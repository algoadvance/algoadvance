[Leetcode 2050. Parallel Courses III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2050)
## Problem Statement

Given the number of courses `n` and an array `relations` where `relations[i] = [prevCourse, nextCourse]` represents that to take course `nextCourse`, you have to take course `prevCourse` first. Also, you are given an integer array `time` where `time[i]` represents the number of months it takes to complete the ith course. The task is to find the minimum number of months required to complete all the courses if you can take any number of courses at the same time as long as the prerequisites are met.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n`, `relations`, and `time`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
   - `0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 10^5)`
   - `relations[i].length == 2`
   - `1 <= prevCourse, nextCourse <= n`
   - `All the pairs [prevCourse, nextCourse] are unique`
   - `1 <= time[i] <= 10^3`

2. **Is the input `relations` guaranteed to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG)?**
   - Yes, the input forms a DAG.

3. **Are there any courses with no prerequisites?**
   - Yes, some courses might not have any prerequisites and can be started immediately.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum number of months required to complete all courses using the following steps:

1. **Topological Sorting:** Use topological sorting to process courses in a valid order where all prerequisites of a course are processed before the course itself.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming:** Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` signifies the minimum time to complete course `i`. Initialize `dp[i]` with the time to complete course `i`.

3. **Traversal and Update:** For each course processed, update the DP values of its dependent courses by considering the maximum time to ensure all prerequisites are completed before starting the course.

4. **Result Calculation:** The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array since that represents when the last course is completed.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& relations, vector<int>& time) {
        vector<int> inDegree(n, 0);
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);

        // Build graph and compute in-degrees
        for (const auto& relation : relations) {
            int prevCourse = relation[0] - 1;
            int nextCourse = relation[1] - 1;
            graph[prevCourse].push_back(nextCourse);
            inDegree[nextCourse]++;
        }

        // Topological sorting using Kahn's Algorithm
        queue<int> q;
        vector<int> dp(n, 0);

        // Initialize the queue with courses that have no prerequisites
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
                dp[i] = time[i];
            }
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int course = q.front(); q.pop();
            for (int nextCourse : graph[course]) {
                // Calculate the time to start the next course
                dp[nextCourse] = max(dp[nextCourse], dp[course] + time[nextCourse]);
                // Decrease the in-degree, if it becomes 0, add it to the queue
                if (--inDegree[nextCourse] == 0) {
                    q.push(nextCourse);
                }
            }
        }

        // The result is the maximum time taken to complete any course
        return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** O(m), where `m` is the number of relations. (Building the adjacency list and calculating in-degrees)
- **Topological Sorting:** O(n + m), where `n` is the number of courses and `m` is the number of relations. (Kahn's algorithm involves processing each course and each edge once)
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n + m)
  
The approach is efficient given the constraints and ensures that the dependencies are honored while computing the minimum time necessary to complete all courses.
