[Leetcode 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1315)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent. A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists. If there are no such nodes, return 0. Note that a node will not have a grandparent if it is a root or a child of the root.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Clarification**:
   - What is the structure of the input? Is it a standard binary tree structure where each node has a left and right child?
   - Can the binary tree contain negative values?

2. **Output Clarification**:
   - Should I return the sum as an integer?

3. **Example Clarifications**:
   - Can you provide an example to clarify the understanding of nodes with even-valued grandparents?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) traversal to visit each node in the binary tree. We will keep track of the parent and grandparent nodes as we traverse. If the grandparent node exists and is an even-valued node, we add the value of the current node to the cumulative sum.

Here's the plan:

1. Traverse the binary tree using DFS (recursive approach).
2. Pass down the current node's value as the parent for the next nodes and the current parent as the grandparent.
3. If the grandparent's value is even and exists, add the current node's value to the sum.
4. Continue this for all nodes and return the final sum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

// Define the structure of a tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int sum = 0;

    // Helper function to perform DFS traversal and calculate the sum.
    void dfs(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* parent, TreeNode* grandparent) {
        if (!node) return;  // Base condition: if the node is null, return.
        
        // If there is a grandparent and its value is even, add the current node's value to the sum.
        if (grandparent && grandparent->val % 2 == 0) {
            sum += node->val;
        }
        
        // Recursively call the left and right children, pushing the current node as the parent
        // and the current parent as the grandparent.
        dfs(node->left, node, parent);
        dfs(node->right, node, parent);
    }
    
    int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root, nullptr, nullptr);  // Initialize DFS with root node and null parent and grandparent.
        return sum;
    }
};

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    // Example tree:
    //        6
    //     /    \
    //    7      8
    //   / \    / \
    //  2   7  1   3
    // /   / \
    //9   1   4

    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->left->right->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(4);

    Solution solution;
    int result = solution.sumEvenGrandparent(root);
    std::cout << "Sum of nodes with even-valued grandparent: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We traverse each node exactly once. The space complexity is \(O(h)\) which is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the height could be \(O(n)\). However, in a balanced tree, it would be \(O(\log n)\).
