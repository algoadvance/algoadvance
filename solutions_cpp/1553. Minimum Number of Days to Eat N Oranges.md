[Leetcode 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1553)
## Problem Statement

You need to determine the minimum number of days required to eat `n` oranges. You can only eat oranges according to the following rules:
1. If `n` is divisible by 3, you can eat `2 * (n / 3)` oranges.
2. If `n` is divisible by 2, you can eat `n / 2` oranges.
3. You can always eat one orange on any given day.

The goal is to find the minimum number of days to reach 0 oranges.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `n` values always non-negative integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **Will `n` be provided within a specific range?**
   - Typically, `n` will be a positive integer, but we'll need to handle edge cases where `n = 0`.

## Strategy

To determine the minimum number of days needed to eat `n` oranges, we can use dynamic programming (DP) or memoization with a depth-first search (DFS). Given the rules, the state space can be reduced significantly by reusing results of previous calculations. Let's use memoization to avoid recalculating results for the same number of oranges multiple times.

### Steps:
1. **Memoization Table:** Use a hash map (or an unordered map in C++) to store the minimum days required to eat `i` oranges.
2. **Recursive Function:** Define a recursive function that uses memoization to find the minimum days for the given `n`.
3. **Base Case:** If `n` is 0, return 0 days since no oranges need to be eaten.
4. **Recursive Case:** Use the rules to recursively call the function:
   - If `n` is divisible by 3, consider the minimum days of `n // 3`.
   - If `n` is divisible by 2, consider the minimum days of `n // 2`.
   - Always consider the case where you eat one orange.

### State Transition:
- `dp(n) = min(1 + dp(n-1), 1 + dp(n // 2) if n % 2 == 0 else float('inf'), 1 + dp(n // 3) if n % 3 == 0 else float('inf'))`

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int, int> memo;
    
    int minDays(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n <= 1) return n;
        
        // If result is already in the memo table
        if (memo.find(n) != memo.end()) return memo[n];
        
        // Recursive case
        int stepsToOne = 1 + (n % 2) + minDays(n / 2);
        int stepsToTwo = 1 + (n % 3) + minDays(n / 3);
        
        int result = min(stepsToOne, stepsToTwo);
        
        // Save the result in the memo table
        memo[n] = result;
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- Each state may only be computed once and stored in the memoization table.
- Given that halving or dividing by 3 narrows down the problem size significantly (similar to logarithmic reductions), the approximate time complexity is `O(log n)` due to the nature of the reductions.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is primarily `O(log n)` for the recursion stack and storage in the memoization table.

This implementation optimizes the process of solving the problem by balancing the computation through memoization, thereby efficiently reducing redundant calculations.
