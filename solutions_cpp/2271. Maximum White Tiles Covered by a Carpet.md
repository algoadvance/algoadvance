[Leetcode 2271. Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2271)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `tiles` where `tiles[i] = [li, ri]` represents that every tile from `li` to `ri` (inclusive) is white. You are also given an integer `carpetLen` which represents the length of a carpet that can cover the tiles. Return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
   - What is the range of `tiles` array and values within `tiles`?
   - What is the range of `carpetLen`?

2. **Tile Overlap**: 
   - Can the ranges in `tiles` overlap?
   
3. **Order of Tiles**:
   - Can we assume tiles are unsorted, and we should sort them as part of our approach?

These points would help in understanding the nature of the input and any constraints which might affect the solution approach.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**:
   - Start by sorting the `tiles` array based on the start position of each tile. This helps in efficiently checking which tiles can be covered by a given carpet's starting position.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Use a sliding window technique to keep track of the total number of white tiles covered by the carpet when it starts at different positions.
   - Maintain two pointers: `start` and `end` to represent the current window of consideration.
   - Calculate the currently covered tiles and update the maximum covered tiles after each iteration.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maximumWhiteTiles(vector<vector<int>>& tiles, int carpetLen) {
    // Sort the tiles based on the starting positions
    sort(tiles.begin(), tiles.end());
    
    int n = tiles.size();
    int maxCovered = 0;
    int covered = 0;
    int j = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Move the end of the window to cover the maximum number of tiles with the given carpet length
        while (j < n && tiles[j][1] - tiles[i][0] + 1 <= carpetLen) {
            covered += tiles[j][1] - tiles[j][0] + 1;
            ++j;
        }
        
        // Calculate the coverage when the carpet partially covers some tile
        if (j < n) {
            maxCovered = max(maxCovered, covered + max(0, carpetLen - (tiles[j][0] - tiles[i][0])));
        } else {
            maxCovered = max(maxCovered, covered);
        }
        
        // Slide the window forward:
        // Deduct the tiles[i][0] to tiles[i][1] length from covered length
        covered -= tiles[i][1] - tiles[i][0] + 1;
    }
    
    return maxCovered;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of tiles.
- **Sliding Window**: The double traversal of the `tiles` array using two pointers takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, making the approach efficient given the potential size of `tiles`.
