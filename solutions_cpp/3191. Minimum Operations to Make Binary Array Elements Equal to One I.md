[Leetcode 3191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3191)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a binary array nums (array elements are either 0 or 1). You have to perform operations to make all elements 1 in the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can:
- Choose any index `i` (0 â‰¤ i < nums.length) and set `nums[i]` to 1.

Find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the binary array equal to one.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Size**: What is the length of the binary array? (This may affect the approach we take.)
2. **Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints on the input array we need to consider, such as the maximum length of the array?
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What if the array is already all 1s?
    - What if the array consists entirely of 0s?

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, the strategy is straightforward:
1. Count the number of 0s in the binary array.
2. The minimum number of operations required to set all elements to 1 will be equal to the number of 0s in the array since each zero will need to be converted to one.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)**: Where N is the number of elements in the binary array. This is because we will need to iterate through the array once to count the number of zeros.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minOperationsToMakeAllElementsOne(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int countZeros = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the array to count the number of 0s
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 0) {
            countZeros++;
        }
    }
    
    // The minimum operations needed to make all elements 1
    return countZeros;
}

int main() {
    // Example cases
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {0, 1, 0, 1, 0}; // Expected output: 3
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {1, 1, 1, 1};    // Expected output: 0
    std::vector<int> nums3 = {0, 0, 0, 0};    // Expected output: 4

    std::cout << "Minimum operations for nums1: " << minOperationsToMakeAllElementsOne(nums1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Minimum operations for nums2: " << minOperationsToMakeAllElementsOne(nums2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Minimum operations for nums3: " << minOperationsToMakeAllElementsOne(nums3) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code will output the minimum number of operations for the given example cases. The approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(N). This ensures that it works well even for larger input sizes.
