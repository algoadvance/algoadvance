[Leetcode 2831. Find the Longest Equal Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2831)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest equal subarray. An equal subarray is a subarray where all of its elements are the same.

You can remove at most `k` elements from the array.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem and its constraints, let's go through some potential questions:

1. **What is the value range for `n` (size of the array) and `k`?**
   - This helps in understanding the efficiency requirements.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums` themselves?**
   - Knowing the possible value range for numbers can assist in optimization strategies.
   
3. **Is the subarray required to be contiguous?**
   - While the problem implicitly suggests it by saying "subarray," confirming this ensures we don't overcomplicate the approach.

For the sake of this solution, let's assume `n` is reasonably large (up to \( 10^5 \)), and the integer values in the array can be any integer within the typical integer limits in C++.

### Strategy

To find the longest equal subarray while allowing up to `k` deletions, we can follow this two-pointer (sliding window) approach with the help of a hash map to count occurrences of elements.

Hereâ€™s the detailed strategy:

1. **Use a Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Maintain a window `[start, end]` and try to keep the most frequent element in the window dominating.
   
2. **Track Element Frequencies:**
   - Use a map (or unordered_map) to count frequencies of elements within the window.
   
3. **Adjust Window When Necessary:**
   - For each increment of the `end` pointer, if the difference between the window size and the count of the most frequent element is more than `k`, increment the `start` pointer to shrink the window.

4. **Update Maximum Length:**
   - As you traverse, keep updating the length of the longest subarray satisfying the constraints.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int longestEqualSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    int start = 0, maxLength = 0, maxFreq = 0;
    
    for (int end = 0; end < nums.size(); ++end) {
        freq[nums[end]]++;
        maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freq[nums[end]]);
        
        while (end - start + 1 - maxFreq > k) {
            freq[nums[start]]--;
            start++;
        }
        
        maxLength = max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1};
    int k = 2;
    cout << "The longest equal subarray is of length: " << longestEqualSubarray(nums, k) << endl;
  
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - Each element is processed at most twice (once by `end` pointer and at most once by `start` pointer).

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - The space used by the `unordered_map` to store frequencies can be up to \(O(n)\) in the worst case where all elements are unique.

This solution should efficiently handle large inputs given the constraints.
