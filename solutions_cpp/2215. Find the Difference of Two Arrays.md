[Leetcode 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2215)
### Problem Statement
Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list `answer` of size `2` where:

- `answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.

**Each integer in `answer[0]` and `answer[1]` must be unique** and you may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the output lists contain only unique integers?
    - Yes, all integers in the output lists should be distinct.
2. Can the input arrays contain duplicates?
    - Yes, the input arrays can contain duplicates, but the output lists should only contain unique integers.
3. Is the order of elements in the output important?
    - No, you can return the lists in any order.

### Strategy
1. Use sets to keep track of the unique elements from both `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Traverse through `nums1` and add each distinct element to a set.
3. Traverse through `nums2` and add each distinct element to a different set.
4. Compute the difference between the two sets:
    - Elements in `nums1` not in `nums2`
    - Elements in `nums2` not in `nums1`
5. Convert these sets to lists and return them.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> findDifference(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    // Create sets to store unique elements of both arrays
    std::unordered_set<int> set1(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    std::unordered_set<int> set2(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());

    // Initialize the result vectors
    std::vector<int> res1, res2;
    
    // Find unique elements in nums1 not in nums2
    for (int num : set1) {
        if (set2.find(num) == set2.end()) {
            res1.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Find unique elements in nums2 not in nums1
    for (int num : set2) {
        if (set1.find(num) == set1.end()) {
            res2.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    return {res1, res2};
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m)
  - Where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`.
  - Constructing the sets takes O(n) for `set1` and O(m) for `set2`.
  - The loops that compute the difference also run in O(n) and O(m) respectively.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m)
  - Each set can potentially store all elements from the input arrays.
