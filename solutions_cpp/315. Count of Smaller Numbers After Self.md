[Leetcode 315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l315)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and you have to return a new counts array. The counts array has the property where `counts[i]` is the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input range**: What is the range of values for elements in the array, and what is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
   - **Answer**: Typically, LeetCode constraints for similar problems have the array length up to 10,000 and element values between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

2. **Output**: Should the counts array have the same length as the input array `nums`?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the counts array should be of the same length as `nums`.

### Strategy
The primary challenge is achieving an efficient solution given the potential input size. A naive \(O(n^2)\) solution would compare every number with every number to its right. This is inefficient for large arrays.

Here, we can use a more efficient solution leveraging Binary Indexed Trees (BIT) or Segment Trees. Another efficient approach involves using modified merge sort:

1. **Merge Sort Insight**: By modifying merge sort to count the smaller elements to the right during the merge step, we can achieve the desired counts efficiently.
2. **Inversion Count Idea**: When we merge, every time we place an element from the right subarray before an element from the left subarray, it means an inversion (smaller element on right) has taken place for the elements in the left subarray.

### Code
Here is how you can implement the solution using a modified merge sort:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

void mergeAndCount(vector<pair<int, int>>& arr, int left, int mid, int right, vector<int>& result) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> temp(right - left + 1);
    int i = left;      // Starting index for left subarray
    int j = mid + 1;   // Starting index for right subarray
    int k = 0;         // Starting index to be sorted in temp
    int count = 0;     // Number of elements from right subarray less than element from left subarray

    while (i <= mid && j <= right) {
        if (arr[i].first <= arr[j].first) {
            result[arr[i].second] += count;
            temp[k++] = arr[i++];
        } else {
            count++;
            temp[k++] = arr[j++];
        }
    }

    while (i <= mid) {
        result[arr[i].second] += count;
        temp[k++] = arr[i++];
    }

    while (j <= right) {
        temp[k++] = arr[j++];
    }

    for (int l = left; l <= right; l++) {
        arr[l] = temp[l - left];
    }
}

void mergeSortAndCount(vector<pair<int, int>>& arr, int left, int right, vector<int>& result) {
    if (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        mergeSortAndCount(arr, left, mid, result);
        mergeSortAndCount(arr, mid + 1, right, result);

        mergeAndCount(arr, left, mid, right, result);
    }
}

vector<int> countSmaller(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> result(n, 0);
    vector<pair<int, int>> arr(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = {nums[i], i};
    }

    mergeSortAndCount(arr, 0, n - 1, result);

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Merge Sort Complexity**: The complexity of the mergesort algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\). This is because each level of recursion involves a \(O(n)\) merge operation and there are \(O(\log n)\) levels of recursion.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the above algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\), making it suitable for large inputs up to 10,000 elements.
