[Leetcode 233. Number of Digit One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l233)
## Problem Statement

The problem "233. Number of Digit One" on LeetCode requires us to count the number of times the digit '1' appears in the decimal representation of all numbers from 1 to n.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of n? (Typically it's safe to assume large range, up to 2^31 - 1, for a complete solution)
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Are there any constraints on the performance or the specific format of the output?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Should the solution handle cases where n=0 and n=1?

### Example

Input: `n = 13`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: The numbers from 1 to 13 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The digit '1' appears 6 times.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, a direct approach that iterates through every number from 1 to n and counts the occurrences of '1' in each number would be efficient but might not be optimal for very large n due to time complexity.

We aim for a more mathematical approach to count the occurrences of the digit '1' in each position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). 

### Steps:
1. We can use `digit place` analysis to count '1's in each decimal place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).
2. For each digit place, count how many times '1' can appear in that place across all numbers from 1 to n.
3. Sum these counts to get the total.

### Mathematical Insight:
For a number n = 314, the digit contribution can be broken down into parts where:
   - Units place impacts every 10 numbers.
   - Tens place impacts every 100 numbers.
   - Hundreds place impacts every 1000 numbers.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int countDigitOne(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;

    long count = 0;
    for (long digitPlace = 1; digitPlace <= n; digitPlace *= 10) {
        long higherDigits = n / (digitPlace * 10);
        long currentDigit = (n / digitPlace) % 10;
        long lowerDigits = n % digitPlace;

        // Counting '1's in the current digit place
        if (currentDigit > 1) {
            count += (higherDigits + 1) * digitPlace;
        } else if (currentDigit == 1) {
            count += higherDigits * digitPlace + (lowerDigits + 1);
        } else if (currentDigit == 0) {
            count += higherDigits * digitPlace;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n = 13;
    std::cout << countDigitOne(n) << std::endl; // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above implementation is O(log10(n)) because we are iterating through each digit place. Because each multiplication (to move to the next digit place) is logarithmic with respect to the base 10, it guarantees efficiency even for large values of n up to 2^31-1.
