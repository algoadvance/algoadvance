[Leetcode 2232. Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses to Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2232)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** string `expression` of the form `num1 + num2` where `num1` and `num2` represent positive integers. 

You have to add a single pair of parentheses to `expression` such that after the addition of parentheses, `expression` evaluates to a minimum value. The result should be returned as a string such that the resulting expression is also well-formed.

## Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: expression = "247+38"
Output: "2(47+38)"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: expression = "12+34"
Output: "1(2+3)4"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that the input will always be in the form `num1+num2`?
   - Yes, the input will always be in the specified form.
   
2. Can `num1` or `num2` be single-digit numbers?
   - Yes, both `num1` and `num2` can be single-digit or multi-digit numbers.

3. Are there leading zeros in `num1` or `num2`?
   - No, `num1` and `num2` are positive integers with no leading zeros.

4. What should we return if there are multiple ways to achieve the minimum value?
   - If there are multiple ways to achieve the minimum value, return any one of the correct expressions.

## Strategy

1. **Split the Expression**: Identify the position of the `+` sign to split `expression` into `num1` and `num2`.
2. **Try All Parenthesis Positions**: Iterate through all possible positions where a pair of parentheses can be inserted to minimize the result. This includes inserting left parenthesis `(` before any digit in `num1` and the right parenthesis `)` after any digit in `num2`.
3. **Evaluate Each Configuration**: For each possible parenthesis placement, evaluate the resulting mathematical expression to determine the minimum value.
4. **Track the Minimum**: Keep track of the smallest value encountered and its corresponding parenthesized expression.
5. **Return the Result**: Construct and return the valid expression that yields the minimum value.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

std::string minimizeResult(std::string expression) {
    int plusPos = expression.find('+');
    std::string num1 = expression.substr(0, plusPos);
    std::string num2 = expression.substr(plusPos + 1);

    int minValue = INT_MAX;
    std::string result;

    for (int i = 0; i < num1.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < num2.size(); ++j) {
            std::string leftPart = (i == 0) ? "1" : num1.substr(0, i);
            std::string middlePart1 = num1.substr(i);
            std::string middlePart2 = num2.substr(0, j + 1);
            std::string rightPart = (j == num2.size() - 1) ? "1" : num2.substr(j + 1);

            int left = std::stoi(leftPart);
            int middle1 = std::stoi(middlePart1);
            int middle2 = std::stoi(middlePart2);
            int right = std::stoi(rightPart);

            int currentValue = left * (middle1 + middle2) * right;
            if (currentValue < minValue) {
                minValue = currentValue;
                result = leftPart + "(" + middlePart1 + "+" + middlePart2 + ")" + rightPart;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string expression = "247+38";
    std::cout << minimizeResult(expression) << std::endl; // Output should be: "2(47+38)"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `num1` and \(m\) is the length of `num2` since we are iterating over every possible place to insert parentheses within the bounds of the two substrings `num1` and `num2`. For each pair of positions, a simple arithmetic calculation is performed.
