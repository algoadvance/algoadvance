[Leetcode 2856. Minimum Array Length After Pair Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2856)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers. In each operation, you can remove two (not necessarily adjacent) elements from the array whose values are equal. The task is to return the minimum length of the array that can be obtained after some number of such operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values of the elements?**
   - This typically would be within the common constraints for array problems, but specific constraints should be checked in the platform.

2. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - Assuming no, because the problem seems to imply that there are elements in the array to be paired.

3. **Is the array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

### Code

Here is a C++ solution to determine the minimum length of the array after removing pairs:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int minLengthAfterRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    
    // Count the frequencies of each element
    for (int num : nums) {
        freq[num]++;
    }
    
    // Find the maximum frequency
    int maxFreq = 0;
    for (const auto& [key, value] : freq) {
        maxFreq = max(maxFreq, value);
    }
    
    int n = nums.size();
    
    // If the most frequent element frequency times 2 is greater than array size, 
    // it determines how many elements will remain since pairing the most frequent element leaves behind these scenarios.
    // Otherwise, the number of remaining elements is determined by the parity of the array size.
    if (maxFreq * 2 > n) {
        return maxFreq * 2 - n;
    } else {
        return n % 2;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1}; // Example input
    cout << "Minimum array length after pair removals: " << minLengthAfterRemovals(nums) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

- **Frequency Counting:** Count the frequency of each element in the array.
- **Max Frequency Check:** Determine the maximum frequency of any element.
- **Conditions for Remaining Length:**
  - If the frequency of the most occurring element * 2 is greater than the size of the array, this excess determines the number of unpairable elements.
  - If not, the remaining length depends on whether the total number of elements is odd or even. An even-length array can be fully paired while an odd-length leaves one unpairable element.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because:
- Counting frequencies involves a single pass through the array: \(O(n)\).
- Finding the maximum frequency involves iterating through the frequency map: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique elements, which is at most \(n\) in the worst case. However, since \(k \leq n\), overall complexity remains \(O(n)\).

This ensures the solution is efficient even for large inputs.
