[Leetcode 1125. Smallest Sufficient Team](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1125)
## Problem Statement

You are trying to form a sufficient team from a given pool of people, where each person has a certain set of skills. The goal is to find the smallest sufficient team such that for every required skill, there is at least one person in this team that possesses it.

Given:

1. A list of required skills.
2. A list of people represented by their respective skill sets.

You need to output the indices of the people in the smallest sufficient team.

### Example

**Input**:
- `req_skills = ["java", "nodejs", "reactjs"]`
- `people = [["java"],["nodejs"],["nodejs","reactjs"]]`

**Output**:
- `[0, 2]`

### Constraints
- The number of people is `n` and `1 <= n <= 60`.
- The number of required skills is `m` and `1 <= m <= 16`.
- Each skill in `req_skills` is a unique string.
- Each `people[i]` is a list of strings representing the skill set of individual `i` which may contain the required skills.
  
## Clarifying Questions
- Can a person have multiple skills?
  - Yes, an individual can have multiple skills.
- Is it necessary for each person's skills to be a subset of the `req_skills`?
  - No, individuals may have additional skills not in `req_skills`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming with bit manipulation.

1. **Bitmasking**: Use a bitmask to represent a combination of skills, where each bit position corresponds to whether a specific skill is possessed by the team.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a DP table to store the smallest team for each possible combination of required skills.

### Steps:

1. **Mapping skills to indices**: Convert `req_skills` to indices for easy manipulation with bitmasks.
2. **DP Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0]` as an empty list indicating no skills require no team members.
3. **Populate DP Table**: Iterate over each person and update the DP table for each possible combination of already formed skills.

The state of each skill set is represented by a bitmask of length equal to the number of required skills. For example, if `req_skills = ['java', 'nodejs', 'reactjs']`, and a team has members who know "java" and "reactjs", then the bitmask for the skills they collectively have would look like `101` in binary (5 in decimal).

## Time Complexity
The algorithm's time complexity is bounded by the number of people and possible skill combinations. The DP update involves iterating over all possible skill combinations, making the time complexity O(n * 2^m) where n is the number of people and m is the number of required skills.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> smallestSufficientTeam(vector<string>& req_skills, vector<vector<string>>& people) {
        int n = req_skills.size();
        int m = people.size();
        
        // Map skill to its index
        unordered_map<string, int> skill_index;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            skill_index[req_skills[i]] = i;
        }
        
        // Convert people skills to bitmask representation
        vector<int> people_skills(m, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (const string& skill : people[i]) {
                if (skill_index.find(skill) != skill_index.end()) {
                    people_skills[i] |= (1 << skill_index[skill]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Dynamic Programming table
        vector<vector<int>> dp(1 << n, vector<int>());
        dp[0] = {};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int person_skill = people_skills[i];
            // Iterate backwards through all the states to prevent premature updates 
            for (int state = (1 << n) - 1; state >= 0; state--) {
                if (!dp[state].empty() || state == 0) {
                    int new_state = state | person_skill;
                    // If this new state is better (smaller team), we take it
                    if (dp[new_state].empty() || dp[new_state].size() > dp[state].size() + 1) {
                        dp[new_state] = dp[state];
                        dp[new_state].push_back(i);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<string> req_skills = {"java", "nodejs", "reactjs"};
    vector<vector<string>> people = \{\{"java"}, {"nodejs"}, {"nodejs", "reactjs"}};
    vector<int> result = sol.smallestSufficientTeam(req_skills, people);
    for (int i : result) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This solution uses bitwise operations to efficiently combine and evaluate possible skill sets, ensuring that the team size remains minimal and all required skills are covered.
