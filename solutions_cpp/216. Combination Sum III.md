### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 216: Combination Sum III

**Description:**  
Find all possible combinations of `k` numbers that add up to a number `n`, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

You should return all possible combinations in any order.

### Example:
```
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]

Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of elements in the combination (k) should be `1 <= k <= 9`.
- The target sum (n) should be `1 <= n <= 60`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can numbers repeat in the combinations?
   **A**: No, each number from 1 to 9 can be used only once in each combination.
   
2. **Q**: Is there a need to sort the combinations?
   **A**: No, the output can be any order as stated in the problem description.

3. **Q**: What if no combinations are possible?
   **A**: Should return an empty list in that scenario.

### Strategy
We will use backtracking to explore all possible combinations of numbers. The algorithm will proceed as follows:
1. Start with an empty combination and a starting number (1 to 9).
2. Recursively add numbers to the combination until the length `k` is reached.
3. If the current combination sums to `n`, add it to the result list.
4. If the sum exceeds `n` or the length exceeds `k`, backtrack.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible combinations and backtrack whenever the current sum exceeds the target or the length exceeds `k`.

### Code
Here's a C++ implementation for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum3(int k, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> combination;
        backtrack(result, combination, k, n, 1);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void backtrack(vector<vector<int>>& result, vector<int>& combination, int k, int target, int start) {
        if (combination.size() == k) {
            if (target == 0) {
                result.push_back(combination);
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i <= 9; ++i) {
            combination.push_back(i);
            backtrack(result, combination, k, target - i, i + 1);
            combination.pop_back(); // backtrack
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is derived from the nature of the backtracking algorithm:
- We have at most 9 possible choices (digits from 1 to 9).
- We need to explore all possible combinations of these digits up to length `k`.

In the worst case, the number of combinations explored is `C(9, k) = 9! / ((9 - k)! * k!)`, which is combinatorial in nature. Thus, for `k <= 9`, the time complexity can be considered exponential, or `O(2^N)` where `N = 9`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity mainly involves the space utilized by the recursion call stack and the temporary list to hold combinations, both of which can reach up to `O(k)` in depth and size respectively. Additionally, the result list stores all valid combinations. Thus, the overall space complexity can be considered `O(N^k)`, again combinatorial in nature.
