[Leetcode 1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1775)
### Problem Statement:

You are given two arrays of integers, `nums1` and `nums2`, which represent the number of dice rolls and their outcomes. The goal is to make the sums of the two arrays equal by changing the values of some elements (each die roll) in either array. You can change each die roll (an element of an array) to any integer between 1 and 6, inclusive. You ought to return the minimum number of operations required to make the sums of the two arrays equal. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What are the sizes of the arrays?
    - The sizes of the arrays can be different.
2. What's the range of values in the arrays?
    - The values are between 1 and 6, representing dice roll outcomes.
3. Can we assume that the input arrays are non-empty?
    - Yes, both arrays are non-empty.

### Strategy:

1. **Calculate the sums** of `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. If the sums are already equal, return 0 since no operations are needed.
3. **Find the difference** between the sums of the two arrays.
4. To minimize the number of operations:
   - **Focus on the maximum possible change** per operation. Changing a `1` to a `6` gives the maximum increment of `5`, and changing a `6` to a `1` gives the maximum decrement of `5`.
5. Create a max-heap (priority queue) to always access the highest potential single-operation change:
   - For `nums1`, consider the change as `6 - nums1[i]`.
   - For `nums2`, consider the change as `nums2[i] - 1`.
6. **Perform operations** from the max-heap until the difference is zero or negative.
7. If the heap is exhausted and you still haven't zeroed the difference, return -1 as it's impossible to balance the sums.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <functional>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    int sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums1) sum1 += num;
    for (int num : nums2) sum2 += num;
    
    if (sum1 == sum2) return 0;

    if (sum1 < sum2) {
        std::swap(nums1, nums2);
        std::swap(sum1, sum2);
    }

    int diff = sum1 - sum2;
    std::priority_queue<int> maxHeap;

    for (int num : nums1) maxHeap.push(num - 1);
    for (int num : nums2) maxHeap.push(6 - num);

    int operations = 0;
    while (!maxHeap.empty() && diff > 0) {
        diff -= maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        operations++;
    }
    
    return diff > 0 ? -1 : operations;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization**: Calculating sums of `nums1` and `nums2` takes O(n + m) time, where n and m are the sizes of the `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
- **Heap Operations**: Inserting all elements into the max-heap takes O((n + m) log(n + m)).
- **While Loop**: Each heap operation takes O(log(n + m)), and in the worst case, it will take O(n + m) operations to balance the arrays.

Overall, the time complexity is O((n + m) log(n + m)).
