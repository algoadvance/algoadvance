[Leetcode 2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2058)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list `head`. A node in the linked list is named a **critical point** if it meets one of the following conditions:
- It is a local maxima (i.e., the value of this node is greater than the values of its previous and next nodes).
- It is a local minima (i.e., the value of this node is smaller than the values of its previous and next nodes).

Note that a node can only be a local maxima or minima if there exists both a previous and a next node.

Return an array of length 2 containing the following:
- The minimum distance between any two distinct critical points.
- The maximum distance between any two distinct critical points.

If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the linked list have duplicate values?
   **A**: Yes, the linked list can have duplicate values.

2. **Q**: What should be returned if there are fewer than two critical points?
   **A**: Return `[-1, -1]`.

3. **Q**: Is the input list guaranteed to have at least one node?
   **A**: Yes, the input list has at least one node.

### Strategy

1. Start traversing the linked list from the head.
2. Identify the critical points by comparing the current node with its previous and next nodes.
3. Keep track of the positions (indices) where the critical points are found.
4. Calculate the minimum and maximum distances between the critical points.
5. If fewer than two critical points are found, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next || !head->next->next) {
            return {-1, -1};
        }
        
        std::vector<int> criticalPoints;
        ListNode* prev = head;
        ListNode* curr = head->next;
        ListNode* next = curr->next;

        int index = 1;  // because curr is at index 1
        
        while (next) {
            if ((curr->val > prev->val && curr->val > next->val) ||
                (curr->val < prev->val && curr->val < next->val)) {
                criticalPoints.push_back(index);
            }
            
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
            next = next->next;
            index++;
        }
        
        if (criticalPoints.size() < 2) {
            return {-1, -1};
        }
        
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 1; i < criticalPoints.size(); ++i) {
            minDiff = std::min(minDiff, criticalPoints[i] - criticalPoints[i - 1]);
        }
        
        int maxDiff = criticalPoints.back() - criticalPoints.front();
        
        return {minDiff, maxDiff};
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once to find critical points and once more to compute distances.
- **Space Complexity**: O(C), where C is the number of critical points, due to storing indices of critical points. However, in the worst case, C is O(N).
