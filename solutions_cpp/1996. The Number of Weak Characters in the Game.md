[Leetcode 1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1996)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each character has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attack_i, defense_i]` represents the properties of the `i`-th character in the game.

A character is considered "weak" if there exists another character who has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than them. 

Your task is to count the number of weak characters in the game and return that count.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input:** 
   - What are the possible ranges for the number of characters, and the attack and defense values?
     - Typically, constraints are provided in the problem. Let's assume `1 <= properties.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= attack_i, defense_i <= 10^5`.

2. **Examples:**
    - Could you provide some example input and expected output?
        - Sure!
          - Input: `[[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]`
          - Output: `0`
          - Explanation: No character is weaker than another character.
          - Input: `[[2,2],[3,3]]`
          - Output: `1`
          - Explanation: The first character is weaker than the second.
          
### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compare characters based on their properties. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the characters by their attack values in ascending order. If two characters have the same attack value, then sort them by their defense values in descending order.
   - Why descending order for defense when attack values are the same? Because, when we loop from the back of the sorted list, for characters with the same attack, it will guarantee that we are comparing with the one having the higher defense first, which simplifies the comparison.

2. **Comparing**:
   - Loop through the sorted list from the back to the front. Keep track of the maximum defense value encountered so far.
   - If the defense value of the current character is less than the maximum seen so far, it means this character is weak.
   - Else, update the maximum defense value.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWeakCharacters(vector<vector<int>>& properties) {
        // Step 1: Sort the properties.
        sort(properties.begin(), properties.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[0] == b[0])
                return a[1] > b[1]; // Sort by defense in descending order if attack values are the same.
            return a[0] < b[0]; // Otherwise, sort by attack in ascending order.
        });
        
        int maxDefense = INT_MIN;
        int weakCharacters = 0;
        
        // Step 2: Traverse sorted characters from the back.
        for (int i = properties.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (properties[i][1] < maxDefense) {
                ++weakCharacters;
            } else {
                maxDefense = properties[i][1];
            }
        }
        
        return weakCharacters;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    
    vector<vector<int>> properties1 = \{\{5, 5}, {6, 3}, {3, 6}};
    cout << sol.numberOfWeakCharacters(properties1) << endl; // Output: 0
    
    vector<vector<int>> properties2 = \{\{2, 2}, {3, 3}};
    cout << sol.numberOfWeakCharacters(properties2) << endl; // Output: 1
    
    vector<vector<int>> properties3 = \{\{1, 5}, {10, 4}, {4, 3}};
    cout << sol.numberOfWeakCharacters(properties3) << endl; // Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity of this solution:

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of characters.
- **Looping through characters**: This step takes \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). The space complexity is \(O(1)\) if we exclude the input storage.
