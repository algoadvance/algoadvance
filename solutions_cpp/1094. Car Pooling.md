[Leetcode 1094. Car Pooling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1094)
### Problem Statement
You are driving a vehicle that has `capacity` empty seats initially available for passengers. The vehicle only drives along a straight road and you cannot drive in the reverse direction.

Given a list of `trips`, where `trip[i] = [numPassengers, from, to]` indicates that `numPassengers` passengers must be picked up at the `from` location and dropped off at the `to` location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips without exceeding the vehicle's capacity at any point in time, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the `from` and `to` locations always non-negative integers?
   - Yes, they are.
2. Can the number of passengers exceed the vehicle capacity in the input itself, or do we only check the cumulative sum of passengers during the entire trip?
   - Only the cumulative sum during the trip should be checked.

### Strategy
1. We will use a difference array to manage the passengers at each specific location.
2. We will simulate the passenger pickup and drop-off process across all the trips using prefix sum technique.

Steps:
1. Create an array to hold the net change of passengers at each location.
2. Iterate over the trips:
    - For each trip, increment the count at the `from` location (passengers picked up).
    - Decrement the count at the `to` location (passengers dropped off).
3. Iterate over the difference array to calculate the number of passengers in the vehicle at any point and verify it does not exceed the capacity.
4. If at any point the capacity is exceeded, return `false`; otherwise, return `true`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of trips and `m` is the range of locations. 
- Space complexity is `O(m)` due to the difference array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool carPooling(vector<vector<int>>& trips, int capacity) {
    // Find the furthest drop-off point
    int maxLocation = 0;
    for (const auto& trip : trips) {
        maxLocation = max(maxLocation, trip[2]);
    }
    
    // Create a difference array to keep track of passenger changes at each point
    vector<int> passengerChange(maxLocation + 1, 0);
    
    for (const auto& trip : trips) {
        int numPassengers = trip[0];
        int from = trip[1];
        int to = trip[2];
        
        passengerChange[from] += numPassengers;
        if (to < maxLocation + 1) {
            passengerChange[to] -= numPassengers;
        }
    }
    
    // Iterate through the difference array and check the passenger capacity
    int currentPassengers = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= maxLocation; i++) {
        currentPassengers += passengerChange[i];
        if (currentPassengers > capacity) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     vector<vector<int>> trips = {{2, 1, 5}, {3, 3, 7}};
//     int capacity = 4;
//     bool result = carPooling(trips, capacity);
//     if(result){
//         cout << "Possible to complete all trips without exceeding capacity." << endl;
//     } else {
//         cout << "Not possible to complete all trips without exceeding capacity." << endl;
//     }
//     return 0;
// }
```

This code provides a solution for the car pooling problem by effectively simulating the passenger pickup and drop-off process. The difference array helps in efficiently updating and querying the number of passengers at each location, ensuring we can check all points without exceeding the vehicle's capacity.
