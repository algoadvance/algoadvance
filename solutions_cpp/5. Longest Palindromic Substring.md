[Leetcode 5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l5)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a palindrome?**  
   A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

2. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input string `s` non-empty?  
     Yes, assume the input string is non-empty.
   - What is the maximum length of the string?  
     The length of the string can be up to `1000` characters.

3. **Output Constraints:**
   - If there are multiple substrings with the same maximum length, can we return any of them?  
     Yes, returning any one of them is acceptable.

## Strategy

### Expanding Around Center

1. **Basic Idea**: 
   - A palindromic string mirrors around its center.
   - We can expand around each character and each pair of consecutive characters to find all palindromes.

2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the start and maximum length of the longest palindrome found.
   - Loop through each character in the string and consider it as the center of a palindrome.
   - Expand around the center for both:
      - Odd length palindromes (single character center).
      - Even length palindromes (pair of characters as center).
   - For each expanded palindrome, check its length and update the start and maximum length variables if it's the longest palindrome found so far.
   - Finally, return the substring starting from the recorded start position with the recorded maximum length.

### Time Complexity
- Expanding around the center will result in examining each character and its neighboring characters.
- For each center, we expand outward to check palindrome properties.
- This results in a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        if (s.empty()) return "";
        
        int start = 0, maxLength = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            // Odd length palindromes
            expandAroundCenter(s, i, i, start, maxLength);
            // Even length palindromes
            expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1, start, maxLength);
        }
        
        return s.substr(start, maxLength);
    }
    
private:
    void expandAroundCenter(const string& s, int L, int R, int& start, int& maxLength) {
        while (L >= 0 && R < s.length() && s[L] == s[R]) {
            --L;
            ++R;
        }
        
        int len = R - L - 1; // Length of the currently found palindrome
        if (len > maxLength) {
            start = L + 1;
            maxLength = len;
        }
    }
};
```

This code defines a class `Solution` that contains a method `longestPalindrome` to find the longest palindromic substring. The helper method `expandAroundCenter` is used to expand around potential centers and update the longest palindrome found during the process.
