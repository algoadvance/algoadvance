[Leetcode 2826. Sorting Three Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2826)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers representing groups. Each integer in the array can only be one of three distinct values: 1, 2, or 3. You need to sort the array in non-decreasing order, but you should only do it by performing a limited number of operations. In each operation, you can pick two adjacent elements and swap them. The goal is to determine the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of the length of the array?
   - Can the array contain any other values besides 1, 2, or 3?

2. **Output Format**:
   - Should the function return the minimum number of swaps or print it?

For this particular problem, we'll assume that the input array will always conform to the constraints mentioned and will only contain the values 1, 2, or 3.

### Strategy

To minimize the number of swaps to sort the array, we can use a variant of the counting sort algorithm. We calculate the number of misplaced elements of each type and plan swaps that place them into their correct positions.

Steps:
1. Count the occurrences of 1, 2, and 3.
2. Determine the segments where each number should ideally be located:
   - The first part of the array should contain all 1’s.
   - The second part should contain all 2’s.
   - The third part should contain all 3’s.
3. Calculate how many elements are misplaced in each of these segments.
4. Use a two-pointer technique to count the minimum swaps needed to position the misplaced elements correctly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int minSwapsToSort(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0, count3 = 0;
    
    // Count the occurrences of 1, 2, and 3
    for(int num : nums) {
        if(num == 1) count1++;
        else if(num == 2) count2++;
        else if(num == 3) count3++;
    }
    
    // Determine the end indices for each number
    int end1 = count1, end2 = count1 + count2, end3 = count1 + count2 + count3;
    
    // Misplacement counters
    int misplaced1 = 0, misplaced2 = 0, misplaced3 = 0;
    
    // Count the misplacements
    for(int i = 0; i < end1; ++i) {
        if(nums[i] != 1) misplaced1++;
    }
    for(int i = end1; i < end2; ++i) {
        if(nums[i] != 2) misplaced2++;
    }
    for(int i = end2; i < end3; ++i) {
        if(nums[i] != 3) misplaced3++;
    }
    
    // Minimum swaps needed
    return max(misplaced1, max(misplaced2, misplaced3));
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2};
    cout << "Minimum number of swaps needed: " << minSwapsToSort(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we process the array linearly to count occurrences and determine misplacements, which provides an efficient solution for reasonably large inputs.
