[Leetcode 1392. Longest Happy Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1392)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. A **happy prefix** is a prefix which is also a suffix (excluding the entire string). Your task is to find the longest happy prefix of the given string `s`. Output the longest happy prefix, or an empty string `""` if no such prefix exists.

### Example
```
Input: s = "level"
Output: "l"

Input: s = "ababab"
Output: "abab"

Input: s = "leetcodeleet"
Output: "leet"

Input: s = "a"
Output: ""
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the string contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, it is usually stated that input strings are lowercase English letters in such problems unless mentioned otherwise.

2. Is there a constraint on the length of the string `s`?
   - Typically, this would be clarified in the problem statement, but we'll assume typical competitive programming constraints, which usually mean `s` can be up to around 10^5 in length.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the concept of the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm. KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to find the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix.

### Steps
1. Implement KMP algorithm's LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array to store lengths.
2. Iterate through the string and maintain the LPS values.
3. The value at the last position of the LPS array indicates the length of the longest happy prefix.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string longestPrefix(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<int> lps(n, 0);  // Longest Prefix Suffix array
    
    // KMP preprocessing
    int length = 0;  // length of the previous longest prefix suffix
    int i = 1;  // starts from the second character
    while (i < n) {
        if (s[i] == s[length]) {
            length++;
            lps[i] = length;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (length != 0) {
                length = lps[length - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The last value in the LPS array gives the length of the longest happy prefix
    return s.substr(0, lps[n - 1]);
}

int main() {
    std::string s;

    // Example cases
    s = "level";
    std::cout << "Input: " << s << ", Output: " << longestPrefix(s) << std::endl;

    s = "ababab";
    std::cout << "Input: " << s << ", Output: " << longestPrefix(s) << std::endl;

    s = "leetcodeleet";
    std::cout << "Input: " << s << ", Output: " << longestPrefix(s) << std::endl;

    s = "a";
    std::cout << "Input: " << s << ", Output: " << longestPrefix(s) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the LPS array computation involves a single pass through the string, and while loop inside is doing linear work due to efficient resets using previously computed values. The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, due to the storage of the LPS array.

This solution is efficient even for large input sizes, making it suitable for competitive programming constraints.
