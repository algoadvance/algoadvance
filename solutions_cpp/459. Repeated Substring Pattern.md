[Leetcode 459. Repeated Substring Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l459)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You need to determine whether the given string `s` can be a result of repeating a substring.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length of string `s`? (Typical interview ensures we handle up to \(10^5\) characters)
    - Are there any specific characters allowed, or any character in ASCII range?

2. **Output:**
    - Should return a boolean value: `true` if the string can be constructed by repeating a substring, otherwise `false`.

## Strategy

1. **Concatenation Method:** If the original string `s` can be constructed by repeating a substring, then repeating this string minus its first and last character should contain `s` exactly once. This involves:
    - Creating a new string `t` by concatenating `s` with itself (e.g., if `s = "abcabc"`, then `t = "abcabcabcabc"`)
    - Removing the first and the last character from `t` (e.g., `t = "bcabcabcabcab"`)
    - Checking if `s` exists in this adjusted `t`.

2. **Prefix-Suffix Array (KMP Algorithm):** Using the prefix-suffix table (LPS array from KMP algorithm) to determine the longest pattern which is both a proper prefix and suffix. If such a pattern exists and divides the length of the string perfectly, `s` can be constructed by repeating that substring.

For brevity, we will implement the first method as it is simpler to code and understand.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool repeatedSubstringPattern(const std::string& s) {
    if (s.empty()) return false;

    std::string t = s + s;
    std::string truncated = t.substr(1, t.size() - 2);

    return truncated.find(s) != std::string::npos;
}

int main() {
    std::string test1 = "abab";
    std::string test2 = "aba";
    std::string test3 = "abcabcabcabc";

    std::cout << std::boolalpha;  // to print `true/false` instead of 1/0
    std::cout << repeatedSubstringPattern(test1) << std::endl;  // Should print true
    std::cout << repeatedSubstringPattern(test2) << std::endl;  // Should print false
    std::cout << repeatedSubstringPattern(test3) << std::endl;  // Should print true

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the `find` operation, which typically runs in \(O(N)\) in average cases, where \(N\) is the length of string `s`. Therefore:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(2N - 2) \approx O(N)\)

This method leverages string manipulation and searching in an efficient manner to determine if the string can be constructed through repetition without complex preprocessing.
