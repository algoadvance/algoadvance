[Leetcode 835. Image Overlap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l835)
## Problem Statement
You are given two binary matrices `A` and `B` of size `N x N`, where `1` represents a pixel and `0` represents an empty space. We can translate one matrix over the other matrix and count the number of overlapping `1`s. Your task is to find the largest possible overlap between translating the images `A` and `B`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the range of values for `N`?
   - Typical constraint is \(1 \leq N \leq 30\).
2. **Boundary Conditions**: How do we handle matrices with all zeros?
   - If both matrices are all zeros, the result should be zero since there would be no overlap.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Translate Matrix**: Try every possible translation of matrix `B` over matrix `A`.
2. **Count Overlaps**: For each translation, count the number of overlapping `1`s.
3. **Identify Maximum Overlap**: Keep track of the maximum overlap encountered.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Padding**: Extend `A` by padding with zeros on all sides to simplify overlap calculation.
2. **Sliding Window**: Slide `B` over `A` and for each position, count the number of overlapping `1`s.
3. **Maximum Overlap Calculation**: Maintain a variable to store the maximum count of overlaps encountered during the sliding process.

## Code
Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int countOverlap(const vector<vector<int>>& A, const vector<vector<int>>& B, int rowOffset, int colOffset) {
    int N = A.size();
    int overlapCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
            int iB = i + rowOffset;
            int jB = j + colOffset;
            if (iB >= 0 && iB < N && jB >= 0 && jB < N && A[i][j] == 1 && B[iB][jB] == 1) {
                overlapCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    return overlapCount;
}

int largestOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
    int N = A.size();
    int maxOverlap = 0;

    for (int rowOffset = -N + 1; rowOffset < N; ++rowOffset) {
        for (int colOffset = -N + 1; colOffset < N; ++colOffset) {
            maxOverlap = max(maxOverlap, max(countOverlap(A, B, rowOffset, colOffset),
                                             countOverlap(B, A, rowOffset, colOffset)));
        }
    }
    
    return maxOverlap;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Counting Overlap**: Each call to `countOverlap` involves iterating through all `N x N` elements. This takes O(N^2) time.
- **Sliding Window**: We slide over a range of \(2N - 1\) for both rows and columns resulting in \( (2N - 1)^2 = 4N^2 - 4N + 1 \), which is approximately O(N^2).
  
Combining both, the total time complexity is `O(N^4)`, which is feasible given the constraint that \( N \leq 30 \).

This approach ensures that we cover all possible translations and find the maximum overlap efficiently within the given constraints.
