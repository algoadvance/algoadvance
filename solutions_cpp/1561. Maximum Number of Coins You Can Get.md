[Leetcode 1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1561)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers representing the number of coins in different piles, you have to pick coins in a particular way to maximize the number of coins you can get.

Here's the rule for picking coins:
1. You have to pick coins in groups of three.
2. From each group of three, out of the three piles you choose, you get the second-largest number of coins.

Return the maximum number of coins you can get.

**Example:**
```
Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose the triplet (2, 4, 8), the second largest is 4.
Choose the triplet (1, 2, 7), the second largest is 2.
The maximum number of coins you can get is 4 + 2 = 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the solution handle cases where the array length isn't a multiple of 3?
    - The problem guarantees that the length of the input list will always be a multiple of 3.

2. Can I assume all numbers in the array are positive integers?
    - Yes, all numbers in the array are positive integers.

## Strategy

To maximize the number of coins you can get, you should:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. Create groups of three starting from the end (since larger numbers yield a higher max sum).
3. From each group of three, pick the second largest coin.
4. Sum the second largest coins from all groups.

Given this strategy, let's implement the solution.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(std::vector<int>& piles) {
        // Sort the piles in non-decreasing order
        std::sort(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        
        int n = piles.size() / 3; // number of groups
        int max_coins = 0;
        
        // Collect the second largest in each group
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            max_coins += piles[piles.size() - 2 * i];
        }
        
        return max_coins;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> piles = {2, 4, 1, 2, 7, 8};
    std::cout << "Max coins: " << sol.maxCoins(piles) << std::endl; // Output should be 9
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The solution involves:

1. Sorting the piles array, which takes \(O(n \log n)\).
2. Summing specific elements iteratively, which takes \(O(n / 3)\) (simplifies to \(O(n)\) since constants are disregarded).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Summary

By sorting the array and strategically selecting the second largest element from each group, we ensure that the total number of coins collected is maximized. The solution has been implemented and should perform efficiently given typical constraints.
