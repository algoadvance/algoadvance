[Leetcode 850. Rectangle Area II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l850)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of axis-aligned rectangles `rectangles`, return the total area covered by the rectangles in the plane. The area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.

The top-left corner of a rectangle is given as `(x1, y1)` and the bottom-right corner as `(x2, y2)`.

**Example:**

```
Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,3,1]]
Output: 5
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of the coordinates?**
   - Yes, the rectangle coordinates are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Can rectangles overlap?**
   - Yes, rectangles can overlap.

3. **What is the maximum number of rectangles?**
   - The number of rectangles can be up to \(200\).

### Strategy

1. **Event Line Sweep Algorithm:**
   - We'll use a line sweep algorithm with events. This involves processing events when the x-coordinate changes.
   
2. **Handling y-intervals:**
   - As the x-coordinate changes, we will maintain active y-intervals using a data structure like a multiset or segment tree to keep track of the vertical line segments currently covered.
   
3. **Sorting Events:**
   - Events will be of two types: starting a rectangle (adding its y-interval) and ending a rectangle (removing its y-interval). These will be processed in order of their x-coordinates.

4. **Adding and Removing Intervals:**
   - At each x-coordinate event, we calculate the total covered y-length from the active y-intervals and multiply by the width between this x-coordinate and the previous one to get the area contribution.

5. **Efficiently Summarizing y-Length:**
   - Use a method to quickly calculate the union of y-intervals which can be achieved using a balanced binary tree or sweep line within the y-intervals.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

struct Event {
    int x, y1, y2, type;
    Event(int x, int y1, int y2, int type) : x(x), y1(y1), y2(y2), type(type) {}
    bool operator < (const Event& e) const {
        return x < e.x;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int rectangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        vector<Event> events;
        for (auto& rect : rectangles) {
            int x1 = rect[0], y1 = rect[1], x2 = rect[2], y2 = rect[3];
            events.emplace_back(x1, y1, y2, 1);  // rectangle starting
            events.emplace_back(x2, y1, y2, -1); // rectangle ending
        }
        
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());
        
        multiset<pair<int, int>> activeYIntervals;
        long long prevX = events[0].x;
        long long area = 0;
        
        for (const auto& event : events) {
            long long currentX = event.x;
            
            long long yCoverage = 0;
            if (!activeYIntervals.empty()) {
                int currentY = -1;
                int covering = 0;
                
                for (const auto& interval : activeYIntervals) {
                    if (interval.second > currentY) {
                        yCoverage += max(0, interval.second - max(interval.first, currentY));
                        currentY = interval.second;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            area += (currentX - prevX) * yCoverage;
            
            if (event.type == 1) {
                activeYIntervals.insert({event.y1, event.y2});
            } else {
                activeYIntervals.erase(activeYIntervals.find({event.y1, event.y2}));
            }
            
            prevX = currentX;
        }
        
        return area % 1000000007;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> rectangles = \{\{0,0,2,2},{1,0,3,1}};
    cout << "Total Area: " << sol.rectangleArea(rectangles) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting events:** \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of events (which is twice the number of rectangles).
- **Processing events:** Each event involves operations on the active intervals which can be managed in \(O(\log n)\) time using balanced binary tree operations for inserts and deletions.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which should be efficient given the constraints.
