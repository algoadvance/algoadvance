[Leetcode 1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1461)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` if every binary code of length `k` is a substring of `s`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Examples:
1. **Input**: `s = "00110110"`, `k = 2`
   **Output**: `true`
   
2. **Input**: `s = "0110"`, `k = 1`
   **Output**: `true`
   
3. **Input**: `s = "0110"`, `k = 2`
   **Output**: `false`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- `1 <= k <= 20`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Should we assume that the input string only contains characters `'0'` and `'1'`?
   **A**: Yes, the problem statement guarantees that the string `s` consists only of binary digits.
   
2. **Q**: Is there any constraint on the value of `k` relative to the length of `s`?
   **A**: `k` will always be within the range of 1 to 20, as per the constraints.

3. **Q**: What is the desired output format?
   **A**: The function should return a boolean value `true` or `false`.

## Strategy

1. **Concept**:
    - The total number of distinct binary codes of length `k` is `2^k`.
    - We need to check if all possible binary codes of length `k` are present in the string `s`.
    
2. **Method**:
    - Use a sliding window of length `k` to traverse the string `s` and collect all unique substrings of length `k`.
    - Use a set to store these substrings and ensure all possible codes are counted exactly once.
    
3. **Steps**:
    - Initialize an empty set to store substrings of length `k`.
    - Iterate the string `s` with a sliding window of size `k`, adding each substring to the set.
    - After the traversal, compare the size of the set with `2^k`.
    - If the size matches `2^k`, all possible binary codes are present; otherwise, they are not.

4. **Time Complexity**:
    - Since we are using a sliding window and set operations, the time complexity is `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
    - The space complexity is `O(2^k)` due to the set storing all possible unique substrings.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

bool hasAllCodes(std::string s, int k) {
    if (k > s.length()) return false;
    
    std::unordered_set<std::string> seen;
    for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; ++i) {
        seen.insert(s.substr(i, k));
    }
    
    return seen.size() == (1 << k);
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "00110110";
    int k1 = 2;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << hasAllCodes(s1, k1) << std::endl;  // Output: true

    std::string s2 = "0110";
    int k2 = 1;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << hasAllCodes(s2, k2) << std::endl;  // Output: true

    std::string s3 = "0110";
    int k3 = 2;
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << hasAllCodes(s3, k3) << std::endl;  // Output: false

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

- **Loop**: We loop through string `s` using a sliding window of size `k`. For each position, we extract a substring of length `k` and insert it into the set.
- **Set Size Check**: After the loop, we check if the size of the set equals `2^k`. If so, all possible binary codes of length `k` are present.
- **Return**: Based on the condition, return `true` or `false`.

This method ensures you comprehensively check for all possible binary codes of the specified length efficiently.
