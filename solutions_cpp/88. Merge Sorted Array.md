[Leetcode 88. Merge Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l88)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `nums1` and `nums2` only holding non-negative integers?**
   - No, the arrays can contain any integer values.
   
2. **Should the merged result be stored back in `nums1` without using additional space?**
   - Yes, the problem constraints require in-place merging without additional significant space beyond variables for indices.

3. **Can `nums1` or `nums2` be empty?**
   - Yes, it's possible for either `m` or `n` to be 0, and this should be handled accordingly.

### Strategy

To merge `nums1` and `nums2` in-place, we'll use a **three-pointer approach**:

1. **Pointers:**
   - `i` initially points to `m - 1` in `nums1`.
   - `j` initially points to `n - 1` in `nums2`.
   - `k` will point to `m + n - 1` to fill the `nums1` from the back.

2. **Steps:**
   - Compare elements from the back of `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - Place the larger element at the back position (`k`) in `nums1`.
   - Move the respective pointers (`i`, `j`, `k`) accordingly.
   - Continue this process until one of the arrays is fully traversed.
   - If elements in `nums2` remain, they need to be copied over to the beginning of `nums1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(m + n) \) – Each element from both arrays is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) – Merging is done in-place without extra storage apart from variables.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
    int i = m - 1; // Pointer for the end of the added elements in nums1
    int j = n - 1; // Pointer for the end of nums2
    int k = m + n - 1; // Pointer for the end of nums1
    
    // Merge in reverse order
    while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
        if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
            nums1[k--] = nums1[i--];
        } else {
            nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
        }
    }
    
    // If there are remaining elements in nums2, copy them
    while (j >= 0) {
        nums1[k--] = nums2[j--];
    }
    
    // No need to do anything for remaining elements in nums1 since they are already in place
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** Start pointers `i`, `j`, and `k` at the end of the respective segments.
- **Merge Loop:** Compare elements from `nums1` and `nums2` backward and place the larger element in the correct position in `nums1`.
- **Remaining Elements:** If any elements remain in `nums2`, copy them over to `nums1`.

This approach ensures that `nums1` contains the merged sorted array using constant extra space.
