[Leetcode 1713. Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1713)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `target` that consists of distinct integers and another integer array `arr` that may have duplicates.

Your goal is to make `target` a subsequence of `arr` by performing at most the fewest operations. In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in `arr`. 

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the elements in `target` always distinct?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem specifies that `target` consists of distinct integers.
   
2. **Q:** Can `arr` have duplicate elements?
   - **A:** Yes, `arr` can contain duplicate elements.
   
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of `target` or `arr`?
   - **A:** The problem typically includes constraints such as \(1 \leq \text{target.length}, \text{arr.length} \leq 10^5\) and \(1 \leq \text{target[i]}, \text{arr[i]} \leq 10^9\).

### Strategy

1. **Map Indexes in `target`:**
   - Create a mapping from each value in `target` to its index.

2. **Filter `arr` based on `target`:**
   - Convert `arr` to a filtered array that only contains elements present in `target` with respect to the `target` indexes.

3. **Find Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**
   - The problem then reduces to finding the LIS in the filtered array because the LIS represents the longest part of `target` already in order in `arr`.

4. **Calculate Insertions Needed:**
   - The difference between the length of `target` and the length of the LIS gives the minimum insertions needed.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& target, std::vector<int>& arr) {
        // Step 1: Create a mapping from value to its index in target
        std::unordered_map<int, int> targetIndexMap;
        for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); ++i) {
            targetIndexMap[target[i]] = i;
        }

        // Step 2: Create the filtered array based on target
        std::vector<int> filteredArr;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (targetIndexMap.find(num) != targetIndexMap.end()) {
                filteredArr.push_back(targetIndexMap[num]);
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Find the LIS in the filtered array using binary search
        std::vector<int> lis;
        for (int num : filteredArr) {
            auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), num);
            if (it == lis.end()) {
                lis.push_back(num);
            } else {
                *it = num;
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Calculate the minimum operations
        return target.size() - lis.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> target = {5, 1, 3};
    std::vector<int> arr = {9, 4, 2, 3, 4};
    std::cout << "Minimum Operations: " << solution.minOperations(target, arr) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
``` 

### Time Complexity

1. **Mapping target indices:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `target`.
2. **Filtering arr:** \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of `arr`.
3. **Finding LIS:** \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the length of the filtered array (with \(k \leq m\)).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\).

This approach is efficient and should work well within typical problem constraints.
