[Leetcode 2749. Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2749)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, you need to perform operations on `num1` to make it zero. In one operation, you can:

1. Subtract `num2` from `num1`.
2. Multiply `num1` by two.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `num1` equal to zero.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `num1` guaranteed to be positive initially?**
   - Yes, `num1` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
   
2. **Is there any constraint on `num2`?**
   - No constraints on `num2` are provided; `num2` can be any integer.

3. **If `num2` is zero, what happens?**
   - If `num2` is zero, you can't perform any subtraction operation, and multiplying `num1` by two will never make it zero.

### Strategy

To solve this problem optimally, you can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) because it systematically explores all possible operation sequences level-by-level. The BFS approach is advantageous because it finds the shortest sequence (minimum operations) to achieve the goal.

You can use a queue to manage the states of `num1` at each step, and a set to record visited states to avoid redundant calculations. 

In each step:
1. If `num1` is zero, we've found the solution.
2. If `num1 > 0`, queue the next states:
   - `num1` after subtracting `num2`
   - `num1` after multiplying by two

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation for the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int minOperationsToMakeZero(int num1, int num2) {
    if (num1 == 0) return 0;
    if (num2 == 0) return -1; // Special case, if subtracting num2 is not possible
    
    queue<pair<int, int>> q; // Pair of current number and operation count
    unordered_set<int> visited;

    q.push({num1, 0});
    visited.insert(num1);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, steps] = q.front();
        q.pop();

        if (current == 0) {
            return steps;
        }

        int next1 = current - num2;
        if (next1 >= 0 && visited.find(next1) == visited.end()) {
            q.push({next1, steps + 1});
            visited.insert(next1);
        }

        int next2 = current * 2;
        if (next2 >= 0 && visited.find(next2) == visited.end()) {
            q.push({next2, steps + 1});
            visited.insert(next2);
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // If unable to reach zero, return -1
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 4;

    int result = minOperationsToMakeZero(num1, num2);
    cout << "Minimum operations to make " << num1 << " zero: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the BFS approach is challenging to compute precisely because it largely depends on the values of `num1` and `num2`. In the worst case:

- Each level of BFS can potentially double the size of the queue, leading to an exponential growth.
- However, because we use a set to track visited states, we avoid redundant calculations.

Thus, while the precise complexity can vary, the BFS ensures the shortest path is found efficiently for reasonable constraints.
