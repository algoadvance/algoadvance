[Leetcode 85. Maximal Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l85)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the typical size of the matrix we can expect? Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix?
2. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle edge cases such as an empty matrix or a matrix with no 1's?
3. **Time Complexity**: Is there any specific time complexity requirement or limitation?

### Strategy

The problem can be broken down into several smaller steps:

1. **Histogram Representation**: At each row in the matrix, treat each element and the elements above it as a histogram. This means, for each row, you can compute the height of 1's column-wise up to that row.
2. **Maximal Rectangle in Histogram**: Use a method to find the largest rectangle possible in a histogram, which we need to apply to each row's histogram representation.

To find the largest rectangle in a histogram, we can use a stack-based approach that operates in linear time for each histogram. By combining these steps, we can solve the problem efficiently.

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int rows = matrix.size();
        int cols = matrix[0].size();
        vector<int> height(cols, 0);
        
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    height[j] = 0;
                } else {
                    height[j] += 1;
                }
            }
            maxArea = max(maxArea, largestRectangleArea(height));
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
    
private:
    int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        stack<int> s;
        heights.push_back(0); // Add a zero-height bar to ensure stack empties by the end
        int maxArea = 0;
        int n = heights.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while (!s.empty() && heights[i] < heights[s.top()]) {
                int h = heights[s.top()];
                s.pop();
                int width = s.empty() ? i : (i - s.top() - 1);
                maxArea = max(maxArea, h * width);
            }
            s.push(i);
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Histogram Update**: Each element in the matrix is processed once, leading to `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**: For each row, the largest rectangle is found in linear time relative to the number of columns, so `O(n)` for each row.
  
Combining these complexities, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)**, which is efficient for this problem.

### Additional Notes

- The space complexity of the solution is `O(n)` due to the additional storage for height and stack variables.
- It is crucial to handle the edge cases such as an empty matrix or matrices fully filled with either 0's or 1's correctly. The provided code does account for these scenarios.
