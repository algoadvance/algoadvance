[Leetcode 1964. Find the Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1964)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `obstacles` of length `n`, where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of the `i-th` obstacle.

For every index `i`, you must find the longest obstacle course in `obstacles` that ends at `i`. The course at `i` is valid if and only if every obstacle `j` (where `0 <= j <= i`) in the course is less than or equal to the obstacle `i`.

Return an array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i]` is the length of the longest obstacle course at each position `i`.

### Example 1:
```text
Input: obstacles = [1,2,3,2,1,5,1]
Output: [1,2,3,3,2,4,3]
```

### Example 2:
```text
Input: obstacles = [2,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1]
```

### Example 3:
```text
Input: obstacles = [3,1,5,6,4,2]
Output: [1,1,2,3,2,2]
```

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - For each obstacle at position `i`, we need to determine the length of the longest subsequence that ends at `i` where each element in the subsequence is not greater than the obstacle at `i`.

2. **Observation:**
   - This seems to be a variant of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem but with the constraint that the sequence is non-decreasing and ends at the current element.

3. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - To optimize, we can use a data structure like a list to keep track of the longest valid subsequence found so far.
   - For each obstacle, we determine where it should fit in this list to maintain the sequence property.
   - Using binary search helps us efficiently find the position to update or extend our list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the `obstacles` array (`n`)?
   - Can the heights in `obstacles` contain negative values or zeros?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the result array `ans` be returned directly or is any specific output format required?

Let's proceed with coding this solution.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(vector<int>& obstacles) {
    int n = obstacles.size();
    vector<int> ans(n);
    vector<int> lis;  // This will store the longest increasing subsequence
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Find the insertion point in lis for obstacles[i]
        int idx = upper_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), obstacles[i]) - lis.begin();
        
        // If idx is equal to the length of lis, it means this element
        // can extend the lis
        if (idx == lis.size()) {
            lis.push_back(obstacles[i]);
        } else { // Otherwise we update the element at idx to obstacles[i]
            lis[idx] = obstacles[i];
        }
        
        // The length of the longest sequence that ends at i is idx + 1
        ans[i] = idx + 1;
    }
    
    return ans;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> obstacles = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1};
    vector<int> result = longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(obstacles);
    for (int r : result) {
        cout << r << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Explanation:**
  - **Binary Search:** Each binary search operation (`upper_bound` function) on the list takes \(O(\log k)\) time where `k` is the current length of the `lis`.
  - **Iteration:** We iterate through the `obstacles` array once, making the total time complexity \(O(n \log n)\) since `n` is the number of elements in the `obstacles` array.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity primarily depends on the `lis` vector, making it \(O(n)\) in the worst case. The `ans` vector also uses \(O(n)\) space to store our results. Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the length of the longest valid obstacle course at each position.
