## Problem Statement

1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability

n passengers board an airplane with exactly n seats. The first passenger has lost their ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:

- Take their own seat if itâ€™s still available
- Pick other available seats randomly when they find their seat occupied

Return the probability that the n-th (last) passenger gets their own seat.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **n Value Range**: What is the range of n? 
   - Usually, in competitive programming problems, `1 <= n <= 10^4` or similar is considered.

2. **Exact Probability Calculation**: Are we expected to derive an exact closed-form probability in terms of n, or are simulations of random seat assignments accepted?
   - Typically, mathematical derivation is preferred, but simulation methods are feasible if they align with time complexity constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n=1`, the first passenger takes the only seat available. The probability should be 1.

With the problem and context in mind, let's derive the approach and formulate the solution.


## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - When n = 1, the probability that the first (and only) passenger gets their own seat is obviously 1.
   - For any `n > 1`, we need to understand the recursive relationship or symmetry that can help deduce the probability. The core insight is realizing the randomness and long-term equilibrium nature of the problem.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - If we start analyzing with small n values, we can build an understanding:
        - For `n = 2`, the probability that passenger 2 sits in their own seat could be understood.
        - Evaluate for higher values using the recursive dependency and observing patterns.
   - The symmetrical nature of the problem with randomness hints that the probability stabilizes to 0.5 for `n > 1`.

3. **General Thought**:
   - For `n > 1`, due to symmetry and averaging over infinite trials, each passenger after the random choice has equal probability of ending up in their respective seats.

4. **Mathematical Conclusion**:
   - The probability converges to 0.5 for `n > 1`.


## Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n == 1) return 1.0;
        // For n > 1, the probability converges to 0.5
        return 0.5;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The function runs in constant time, O(1), as it involves only basic arithmetic and conditional checks.
- **Space Complexity**: The solution uses constant space, O(1), as no extra space proportional to input size is needed.

This solution intelligently and mathematically derives the probability without running repetitive simulations, ensuring optimal efficiency.
