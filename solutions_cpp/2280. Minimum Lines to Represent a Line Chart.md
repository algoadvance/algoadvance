[Leetcode 2280. Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2280)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [day_i, price_i]` indicates the price of the stock on day `day_i`. A line chart is created by connecting adjacent points with a line segment, where a point `(day_i, price_i)` is connected to `(day_(i+1), price_(i+1))` with a line segment.

Return the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart. Note that **a single line segment can cover multiple points if they form a straight line**.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the `day_i` values guaranteed to be unique?** 
   - Yes, each `day_i` is unique.

2. **Do the points need to be sorted by the `day_i` values?**
   - Yes, or we need to sort them first if they're not.

3. **Can there be floating-point precision issues?**
   - No, all calculations can be done using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision issues.

4. **Is there a limit to the number of points?**
   - Standard constraints (e.g., \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)) apply but should check the exact constraints from the problem statement.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Points**: Ensure the points are sorted by the day values.
2. **Check Collinearity**: We can use the slope formula to check if three consecutive points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)` are collinear. Instead of computing the slope directly, use cross multiplication to avoid division and floating-point issues:
   - Points are collinear if: \((y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) == (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)\)
3. **Count Segments**: Start from the first two points, check if the next point continues the same line. If not, start a new line segment.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimumLines(vector<vector<int>>& stockPrices) {
    int n = stockPrices.size();
    if (n < 2) return 0; // If there are less than 2 points, no line needed.
    
    // Sort the points based on the day (x-coordinate)
    sort(stockPrices.begin(), stockPrices.end());
    
    int lines = 1; // At least one line is needed if there are 2 or more points.

    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        long long x1 = stockPrices[i-2][0], y1 = stockPrices[i-2][1];
        long long x2 = stockPrices[i-1][0], y2 = stockPrices[i-1][1];
        long long x3 = stockPrices[i][0], y3 = stockPrices[i][1];

        // Check if the slopes between the pairs are the same using cross multiplication
        if ((y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) != (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)) {
            lines++;
        }
    }

    return lines;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Traversal and Checking Collinearity**: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: **\(O(n \log n)\)**. The space complexity is **\(O(1)\)**, ignoring the input space.
