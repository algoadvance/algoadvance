[Leetcode 1300. Sum of Mutated Array Closest to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1300)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer target. You have to modify the array in such a way that all elements in the array become equal to some integer `value` (which can be different for different elements in the array). The integer `value` should be chosen such that the sum of the elements in the modified array is as close as possible to the target.

Return the integer `value` used to modify the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of `arr` confined to any particular range?**
   - No range is specified, so assume it can be any integers.

2. **Is the array sorted?**
   - The problem does not specify that the array is sorted, so we should assume it is not necessarily sorted.

3. **Is the `target` guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, since we aim to modify the array to get closest to the target, the target will be a non-negative integer.

4. **What should we return if there are multiple values that result in the sum closest to the target?**
   - Return the smallest such value.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - First, sort the array. This will be helpful to use binary search effectively.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to find the value. The search range for the `value` will be from 0 to the maximum value of the array (`arr`).

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For a given `value`, calculate the sum by iterating through the array, replacing each element with the minimum of `value` and the original element.

4. **Closest Sum Logic**:
   - Track the closest sum and the corresponding value during the binary search iterations to determine the optimal value.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int findBestValue(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.back();
    int closestSum = INT_MAX;
    int closestValue = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (left + right) / 2;
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            sum += min(num, mid);
        }
        
        if (abs(sum - target) < abs(closestSum - target) || 
            (abs(sum - target) == abs(closestSum - target) && mid < closestValue)) {
            closestSum = sum;
            closestValue = mid;
        }
        
        if (sum < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return closestValue;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {4, 9, 3};
    int target = 10;
    cout << "Best value: " << findBestValue(arr, target) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Array**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.
2. **Binary Search**: `O(log M * n)` where `M` is the maximum element in `arr`.

   - The binary search is `O(log M)`
   - For each value tested in the binary search, calculating the sum takes `O(n)`

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + log M * n)`, which simplifies to `O((n + log M) * n)` where `M` is the maximum value in the array.

### Explanation of the Approach

1. **Binary Search Setup**: 
   - Binary search over the possible values between `0` and the maximum value in the array.
   
2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For each value `mid` during the binary search, calculate the sum of the modified array.

3. **Track Closest Sum**:
   - Keep track of the closest sum achieved and the corresponding value. Update these if a closer sum is found.
   
4. **Adjust Search Range**:
   - Adjust the binary search range based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the value that leads to a sum closest to the target.
