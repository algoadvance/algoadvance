### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2327: **Number of People Aware of a Secret**

You are given an integer `n`, which represents the number of days after a secret is initially shared with just one person. Every day, each person who knows the secret can decide to tell one new person the secret. There is a constraint that a person will forget the secret after learning it for `forget` days. Determine the number of people who know the secret at the end of `n` days.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the person who initially knows the secret included in the count?**
   - Yes, the initial person who knows the secret is included in the count on the first day.
   
2. **Does a person forget the secret exactly on the `forget`-th day?**
   - Yes, a person forgets the secret exactly `forget` days after learning it.

3. **Can a person who knows the secret share it before forgetting?**
   - Yes, a person can share the secret with one new person each day until they forget it.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int forget) {
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[1] = 1; // On day 1, 1 person knows the secret.
        
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        
        // The number of new people knowing the secret each day.
        std::vector<int> share(n + 1, 0);
        share[1] = 1;

        for (int day = 2; day <= n; ++day) {
            if (day >= forget) {
                dp[day] = (dp[day] + share[day - forget]) % MOD;
            }
            share[day] = dp[day - 1] - ((day - forget > 0) ? share[day - forget] : 0);
            share[day] = (share[day] + MOD) % MOD; // Make sure it is non-negative.
            dp[day] = (dp[day - 1] + share[day]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};

```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Use a DP array, `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of people who know the secret on day `i` and have not yet forgotten it.
   - Use another array, `share`, where `share[i]` represents the number of people who start sharing the secret on day `i`.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - Iteratively update the number of people who know the secret.
   - Every day, the number of new people who know the secret is added and the people who forget the secret are subtracted.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the number of people can be large, use modulo `1000000007` to avoid overflow.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of days. We iterate through each day and perform constant-time operations. 
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, as we use two vectors of size `n` to keep track of the results.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of people who know the secret while considering the constraints of forgetting the secret after a given number of days.
