[Leetcode 3139. Minimum Cost to Equalize Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3139)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, you can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
- Choose an integer `x` and change any element of the array to `x` with a cost of `k`.

Find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. 

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the possible values for `nums` and `k`?**
   - `nums` can contain positive and negative integers. `k` is a positive integer.
   
2. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array has a length `n >= 1`.

3. **What should the function return if the array length is 1?**
   - The function should return 0, as all elements are already equal.

### Strategy:
To minimize the cost of equalizing the array, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Choose Median:** The optimal value for which we should make all elements equal is the median of the array. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences, which directly correlates to minimizing the total cost.

2. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - Find the median of the array.
   - Compute the total cost to change each element to the median.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting will help easily pick the median.
2. **Find the Median:** For odd length arrays, the median is the middle element. For even length arrays, you can choose either of the two middle elements.
3. **Compute the Minimum Cost:** The cost will be the number of changes (which is `n-1`, as we start from one element) multiplied by `k`.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [1, 4, 6, 8, 10]`, `k = 2`
- Sorted `nums`: `[1, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
- Median: `6`

### Code Implementation:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCostEqualizeArray(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) return 0; // Single element, no cost.

        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int median = nums[nums.size() / 2];  // Median value

        int cost = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num != median) {
                cost += k;
            }
        }
        return cost;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Calculating cost:** \(O(n)\)
- **Overall:** \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for this problem.

### Space Complexity:
- **In-place Sorting:** \(O(1)\) extra space apart from the input array.

This concludes the solution with an efficient approach to solve the problem and minimize the cost to equalize the array.
