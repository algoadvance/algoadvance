[Leetcode 3035. Maximum Palindromes After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3035)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and array `queries` consisting of pairs of integers where each pair `(l, r)` represents a query for the substring `s[l:r]` (inclusive). For each query, you can perform operations to change characters within the substring in order to form the lexicographically smallest palindrome possible.

The task is to implement a function that returns an array of the resulting palindromes for each query after performing the operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the substring be modified into any permutation to form the smallest lexicographic palindrome?**
   - Yes, you can reorder the characters to form the smallest lexicographical palindrome possible.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` and the number of queries?**
   - These constraints will help determine the efficiency requirements. For the sake of this problem, let’s assume:
     - The length of `s` is up to `10^5`.
     - The number of queries is up to `10^5`.

3. **Are the indices in `queries` 0-based or 1-based?**
   - Let’s assume the indices are 0-based for ease of implementation.

4. **What should be the approach if the number of unique characters and operations required to form a palindrome are high?**
   - Using hash maps and sorting techniques, we can manage the characters and their frequencies to form palindromes efficiently.

### Strategy

1. **Extract Substrings:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, extract the substring `s[l:r+1]`.

2. **Character Frequency Count:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in the substring.

3. **Form the Palindrome:**
   - Identify the lexicographically smallest half of the palindrome based on character frequency.
   - Construct the first half and use it to form the complete palindrome.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Precompute the prefix frequency array for the string to speed up frequency computation for each substring.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single character substrings.
   - Even and odd length substrings.
   - Substrings with all identical characters.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>

std::vector<std::string> maxPalindromesAfterOperations(const std::string& s, const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& queries) {
    // Prefix frequency array
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<std::map<char, int>> prefixFreq(n + 1);
    
    // Fill prefix frequency array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixFreq[i + 1] = prefixFreq[i];
        prefixFreq[i + 1][s[i]]++;
    }
    
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    result.reserve(queries.size());

    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int l = query.first;
        int r = query.second;
        
        // Calculate frequency for substring s[l:r+1]
        std::map<char, int> charCount;
        for (auto& kv : prefixFreq[r + 1]) {
            charCount[kv.first] += kv.second;
        }
        for (auto& kv : prefixFreq[l]) {
            charCount[kv.first] -= kv.second;
        }
        
        // Create the lexicographically smallest palindrome
        std::string half;
        char oddChar = 0;
        
        for (auto& kv : charCount) {
            int count = kv.second;
            if (count % 2 != 0) {
                oddChar = kv.first;
            }
            half += std::string(count / 2, kv.first);
        }
        
        std::string palindrome = half;
        if (oddChar) {
            palindrome += oddChar;
        }
        std::reverse(half.begin(), half.end());
        palindrome += half;

        result.push_back(palindrome);
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
// std::string s = "aabbcb";
// std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> queries = \{\{0, 5}, {1, 4}};
// std::vector<std::string> result = maxPalindromesAfterOperations(s, queries);
// result should be {"abccba", "bacab"}

```

### Time Complexity

- Preprocessing the prefix frequency array takes \(O(n \cdot 26)\) where 26 is the number of distinct characters in the English alphabet.
- For each query, extracting the frequency map and constructing the palindrome has a time complexity of \(O(26)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity for handling all queries is \(O(q \cdot 26) \approx O(q)\).

This efficiency makes the approach viable for the given constraints.
