[Leetcode 2132. Stamping the Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2132)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied). You want to stamp the binary grid using a `1 x 1` stamp such that all the empty (`0`) cells are covered.

A stamp requires an empty cell to be stamped, meaning you can stamp in cells `[i, j]` if `grid[i][j] == 0`. Once you stamp a cell, it can't be used for another stamp. Return true if you can stamp all the empty cells; otherwise, return false.

**Example:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: True

Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: False
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Constraints**: What is the maximum size for `m` and `n`?
   - *Answer*: There is no explicit constraint given in the problem statement, but typical constraints might range up to 1000 x 1000.

2. **Cell Reuse**: Can we reuse the grid cells once stamped?
   - *Answer*: No, once you stamp a cell, it canâ€™t be used for another stamp.

3. **Guaranteed Feasibility**: Are we guaranteed that `grid` will contain at least one empty cell (0)?
   - *Answer*: No explicit guarantee is given, so the code should account for grids with no `0` cells.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Over All Cells**: Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Stamping Process**: If you encounter a `0`, mark it as stamped.
3. **Validation**: Ensure that all `0` cells are covered by the stamping process by the end of iteration.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool canStampGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                bool canStamp = false;
                if (i < m - 1 && grid[i+1][j] == 0) {
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i+1][j] = 2; // mark as stamped
                    canStamp = true;
                }
                if (j < n - 1 && grid[i][j+1] == 0) {
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i][j+1] = 2; // mark as stamped
                    canStamp = true;
                }
                if (!canStamp) {
                    return false; // can't stamp current '0' cell
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid1 = {{0, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 0}};
    vector<vector<int>> grid2 = {{1, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}};
    
    bool result1 = canStampGrid(grid1); // Expected: true
    bool result2 = canStampGrid(grid2); // Expected: false
    
    return (result1 == true && result2 == false) ? 0 : 1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The nested loop checks each cell in the grid exactly once, making the time complexity O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is efficient for reasonably large values of `m` and `n` within typical constraint limits.
