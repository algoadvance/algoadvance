[Leetcode 980. Unique Paths III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l980)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid` where `grid[i][j]` could be:
- `1` representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- `2` representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- `0` representing empty squares we can walk over.
- `-1` representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walk ways from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the path revisit the starting square or ending square?**
   - No, we need to walk over each non-obstacle square exactly once which also includes not revisiting the starting or ending square.
2. **Is the grid always well-defined such that there is purely one start and one end?**
   - Yes, the grid always contains exactly one starting square and one ending square.
3. **What are the constraints on the size of the grid?**
   - The constraint details are usually provided in the problem, but for this problem, we can assume that m and n are reasonable such that a solution is feasible within typical computational limits.

## Strategy:
We will use Depth First Search (DFS) for traversing the grid. The main steps are:

1. **Identify the Starting Point:** Traverse the grid to find the coordinates of the starting point (`1`) and the total count of non-obstacle cells.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Use DFS to explore all 4 potential directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Backtracking:** Mark the current cell as visited before moving and backtrack (unmark the cell as visited) after exploring all routes from the current cell.
4. **Check Termination:** If we reach the ending point (`2`) and have visited all non-obstacle cells, we count this path as valid.
5. **Boundary Check:** Ensure that we don't move outside the grid or onto obstacles.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsIII(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int startX, startY, emptyCells = 1; // `emptyCells` starts at 1 to count the start point.
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid.front().size();
        
        // Find the start point and the total number of cells that need to be visited.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    startX = i;
                    startY = j;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    ++emptyCells;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dfs(grid, startX, startY, emptyCells, m, n);
    }

private:
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int emptyCells, int m, int n) {
        // Base condition: If out of bounds or on obstacle, return 0 paths.
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] == -1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // If we reach the ending cell but still have cells to visit, return 0 paths.
        if (grid[x][y] == 2) {
            return emptyCells == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        // Mark the cell as visited by setting it to -1.
        grid[x][y] = -1;
        int totalPaths = 0;
        
        // Explore all 4 directions
        totalPaths += dfs(grid, x + 1, y, emptyCells - 1, m, n);
        totalPaths += dfs(grid, x - 1, y, emptyCells - 1, m, n);
        totalPaths += dfs(grid, x, y + 1, emptyCells - 1, m, n);
        totalPaths += dfs(grid, x, y - 1, emptyCells - 1, m, n);
        
        // Backtrack: Unmark the cell as visited.
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        
        return totalPaths;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(4^E)\), where \(E\) is the number of empty or non-obstacle squares. This is because in the worst case, we can move in 4 directions from each cell.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(E)\), for the recursion stack and extra space used by the grid manipulation.

This solution efficiently handles the problem by using DFS and backtracking techniques to ensure that all valid paths from the start to the end are counted, satisfying the condition of visiting each square exactly once.
