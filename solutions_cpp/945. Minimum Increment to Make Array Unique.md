[Leetcode 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l945)
### Problem Statement

The problem requires you to make all the elements in an array unique with the minimum increment operations. An increment operation means you can increase the value of any element by 1. The aim is to find the minimum number of such increments needed so that all elements in the array are unique.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 increment, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation: After 6 increments, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array be empty?
   **A:** No, according to the problem statement there is at least one element in the array.
2. **Q:** What is the range of the element values in the array?
   **A:** The problem constraints typically allow the elements to range in the order of typical integer values, unless specifically restricted.
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   **A:** Leetcode usually handles arrays up to a size of \(10^5\), but specifics should be checked in the problem description.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting simplifies the problem because it allows us to process elements in order and ensures any duplicates are adjacent.
   
2. **Increment Duplicates:** Traverse the sorted array and for each duplicate found, increment it to the next available unique value. Count the number of increments needed.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minIncrementForUnique(vector<int>& nums) {
    // First, sort the array
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    // This will hold the total number of increments
    int increments = 0;

    // Iterate over the sorted array
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
            // Calculate the number of increments needed
            int neededIncrement = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
            // Increment the current number
            nums[i] += neededIncrement;
            // Add to the total increments
            increments += neededIncrement;
        }
    }

    return increments;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Traverse and Increment:** \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\), dominated by the sorting step.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space besides the input array `nums`.

### Example Usage

```cpp
int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 2};
    cout << minIncrementForUnique(nums1) << endl; // Output: 1

    vector<int> nums2 = {3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7};
    cout << minIncrementForUnique(nums2) << endl; // Output: 6

    return 0;
}
```

This solution should provide an efficient and clear approach to solve the problem of making all elements in an array unique with the minimum increments.
