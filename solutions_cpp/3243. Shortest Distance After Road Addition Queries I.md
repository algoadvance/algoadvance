[Leetcode 3243. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3243)
## Problem Statement

Given a weighted undirected graph \( \text{graph} \) represented as an adjacency list where \(\text{graph}[i]\) is a list of pairs \((j, \text{cost})\) representing edges between node \(i\) and node \(j\) with weight \(\text{cost}\), and a list of queries \(\text{queries}\) where each query is represented as a pair of nodes \((u, v)\), find the shortest distance between nodes \(u\) and \(v\) after each query.

Each query also specifies a new road (edge) to be added to the graph before evaluating the shortest distance. The new road is represented by a triplet \((u, v, \text{newCost})\) indicating there's now also a road between \(u\) and \(v\) with weight \(\text{newCost}\).

## Clarifying Questions
- **Q**: Will there be any negative weights in the graph?
  - **A**: No, all weights will be non-negative, which allows us to use Dijkstra's algorithm effectively.
  
- **Q**: Can the new road replace existing roads with higher costs?
  - **A**: Yes, after adding the new road, the graph will have this additional road regardless of previous edges.
  
- **Q**: What is the size of the graph (number of nodes and edges), and how many queries will typically be expected?
  - **A**: Assume the graph can have up to 200 nodes and 1000 edges. The number of queries can be up to 500.

## Strategy
1. We'll use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the graph.
2. For each query, temporarily add the new road, compute the shortest path between the given nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm, then restore the graph to its previous state.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int node;
    int weight;
};

struct Graph {
    vector<vector<Edge>> adj;
    int n;

    Graph(int n) : n(n) {
        adj.resize(n);
    }

    void addEdge(int u, int v, int w) {
        adj[u].push_back({v, w});
        adj[v].push_back({u, w});
    }

    int shortestPath(int src, int dest) {
        vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

        dist[src] = 0;
        pq.push({0, src});

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            int u = pq.top().second;
            pq.pop();

            for (const auto& edge : adj[u]) {
                int v = edge.node;
                int weight = edge.weight;

                if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                    pq.push({dist[v], v});
                }
            }
        }

        return dist[dest];
    }
};

vector<int> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>& edges, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>& queries) {
    Graph graph(n);
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int u, v, w;
        tie(u, v, w) = edge;
        graph.addEdge(u, v, w);
    }

    vector<int> results;

    for (auto& query : queries) {
        int u, v, newCost;
        tie(u, v, newCost) = query;

        // Backup the adjacency list for undoing the addition after calculation
        auto backup = graph.adj;

        // Add the new road
        graph.addEdge(u, v, newCost);

        // Get the shortest path
        results.push_back(graph.shortestPath(u, v));

        // Restore graph to its initial state
        graph.adj = backup;
    }

    return results;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is \(O(E + V \log V)\) where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) is the number of vertices.
- For each query, we temporarily add an edge and run Dijkstra's, hence the complexity for each query is \(O(E + V \log V)\).
- As the number of queries \(K\) and assuming \(K\) queries, the total time taken will be \(O(K(E + V \log V))\).

This approach considers adding the edge for each query in a temporary manner and restoring the original state of the graph afterward. The focus is on ensuring accurate computation without permanently altering the graph for subsequent queries.
