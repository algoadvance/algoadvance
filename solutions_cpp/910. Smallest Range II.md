[Leetcode 910. Smallest Range II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l910)
### Problem Statement

The problem is defined on LeetCode as follows:
 
You are given an integer array `A` and an integer `K`. For each integer in the array, you can choose to add `K` to it or subtract `K` from it.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the array after performing up to one of these operations on each array element.

**Example:**
```
Input: A = [1, 3, 6], K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose (1+3), (3+3), (6-3). The resulting array is [4, 6, 3] and the difference between the max and min is 6-3 = 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements in the array have negative values?**
   - Yes, the elements can be negative.
   
2. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, we can assume that the array is non-empty.

3. **What are the constraints for `A` and `K`?**
   - The length of the array `A` will be between `1` and `10000`.
   - Each element of the array `A` can be as large as `10^5` in absolute value.
   - `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `10^4`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** 
   - Sorting the array helps in evaluating the smallest range because the extremes will change in a predictable manner when `K` is added or subtracted.
   
2. **Initial Range Calculation:**
   - Calculate the initial difference between the maximum and minimum values of the sorted array without any adjustments. This serves as the baseline.

3. **Evaluate Possible Ranges:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array and calculate new potential ranges by considering the effect of adding/subtracting `K` to each element.
   - Specifically, consider the new extremes (`low` and `high`) formed by the middle elements and their potential shifted values.
   
4. **Determine the Minimum Range:**
   - Keep track of the minimum difference between the possibly modified max and min values.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

int smallestRangeII(std::vector<int>& A, int K) {
    if (A.size() == 1) {
        return 0;   // If there's only one element, no range calculation is needed.
    }

    std::sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    int n = A.size();
    int initialRange = A[n - 1] - A[0];

    int result = initialRange;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int high = std::max(A[n - 1] - K, A[i] + K);
        int low = std::min(A[0] + K, A[i + 1] - K);
        result = std::min(result, high - low);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> A = {1, 3, 6};
    int K = 3;
    std::cout << "Smallest Range II: " << smallestRangeII(A, K) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array `A`.
- **Evaluating the Possible Ranges:** `O(n)` as it involves a single pass through the array.

Hence, the total time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step.

This approach ensures that we attempt to minimize the difference effectively, considering all possible adjustments with given constraints.
