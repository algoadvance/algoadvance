[Leetcode 803. Bricks Falling When Hit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l803)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid of binary values representing a matrix of bricks (with `1` representing a brick and `0` representing empty space). Additionally, you are given an array `hits` where each element is a pair of coordinates `(i, j)` representing a brick that is hit and removed at that position.

After each hit, some bricks might fall off the grid. A brick will not fall if it is directly connected to the top of the grid or if it is connected to a brick that will not fall. You have to return an array representing the number of bricks that will fall after each hit in the order of hits.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the given coordinates in the hits guaranteed to be within the grid?**
   - Yes, you can assume that all hit coordinates are within the grid.
   
2. **Should the result include the bricks that were just hit, or only the bricks that fell due to the hit?**
   - The result should include only the bricks that fell due to the hit, not the brick at the hit location itself.

3. **Can the same position be hit more than once?**
   - Yes, a position can be hit more than once.

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using the union-find (disjoint set union) data structure. The idea is to simulate the process in reverse â€” first by considering all hits are applied, marking them as absent bricks initially. Then, we gradually add the bricks back and simulate their falling using the union-find data structure. 

Steps:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Mark all hit bricks as 0.
   - Use union-find to connect all remaining bricks.

2. **Simulate Reverse Hits:**
   - For each hit in reverse order, add the brick back.
   - Connect this brick to its neighboring bricks if they exist.
   - Calculate the change in the number of connected components before and after adding this brick.

Here's the step-by-step implementation.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int size) : root(size), rank(size, 1) {
        iota(root.begin(), root.end(), 0);
    }
    
    int find(int x) {
        if (root[x] == x) {
            return x;
        }
        return root[x] = find(root[x]);
    }
    
    bool unionSets(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                root[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                root[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                root[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    int getSize(int x) {
        return rank[find(x)];
    }

    vector<int> root;
    vector<int> rank;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> hitBricks(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& hits) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        
        // Marking the hit points as 0
        for (const auto& hit : hits) {
            grid[hit[0]][hit[1]] -= 1;
        }
        
        UnionFind uf(rows * cols + 1);
        
        // Connect grid cells, treating marked points as 0
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    unionNeigbors(uf, grid, i, j, rows, cols);
                }
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> result(hits.size());
        static vector<vector<int>> directions = { {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0} };
        
        for (int k = hits.size() - 1; k >= 0; --k) {
            int x = hits[k][0], y = hits[k][1];
            if (++grid[x][y] == 1) {
                int prevSize = uf.getSize(rows * cols);
                for (auto& dir : directions) {
                    int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                    if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols && grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                        uf.unionSets(x * cols + y, nx * cols + ny);
                    }
                }
                if (x == 0) {
                    uf.unionSets(x * cols + y, rows * cols);
                }
                int newSize = uf.getSize(rows * cols);
                result[k] = max(0, newSize - prevSize - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

private:
    void unionNeigbors(UnionFind& uf, vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int rows, int cols) {
        static vector<vector<int>> directions = { {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0} };
        for (auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols && grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                uf.unionSets(x * cols + y, nx * cols + ny);
            }
        }
        if (x == 0) {
            uf.unionSets(x * cols + y, rows * cols);
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of Union-Find (to mark all valid bricks):** O(m \* n)
- **Union operations for each hit:** O(m \* n)
- **Total complexity:** O(m \* n) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. Each hit involves operations that are essentially constant time due to the efficient union-find operations with path compression and union by rank.
