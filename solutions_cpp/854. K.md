[Leetcode 854. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l854)
### Problem Statement

Given two anagrams `s1` and `s2`, you have to return the smallest number of swaps required to transform `s1` into `s2`. A swap is defined as swapping two characters in the string. Two strings are considered K-similar if one string can be transformed into the other by exactly K such swaps. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a valid swap?** – A valid swap is one that you perform on any two characters in the string to step closer to converting `s1` into `s2`.
2. **Constraints:** – What are the constraints on the input size?
   - Both `s1` and `s2` are of the same length.
   - `1 <= s1.length == s2.length <= 20`
   - `s1` and `s2` are anagrams of each other.

### Strategy

1. **Problem Analysis**: 
   - Since we are allowed to swap any characters, the problem can be thought of as a shortest path problem where each state is a string configuration, and transitions (edges) are swaps.
   
2. **Approach**:
   - We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the minimal number of swaps.
   - We start from the initial string `s1` and aim to reach `s2`.
   - Explore all possible states by swapping characters in `s1` and move closer to `s2` step by step.
   
3. **Details**:
   - Use a queue to perform BFS and a set to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.
   - For each current string, swap characters that are out-of-place as compared to `s2`, and push the new configurations into the queue.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int kSimilarity(string s1, string s2) {
    if (s1 == s2) return 0;
    
    int n = s1.size();
    queue<pair<string, int>> q; // {current string, step count}
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    
    q.push({s1, 0});
    visited.insert(s1);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, step] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        int i = 0;
        while (i < n && current[i] == s2[i]) i++;
        
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (current[j] == s2[i] && current[j] != s2[j]) {
                swap(current[i], current[j]);
                if (current == s2) return step + 1;
                if (!visited.count(current)) {
                    visited.insert(current);
                    q.push({current, step + 1});
                }
                swap(current[i], current[j]); // swap back
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // Should never reach here if s1 and s2 are anagrams
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "abac", s2 = "baca";
    cout << kSimilarity(s1, s2) << endl; // Output should be 2
    
    s1 = "abc", s2 = "bca";
    cout << kSimilarity(s1, s2) << endl; // Output should be 2

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The main factors affecting the time complexity are:
- **State space size**: The number of distinct strings that can be formed by swapping characters in `s1`, which is bounded factorially.
- **BFS Exploration**: BFS generally ensures we explore the minimum number of swaps.

Thus, the overall **time complexity** is `O(n!)` where `n` is the length of the string because in the worst case, there are factorially many permutations.

**Note**: Given the constraints, an efficient BFS approach should be effective within practical limits (20! is feasible with modern computational power when backed by pruning strategies).
