[Leetcode 2971. Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2971)
## Problem Statement

You need to write a function to calculate the perimeter of a polygon given its vertex coordinates. The function should then identify the polygon with the largest perimeter from a list of polygons.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: What does the input look like? Is it an array of polygons, where each polygon is a list of vertex coordinates?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, the input will be a vector of polygons, where each polygon is represented as a vector of pairs of integers representing the vertex coordinates.

2. **Number of Vertices**: Can polygons have different numbers of vertices, or do all polygons have the same number of vertices?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, polygons can have different numbers of vertices.

3. **Output**: What should the output be? Do you return the index of the polygon with the largest perimeter or the perimeter value itself?
   - **Assumption**: We'll return the index of the polygon with the largest perimeter.

## Strategy

1. **Perimeter Calculation**: Create a helper function to calculate the perimeter of a given polygon.
   - Use the distance formula \(\sqrt{ (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 }\) to calculate the distance between two points.
   - Sum these distances for each pair of consecutive vertices, including the distance from the last vertex back to the first.

2. **Find Largest Perimeter**: Iterate through the list of polygons, calculate each polygon's perimeter, and track the largest perimeter and its corresponding index.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - List contains no polygons.
   - Polygons with less than three vertices (not valid polygons).
   
## Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate Euclidean distance between two points
double calculateDistance(pair<int, int> a, pair<int, int> b) {
    return sqrt(pow(b.first - a.first, 2) + pow(b.second - a.second, 2));
}

// Function to calculate the perimeter of a polygon
double calculatePerimeter(vector<pair<int, int>>& polygon) {
    double perimeter = 0;
    int n = polygon.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        perimeter += calculateDistance(polygon[i], polygon[(i + 1) % n]);
    }
    return perimeter;
}

// Function to find the index of the polygon with the largest perimeter
int findLargestPerimeter(vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& polygons) {
    if (polygons.empty()) return -1;  // No polygons in the list

    int largestIndex = -1;
    double largestPerimeter = -numeric_limits<double>::max();

    for (int i = 0; i < polygons.size(); ++i) {
        if (polygons[i].size() < 3) continue;  // Ignore invalid polygons

        double currentPerimeter = calculatePerimeter(polygons[i]);
        if (currentPerimeter > largestPerimeter) {
            largestPerimeter = currentPerimeter;
            largestIndex = i;
        }
    }

    return largestIndex;
}

int main() {
    // Example list of polygons represented by their vertex coordinates
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> polygons = {
        \{\{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 0}},          // Square
        \{\{0, 0}, {0, 2}, {3, 1}},                   // Triangle
        \{\{1, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 2}, {3, 0}, {1, 0}}    // Pentagon
    };

    int largestPolygonIndex = findLargestPerimeter(polygons);
    cout << "The index of the polygon with the largest perimeter is: " << largestPolygonIndex << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Perimeter Calculation**: For each polygon with \( n \) vertices, calculating the perimeter involves \( n \) distance calculations, each taking constant time \( O(1) \). Hence, the time complexity per polygon is \( O(n) \).
- **Find Largest Perimeter**: If there are \( m \) polygons with an average of \( n \) vertices, the overall time complexity is \( O(m \times n) \).

In summary: **Time Complexity is \( O(m \times n) \)** where \( m \) is the number of polygons and \( n \) is the average number of vertices per polygon.
