[Leetcode 715. Range Module](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l715)
## Problem Statement

The problem is as follows:

A Range Module keeps track of a set of ranges of numbers. Your task is to implement a data structure that supports the following methods:

1. `void addRange(int left, int right)`: Adds the half-open interval `[left, right)`, tracking every real number in that interval. If adding the range `[left, right)` fully covers any existing ranges, those ranges are removed.

2. `bool queryRange(int left, int right)`: Returns `true` if every real number in the interval `[left, right)` is currently being tracked, and `false` otherwise.

3. `void removeRange(int left, int right)`: Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the interval `[left, right)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the ranges overlap when added?
   - Yes, the `addRange` method should merge overlapping ranges.

2. Should the `removeRange` method handle cases where only part of a tracked range is removed?
   - Yes, the method should handle splitting existing ranges if required.

3. Are there any constraints on the ranges' values or sizes?
   - The values will typically be within the bounds of 32-bit signed integers (`int`).

## Strategy

We'll use the `std::map` in C++ to handle the intervals. The key of the map will be the start of the interval, and the value will be the end of the interval.

1. **`addRange(int left, int right)`**:
   - Merge overlapping or touching intervals and update the map.

2. **`queryRange(int left, int right)`**:
   - Check if any existing interval completely covers the given interval.

3. **`removeRange(int left, int right)`**:
   - Remove the specified range and adjust the existing intervals accordingly.

## Code

```cpp
#include <map>
using namespace std;

class RangeModule {
private:
    map<int, int> intervals; // Stores intervals as [start, end)

public:
    void addRange(int left, int right) {
        auto it = intervals.upper_bound(left);
        if (it != intervals.begin() && (--it)->second < left) ++it;

        while (it != intervals.end() && it->first <= right) {
            left = min(left, it->first);
            right = max(right, it->second);
            it = intervals.erase(it);
        }

        intervals[left] = right;
    }

    bool queryRange(int left, int right) {
        auto it = intervals.upper_bound(left);
        if (it == intervals.begin() || (--it)->second < right) {
            return false;
        }

        return it->second >= right;
    }

    void removeRange(int left, int right) {
        auto it = intervals.upper_bound(left);
        if (it != intervals.begin() && (--it)->second <= left) ++it;

        vector<pair<int, int>> to_add;

        while (it != intervals.end() && it->first < right) {
            if (it->first < left) {
                to_add.emplace_back(it->first, left);
            }

            if (it->second > right) {
                to_add.emplace_back(right, it->second);
            }

            it = intervals.erase(it);
        }

        for (const auto& rng : to_add) {
            intervals[rng.first] = rng.second;
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **`addRange(int left, int right)`**: O(n), where n is the number of current intervals in the worst case, because we might need to merge all ranges.
- **`queryRange(int left, int right)`**: O(log n), where n is the number of current intervals because we are using a map which provides logarithmic time complexity for lookup.
- **`removeRange(int left, int right)`**: O(n), where n is the number of current intervals, as it might cause new ranges to be added and split.

Overall, the solution ensures efficient range management using a balanced map structure (`std::map` in C++).
