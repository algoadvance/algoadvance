[Leetcode 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1637)
## Problem Statement

Given `n` points on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, return **the width of the widest vertical area between two points such that no points are inside the area**.

A **vertical area** is an area of the plane where all points have different x-coordinates but have the same y-coordinate, and the width of a vertical area is the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the two edges.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the input array (`points`)? 
   - The `points` array can have a size anywhere from 2 to 10^5 elements.
  
2. What is the range of the x and y coordinates?
   - Both x and y coordinates are integers that can range from -10^9 to 10^9.

3. Can there be duplicate points?
   - The problem implies unique points but does not explicitly prohibit duplicates. However, since vertical areas are based only on x-coordinates, duplicates in y_coordinates are not directly relevant.

4. What should be returned if there are no vertical areas?
   - The problem guarantees at least two points, so there will always be a vertical area, and hence, this case does not need special handling.

## Strategy

1. **Extract X-Coordinates**: Focus on the x-coordinates since vertical areas are concerned with their differences.
  
2. **Sort X-Coordinates**: Sorting the list of x-coordinates allows us to easily calculate the differences between consecutive x-coordinates.

3. **Compute Maximum Difference**: Iterate through the sorted list of x-coordinates and compute the differences between consecutive elements, maintaining the maximum difference.
  
## Code

Hereâ€™s the possible C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
        // Extract x-coordinates
        std::vector<int> xCoords;
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            xCoords.push_back(point[0]);
        }
        
        // Sort the x-coordinates
        std::sort(xCoords.begin(), xCoords.end());
        
        // Calculate the maximum difference between consecutive x-coordinates
        int maxWidth = 0;
        for (size_t i = 1; i < xCoords.size(); ++i) {
            maxWidth = std::max(maxWidth, xCoords[i] - xCoords[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return maxWidth;
    }
};

```

## Time Complexity

- Extracting x-coordinates: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points.
- Sorting x-coordinates: \(O(n \log n)\), due to the sorting step.
- Calculating maximum difference: \(O(n)\), a single pass through the sorted list.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which results in \(O(n \log n)\).
