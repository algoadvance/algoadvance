[Leetcode 2264. Largest 3](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2264)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` representing a number, you need to find the largest **three-same-digit** number in the given string. A three-same-digit number is a sequence of the same digit appearing three times consecutively. Return that largest number as a string. If there is no such number, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the input string `s`?
   - Are there any characters other than digits in the string?

   **Clarification:**
   - The length of the input string `s` can be up to `10^5`.
   - The string `s` will only contain numeric digits (`0-9`).

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - The output should be the largest three-same-digit number in the string.
   - If no such sequence exists, return an empty string.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the String:**
   - We will traverse the string while checking for any sequence of three consecutive same digits.

2. **Compare and Store:**
   - Every time we encounter a sequence of three same digits, we need to compare it with the previously found sequence to ensure we keep the largest one.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where the string is less than 3 characters long.
   - Handle edge cases where there are no such three-same-digit sequences in the string.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string largestThreeSameDigitNumber(string s) {
    // Initialize the result as an empty string
    string result = "";
    int n = s.length();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
        if (s[i] == s[i+1] && s[i] == s[i+2]) {
            string current = s.substr(i, 3);
            if (result == "" || current > result) {
                result = current;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    cout << largestThreeSameDigitNumber("6777133339") << endl; // Output: "777"
    cout << largestThreeSameDigitNumber("2300019") << endl;    // Output: "000"
    cout << largestThreeSameDigitNumber("42352338") << endl;   // Output: ""

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We are making a single pass through the string to check for three-same-digit sequences. This results in a linear time complexity \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We are using a constant amount of space to store the result, hence the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

Feel free to ask for further clarifications or additional test cases!
