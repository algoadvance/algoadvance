[Leetcode 1802. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1802)
### Problem Statement

Given three parameters `n`, `index`, and `maxSum`, you need to construct an array `nums` of length `n` where the sum of all elements in `nums` does not exceed `maxSum`, and the element at position `index` is the maximum value possible. Additionally, the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements should be at most 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are `n`, `index`, and `maxSum` positive integers?
   **A**: Yes, all three are positive integers.

2. **Q**: Can the array values be negative or zero?
   **A**: No, each element of the array should be a positive integer.

3. **Q**: Is there a specific requirement for the initial values of the array elements?
   **A**: No, the values can be any positive integer, but they should adhere to the given constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach**: The problem requires finding the maximum value at a specific index such that the sum does not exceed `maxSum`, and the absolute difference between adjacent elements is at most 1. To approach this problem, binary search is a suitable technique to determine the maximum possible value at the given `index`.

2. **Calculate the Sum for a Candidate Max Value at `index`**:
    - Use a binary search to guess the maximum value (`maxVal`) for `nums[index]`.
    - Calculate the total sum of the elements with each guess.
    - Ensure that the sum of the array does not exceed `maxSum`.

3. **Helper Functions**:
    - A helper function to calculate the required sum for a given maximum value will be useful.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution leveraging binary search.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(int n, int index, int maxSum) {
        // Binary search function to check if a given maximum `mid` at `index` is feasible
        auto requiredSum = [&](long mid) -> long {
            long left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0;

            // Sum of elements to the left of index
            if (mid > index) {
                left_sum = (mid - index) * (mid + index + 1) / 2;
            } else {
                left_sum = mid * (mid + 1) / 2 + index - mid;
            }

            // Sum of elements to the right of index
            if (mid >= (n - 1 - index)) {
                right_sum = (mid - (n - 1 - index)) * (mid + (n - 1 - index) + 1) / 2;
            } else {
                right_sum = mid * (mid + 1) / 2 + (n - 1 - index) - mid;
            }

            // Calculate the total sum required
            return left_sum + mid + right_sum - mid;
        };

        int low = 1, high = maxSum;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
            if (requiredSum(mid) <= maxSum) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }
};

// Sample Execution for the example:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.maxValue(4, 2, 6) << endl; // Output should be 2
    cout << sol.maxValue(6, 1, 10) << endl; // Output should be 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The binary search runs in \(O(\log(maxSum))\) because it repeatedly divides the range of possible values by half.
- **Sum Calculation**: Each sum calculation within the helper function runs in \(O(1)\) time due to direct formula-based computation.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(\log(maxSum))\), which is efficient for the allowable input constraints.
