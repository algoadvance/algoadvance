[Leetcode 560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l560)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain negative numbers? **Yes.**
2. Are the elements in the array necessarily integers? **Yes.**
3. Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty? **Yes, per the problem description.**
4. Should the subarrays be of at least length 1? **Yes, subarrays need to be non-empty continuous parts of the original array.**

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a hashmap (unordered_map in C++) to keep track of the cumulative sums and their frequencies. This will help us efficiently calculate the number of subarrays that sum up to `k`.

Here is the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize a hashmap to store the cumulative sum and its frequency.
2. Initialize `sum` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative sum while iterating through the array.
3. Initialize `count` to 0, which will store the count of subarrays that sum to `k`.
4. Iterate over the elements of the array, updating the cumulative sum.
5. For each element, check if the cumulative sum minus `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index with a sum of `k`.
6. Update the hashmap with the current cumulative sum.
7. Return the count of subarrays that sum to `k`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> cumulativeSumFreq; // To store cumulative sum and its frequency
        cumulativeSumFreq[0] = 1; // To account for subarrays that begin at the start of the array
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (const int& num : nums) {
            sum += num;
            
            // Check if there is a subarray summing to k
            if (cumulativeSumFreq.find(sum - k) != cumulativeSumFreq.end()) {
                count += cumulativeSumFreq[sum - k];
            }

            // Update the frequency of the current cumulative sum
            cumulativeSumFreq[sum]++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 1};
    int k = 2;
    cout << sol.subarraySum(nums, k) << endl; // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the hash map that keeps track of cumulative sums and their frequencies.

This approach captures the essence of leveraging prefix sums and hash maps to maintain constant look-up times, resulting in a highly efficient solution.
