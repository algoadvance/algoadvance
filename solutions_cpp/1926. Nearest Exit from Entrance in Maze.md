[Leetcode 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1926)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col]` denotes the row and column of the entrance cell that is guaranteed to be an empty cell. 

Your task is to find the nearest exit from the entrance in the maze. An exit is an empty cell that is located at the boundary of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What are the constraints on `m` and `n` (dimensions of the maze)?
2. Can there be multiple exits with the same shortest distance, and do we need to return the path or just the distance?
3. Is the maze guaranteed to have at least one exit?

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int nearestExit(vector<vector<char>>& maze, vector<int>& entrance) {
        int m = maze.size();
        int n = maze[0].size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        
        q.push({entrance[0], entrance[1]});
        maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+';

        int steps = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                auto [row, col] = q.front();
                q.pop();

                for (auto dir : directions) {
                    int r = row + dir[0];
                    int c = col + dir[1];

                    if (r >= 0 && c >= 0 && r < m && c < n && maze[r][c] == '.') {
                        if (r == 0 || c == 0 || r == m - 1 || c == n - 1) {
                            return steps + 1;
                        }
                        maze[r][c] = '+';
                        q.push({r, c});
                    }
                }
            }
            steps++;
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Strategy:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We use BFS to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid. BFS explores all nodes at the present "depth" level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
2. **Queue Initialization**: We initialize a queue with the entrance cell and mark it as visited by changing it to `+`.
3. **Direction Array**: We use a directional array to explore all four possible directions (right, down, left, up).
4. **Boundary Check**: During exploration, if we find an empty cell on the boundary that's not the entrance, we return the current step count as the shortest path.
5. **Visited Cells**: We mark cells as visited by changing their value to `+` to avoid reprocessing.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the maze. Each cell is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n), for the queue which in the worst case can store all cells.

By using BFS, we ensure that the path found is the shortest, and the approach efficiently navigates through the maze.
