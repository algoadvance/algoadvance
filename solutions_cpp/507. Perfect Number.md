[Leetcode 507. Perfect Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l507)
## Problem Statement

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

Write a function that checks whether a given number is a perfect number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of the input integer? (e.g., 1 to \(10^8\))
   - Can the input be zero or a negative number? 

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the given number is a perfect number?

Let's assume:
- The input integer is in the range from 1 to \(10^8\).
- The input integer is always positive.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPerfectNumber(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) return false;  // No perfect number less than or equal to 1
        
        int sum = 1;  // Start with 1 because 1 is a divisor of all numbers
        int sqrtNum = std::sqrt(num);
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrtNum; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
                if (i != num / i) {
                    sum += num / i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return sum == num;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int num = 28;
    std::cout << "Is " << num << " a perfect number? " << (solution.checkPerfectNumber(num) ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: If the number is less than or equal to 1, return `false` as there are no perfect numbers less than or equal to 1.
2. **Summing Divisors**:
   - Start with a sum of 1 because 1 is a divisor of all numbers.
   - Iterate over possible divisors from 2 up to the square root of the number.
   - If `i` is a divisor, add `i` and also add the corresponding divisor `num / i` (if it's different from `i`).
   - The use of the square root reduces the number of iterations needed.
3. **Final Check**: If the sum of the divisors equals the original number, then it is a perfect number. Otherwise, it is not.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\sqrt{n})\)
  - This is because the loop runs from 2 to the square root of `num`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
