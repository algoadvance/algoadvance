[Leetcode 2240. Number of Ways to Buy Pens and Pencils](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2240)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `total` indicating the amount of money you have, and two integers `cost1` and `cost2` where:
- `cost1` is the cost of a pen.
- `cost2` is the cost of a pencil.

You want to know the number of different ways you can spend your money to buy pens and pencils. You can spend all or part of your money buying pens and pencils but you cannot exceed the `total` amount of money you have.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can I assume that all inputs (`total`, `cost1`, and `cost2`) are positive integers?**
   - Yes, you can assume they are positive integers.
   
2. **Is it allowed to buy zero pens or pencils?**
   - Yes, you can buy zero pens or pencils.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We will initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of ways to spend the money.

2. **Iterate Over Pens**: 
   - Use a loop to iterate over the possible number of pens that can be bought with the available money. For each choice of pen count, calculate the remaining money after buying these pens.

3. **Compute Pencils**:
   - With the remaining money, calculate the maximum number of pencils that can be bought.
   - For each pen count, every possible way to buy pencils is a valid way (including zero pencils).

4. **Count the Ways**:
   - For each possible number of pens, all combinations of pencils (from zero up to the maximum that can be bought with the remaining money) will be counted.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\frac{\text{total}}{\text{cost1}})\) - This is because the outer loop iterates over the number of pens which can range from 0 to total/cost1. Inside each iteration, calculations are constant time.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long waysToBuyPensPencils(int total, int cost1, int cost2) {
        long long ways = 0;

        for (int pens = 0; pens * cost1 <= total; ++pens) {
            // Calculate remaining money after buying `pens` pens
            int remainingMoney = total - pens * cost1;
            // Number of ways to buy pencils with the remaining money
            int pencilsWays = remainingMoney / cost2 + 1;
            ways += pencilsWays;
        }

        return ways;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int total = 20;
    int cost1 = 10;
    int cost2 = 5;
    cout << "Number of ways to buy pens and pencils: " << sol.waysToBuyPensPencils(total, cost1, cost2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code will output the number of ways to buy pens and pencils without exceeding the given total amount of money. The logic ensures that we account for all possible valid combinations of buying pens and pencils.
