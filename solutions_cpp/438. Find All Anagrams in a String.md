[Leetcode 438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l438)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example
```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0, 6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the input strings `s` and `p`?**
   - `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`
   - `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

2. **Can we assume that inputs are valid (i.e., `s` and `p` are always lowercase and non-empty)?**
   - Yes, based on the problem constraints.

3. **Is maintaining the order of output significant?**
   - No, the problem statement allows returning the output in any order.

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we can use a sliding window approach along with a frequency counter. Here’s the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Count Frequency of Characters in `p`:**
   - Create a frequency array `p_count` for `p`.

2. **Initialize a Sliding Window:**
   - Start with the first window in `s` that has the same length as `p`.
   - Populate the frequency array `s_count` for this window.

3. **Slide the Window and Compare:**
   - Slide the window one character at a time across `s`.
   - For each new position, update the `s_count` by including the new character and excluding the old character from the frequency array.
   - Compare `s_count` with `p_count`. If they match, record the start index of the window.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `p` is longer than `s`, it's impossible to find an anagram, so return an empty array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
    vector<int> result;
    vector<int> p_count(26, 0), s_count(26, 0);
    
    int p_len = p.length(), s_len = s.length();
    if (p_len > s_len) return result;
    
    // Count frequency of characters in p
    for (char c : p) {
        p_count[c - 'a']++;
    }
    
    // Initialize the first window in s
    for (int i = 0; i < p_len; i++) {
        s_count[s[i] - 'a']++;
    }
    
    // Compare initial window
    if (s_count == p_count) {
        result.push_back(0);
    }
    
    // Slide the window over s
    for (int i = p_len; i < s_len; i++) {
        s_count[s[i] - 'a']++;                  // Add new character to window
        s_count[s[i - p_len] - 'a']--;          // Remove old character from window
        
        // Compare current window with p frequency
        if (s_count == p_count) {
            result.push_back(i - p_len + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "cbaebabacd";
    string p = "abc";
    vector<int> indices = findAnagrams(s, p);
    
    for (int index : indices) {
        cout << index << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of `s`. This is because:
- We make a single pass to count the frequency of `p`’s characters.
- We initialize the first window (which takes O(m) time where `m` is the length of `p`).
- We slide the window across `s`, performing constant-time updates to the frequency array and comparisons (`O(1)` per position).

Hence, the overall complexity is O(n+m), which simplifies to O(n) since `m` ≤ `n`.
