[Leetcode 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1325)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree and an integer `target`, remove all the leaf nodes with value equal to `target`. Repeat until you cannot remove any more leaf nodes with the value `target`.

You are expected to return the modified tree.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What should the function return if the tree is empty?**
   - A: If the tree is empty (i.e., root is `NULL`), return `NULL`.
   
2. **Q: Does the function need to handle negative values or non-integer types in the tree nodes?**
   - A: No, the problem assumes that all node values are integers.

3. **Q: What is the definition of a leaf node?**
   - A: A leaf node is a node that has no children (both left and right child pointers are `NULL`).

4. **Q: Is it possible for the entire tree to be deleted?**
   - A: Yes, if all nodes in the tree match the `target` value and they all turn into leaf nodes during the process, then the entire tree can be deleted.

## Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Traverse the tree in post-order fashion (left-right-root).
   - If a node is a leaf and its value is equal to the `target`, delete this node by returning `NULL`.
   - Otherwise, return the node itself.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the root itself is `NULL`, return `NULL`.
   - Handle the tree reduction case where the entire tree may be removed.

## Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if (!root) return NULL;
        
        // Process left and right children first (post-order traversal)
        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
        
        // Now process the current node
        if (!root->left && !root->right && root->val == target) {
            delete root; // Remove the leaf node
            return NULL;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm performs a single post-order traversal of the tree. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack used during the post-order traversal. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, h can be equal to n. In the best case (balanced tree), h is log(n).
