[Leetcode 1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1281)
## Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1281: "Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer"

Given an integer number `n`, the task is to:
1. Calculate the product of its digits.
2. Calculate the sum of its digits.
3. Return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 234
Output: 15 
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
Result = 24 - 9 = 15
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   **A:** We assume `n` is a positive integer as the problem domain usually deals with positive integers unless otherwise specified.

2. **Q:** Can the input integer `n` be a single digit?
   **A:** Yes, though in such cases the product and sum would be the same, resulting in a difference of 0.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int product = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            product *= digit;
            sum += digit;
            n /= 10;
        }
        
        return product - sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 234; // example input
    std::cout << "Result: " << solution.subtractProductAndSum(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `product` to 1 (as multiplying by 1 has no effect).
   - `sum` to 0 (as adding 0 has no effect).

2. **Iterate Through Digits:**
   - Use a loop to process each digit of `n`.
   - Extract the last digit using modulo operation (`n % 10`).
   - Add this digit to `sum`.
   - Multiply this digit with `product`.
   - Remove the last digit by performing integer division by 10 (`n /= 10`).

3. **Calculate and Return Result:**
   - Subtract `sum` from `product` and return the result.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(d), where d is the number of digits in the integer `n`. Each digit is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of space for storing the intermediate results (`product` and `sum`).

This solution efficiently processes each digit of the number and computes the desired result in a linear time relative to the number of digits.
