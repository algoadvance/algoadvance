[Leetcode 1599. Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1599)
### Problem Statement

You own a Centennial Wheel and are responsible for its operation. You decide to maximize your profit by establishing a pricing strategy around the number of customers who use the wheel. The pricing rules are as follows:
- You can board 4 customers at once, and it costs `$4` per customer.
- If there are fewer than 4 waiting customers, you will board all of them, still charging `$4` per customer.
- Each rotation costs you `$8` to run the wheel.

Given an array `customers` where `customers[i]` is the number of customers waiting to get on the wheel at each rotation, return the maximum profit you can achieve after each rotation.

If it is impossible to achieve a profit without any customers left waiting, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if the rotations result in a profit of zero?** 
   - We should treat a zero profit as a valid condition.
  
2. **Can customers accumulate over rotations?**
   - Yes, customers can accumulate and wait in line for the next rotations if they are not served due to capacity limits.

3. **Is there a maximum number of rotations allowed?**
   - No, there are no specified maximum rotations allowed.

4. **What should the maximum profit be if there are no customers?**
   - The maximum profit should also take into account the rotations made. If no rotations are made and no customers are present, return `-1`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Initialize variables to track the total number of customers, total profit, current rotation, and the maximum profit seen so far.
   
2. **Simulate each rotation**:
   - For each rotation, determine how many customers can board.
   - Calculate the profit for that rotation.
   - Deduct the cost of running the wheel from the profit.
   - Add any remaining customers to the next rotation.
   - Keep track of the cumulative profit and update the maximum profit and corresponding rotation number.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the maximum profit never becomes positive, return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperationsMaxProfit(std::vector<int>& customers, int boardingCost, int runningCost) {
        int maxProfit = -1, maxRotation = -1;
        int currentRotation = 0, totalCustomers = 0, currentProfit = 0, waitingCustomers = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < customers.size(); i++) {
            waitingCustomers += customers[i];
            
            int customersToBoard = std::min(waitingCustomers, 4);
            waitingCustomers -= customersToBoard;
            
            currentProfit += customersToBoard * boardingCost - runningCost;
            currentRotation++;
            
            if (currentProfit > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = currentProfit;
                maxRotation = currentRotation;
            }
        }
        
        while (waitingCustomers > 0) {
            int customersToBoard = std::min(waitingCustomers, 4);
            waitingCustomers -= customersToBoard;
            
            currentProfit += customersToBoard * boardingCost - runningCost;
            currentRotation++;
            
            if (currentProfit > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = currentProfit;
                maxRotation = currentRotation;
            }
        }
        
        return maxProfit > 0 ? maxRotation : -1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> customers = {8, 3, 8, 3, 4, 5};
    int boardingCost = 4;
    int runningCost = 8;

    int result = sol.minOperationsMaxProfit(customers, boardingCost, runningCost);
    std::cout << "Maximum profit achieved at rotation: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `customers` array plus any additional rotations required to service all customers, because each rotation is processed in constant time.
