[Leetcode 2498. Frog Jump II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2498)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the position of the ith stone along a river. The first stone is at position `stones[0] = 0` and the last stone is at position `stones[n-1]`. A frog is initially on the first stone and wants to reach the last stone. The frog can only jump to the next stone in the array, but the lengths of its jumps can be different.

Find the minimal time `T` such that the frog can get to the last stone by making jumps of at most `T` units of length.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the positions in `stones` sorted in non-decreasing order?**
   Yes, the positions are sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Can the frog skip stones?**
   No, the frog must jump to the next stone in order without skipping any stones.

3. **What is the range of the length of `stones`?**
   The length of the array can go up to 10^4 stones.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal jump length `T` such that the frog can reach the last stone. Since the frog must land on each stone sequentially, we can determine `T` by finding the maximum difference between consecutive stones. This ensures that the frog's longest jump is minimized while still being able to jump between each pair of adjacent stones.

### Code
Here's the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxJump(std::vector<int>& stones) {
        int maxJump = 0;
        for (size_t i = 1; i < stones.size(); ++i) {
            maxJump = std::max(maxJump, stones[i] - stones[i - 1]);
        }
        return maxJump;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize `maxJump` to 0, which will track the maximum difference between any two consecutive stones.
2. **Loop Through Stones:**
   - We iterate through the `stones` array starting from the second element.
   - For each stone, we calculate the difference with the previous stone.
   - We update `maxJump` to be the maximum of its current value and the calculated difference.
3. **Return Result:**
   - After the loop, `maxJump` contains the minimal `T` such that the frog can jump from the first to the last stone.
   
This approach ensures that we only need to traverse the list once, making it efficient.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of stones. This is because we iterate through the list of stones once to find the maximum jump.
