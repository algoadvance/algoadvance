[Leetcode 939. Minimum Area Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l939)
### Problem Statement

Given a set of points in the XY plane represented by a 2D integer array `points` where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes. If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the coordinates for the points?**
   - The coordinates range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

2. **Can the points be duplicated in the input?**
   - The points are unique.

3. **What is the maximum number of points?**
   - The number of points will be at most `5000`.

### Strategy

To find the minimum area of a rectangle, we can take advantage of the following observations:
1. A rectangle can be defined by two of its diagonally opposite corners.
2. If two points form the opposite corners of one diagonal of the rectangle, the other two corners must also be present in the set of points.

With these observations, here's the plan:
1. Use a map to store points for quick lookup.
2. Iterate over each pair of points to check if they can be opposite corners of a rectangle.
3. For each pair of points, check if the other two points required to form the rectangle also exist in the set.
4. Calculate the area of the rectangle each time a valid pair is found and keep track of the minimum area found.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <utility>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

int minAreaRect(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    // Convert the points into a set for O(1) lookup
    unordered_set<long long> pointSet;
    for (const auto& point : points) {
        long long combined = ((long long)point[0] << 32) | (long long)point[1];
        pointSet.insert(combined);
    }

    int minArea = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    int n = points.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
            int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
            
            if (x1 != x2 && y1 != y2) {
                long long point3 = ((long long)x1 << 32) | (long long)y2;
                long long point4 = ((long long)x2 << 32) | (long long)y1;
                
                if (pointSet.count(point3) && pointSet.count(point4)) {
                    int area = abs(x2 - x1) * abs(y2 - y1);
                    minArea = min(minArea, area);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return minArea == numeric_limits<int>::max() ? 0 : minArea;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> points = \{\{1, 1}, {1, 3}, {3, 1}, {3, 3}, {2, 2}};
    cout << "Minimum area rectangle: " << minAreaRect(points) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N^2)`, where `N` is the number of points. This is because we are iterating through each pair of points to check if they can form a rectangle's diagonal. The space complexity is `O(N)` due to the additional storage used for the set to store the points. This approach is efficient enough given the constraints (with a maximum of `5000` points).
