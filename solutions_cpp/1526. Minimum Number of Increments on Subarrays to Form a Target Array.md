[Leetcode 1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1526)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `target`, you want to form an array `arr` which initially contains all zeros, using the following operation in any number of increments:
- Choose a subarray of `arr` and increment each value by one.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to form the `target` array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Length of the target array**: Is there a constraint on the length of the `target` array?
   - **Answer**: The length of `target` is constrained by typical problem constraints, usually up to 10^5 elements.
  
2. **Range of values**: What is the range of values in the `target` array?
   - **Answer**: The values in `target` are positive integers, typically within the range from 1 to 10^5.

3. **Subarrays**: Can the chosen subarray have length 1, i.e., a single element subarray?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the chosen subarray can be of any length including length 1.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, note that each position in the `target` array could require multiple increments due to its final value. Importantly, we only need to keep track of when these increments change.

Here's a step-by-step strategy:
1. Start from an array `arr` initialized to all zeros.
2. Iterate through the `target` array.
3. For each element in the `target`, note the difference from the previous element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, the difference represents how many new operations are needed to reach this element.

This essentially boils down to counting increases in the `target` values relative to their preceding values.

### Code

Here's a succinct implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOperations(std::vector<int>& target) {
        int total_operations = target[0];  // Initialize with the first element value
        for (int i = 1; i < target.size(); ++i) {
            if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
                total_operations += (target[i] - target[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return total_operations;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Start operations count with `target[0]`, because creating the first element itself needs `target[0]` operations.
- **Iteration and Condition**: As we iterate through the array from the second element to the end:
  - For each element `target[i]`, check if it is greater than `target[i-1]`.
  - If so, the difference (`target[i] - target[i-1]`) indicates new operations required to "raise" to the current level.

### Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the `target` array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array to calculate the total required increments. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of additional space.

By focusing on the differences between consecutive elements, we ensure that we are only counting necessary operations, leading to an efficient and clear solution.
