[Leetcode 1409. Queries on a Permutation With Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1409)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an array `queries` of positive integers between `1` and `m`, and an array `P` where `P[i] = i+1` initially (a permutation of the integers from `1` to `m`). For each `query[i]`, process the queries in order starting from the first query (i.e., `queries[0]`) to the last query (i.e., `queries[queries.size() - 1]`):

1. Find the position of `query[i]` in the permutation `P`.
2. Record this position in the answer array.
3. Move `query[i]` to the front of the permutation `P`.

Return an array of `answers` where `answers[i]` is the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Content of `queries` and `m`:**
   - Can `queries` contain duplicate values? 
     - Yes, `queries can contain duplicate values`.
   - What are the constraints for `m` and the length of `queries`?
     - The constraints are: `1 <= m <= 10^3` and `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`.

2. **Permutations:**
   - Is `P` fixed only based on `m` initially and modified subsequently for each query?
     - Yes, `P` starts as a permutation of integers from `1` to `m`.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a list `P` starting from `[1, 2, ..., m]`.
   
2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query in `queries`, find the index of `query[i]` in the list `P`.
   - Record this index (considered as 1-based for the result).
   - Move the element at this index to the front of the list `P`.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Utilize an efficient search and insert operation to handle up to `10,000` queries on a list of size `1,000`.
   - Direct list operations should be manageable within the given constraints, albeit the worst-case time complexity per query could be `O(m)` in linear search operations.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> processQueries(const std::vector<int>& queries, int m) {
    std::vector<int> P(m);
    std::vector<int> result;

    // Initialize the permutation P
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        P[i] = i + 1;
    }

    // Process each query
    for (int query : queries) {
        // Find the position of query in the permutation
        auto it = std::find(P.begin(), P.end(), query);
        int position = it - P.begin();

        // Record the 1-based position
        result.push_back(position + 1);

        // Move the element to the front
        P.erase(it);
        P.insert(P.begin(), query);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- The worst-case time complexity of the provided solution is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the size of the permutation and `n` is the size of the `queries`. This is because for each query we might need to scan `m` elements and we have `n` queries to process.
- Given the constraints, this approach should work within a feasible time for practical test cases on LeetCode.

### Summary:

This solution efficiently processes the queries by leveraging direct operations on the vector `P`. Utilizing the capabilities of C++ Standard Template Library (STL) functions like `std::find`, `erase`, and `insert`, our solution maintains readability and leverages existing functionalities.
