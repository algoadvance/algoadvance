[Leetcode 2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2581)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected tree consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n. A tree is a simple connected graph with no cycles. You are also given an array of subtrees where each subtree is represented as a list of integers, denoting the node labels in that subtree. Determine the number of nodes that can be the root of the original tree.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the number of nodes n and the subtrees?**
   - The constraints could greatly influence the approach we take (e.g., brute force vs. optimized solutions).

2. **Is the input guaranteed to be a valid tree?**
   - This helps us ensure our assumptions are correct about connectivity and no cycles.

3. **How is the tree and subtree information provided?**
   - This will help us design the input parsing part of the solution.

4. **What is the size of the array representing subtrees?**
   - Knowing this can help tailor our solution to be more efficient.

Let's assume the problem has some typical constraints, such as \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and each subtree has at least one node.

## Strategy

1. **Represent the Tree:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree since it's more efficient for sparse matrices.

2. **Simulate Subtrees:**
   - For each subtree, convert it to a set for efficient membership checking.

3. **Check Possible Roots:**
   - A node can be a root if it can form all given subtrees as connected components starting from that node. This involves checking if the subtree's nodes form a connected component in the BFS or DFS traversal from the node.

4. **Edges Case Considerations:**
   - If a node is not connected to all nodes in a subtree, it can’t be a root.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFormSubtree(int root, const unordered_set<int>& subtree, const unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& tree) {
        queue<int> q;
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        
        q.push(root);
        visited.insert(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for (int neighbor : tree.at(node)) {
                if (!visited.count(neighbor)) {
                    if (subtree.count(neighbor) > 0) { // Neighbor should be part of subtree
                        q.push(neighbor);
                        visited.insert(neighbor);
                    } else if (subtree.count(node) > 0) { // Current node should be part of subtree
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Ensure all nodes in subtree were visited (subtree is connected)
        for (int node : subtree) {
            if (!visited.count(node)) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    int rootCount(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<vector<int>>& subtrees) {
        // Build the tree
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> tree;
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Convert subtrees to sets for efficient checking
        vector<unordered_set<int>> subtreeSets(subtrees.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < subtrees.size(); ++i) {
            for (int node : subtrees[i]) {
                subtreeSets[i].insert(node);
            }
        }
        
        int possibleRoots = 0;
        
        // Check each node if it can be the root
        for (int root = 1; root <= n; ++root) {
            bool isRootPossible = true;
            for (const auto& subtree : subtreeSets) {
                if (!canFormSubtree(root, subtree, tree)) {
                    isRootPossible = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isRootPossible) ++possibleRoots;
        }
        
        return possibleRoots;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Tree Building: O(n)**
  - Constructing the adjacency list from the edges.

- **Root Checking (for each node):** O(n * (V + E))
  - We potentially perform a graph traversal (BFS/DFS) from each node for each subtree.
  - Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Since it's a tree, E ≈ n.
  
Thus, the overall complexity can be approximated as \(O(n^2)\), which should be efficient enough for \(n \leq 10^3\) but might need optimization for larger values.
