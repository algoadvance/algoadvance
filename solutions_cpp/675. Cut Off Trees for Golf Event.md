[Leetcode 675. Cut Off Trees for Golf Event](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l675)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D grid. Each cell of the grid represents a tree with a certain height or an empty cell (represented by `0` - impassable).

You are initially positioned at the cell (0, 0). You can move left, right, up, or down. You need to cut off all the trees in order of their height (from smallest to tallest). In one step, you can move to an adjacent cell if it is not blocked (i.e., not `0`).

You might be asked to return the minimum number of steps you need to take to cut off all the trees. If you can't do it, return -1.

Example input:
```
forest = [
  [1,2,3],
  [0,0,4],
  [7,6,5]
]
```
Example output: 6

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be negative numbers in the grid? 
   - No, only non-negative integers.
2. What should be done if there are multiple trees with the same height? 
   - It is assumed there won't be any timing conflicts based on the problem description.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int cutOffTree(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& forest) {
        std::vector<std::tuple<int, int, int>> trees;
        int rows = forest.size();
        int cols = forest[0].size();

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c) {
                if (forest[r][c] > 1) {
                    trees.emplace_back(forest[r][c], r, c);
                }
            }
        }
        
        std::sort(trees.begin(), trees.end());

        int sx = 0, sy = 0;
        int total_steps = 0;

        for (auto& tree : trees) {
            int tx, ty, height;
            std::tie(height, tx, ty) = tree;
            int steps = bfs(forest, sx, sy, tx, ty);
            if (steps == -1) return -1;
            total_steps += steps;
            sx = tx;
            sy = ty;
        }

        return total_steps;
    }

private:
    int bfs(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& forest, int start_x, int start_y, int target_x, int target_y) {
        if (start_x == target_x && start_y == target_y) return 0;
        
        int rows = forest.size();
        int cols = forest[0].size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        std::vector<std::vector<bool>> visited(rows, std::vector<bool>(cols, false));
        
        std::queue<std::tuple<int, int, int>> q;
        q.emplace(start_x, start_y, 0);
        visited[start_x][start_y] = true;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y, steps] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0];
                int ny = y + dir[1];

                if (nx < 0 || nx >= rows || ny < 0 || ny >= cols || forest[nx][ny] == 0 || visited[nx][ny]) {
                    continue;
                }

                if (nx == target_x && ny == target_y) {
                    return steps + 1;
                }

                visited[nx][ny] = true;
                q.emplace(nx, ny, steps + 1);
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Strategy
1. **Tree Collection and Sorting**: Collect all tree cells and sort them by height.
2. **BFS for Shortest Path**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the current position to the target tree.
3. **Path Calculation**: Accumulate steps required to reach each tree in ascending order of their heights.
4. **Early Exit**: If any tree cannot be reached, return -1 immediately.

## Time Complexity
1. **Tree Collection and Sorting**: O(m*n*log(m*n)), where `m` and `n` are the rows and columns of the matrix/grid.
2. **BFS for Path Calculation**: Since BFS iterates over all potentially reachable cells, in the worst case, each BFS has a time complexity of O(m*n).
3. **Total Complexity**: O(m*n*log(m*n) + k*(m*n)), where `k` is the number of trees that need to be cut. Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by O(m*n*(log(m*n) + k)) with `k` being `O(m*n)`.

This approach ensures we handle both the sorting of heights and shortest path calculations optimally given the grid constraints.
