[Leetcode 2439. Minimize Maximum of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2439)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` comprising `n` non-negative integers. In one operation, you must:

1. Choose an integer `i` such that `1 <= i < n` and `nums[i] > 0`.
2. Decrease `nums[i]` by 1.
3. Increase `nums[i-1]` by 1.

Your goal is to perform the above operation any number of times such that the maximum value in the array `nums` is minimized.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer of `nums` after performing any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` have all zeros initially?**
   - Yes, `nums` can have all zeros, and in that case, the maximum value is already minimized.
  
2. **Will the array always contain at least two elements?**
   - The array may have any number of non-negative integers, starting from one element upwards.

3. **What is the range of the values within `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints are given that may range from `0` to some maximum value like `10^9`.

4. **Is there a limit to the number of operations you can perform?**
   - No, there’s no explicit limit on the number of operations.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to leverage binary search combined with a greedy approach. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Binary Search Approach**:
    - We apply binary search to find the minimum maximum value, `mid`, such that it is feasible to distribute the values in the array `nums` within `mid`.

2. **Greedy Check**:
    - For the mid value determined by binary search, simulate the array adjustments to check if it’s feasible to make every element less than or equal to `mid`.

Steps:
- Initialize `low` as the smallest value in `nums` and `high` as the largest value in `nums`.
- While `low <= high`, compute `mid`.
- For each element in `nums` from right to left:
  - Check if `nums[i]` is greater than `mid`, if so, try to reduce `nums[i]` and shift the difference to `nums[i-1]`.
- If all values can be reduced to within `mid`, adjust the binary search bounds accordingly.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isFeasible(const std::vector<int>& nums, int maxVal) {
        // Work on a copy of the array 
        std::vector<long long> temp(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = temp.size() - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            if (temp[i] > maxVal) {
                long long excess = temp[i] - maxVal;
                temp[i] -= excess;
                temp[i - 1] += excess;
            }
        }
        return temp[0] <= maxVal;
    }

    int minimizeArrayValue(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = *std::min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int high = *std::max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int result = high;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (isFeasible(nums, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Time Complexity**: \(O(\log(max(\text{nums})))\)
- **Feasibility Check Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for each binary search iteration
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot \log(max(\text{nums})))\)

This combines the binary search with the greedy check approach to ensure we efficiently find the minimized maximum value of the array.
