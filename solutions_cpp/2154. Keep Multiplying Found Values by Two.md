[Leetcode 2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2154)
## Problem Statement

You're given an integer array `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is the starting value. Your task is to find if the value `original` exists in the `nums` array. If it does, multiply the `original` value by two and repeat the process until the value `original` is no longer present in `nums`. Return the final value of `original`.

### Example
1. Input: `nums = [5,3,6,1,12]`, `original = 3`
   Output: `24`

2. Input: `nums = [2,7,9]`, `original = 4`
   Output: `4`

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Should we modify the `nums` array or keep it intact?**
   - A: You should keep the `nums` array intact.
   
2. **Q: Are the elements in the `nums` array unique or can they be duplicated?**
   - A: The elements can be duplicated.

## Strategy

1. **Utilize a Set:**
   - Convert the `nums` array to a `set` to allow O(1) time complexity checks for the presence of values.
   
2. **Iteration:**
   - Perform a loop where you check if the `original` value exists in the set.
   - If it does, multiply `original` by 2 and continue.
   - If it doesn't, break the loop and return the current value of `original`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int findFinalValue(std::vector<int>& nums, int original) {
    std::unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    while (numSet.find(original) != numSet.end()) {
        original *= 2;
    }
    
    return original;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Conversion from `vector` to `set`:**
   - O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
   
2. **While Loop:**
   - In the worst case, the value of `original` could double up to the maximum value possible within the integer range. However, practically, the loop will run for a limited number of iterations due to the constraints provided.

Overall, the time complexity can be considered O(n) for most practical purposes, considering the conversion to set and membership checking form the bulk of the operations.
