[Leetcode 1750. Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1750)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, you are allowed to delete characters from the start or the end of the string. Return the minimum length of the resulting string after performing this operation as many times as you want. You must delete equal characters that are adjacent to the ends of the string.

### Example:
- Input: s = "aabccabba"
- Output: 3
  - Explanation: Delete "aa" and "bb", the string becomes "cba", which has a length of 3.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the characters be deleted only once from both ends in one operation?
   - Yes, you can delete the same characters appearing from both ends only once in one operation.

2. Are empty strings or strings with a single type of character valid as inputs?
   - Yes, any string of non-zero length can be an input.

## Strategy
Observe that characters that are the same and adjacent to both the start and the end of the string can be deleted repetitively. We need to count and remove such matching characters from both ends until we no longer find matches.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Use two pointers approach:
   - One pointer starting from the beginning of the string (`left`).
   - Another pointer starting from the end of the string (`right`).
2. Compare characters at these pointers.
3. If the characters are the same, move the pointers inward and continue this until the characters differ.
4. Finally, compute the remaining string length as `right - left + 1`.

### Implementation in C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minimumLength(std::string s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.length() - 1;
    
    while (left < right && s[left] == s[right]) {
        char currentChar = s[left];
        
        // Move left pointer inward
        while (left <= right && s[left] == currentChar) {
            left++;
        }
        
        // Move right pointer inward
        while (right >= left && s[right] == currentChar) {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return right - left + 1;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "aabccabba";
    std::cout << "Minimum length of the string after deletions: " << minimumLength(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are potentially scanning through the entire string with the two pointers but only in one pass.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This algorithm is efficient given the constraints and ensures that we're correctly minimizing the string by removing the same characters from both ends repeatedly.
