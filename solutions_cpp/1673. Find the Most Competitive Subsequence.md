[Leetcode 1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1673)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (or none) elements from the array, while keeping the relative order of the remaining elements.

A subsequence `a` is more competitive than a subsequence `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, subsequence `a` has a number less than the corresponding number in `b`. 

Return the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]

Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
Output: [2,3,3,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `nums` contain negative numbers or zero?
   **A:** Yes, `nums` can contain any integers.
2. **Q:** What is the range of values for `k`?
   **A:** `k` is a positive integer and `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a monotonic stack approach to build the competitive subsequence. The stack will always contain the current most competitive subsequence of the desired length.

1. **Initialize an empty stack** to keep track of the most competitive subsequence.
2. **Iterate through the array** `nums`. For each element `nums[i]`:
   - If the stack is not empty, and the current element `nums[i]` is smaller than the top element of the stack, and removing the top element will still allow us to pick enough elements from the remaining array to form a subsequence of length `k`, we pop the top element.
   - Push the current element `nums[i]` onto the stack.
3. **Ensure that the stack's size does not exceed `k`** at any point.
4. After processing all elements, the first `k` elements of the stack will be the result.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::vector<int> mostCompetitive(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::vector<int> stack;
    int n = nums.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // while stack not empty, last element in stack is larger than nums[i] 
        // and we can remove it while still being able to take enough elements
        while (!stack.empty() && stack.back() > nums[i] && stack.size() + (n - i) > k) {
            stack.pop_back();
        }
        // add current element to stack if it is less than k
        if (stack.size() < k) {
            stack.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
    }

    return stack;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k), where `k` is the size of the desired subsequence, as the stack can grow up to size `k`.

This solution efficiently builds the most competitive subsequence by leveraging a stack-based approach to maintain the desired order and size constraints.
