[Leetcode 1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1497)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, you need to check if the array can be divided into pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the array length be odd?**
   - No, the array length must be even for it to be divided completely into pairs.

2. **What is the range of values for `k` and the elements in the array?**
   - The values of `k` and the array elements are typically within the range of typical 32-bit integers, but this should be confirmed against problem constraints if any.

3. **Are there any special cases to consider?**
   - If `k` is zero, the problem should likely be discarded as division by zero is undefined. Each pair's sum must be divisible by `k`, so handling remainders is key.

### Strategy:

1. **Remainder Buckets:**
   - Compute the remainder of each element when divided by `k`.
   - Use a map or an array to store counts of each remainder.

2. **Pairing Strategy:**
   - For a pair `(a, b)` to be valid, `(a + b) % k == 0`.
   - This implies `a % k` and `b % k` should sum to `k` (or both can be zero).

3. **Check Counts:**
   - For remainder `0`, the count must be even as they have to pair among themselves.
   - For any other remainder `r`, the count of `r` must be equal to the count of `k - r`.

   This ensures that all elements can be paired appropriately to satisfy the condition.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

bool canArrange(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    unordered_map<int, int> remainder_count;
    
    // Calculate the remainder frequencies
    for (int num : arr) {
        int remainder = ((num % k) + k) % k; // Handling negative numbers correctly
        remainder_count[remainder]++;
    }
    
    // Check pair conditions
    for (const auto& entry : remainder_count) {
        int rem = entry.first;
        int count = entry.second;
        
        // Special case for remainder 0
        if (rem == 0) {
            if (count % 2 != 0) return false;
        } else {
            // There must be same number of `rem` and `k - rem`
            if (remainder_count[rem] != remainder_count[k - rem]) return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse through the array once to populate the remainder counts which is \(O(n)\).
  - We then check the pairing conditions which, in the worst case, can be considered \(O(n)\) if all unique remainders are checked.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\)
  - The remainder map can have at most `k` keys.

This solution should be efficient and works within the constraints commonly provided for such problems on LeetCode.
