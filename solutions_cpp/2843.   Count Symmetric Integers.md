[Leetcode 2843.   Count Symmetric Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2843)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers, `low` and `high`. A symmetric integer is an integer that reads the same both forward and backward (i.e., a palindrome). Your task is to count the number of symmetric integers between `low` and `high`, inclusive.

For example, if `low` is 10 and `high` is 150, there are several symmetric integers such as 11, 22, etc., up to 121.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of inputs**:
   - What are the constraints on `low` and `high`?
   - Are the values of `low` and `high` guaranteed to be non-negative and non-zero?

2. **Edge cases**:
   - What happens if `low` is equal to `high`?
   - Do we need to consider single-digit numbers as symmetric integers?

## Plan

1. **Iterate through each number:** Iterate through each number from `low` to `high`.
2. **Check for symmetry:** For each number, convert it to a string and check if it is a palindrome.
3. **Count symmetric integers:** Maintain a counter to count all the symmetric integers.

## Strategy

1. Use a loop to iterate from `low` to `high`.
2. Convert each number to a string.
3. Check if the string is the same forwards and backwards.
4. If a number is symmetric, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter after the loop ends.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is **O(N * k)**, where `N` is the number of integers between `low` and `high`, and `k` is the average number of digits in the integers. Converting a number to a string and checking if it is a palindrome both take **O(k)** time.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int countSymmetricIntegers(int low, int high) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = low; i <= high; ++i) {
            if (isSymmetric(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

private:
    bool isSymmetric(int num) {
        std::string s = std::to_string(num);
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.size() - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int low = 10;
    int high = 150;
    std::cout << "Number of symmetric integers: " << sol.countSymmetricIntegers(low, high) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Class Definition:** We define a class `Solution` with two member functions.
2. **countSymmetricIntegers:** This method iterates from `low` to `high` and uses the `isSymmetric` helper method to check if a number is a palindrome. It keeps a count of symmetric integers.
3. **isSymmetric:** This helper method converts an integer to a string and checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.
4. **Main Function:** We instantiate the `Solution` class and call the `countSymmetricIntegers` method with the sample `low` and `high` values, then print the result.

This solution ensures all numbers in the given range are checked, and only the symmetric ones are counted.
