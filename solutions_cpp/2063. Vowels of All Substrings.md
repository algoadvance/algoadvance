[Leetcode 2063. Vowels of All Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2063)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `word`, consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to return the total number of vowels (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') in all possible substrings of the given string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the expected length range of the input string?
   - **A**: The length of the input string `word` will be between 1 and 10^5.

2. **Q**: Should uppercase vowels be considered?
   - **A**: No, the problem specifies that the input string consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Q**: Are there any special characters or whitespace in the input string?
   - **A**: No, the problem states that the string only contains lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, consider the contribution of each character to the total number of vowels in all possible substrings. Hereâ€™s a strategic breakdown:

1. **Understanding Character Contribution**:
    - Each character in a string influences several substrings. For any character at position `i` (0-indexed), it can be part of substrings starting from any of the previous characters up to itself.
    - Specifically, the number of substrings in which a character at position `i` appears can be calculated as `(i + 1) * (n - i)`, where `n` is the length of the string. 

2. **Counting Vowels**:
    - If the character is a vowel, add its contribution `(i + 1) * (n - i)` to the total count.

By focusing on the positions and contributions, we avoid generating all possible substrings directly, leading to an efficient solution.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long countVowelSubstrings(string word) {
        unordered_set<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
        long long totalCount = 0;
        int n = word.length();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (vowels.count(word[i]) > 0) {
                totalCount += (i + 1) * (n - i);
            }
        }
        
        return totalCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string word;
    cout << "Enter the string: ";
    cin >> word;
    cout << "Total vowels in all substrings: " << solution.countVowelSubstrings(word) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The provided algorithm runs in linear time, `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `word`. This is efficient given the constraints, since each character is processed exactly once. The space complexity is `O(1)`, since the additional space used by the `unordered_set` of vowels and a few auxiliary variables does not scale with the input size.
