[Leetcode 326. Power of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l326)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, write a function to determine if it is a power of three. An integer `n` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input integer `n`?**
   - **Assume**: `n` can be any 32-bit signed integer, which means it can range from `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.

2. **Can the input `n` be negative or zero?**
   - **Yes**, the input can be negative or zero.

3. **What should be returned for negative numbers and zero?**
   - Any non-positive number should return `false`, as powers of three are positive numbers.

4. **Is there any constraint on time complexity?**
   - Preferably, the solution should be efficient enough to handle the range mentioned (i.e., `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`).

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: If `n` is less than or equal to zero, return `false` immediately, since powers of three are always positive.
   
2. **Iterative Solution**: Iterate to divide `n` by 3 continuously:
   - While `n` is greater than 1, check if `n` is divisible by 3.
   - If it isn't, return `false` because `n` cannot be a power of three.
   - Divide `n` by 3 and continue the loop.
   - If the loop completes and `n` is reduced to 1, return `true`.

3. **Alternative Approach (Mathematical)**: Use logarithms to determine if `n `is a power of three:
   - If `n` is positive, compute `log(n) / log(3)`. If the result is an integer, then `n` is a power of three.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the iterative approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    while (n % 3 == 0) {
        n /= 3;
    }
    return n == 1;
}

int main() {
    int test1 = 27;   // Expected: true (3^3)
    int test2 = 0;    // Expected: false
    int test3 = 9;    // Expected: true (3^2)
    int test4 = 45;   // Expected: false

    cout << std::boolalpha;
    cout << "Is " << test1 << " a power of three? " << isPowerOfThree(test1) << endl;
    cout << "Is " << test2 << " a power of three? " << isPowerOfThree(test2) << endl;
    cout << "Is " << test3 << " a power of three? " << isPowerOfThree(test3) << endl;
    cout << "Is " << test4 << " a power of three? " << isPowerOfThree(test4) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Iterative Approach**: `O(log3(n))`, where `log3` is the logarithm base 3. This is because in each iteration, we divide `n` by 3. The number of divisions needed is proportional to `log3(n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, no extra space required other than variables.

This method ensures that we efficiently determine whether `n` is a power of three, taking into account all edge cases, including negative numbers and zero.
