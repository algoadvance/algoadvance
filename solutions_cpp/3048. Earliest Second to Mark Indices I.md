[Leetcode 3048. Earliest Second to Mark Indices I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3048)
## Problem Statement

You have a 2D grid `mat` of size `m x n` where every cell in `mat` is either `0` (unmarked) or `1` (marked). You want to know the earliest second at which all `0`s are converted into `1`s. Cells in the grid are updated according to the following rules:
- A `1` in cell `(i, j)` will convert all its adjacent unmarked cells (`0`s) into `1`s.
- The conversion takes place every second.

Return the earliest second at which all cells are marked.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
At the start, only the center cell is marked.
At the 1st second, it marks the adjacent cells.
At the 2nd second, all remaining `0`s are marked.
```

### Constraints:
- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid have multiple initially marked cells?**
   - Yes, the grid can have multiple `1`s initially.

2. **What will be returned if the grid is initially full of `1`s?**
   - The result should be `0` as all cells are already marked.

3. **Will the grid always have at least one `1` initially?**
   - Yes, the constraints imply there will always be a marked cell initially.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Utilize BFS to propagate the marking from initial `1`s since BFS explores neighbor nodes level-by-level, which naturally fits the problem where cells are updated every second.
   
2. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize a queue with all initially marked cells (`1`s) and set the level (time) as `0`.
   - For each cell in the queue, mark all its adjacent cells and add them to the queue.
   - Continue this process until all cells are marked.
   - Return the maximum time taken to mark all cells.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is `O(m * n)` because each cell is processed once.
   - The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the BFS queue and visited cells.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int earliestTimeToMarkAll(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        int cellsToMark = 0;

        // Enqueue all initially marked cells
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    q.push({i, j});
                } else {
                    cellsToMark++;
                }
            }
        }

        if (cellsToMark == 0) return 0; // All cells are already marked

        int seconds = 0;
        vector<int> dirX = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
        vector<int> dirY = {0, 0, -1, 1};

        while (!q.empty() && cellsToMark > 0) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                auto [x, y] = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d) {
                    int newX = x + dirX[d];
                    int newY = y + dirY[d];
                    if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && mat[newX][newY] == 0) {
                        mat[newX][newY] = 1;
                        q.push({newX, newY});
                        cellsToMark--;
                    }
                }
            }
            seconds++;
        }

        return seconds;
    }
};
```

This code accurately implements the BFS approach to solve the problem of marking all cells in the shortest time based on the rules provided.
