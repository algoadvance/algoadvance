[Leetcode 771. Jewels and Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l771)
### Problem Statement

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

**Example 1:**
```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `jewels` or `stones` be empty?**
   - Yes, it is possible for either string to be empty. In such cases, the result should be zero.

2. **Can `jewels` or `stones` contain characters other than letters?**
   - For the purpose of the problem as described, `jewels` and `stones` will only contain alphabetic characters (case-sensitive).

3. **What is the maximum length of `jewels` and `stones`?**
   - Typically, LeetCode problems handle strings up to length of 50 or as specified, but we will assume lengths up to 50 characters unless otherwise constrained.

### Strategy
1. Use a hash set to store all the characters found in `jewels` for constant time lookup.
2. Iterate through the `stones` string and count how many characters are found in the hash set.

### Time Complexity
- Creating the hash set from `jewels` will take O(m) time where `m` is the length of `jewels`.
- Iterating through the `stones` string and checking membership in the hash set will take O(n) time where `n` is the length of `stones`.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m + n).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int numJewelsInStones(std::string jewels, std::string stones) {
    std::unordered_set<char> jewelSet(jewels.begin(), jewels.end());
    int count = 0;
    
    for (char stone : stones) {
        if (jewelSet.find(stone) != jewelSet.end()) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string jewels = "aA";
    std::string stones = "aAAbbbb";
    std::cout << "Number of jewels in stones: " << numJewelsInStones(jewels, stones) << std::endl;  // Output: 3

    std::string jewels2 = "z";
    std::string stones2 = "ZZ";
    std::cout << "Number of jewels in stones: " << numJewelsInStones(jewels2, stones2) << std::endl;  // Output: 0

    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `numJewelsInStones` which takes two strings `jewels` and `stones`, and returns the number of stones that are also jewels. It leverages an unordered set for efficient look-up of jewel characters and iterates through each stone to check for membership in the jewel set, maintaining an overall O(m + n) time complexity.
