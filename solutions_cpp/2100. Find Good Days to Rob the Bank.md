[Leetcode 2100. Find Good Days to Rob the Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2100)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `security` where `security[i]` is the number of guards on duty on the `i-th` day. You are also given an integer `time`.

A day is considered a good day to rob the bank if:
- For the last `time` days (inclusive) leading up to the day, the number of guards has never increased.
- For the next `time` days (inclusive) following the day, the number of guards has never decreased.

More formally, this means:
- `security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i]`
- `security[i] <= security[i + 1] <= ... <= security[i + time]`

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The returned days should be sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Boundaries**: What are the minimum and maximum values for elements in `security` and for `time`?
2. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle scenarios where calculating the leading up or following days is not feasible, for example, when `time` is greater than or equal to the length of `security`?
3. **Performance**: Any specific performance requirements or constraints to handle the maximum possible input sizes efficiently?

### Strategy
1. **Observation**: We need to create two helper arrays, `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing`.
   - `non_increasing[i]` will be the number of consecutive days up to day `i` where the guards haven't increased.
   - `non_decreasing[i]` will be the number of consecutive days after day `i` where the guards don't decrease.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute the `non_increasing` array by iterating from left to right.
   - Compute the `non_decreasing` array by iterating from right to left.
   - A day `i` is a valid robbery day if `non_increasing[i] >= time` and `non_decreasing[i] >= time`.

3. **Implementation**:
   - First, compute the `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing` arrays.
   - Iterate through the list and find all valid days based on the conditions.

### Time Complexity
The solution requires two passes through the `security` list to build the helper arrays and one final pass to collect valid days. Hence, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of days in the `security` list.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> goodDaysToRobBank(vector<int>& security, int time) {
    int n = security.size();
    vector<int> non_increasing(n, 0);
    vector<int> non_decreasing(n, 0);
    
    // Fill the non_increasing array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (security[i] <= security[i - 1]) {
            non_increasing[i] = non_increasing[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Fill the non_decreasing array
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (security[i] <= security[i + 1]) {
            non_decreasing[i] = non_decreasing[i + 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Collect valid days
    vector<int> good_days;
    for (int i = time; i < n - time; ++i) {
        if (non_increasing[i] >= time && non_decreasing[i] >= time) {
            good_days.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    return good_days;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **non_increasing Array**: Tracks for each day `i`, the number of consecutive days upto `i` where the number of guards is non-increasing.
2. **non_decreasing Array**: Tracks for each day `i`, the number of consecutive days after `i` where the number of guards is non-decreasing.
3. **Valid Days Check**: Iterate over each day and check if both conditions specified in the problem statement are met.

This approach ensures we only traverse the list a few times, keeping the solution efficient and straightforward.
