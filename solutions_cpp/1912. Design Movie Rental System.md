[Leetcode 1912. Design Movie Rental System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1912)
### Problem Statement

You have the implementation details for a Movie Rental System. The system should support the following functionalities:

1. **Add Movie**: Add a new movie to the system with a unique movie ID, shop ID, and rental price.
2. **Search Movies by Price**: Given a movie name, find the top `k` movie rental shops sorted by price in ascending order.
3. **Rent a Movie**: Rent a movie given its shop ID and movie ID.
4. **Return a Movie**: Return a previously rented movie to the shop.
5. **Report Rented Movies**: Report the top `k` rented movies sorted by their rental time.

The implementation should be efficient and able to handle large datasets.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Unique Identifiers**: Are both movie ID and shop ID globally unique across all movies and shops?
2. **Rental Operations**: Should we maintain a history of rented movies or only the current state (rented or not)?
3. **Tie-breaking**: In case of ties by price, how do we handle sorting further?
4. **Concurrency**: Is this system intended to handle concurrent requests?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <map>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class MovieRentalSystem {
private:
    struct Movie {
        int movieId;
        int shopId;
        int price;
        bool operator<(const Movie& other) const {
            if (price == other.price) {
                if (shopId == other.shopId) {
                    return movieId < other.movieId;
                }
                return shopId < other.shopId;
            }
            return price < other.price;
        }
    };
    
    struct RentedMovie {
        int movieId;
        int shopId;
        bool operator<(const RentedMovie& other) const {
            if (shopId == other.shopId) {
                return movieId < other.movieId;
            }
            return shopId < other.shopId;
        }
    };
    
    map<string, set<Movie>> movieList; // movie name -> available movies sorted by price
    set<Movie> rentedMovies;  // rented movies sorted by price
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> shopMoviePrices; // shopId -> (movieId -> price)
    
public:
    MovieRentalSystem() {}
    
    void addMovie(int movieId, int shopId, int price, const string& movieName) {
        Movie newMovie = { movieId, shopId, price };
        movieList[movieName].insert(newMovie);
        shopMoviePrices[shopId][movieId] = price;
    }
    
    void rentMovie(int shopId, int movieId, const string& movieName) {
        int price = shopMoviePrices[shopId][movieId];
        Movie rented = { movieId, shopId, price };
        movieList[movieName].erase(rented);
        rentedMovies.insert(rented);
    }
    
    void returnMovie(int shopId, int movieId, const string& movieName) {
        int price = shopMoviePrices[shopId][movieId];
        Movie rented = { movieId, shopId, price };
        rentedMovies.erase(rented);
        movieList[movieName].insert(rented);
    }
    
    vector<tuple<int, int>> searchMovies(const string& movieName, int k) {
        vector<tuple<int, int>> result;
        for (const auto& movie : movieList[movieName]) {
            if (result.size() >= k) break;
            result.push_back(make_tuple(movie.movieId, movie.shopId));
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    vector<tuple<int, int>> reportRented(int k) {
        vector<tuple<int, int>> result;
        for (const auto& movie : rentedMovies) {
            if (result.size() >= k) break;
            result.push_back(make_tuple(movie.movieId, movie.shopId));
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
    - `movieList`: A map to store available movies, sorted by their price.
    - `rentedMovies`: A set to store rented movies, also sorted by price.
    - `shopMoviePrices`: A map to quickly find the price of a specific movie in a specific shop.

2. **Operations**:
    - `addMovie`: Insert the movie into `movieList` and update `shopMoviePrices`.
    - `rentMovie`: Move the movie from `movieList` to `rentedMovies`.
    - `returnMovie`: Move the movie from `rentedMovies` back to `movieList`.
    - `searchMovies`: Retrieve the top `k` movies based on price.
    - `reportRented`: Retrieve the top `k` rented movies.

### Time Complexity

- **addMovie**: O(logN) for insertion into the set where `N` is the number of movies.
- **rentMovie**: O(logN) for deletion from one set and insertion into another.
- **returnMovie**: O(logN) for deletion from one set and insertion into another.
- **searchMovies**: O(k) where `k` is the number of results to retrieve.
- **reportRented**: O(k) where `k` is the number of results to retrieve.

This strategy ensures that the operations remain efficient by utilizing logarithmic time complexity for insertions and deletions in sorted structures.
