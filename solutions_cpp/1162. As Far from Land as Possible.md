[Leetcode 1162. As Far from Land as Possible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1162)
Sure, let's tackle the leetcode problem 1162: "As Far from Land as Possible". Here’s how we'll break it down:

### Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` grid containing only values `0` (water) and `1` (land). You have to find the distance to the nearest land for every water cell in the grid, and return the maximum distance among them. If there is no land or water in the grid, return `-1`.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan Distance which is defined as: `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start, let’s clarify a few things:

1. **Size of the Grid**: What are the constraints on the size of the grid? (Typically, grid sizes are given in the problem statement, but assuming standard competitive programming limits).
2. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if there is no land (`1`s) in the grid or no water (`0`s)? (From the problem, we know it should return `-1`).

### Strategy
The problem can be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is excellent for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this one.

### Steps:
1. **Identify Land Cells**: Start by identifying all land cells and push them into a queue. This way, you treat all land cells as starting points in the BFS.
2. **BFS from All Land Cells Concurrently**: Perform BFS from all land cells concurrently. Each layer of BFS will effectively compute the Manhattan Distance level by level.
3. **Track the Maximum Distance**: Track the maximum distance encountered during the BFS. This will be the result.

### Code
Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int n = grid.size();
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    
    // Step 1: Add all land cells to the queue
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                q.push({i, j});
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If there is no land or no water in the grid, return -1
    if (q.size() == 0 || q.size() == n * n) return -1;
    
    // Directions for moving in the grid: up, down, left, right
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    int maxDist = -1;
    
    // Step 2: Perform BFS from all land cells
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        maxDist++;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            pair<int, int> cell = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (auto dir : directions) {
                int x = cell.first + dir.first;
                int y = cell.second + dir.second;
                
                // Check boundaries and if the cell is water (0)
                if (x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < n && y < n && grid[x][y] == 0) {
                    grid[x][y] = 1; // Mark as visited
                    q.push({x, y});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxDist;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n^2) to push all land cells into the queue.
- **BFS Traversal**: Each cell is visited once, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^2).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for storing the queue and additional space to keep track of visited nodes.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is also O(n^2). This is efficient given the constraints typically seen in grid problems.
