[Leetcode 3077. Maximum Strength of K Disjoint Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3077)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of integers and an integer `K`, divide the array into `K` disjoint subarrays such that the sum of the maximum elements of these subarrays is maximized. The sum of the chosen elements should be the highest possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the subarrays be of different lengths?**
   - Yes, the subarrays can be of different lengths as long as they are disjoint (do not overlap).

2. **What are the constraints on the array length and the values it contains?**
   - Assume array length \(N\) and \(K\) are up to \(10^5\), and the values in the array can be either positive or negative integers or zero.

3. **Can \(K\) be greater than the length of the array?**
   - No, \(K\) will always be less than or equal to the length of the array \(N\).

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Objective**:
   - We need to split the array such that each subarray has a maximum element, and the sum of these maximum elements across all \(K\) subarrays is maximized.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We can use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum of the maximum elements of \(j\) subarrays ending at or before the \(i\)-th element.

3. **Transition**:
   - To form disjoint subarrays, we should iterate over possible positions where we can end a subarray and begin a new one.
   - For each element, consider the maximum value obtainable by adding it as part of a new subarray ended at that point.

4. **Initialization and Base Cases**:
   - Initialize `dp[i][1]` with the maximum over the first `i` elements for subarray count 1.
   - If not feasible to form the subarrays with fewer elements, the entry should remain negative infinity.

5. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through each possible number of subarrays and each possible termination point of the subarray, considering max contributions.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int findMaxStrength(vector<int>& A, int K) {
    int N = A.size();
    
    // DP table; dp[i][j] will represent maximum sum of max subarray elements
    // for j subarrays using up to the i-th element
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(N + 1, vector<long long>(K + 1, LLONG_MIN));
    
    // Base case: sum of max elements for 0 subarrays is 0
    for (int i = 0; i <= N; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = 0;
    }
    
    for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j) {
        for (int i = j; i <= N; ++i) {
            long long currentMax = LLONG_MIN;
            long long maxSum = LLONG_MIN;
            for (int k = i; k >= j; --k) {
                currentMax = max(currentMax, (long long)A[k - 1]);
                maxSum = max(maxSum, dp[k - 1][j - 1] + currentMax);
            }
            dp[i][j] = maxSum;
        }
    }
    
    return dp[N][K];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int K = 2;

    cout << "Maximum strength of K disjoint subarrays: " << findMaxStrength(A, K) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop** over \(K\) (subarray count): \(O(K)\)
- **Inner Loop** over \(N\) (elements in the array): \(O(N)\)
- **Innermost Loop** for calculating maximum up to each element: \(O(N)\) 

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(K \times N^2)\). Given the constraints, this could be improved by optimizing the DP transitions to avoid redundant calculations. Optimal solution considerations might involve different data structures, but for now, this demonstrates the problem-solving approach.
