[Leetcode 1040. Moving Stones Until Consecutive II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1040)
Certainly! Let's break down the process for addressing the problem "1040. Moving Stones Until Consecutive II."

### Problem Statement
Given an array "stones" of integers representing the positions of stones on a number line, you have two friends who can move stones. In one move, a stone can be removed from the line and placed in another position on the line such that:
1. It occupies a space between two adjacent stones.
2. We form a consecutive sequence of stones.

You need to determine the minimum and maximum number of moves to create a consecutive sequence of stones out of the given positions.

### Clarifying Questions
- Are the stones' positions guaranteed to be unique and sorted in any order?
- Is there any constraint on the number of stones?
- Can we assume that the input array will not be empty?

For this problem, let's assume:
1. The stones' positions are unique but not necessarily sorted.
2. `1 <= stones.length <= 10^4`
3. `0 <= stones[i] <= 10^9`

### Strategy
#### Minimum Moves
- To calculate the minimum moves, we aim to find the smallest window that can contain consecutive stones.
- Sort the positions of stones.
- Use the sliding window technique to find the smallest window where we can shift stones to form a consecutive sequence.

#### Maximum Moves
- The maximum number of moves can be derived by focusing on how to spread the stones as much as possible:
  - Move the end stones to the farthest apart vacant positions after occupying intermediate positions first.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<int> numMovesStonesII(vector<int>& stones) {
    sort(stones.begin(), stones.end());
    
    int n = stones.size();
    int max_gap = stones[n-1] - stones[0] + 1 - n;
    int max_moves = max(max_gap - min(stones[1] - stones[0] - 1, stones[n-1] - stones[n-2] - 1), max_gap - 1);
    
    int min_moves = n;
    int j = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (j < n && stones[j] <= stones[i] + n - 1) {
            j++;
        }
        int already_in_position = j - i;
        if (already_in_position == n - 1 && stones[j-1] - stones[i] == n - 2) {
            min_moves = min(min_moves, 2);
        } else {
            min_moves = min(min_moves, n - already_in_position);
        }
    }

    return {min_moves, max_moves};
}

int main() {
    vector<int> stones = {6, 5, 4, 3, 10};
    vector<int> result = numMovesStonesII(stones);

    cout << "Minimum moves: " << result[0] << endl;
    cout << "Maximum moves: " << result[1] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Maximum moves calculation**:
   - Calculate the total number of gaps using the positions of the first and last stones.
   - Determine the potential gaps from the first to the second and the second last to the last stone.
   - Derive maximum possible moves by choosing to minimize moves on either extreme of the sorted stone positions.

2. **Minimum moves calculation**:
   - Use a sliding window to find the smallest window containing all stones.
   - Keep track of the number of stones already in the window.
   - Adjust moves considering the special case where exactly one move is necessary when n-1 stones are sequential and one stone is distant.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the stones takes `O(n log n)` time.
- Sliding window and other calculations take `O(n)` time.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to sorting.

By following this strategy and using the given code, you can determine the minimum and maximum moves efficiently for aligning stones consecutively.
