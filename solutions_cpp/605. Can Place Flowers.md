[Leetcode 605. Can Place Flowers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l605)
### Problem Statement

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer `n`, return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

### Example
- Example 1: 
    - Input: `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]`, `n = 1`
    - Output: `true`
- Example 2: 
    - Input: `flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1]`, `n = 2`
    - Output: `false`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the values in the flowerbed array only 0's and 1's?**
    - Yes, the array contains only 0's and 1's.
2. **Is the flowerbed array fixed in size or can it be variable?**
    - The size of the flowerbed array can vary.
3. **Is it possible for n to be larger than the length of the flowerbed?**
    - Yes, but in that case, we can immediately return false because we can't plant more flowers than available plots.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we’ll iterate through the `flowerbed` array and look for potential spots where a new flower can be planted while adhering to the no-adjacent-flowers rule. We’ll follow these steps:

1. Traverse the flowerbed array.
2. Check if the current plot and its adjacent plots (previous and next) are empty.
3. If a flower can be planted at the current plot, update the array and increment the count of planted flowers.
4. If the number of flowers planted matches or exceeds `n`, return true.
5. If the end of the array is reached and the number of flowers planted is still less than `n`, return false.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

bool canPlaceFlowers(std::vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int len = flowerbed.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
            // Check if the previous and next positions are 0 or out of bounds
            bool emptyPrev = (i == 0 || flowerbed[i-1] == 0);
            bool emptyNext = (i == len - 1 || flowerbed[i+1] == 0);
            
            if (emptyPrev && emptyNext) {
                // Plant the flower here
                flowerbed[i] = 1;
                count++;
                
                // Check if we have planted enough flowers
                if (count >= n) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count >= n;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the flowerbed array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array to check possible planting spots and update the flowerbed.

### Explanation
1. **Iteration**: We iterate over the flowerbed array checking each plot.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each empty plot (`flowerbed[i] == 0`), we check if the previous (`i-1`) and next (`i+1`) plots are also empty or out of bounds.
3. **Planting**: If both adjacent plots are empty, we plant a flower by setting `flowerbed[i] = 1` and increase the count of planted flowers.
4. **Early Exit**: If at any point the count of planted flowers reaches or exceeds `n`, we return true quickly. If the loop ends and the count is still less than `n`, we return false, as it's not possible to plant the required number of flowers.
