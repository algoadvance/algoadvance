[Leetcode 2081. Sum of k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2081)
## Problem Statement
We need to find the sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers. A k-mirror number is defined as a number that:

1. Is the same when read forwards and backwards in the k-base representation.
2. Is the same in its decimal representation when read forwards and backwards.

Given integers `k` and `n`, the task is to compute the sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Do we need to handle any edge cases, such as if `k` is 2 or very large, affecting the base conversion?
2. Are the k-mirror numbers required to be strictly positive integers?
3. Are there constraints on the values of `k` and `n`? For instance, maximum limits for optimization considerations?

Assuming typical constraints for LeetCode problems:
- \( 2 \leq k \leq 9 \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \)

## Strategy
1. **Palindrome Check**: Develop a helper function to determine if a number is a palindrome in a given base `k`.
2. **Generate k-mirror Numbers**: Sequentially check numbers to see if they satisfy the k-mirror property in both base `k` and base 10.
3. **Sum Calculation**: Maintain a running sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers found.

The algorithm will start checking from the smallest positive integer and will stop when `n` k-mirror numbers have been summed.

### Helper Functions Description:
1. **`isPalindrome`**: Takes a string and checks if it is a palindrome.
2. **`toBase`**: Converts a number to a string representation in base `k`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to convert a number into a string representation in a given base
std::string toBase(int num, int base) {
    std::string baseString = "";
    while (num > 0) {
        int remainder = num % base;
        baseString = std::to_string(remainder) + baseString;
        num /= base;
    }
    return baseString;
}

// Helper function to check if a string is a palindrome
bool isPalindrome(const std::string& s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) return false;
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Main function to find the sum of the first n k-mirror numbers
long long sumOfKMirror(int k, int n) {
    long long sum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int num = 1;
    
    while (count < n) {
        std::string numStr = std::to_string(num);
        if (isPalindrome(numStr)) {
            std::string baseKStr = toBase(num, k);
            if (isPalindrome(baseKStr)) {
                sum += num;
                count++;
            }
        }
        num++;
    }
    
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int k = 2;
    int n = 5;
    std::cout << "Sum of first " << n << " " << k << "-mirror numbers: " << sumOfKMirror(k, n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is derived from:
1. **Base Conversion**: Each conversion takes \(O(\log(\text{num}))\).
2. **Palindrome Check**: Both base 10 and base k string checks take \(O(D)\), where \(D\) is the length of the string.
3. As the algorithm checks numbers sequentially starting from 1, the complexity in the worst case can be estimative but primarily dependent on finding the first `n` k-mirror numbers.

In practical scenarios for constrained inputs (`n` and `k` as specified), the approach should remain efficient.
