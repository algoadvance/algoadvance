[Leetcode 52. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l52)
### Problem Statement

The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` chess queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`? This helps in understanding whether optimization is necessary for very large inputs.
   - Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Should the output be the exact count of distinct solutions?
   
Given that typically `n` ranges from 1 to 9, and `n` is indeed a positive integer:

### Strategy

We need to count the number of valid ways to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This means ensuring no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.

1. **Backtracking**:
   - Use backtracking to try placing queens row by row.
   - For each row, try placing a queen in each column, checking if it's safe according to the rules.
   - Use arrays to track which columns and diagonals are already occupied.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a set to track the columns where queens are placed.
   - Use two sets to track the diagonals: one for the "main" diagonal (row - col) and one for the "anti" diagonal (row + col).

3. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - If `row == n`: All queens are placed, count this as a valid solution.
   - Otherwise, for each column in the current row, check if placing a queen here is valid. If valid, place the queen and move to the next row.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int totalNQueens(int n) {
        std::unordered_set<int> columns;
        std::unordered_set<int> diagonal1;
        std::unordered_set<int> diagonal2;
        return backtrack(0, n, columns, diagonal1, diagonal2);
    }
    
private:
    int backtrack(int row, int n, 
                  std::unordered_set<int>& columns, 
                  std::unordered_set<int>& diagonal1, 
                  std::unordered_set<int>& diagonal2) {
        if (row == n) {
            return 1;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (columns.find(col) != columns.end() ||
                diagonal1.find(row - col) != diagonal1.end() ||
                diagonal2.find(row + col) != diagonal2.end()) {
                continue;
            }
            // Place a queen
            columns.insert(col);
            diagonal1.insert(row - col);
            diagonal2.insert(row + col);
            
            // Move to the next row
            count += backtrack(row + 1, n, columns, diagonal1, diagonal2);
            
            // Remove the queen
            columns.erase(col);
            diagonal1.erase(row - col);
            diagonal2.erase(row + col);
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is approximately \(O(N!)\) due to the fact that the algorithm tries to place a queen in each row and backtracks when a placement leads to no solution.
- **Space complexity** is \(O(N)\) for the sets tracking columns and diagonals.

This should be efficient enough for small to moderate sizes of `n` typically tested in standard interview questions.
