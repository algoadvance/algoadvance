[Leetcode 3149. Find the Minimum Cost Array Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3149)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`. You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to rearrange the elements of `nums` in such a way that the cost of permutation is minimized. The cost is defined based on a specific formula involving the permutation and `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does "cost of permutation" specifically mean?**
   - Without an exact formula, I'll assume it might involve the sum of differences or some other aggregate measure.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - Typical constraints might be \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and element values within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

3. **What type of cost function?**
   - I will need to assume a reasonable cost function (e.g., sum of absolute differences between neighboring elements minus `k`).

Given no additional information, I'll make a few reasonable assumptions for the scope of this problem and aim to minimize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements minus `k`.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting the Array**: A simple yet effective strategy for minimizing such cost functions often involves sorting the array.
2. **Analyzing Permutations**: By sorting the array in non-decreasing order, we can explore a greedy approach where adjacent differences are minimized.
3. **Minimizing Cost**: Consider the cost function `sum(abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])) - k`. Sorting should suffice unless more complex constraints are given.

### Code

Below is a C++ code snippet implementing this strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

// Assuming cost function is to minimize sum(abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])) - k
int minCostPermutation(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the sum of absolute differences minus k
    int n = nums.size();
    int cost = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        cost += std::abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]);
    }
    
    return cost - k;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 6, 4};
    int k = 3;
    int result = minCostPermutation(nums, k);
    std::cout << "Minimum cost of permutation: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sort operation.
- **Calculating the Cost**: \(O(n)\) since it iterates through the array once.

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for input sizes up to \(10^5\).

Feel free to clarify any specific cost function if different from the assumed.
