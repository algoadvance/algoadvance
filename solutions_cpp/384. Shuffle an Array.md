[Leetcode 384. Shuffle an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l384)
### Problem Statement
You need to design a class to shuffle a given array and also be able to reset it to its original configuration. Imagine this functionality as two operations: "shuffle" and "reset". 

Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- `int[] reset()` Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
- `int[] shuffle()` Returns a random shuffling of the array.

### Clarifying Questions
Before jumping into the solution, it's important to clarify the requirements:

1. **Is the array guaranteed to have at least one element?**
   - Typically, yes, but handle edge cases with zero or one element.
   
2. **Should the shuffle be uniformly random?**
   - Yes, each permutation should be equally likely.

3. **Can I use built-in random functions?**
   - Yes, using C++ standard library functions like `std::random_shuffle`.

### Strategy
1. **Store the Original Configuration**:
   - Maintain a copy of the original array so that we can reset to the exact original.

2. **Shuffle Using Fisher-Yates Algorithm**:
   - Fisher-Yates provides an efficient way to generate a random permutation of an array where all permutations are equally likely.

### Code Implementation

Here's how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>  // for std::swap
#include <random>     // for std::default_random_engine
#include <ctime>      // for std::time

class Solution {
private:
    std::vector<int> original;
    std::vector<int> array;

public:
    Solution(std::vector<int>& nums) : original(nums), array(nums) {
        // Seed the random number generator
        std::srand(unsigned(std::time(0)));
    }
    
    std::vector<int> reset() {
        array = original;
        return array;
    }
    
    std::vector<int> shuffle() {
        int n = array.size();
        // Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            int j = std::rand() % (i + 1);
            std::swap(array[i], array[j]);
        }
        return array;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization (`Solution(std::vector<int>& nums)`)**:
   - Store both the original and current arrays.
   - Seed the random number generator.

2. **Reset (`reset()`)**:
   - Simply copy the original array back to the current array and return it.

3. **Shuffle (`shuffle()`)**:
   - Implementing a Fisher-Yates shuffle to ensure a uniform random permutation.
   - Iterate in reverse order, swapping elements with randomly chosen positions.

### Time Complexity
Both operations `reset` and `shuffle` are efficient:

1. **Reset Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - Reset requires copying the array which takes linear time relative to the size of the array.
   
2. **Shuffle Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
   - Fisher-Yates algorithm runs in linear time, with each swap being \( O(1) \).

Thus, the overall performance is optimal for the given operations.
