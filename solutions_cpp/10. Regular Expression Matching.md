[Leetcode 10. Regular Expression Matching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l10)
## Problem Statement

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`, where:
- `.` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

**Example:**

1. `Input: s = "aa", p = "a"`
   `Output: false`
   Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

2. `Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"`
   `Output: true`
   Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

3. `Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"`
   `Output: true`
   Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are strings `s` and `p` always non-empty, or should we handle empty strings as well?
2. Can we assume the patterns and strings consist only of lowercase letters and the characters `.` and `*`?
3. Is there a maximum length constraint on the strings `s` and `p`?

## Strategy

We will employ a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will use a 2D table (or array) `dp` where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a table `dp` with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `p`.
2. `dp[i][j]` will represent whether `s[0..i-1]` matches `p[0..j-1]`.
3. The entry `dp[0][0]` will be `true` because an empty string matches an empty pattern.
4. Fill the table using the following rules:
   - If `p[j-1]` is a regular character (i.e., not `.` or `*`), then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` if the characters match (`s[i-1] == p[j-1]`).
   - If `p[j-1]` is `.`, it matches any character, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If `p[j-1]` is `*`, check the character before `*`:
     - If `p[j-2]` does not match `s[i-1]` and `p[j-2]` is not `.`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]` (consider `*` as matching zero characters).
     - If `p[j-2]` matches `s[i-1]` or `p[j-2]` is `.`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]` or `dp[i-1][j]`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of pattern `p`.
- The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the 2D table.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        int m = s.length();
        int n = p.length();
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(m + 1, vector<bool>(n + 1, false));

        dp[0][0] = true;
        
        // Initialize for patterns with *
        for (int j = 2; j <= n; j++) {
            if (p[j - 1] == '*') {
                dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2];
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (p[j - 1] == '.' || p[j - 1] == s[i - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else if (p[j - 1] == '*') {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2]; // consider zero occurrence of character before *
                    if (p[j - 2] == '.' || p[j - 2] == s[i - 1]) {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j]; // consider if one or more occur
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to build up the results in a bottom-up manner. Each entry in the `dp` table is filled based on the conditions described, ensuring that we consider all possible ways to match the input string with the given pattern.
