[Leetcode 539. Minimum Time Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l539)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Do the time points always include valid times, i.e., formatted properly and within the 24-hour bounds?
   - How large can the list of time points be?
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the result strictly be an integer representing the minimum difference in minutes?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- Time points are always valid and formatted correctly.
- The maximum number of time points is reasonably small, within a few thousand.

### Strategy
1. **Convert Time Points to Minutes**:
   Each time is in "HH:MM" format. Convert each time to the total number of minutes since 00:00.
   
2. **Sort Time Points**:
   Sort the list of times represented in minutes.
   
3. **Calculate Differences**:
   Iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between consecutive time points.
   
4. **Consider Circular Difference**:
   Since the clock wraps around, also consider the difference between the first and the last time (plus a wrap-around).

### Code

Here's the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDifference(vector<string>& timePoints) {
        auto getMinutes = [](const string &time) -> int {
            int hours = stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
            int minutes = stoi(time.substr(3, 2));
            return hours * 60 + minutes;
        };

        vector<int> minutes;
        for (const auto& time : timePoints) {
            minutes.push_back(getMinutes(time));
        }

        sort(minutes.begin(), minutes.end());
        
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        for (size_t i = 1; i < minutes.size(); ++i) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1]);
        }

        // Circular difference (first and last elements wrap)
        int wrapAroundDiff = (1440 - minutes.back()) + minutes.front();
        minDiff = min(minDiff, wrapAroundDiff);

        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Conversion of times to minutes**: O(n)
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **Calculating minimum differences**: O(n)

Overall, the algorithm runs in O(n log n) time due to the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the minute representations of the times.
