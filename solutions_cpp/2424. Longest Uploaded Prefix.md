[Leetcode 2424. Longest Uploaded Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2424)
## Problem Statement

You are given a video-sharing platform where users can upload videos in any order. However, the platform displays the longest consecutive sequence of uploaded videos, starting from video 1.

- Implement the class `LUPrefix`:
  - `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object with `n`, the total number of videos.
  - `void upload(int video)` indicates that the video `video` is uploaded.
  - `int longest()` returns the length of the longest uploaded prefix (i.e., the number of consecutive videos uploaded starting from video 1).

## Example
```
LUPrefix *obj = new LUPrefix(5);
obj->upload(3);
int param_2 = obj->longest();  // Should return 0 since 1 and 2 are not uploaded yet.
obj->upload(1);
obj->upload(2);
int param_3 = obj->longest();  // Should return 3 since videos 1, 2, and 3 are uploaded.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of `n`? This will help determine potential edge cases (e.g., memory constraints).
2. Can there be duplicate uploads for a specific video? If so, do duplicates affect the longest prefix calculation?
3. Will we always get calls to `upload` before `longest`?

## Strategy
1. Use a boolean array to keep track of which videos have been uploaded.
2. Keep a variable to store the length of the longest uploaded prefix.
3. When a video is uploaded, update the boolean array.
4. Adjust the longest prefix length accordingly when checking consecutive upload starting from 1.

## Code
Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation of the `LUPrefix` class:

```cpp
class LUPrefix {
private:
    vector<bool> uploaded;  // Boolean array to keep track of uploaded videos
    int longestPrefix;      // Variable to store the longest uploaded prefix

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the object with n videos
    LUPrefix(int n): uploaded(n + 1, false), longestPrefix(0) {}

    // Marks the video `video` as uploaded
    void upload(int video) {
        uploaded[video] = true;
        
        // Update the longest prefix length
        while (longestPrefix + 1 < uploaded.size() && uploaded[longestPrefix + 1]) {
            longestPrefix++;
        }
    }

    // Returns the length of the longest uploaded prefix
    int longest() {
        return longestPrefix;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- `LUPrefix(int n)`: `O(n)` because initializing the boolean array involves setting up `n+1` elements.
- `upload(int video)`: `O(1)` on average because each upload involves a few array assignments and a linear scan of prefix length which only moves forward across the array.
- `longest()`: `O(1)` since it simply returns the stored value of the longest uploaded prefix.

By ensuring that the `upload` function only incrementally maintains the longest uploaded prefix, the overall operations remain efficient.
