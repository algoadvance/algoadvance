[Leetcode 795. Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l795)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `left` and `right`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the value of the maximum array element is in the range `[left, right]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?
   - What is the length range for the `nums` array?
   - Are `left` and `right` inclusive?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should we handle empty arrays?
   - What should we return if no subarray meets the criteria?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarrayBoundedMax(std::vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {
        return countSubarrays(nums, right) - countSubarrays(nums, left - 1);
    }

private:
    int countSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums, int bound) {
        int count = 0, current = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num <= bound) {
                current++;
            } else {
                current = 0;
            }
            count += current;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we can break it down into simpler parts:

1. **Counting Function**:
   - We define a helper function `countSubarrays` that counts the number of subarrays where the maximum element is less than or equal to a given bound.
   - It uses a sliding window approach to count contiguous subarrays.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - Use the helper function to count subarrays up to the `right` bound and then subtract the count of subarrays up to `left - 1`.
   - This way, we determine the subarrays specifically within the `[left, right]` range by exclusion.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we only iterate through the array a limited number of times (specifically, twice) to gather the required counts. Each element is processed in constant time during each iteration, making this approach efficient for large input sizes.
