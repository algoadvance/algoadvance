[Leetcode 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l769)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` that is a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., arr.length - 1]`, we need to find the maximum number of chunks we can split the array into such that after sorting each chunk individually and concatenating them, we obtain a sorted array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the array guaranteed to be a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., arr.length - 1]`? 
     - **Yes**.
   - What is the length range of the array?
     - The length of `arr` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.

2. **Output:**
   - Do we need to return the exact chunks or just the count of chunks?
     - We only need to return the count of chunks.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, keep track of the maximum value encountered in the array as you iterate through it. If the maximum value at a certain index `i` is equal to `i`, it means you can form a chunk between the previous index (last chunk's end) and `i` because all elements before and including `i` can be sorted independently of the subsequent elements while still maintaining the overall sorted order when concatenated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize variables:** Start with `max_so_far` set to a very low value and a `chunk_count` initialized to 0.
2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - Update `max_so_far` with the maximum value encountered up to the current index.
   - If `max_so_far` is equal to the current index `i`, increment `chunk_count` by 1 because we found a valid chunk.
3. **Return the `chunk_count` after finishing the loop.**

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation for the given strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For std::max

class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(std::vector<int>& arr) {
        int max_so_far = 0;
        int chunk_count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
            max_so_far = std::max(max_so_far, arr[i]);
            
            if (max_so_far == i) {
                ++chunk_count;
            }
        }
        
        return chunk_count;
    }
};
```

In the above code:
- `max_so_far` keeps track of the maximum value found as we iterate through the array.
- When `max_so_far` equals the current index, it signifies that the current segment can be considered as a chunk.

This approach ensures we appropriately determine the maximum number of chunks that can be sorted independently to form the entire sorted array.
