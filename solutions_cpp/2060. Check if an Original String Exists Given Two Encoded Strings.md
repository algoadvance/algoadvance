[Leetcode 2060. Check if an Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2060)
## Problem Statement

Given two encoded strings `s1` and `s2`, return true if and only if it is possible to decode them to the same original string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. `k` is a positive integer.

Note:

- The input strings `s1` and `s2` can be empty.
- The input strings `s1` and `s2` consist of lower-case English letters and digits.

For example:
```
Input: s1 = "3[a]2[bc]", s2 = "aaabcbc"
Output: true
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the input strings?**
    - This will help in understanding the limitations for our solution, especially in terms of space and time complexity.

2. **Can the k value be more than a single digit (i.e., greater than 9)?**
    - This will help ensure that the parsing logic handles multi-digit numbers correctly.

3. **Are there any constraints on the content inside the brackets?**
    - Knowing this can help in optimizing the parsing and decoding logic.

Assuming that:
- The maximum length of input strings will be reasonably large but within the limits of usual competitive programming scenarios.
- `k` can be a multi-digit number.
- There are no constraints on the content inside the brackets other than what has been specified (lowercase letters and digits).

## Strategy

1. **Recursive Decoding Function**: Create a helper function to recursively decode the given encoded string into its original form.
2. **Traversal and Comparison**: Traverse both strings and compare them in their decoded forms.

1. **Recursive Decoding**:
   - Use a stack to parse through the string.
   - For every opening bracket `[`, push elements to the stack until `]` is found.
   - Once `]` is found, pop from the stack and reverse the string to get the correct expanded sequence.
   - Multiply this sequence by the number before the opening bracket.

2. **Optimized Comparison**:
   - Instead of fully decoding the strings, decode only the necessary parts to check if they can form the same original sequence.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool possiblyEquals(string s1, string s2) {
        return decodeAndCompare(s1, s2, 0, 0, 0);
    }
    
private:
    bool decodeAndCompare(const string& s1, const string& s2, int i, int j, int diff) {
        if (i == s1.size() && j == s2.size()) {
            return diff == 0;
        }
        
        if (diff > 0 && j < s2.size() && isdigit(s2[j])) {
            int val = 0;
            int k = j;
            while (k < s2.size() && isdigit(s2[k])) {
                val = val * 10 + (s2[k] - '0');
                if (decodeAndCompare(s1, s2, i, k + 1, diff - val)) {
                    return true;
                }
                k++;
            }
        } else if (diff < 0 && i < s1.size() && isdigit(s1[i])) {
            int val = 0;
            int k = i;
            while (k < s1.size() && isdigit(s1[k])) {
                val = val * 10 + (s1[k] - '0');
                if (decodeAndCompare(s1, s2, k + 1, j, diff + val)) {
                    return true;
                }
                k++;
            }
        } else {
            if (diff == 0) {
                if (i < s1.size() && j < s2.size() && s1[i] == s2[j]) {
                    return decodeAndCompare(s1, s2, i + 1, j + 1, diff);
                }
            } else if (diff > 0) {
                if (i < s1.size()) {
                    return decodeAndCompare(s1, s2, i + 1, j, diff - 1);
                }
            } else {
                if (j < s2.size()) {
                    return decodeAndCompare(s1, s2, i, j + 1, diff + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Main Function**:
   - The `possiblyEquals` function initializes the recursive decoding and comparison process.

2. **Recursive Helper Function**:
   - `decodeAndCompare` handles decoding and comparison.
   - It uses a difference integer `diff` to manage the comparison state between two indices of the strings.
   - If indices reach the end of both strings and `diff` is zero, return `true`.
   - If the current character of one string is a digit, calculate its integer value and adjust `diff` accordingly.
   - Recursively check the further positions.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity depends on the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, but generally it can be considered as O(n * m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the input strings after decoding, since each string might need to be fully traversed and decoded.
