[Leetcode 557. Reverse Words in a String III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l557)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. The string contains words separated by spaces. Each word consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case). You need to return a string where the letters of each word are reversed, but the words themselves remain in the original order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
```

Note:
- It's guaranteed that `s` contains printable ASCII characters.
- `s` only contains English letters and spaces `' '`.
- There are no leading or trailing spaces.
- There will be at least one word in `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are punctuation marks considered part of a word or should they be treated differently?
    - They are considered part of the word based on the example provided.

2. Can extra spaces be present between words?
    - No, based on the problem statement, words are separated by a single space.

3. Are there any constraints on the length of the string?
    - The problem does not explicitly mention constraints, so we assume it is manageable within standard memory limits.

## Strategy

1. Split the input string `s` into words using space as the delimiter.
2. Reverse each word.
3. Join the reversed words with a space to form the final string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::string reverseWords(std::string s) {
    std::istringstream iss(s);
    std::string word;
    std::vector<std::string> words;
    
    // Split the string into words
    while (iss >> word) {
        // Reverse each word and store it in the vector
        std::reverse(word.begin(), word.end());
        words.push_back(word);
    }
    
    // Join reversed words with space
    std::ostringstream oss;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0) {
            oss << " ";
        }
        oss << words[i];
    }
    
    return oss.str();
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "Let's take LeetCode contest";
    std::string result = reverseWords(s);
    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. Splitting the string into words - O(n), where `n` is the length of the string as each character is processed once.
2. Reversing each word - O(m) for each word where `m` is the length of the word. As the sum of all word lengths is equal to `n`, this step is O(n) in total.
3. Joining the words back into a single string - O(n), where `n` is the length of the final string.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string.
