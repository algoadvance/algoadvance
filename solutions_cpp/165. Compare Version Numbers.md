[Leetcode 165. Compare Version Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l165)
### Problem Statement

You are given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, composed of one or more integers separated by a dot (`.`). Each version number consists of multiple sections separated by dots. Each section within the version numbers contains only digits. 

For example, `version1 = "1.0"` and `version2 = "1.0.0"` are valid version numbers.

You need to compare these version numbers to find out which one is greater, or if they are equal. The possible outcomes are:
- Return `1` if `version1` > `version2`
- Return `-1` if `version1` < `version2`
- Return `0` if `version1` == `version2`

Note that:
- `1.0` is considered equal to `1.0.0` (trailing zeros can be ignored).
- The sections are compared as integers, so `1.0.0` is the same as `1.0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format:**
   - Confirm if the inputs `version1` and `version2` are always valid version strings.
   - Are the version numbers always non-empty strings?

2. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the version string?
   - Does the version string always contain only digits and dots, and are sections always non-empty?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How to handle leading zeros in a version section? For example, `version1 = "1.01"`, `version2 = "1.001"`.

### Strategy

1. **Split the Version Strings:**
   - Split `version1` and `version2` by the dot `.` to get a list of integers indicating each section of the version numbers.
   
2. **Normalize Section Lists:**
   - Normalize the lists by appending zeros to the shorter list to make their lengths equal.
   
3. **Comparison:**
   - Compare the sections one by one as integers. The first non-equal section will determine the result.
   
4. **Edge Handling:**
   - If all corresponding sections are equal, then the versions are equal.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation for comparing version numbers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::vector<int> splitVersion(const std::string& version) {
    std::vector<int> components;
    std::stringstream ss(version);
    std::string item;
    while (std::getline(ss, item, '.')) {
        components.push_back(std::stoi(item));
    }
    return components;
}

int compareVersion(std::string version1, std::string version2) {
    std::vector<int> v1 = splitVersion(version1);
    std::vector<int> v2 = splitVersion(version2);
    
    int length = std::max(v1.size(), v2.size());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        int num1 = (i < v1.size()) ? v1[i] : 0;
        int num2 = (i < v2.size()) ? v2[i] : 0;
        
        if (num1 > num2) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (num1 < num2) {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string version1 = "1.01";
    std::string version2 = "1.001";
    
    std::cout << compareVersion(version1, version2) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting Versions:** Splitting the version string by `.` takes O(n) where n is the length of the longest string version.
- **Comparison:** The comparison iterates through the sections which takes O(m) where m is the number of sections (max length between both versions).

Overall, the time complexity of the function is O(n + m).

Feel free to ask for any further clarifications or optimizations!
