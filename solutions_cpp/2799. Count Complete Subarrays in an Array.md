[Leetcode 2799. Count Complete Subarrays in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2799)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array 'nums'. A subarray of nums is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within the array. A subarray of nums is called "complete" if the total number of distinct elements present in the subarray is equal to the total number of distinct elements in nums.

Your task is to return the number of complete subarrays.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1]
Output: 7

Explanation:
The complete subarrays from nums are:
1. [1, 2, 1, 3]
2. [2, 1, 3]
3. [1, 2, 1, 3]. 
4. [1]
5. [3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input and Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum possible values for the size of `nums` and the elements within it?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should there be any specific format for the output, or is a simple integer count sufficient?

3. **Duplicates:**
   - Can elements repeat in `nums`, and should they be considered distinctly only once for the purpose of checking unique counts?

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>

int countCompleteSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_set<int> unique_elements(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int required_unique_count = unique_elements.size();
    
    int left = 0, right = 0, count = 0;
    std::unordered_map<int, int> window_element_count;
    int current_unique_count = 0;
    
    while (right < nums.size()) {
        if (window_element_count[nums[right]] == 0) {
            current_unique_count++;
        }
        
        window_element_count[nums[right]]++;
        right++;
        
        while (current_unique_count == required_unique_count) {
            count += (nums.size() - right + 1);
            window_element_count[nums[left]]--;
            if (window_element_count[nums[left]] == 0) {
                current_unique_count--;
            }
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1};
    std::cout << "Number of complete subarrays: " << countCompleteSubarrays(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Determining Unique Elements:**
   - First determine the number of unique elements in the array `nums`.
   - This is done using an `unordered_set` as it allows us to efficiently determine the distinct elements.

2. **Two-Pointer/Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use a sliding window technique with two pointers (`left`, `right`).
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer while maintaining a count of the distinct elements in the current window.
   - Once the window contains all the distinct elements, increment the `left` pointer to shrink the window until it is no longer complete.
   - For each valid window, all subarrays starting from `left` to the beyond `right` are complete.

3. **Counting Valid Subarrays:**
   - Whenever the window is complete, all subarrays that start from `left` and end anywhere from `right` to the end of the array are valid complete subarrays. 
   - Thus, the number of valid subarrays can be counted each time the window is complete.

## Time Complexity

- **Constructing Unique Set:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Sliding Window:** Each element is processed at most twice (once when `right` moves forward and once when `left` moves forward), leading to an amortized O(N) complexity.
  
Overall, the time complexity for this algorithm is O(N). This makes it efficient even for larger inputs within typical constraints of competitive programming.
