[Leetcode 2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2038)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `colors` where each character is either `'A'` or `'B'`. In a single move, you can remove a character from the string if it fulfills both of the following conditions:
1. The character is the same as its neighbors.
2. Both its neighbors are still remaining characters of the string.

After the character is removed, the string may become shorter, and thus its neighbors may change.

Return `true` if Alice can win the game if she plays first, or `false` if Bob will win the game assuming both players play optimally after the initial move.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a win for Alice or Bob?**
   - Alice and Bob remove pieces alternately. Alice wins if she can make a move while Bob cannot. Bob wins if the reverse is true.

2. **What is the input constraint on the length of the string?**
   - The length of the string `colors` can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Is the string empty or composed of characters other than 'A' and 'B'?**
   - No, the string will always contain at least one character, and every character will be either 'A' or 'B'.

### Strategy

The idea is to count consecutive groups of 'AAA's and 'BBB's. Alice can only remove from 'AAA' groups and Bob can only remove from 'BBB' groups. To determine who will win if both play optimally:
1. **Count the potentially removable 'A's.**
2. **Count the potentially removable 'B's.**
3. Alice plays optimally and removes 'A' pieces, and Bob does the same with 'B' pieces. Compare their counts.

**Steps**:
1. Traverse the string.
2. Count the consecutive 'A's that form groups of at least 3.
3. Count the consecutive 'B's that form groups of at least 3.
4. Compare these counts to determine the winner.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerOfGame(std::string colors) {
        int countA = 0;
        int countB = 0;
        int n = colors.size();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (colors[i] == 'A' && colors[i - 1] == 'A' && colors[i + 1] == 'A') {
                countA++;
            }
            if (colors[i] == 'B' && colors[i - 1] == 'B' && colors[i + 1] == 'B') {
                countB++;
            }
        }
        
        return countA > countB;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `colors`. We traverse the string once, which takes linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a fixed number of extra variables for counting.

By this logic, we ensure that both players play optimally, and we can deduce the winner based on the counts of potential moves for Alice and Bob.
