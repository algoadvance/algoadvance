[Leetcode 3042. Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3042)
## Problem Statement
You are given two arrays of strings `words1` and `words2`. A string `words1[i]` from `words1` is a prefix of a string `words2[j]` from `words2` if they both share the same starting characters. Similarly, `words1[i]` is a suffix of `words2[j]` if they both share the same ending characters. 

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `words1[i]` is a prefix or a suffix of `words2[j]`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: words1 = ["a", "abc"], words2 = ["abcdef", "abc", "de"]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 pairs: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)
- "a" is a prefix of "abcdef"
- "a" is a prefix of "abc"
- "abc" is a prefix of "abcdef"
- "abc" is a prefix of "abc"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarification on empty arrays:** Can `words1` or `words2` be empty?
2. **Case sensitivity:** Are the words case-sensitive?
3. **Character set:** Are the words made up of only lowercase English letters?
4. **Length constraints:** What are the constraints on the lengths of the words and sizes of the arrays?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Initialize a counter to zero.
2. **Nesting Loops:** Iterate through each word in `words1` and for each word, iterate through each word in `words2`.
3. **Prefix and Suffix Check:** For each pair `(i, j)`, check:
   - If `words1[i]` is a prefix of `words2[j]`
   - If `words1[i]` is a suffix of `words2[j]`
4. **Update Counter:** Increment the counter for each valid prefix or suffix found.
5. **Return the Counter:** At the end of the iterations, return the counter value.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to check if a is a prefix of b
bool isPrefix(const string &a, const string &b) {
    if (a.size() > b.size()) return false;
    return b.compare(0, a.size(), a) == 0;
}

// Helper function to check if a is a suffix of b
bool isSuffix(const string &a, const string &b) {
    if (a.size() > b.size()) return false;
    return b.compare(b.size() - a.size(), a.size(), a) == 0;
}

int countPrefixSuffixPairs(const vector<string> &words1, const vector<string> &words2) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const string &w1 : words1) {
        for (const string &w2 : words2) {
            if (isPrefix(w1, w2) || isSuffix(w1, w2)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words1 = {"a", "abc"};
    vector<string> words2 = {"abcdef", "abc", "de"};
    
    int result = countPrefixSuffixPairs(words1, words2);
    cout << "Count of prefix and suffix pairs: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

Let's denote the length of `words1` as `m` and the length of `words2` as `n`. Also, let `L` denote the average length of the strings in `words1` and `words2`.

1. **Iterating through pairs:** The nested loops result in `O(m * n)` iterations.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Check:** Each check for prefix and suffix takes at most `O(L)` time.

Thus, the time complexity is `O(m * n * L)`.

This means the function can efficiently handle typical input sizes encountered in practical scenarios while ensuring correctness.
