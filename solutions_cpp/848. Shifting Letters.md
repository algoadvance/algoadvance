[Leetcode 848. Shifting Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l848)
## Problem Statement

You have a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer array `shifts` of the same length.

Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a').

- For example, shifting 'a' results in 'b', and shifting 'z' results in 'a'.

Now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first `i + 1` letters of `s`, `x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `s` are applied.

### Example

#### Example 1:

**Input:** `s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]`  
**Output:** `"rpl"`  
**Explanation:** We start with "abc".  
Arriving at "rpl" by shifting:
- 1st letter by 3 times to 'd'.
- 1st 2 letters by 5 times to 'h' and 'h' (starting from 'd') resulting in 'hhc'.
- 1st 3 letters by 9 times to 'rpl' due to cyclic shifts.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is `s` always non-empty?
    - What is the maximum length of `s` and `shifts`?
    - Are the values in `shifts` non-negative?

2. **Output Constraints:**
    - Does the output string need to exactly match case-sensitivity?

## Strategy

1. **Accumulate Shifts:**
    - Traverse the `shifts` array from end to start, accumulating the effect of shifts.
    - Instead of applying the shifts [3, 5, 9] directly, consider cumulative shifts at each step. This way, the 2nd shift also includes the 3rd shift, and the 1st shift includes both 2nd and 3rd shifts.

2. **Apply Shifts to String:**
    - Modify the original string `s` by shifting the characters according to the values in the modified `shifts` array.
    - Use modulo operation to handle the wrapping around (‘z’ shifting to 'a').

### Example with Cumulative Shifts

For `shifts = [3, 5, 9]`:
- Update shifts to reflect cumulative shifts:
    - `shifts[2] = 9` (no change)
    - `shifts[1] = 5 + shifts[2] = 5 + 9 = 14`
    - `shifts[0] = 3 + shifts[1] = 3 + 14 = 17`

Updated `shifts` array would be `[17, 14, 9]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string shiftingLetters(std::string s, std::vector<int>& shifts) {
    int n = shifts.size();
    
    // Accumulate shifts from the end to start
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        shifts[i] += shifts[i + 1];
        shifts[i] %= 26; // Reduce to keep within bounds (a-z)
    }
    shifts[n - 1] %= 26; // also handle the last element
    
    // Apply shifts to string s
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        s[i] = (s[i] - 'a' + shifts[i]) % 26 + 'a'; 
    }

    return s;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Accumulation of Shifts:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `shifts`.
- **Applying Shifts to String:** O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
