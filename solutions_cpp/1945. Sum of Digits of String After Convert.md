[Leetcode 1945. Sum of Digits of String After Convert](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1945)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`.

First, convert `s` into an integer by replacing each letter with its position in the alphabet (i.e., replace 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26). For example, if `s = "zbax"`, then we have to convert it to the integer `261124`.

Then, transform the integer by repeating the following process `k` times:

1. Replace the integer with the sum of its digits.

Return the resulting integer after performing the above operations `k` times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Length Constraints**: What is the length range of the string `s` and the value range for `k`?
   - Constraints are typically such that `s` can be up to 100 characters and `k` up to 100.
  
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What happens if `k` is 0?
   - Are there any non-lowercase alphabetic inputs?
   - Assume `s` has only lowercase English letters and `k` is a positive integer as per constraint definitions.

## Strategy

1. **Step 1: Convert String to Integer**:
   - Replace each character in the string with its corresponding numeric position in the alphabet.
   - Concatenate these numeric positions to get the initial integer value.

2. **Step 2: Transform the Integer**:
   - For `k` iterations, transform the number by summing its digits.

3. **Sum Digits Function**:
   - Create a helper function to obtain the sum of digits of a given integer.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int getSumOfDigits(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

int getLucky(std::string s, int k) {
    // Step 1: Convert string to number
    std::string numberStr = "";
    for (char c : s) {
        int val = c - 'a' + 1;
        numberStr += std::to_string(val);
    }

    // Convert numberStr to integer for digit summing
    int num = std::stoi(numberStr);

    // Step 2: Sum of digits transformation k times
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        num = getSumOfDigits(num);
    }
    
    return num;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "zbax";
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << "Result: " << getLucky(s, k) << std::endl; // Output should be 8
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **String Conversion**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Digit Summing (getSumOfDigits)**: The worst-case number of digits for this problem would be approximately 3 times the length of `s` (each letter 'z' yields "26"). Taking the sum is O(m) where `m` is the number of digits.

3. **Total Time Complexity**: O(n + k * m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the number of digits in the number formed. Given the constraints, this is efficient enough.
