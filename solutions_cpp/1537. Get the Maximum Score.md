[Leetcode 1537. Get the Maximum Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1537)
### Problem Statement

You are given two sorted arrays of distinct integers `nums1` and `nums2`.

A valid path is defined as:
- Starting at any element in `nums1` or `nums2`.
- Picking exactly one element from either `nums1` or `nums2`.
- Moving to the next element in the same array or switching to the other array.

You should select elements from the arrays such as to maximize the sum of the elements from a valid path.

Return the maximum sum you can obtain.

Since the result may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the arrays?
   **A:** The length of `nums1` and `nums2` can be up to `2 * 10^4`.

2. **Q:** Can elements in the arrays be negative?
   **A:** No, the elements in both arrays are positive based on the problem description stating "distinct integers".

3. **Q:** Are there common elements between the two arrays, and how should they be handled?
   **A:** Yes, there can be common elements. These common points allow you to switch from one array to the other and are crucial to determine the maximum sum path.

### Strategy 

1. Traverse both arrays simultaneously using two pointers.
2. Maintain two accumulators (`sum1` and `sum2`) which will store the sum of elements from the start of each array up to the current point respectively.
3. At each common element, calculate the maximum of the two accumulators plus the common element, then reset the accumulators to this value (since you can choose to proceed from this common junction).
4. Continue this process until the end of both arrays.
5. At the end, take the maximum of the two accumulators and return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        long sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int n1 = nums1.size(), n2 = nums2.size();
        
        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                sum1 += nums1[i];
                i++;
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                sum2 += nums2[j];
                j++;
            } else { // nums1[i] == nums2[j]
                long maxSum = max(sum1, sum2) + nums1[i];
                sum1 = sum2 = maxSum;
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        while (i < n1) {
            sum1 += nums1[i++];
        }

        while (j < n2) {
            sum2 += nums2[j++];
        }

        return (max(sum1, sum2) % MOD);
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums1 = {2, 4, 5, 8, 10};
    vector<int> nums2 = {4, 6, 8, 9};
    cout << sol.maxSum(nums1, nums2) << endl; // Output: 30
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n1 + n2), where n1 is the length of `nums1` and n2 is the length of `nums2`. The algorithm traverses each array at most once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), We are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently uses the two-pointer technique to merge and find the maximum path sum considering both arrays in a linear pass.
