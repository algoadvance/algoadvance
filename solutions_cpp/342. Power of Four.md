[Leetcode 342. Power of Four](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l342)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of four if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 4^x`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of the integer `n`?
   **A:** The integer `n` will be within the typical 32-bit signed integer range, i.e., from `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.
   
2. **Q:** Is `1` considered a power of four?
   **A:** Yes, `1` is `4^0`, so it should return `true`.

3. **Q:** How should negative numbers be handled?
   **A:** Negative numbers will never be a power of four, so they should return `false`.

## Strategy

To determine if a number is a power of four, we can use the following criteria:
1. The number must be positive.
2. The number must be a power of two (only one bit set in its binary representation).
3. The number minus one must be divisible by `3`. 

### Explanation
- **Power of Two Check:** In binary, powers of two have exactly one '1' and the rest '0's. For example, `1` is `0001`, `2` is `0010`, `4` is `0100`, etc. To check if a number `n` is a power of two, the condition `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` must hold true.
- **Power of Four Check:** Power of four numbers have specific positions for the set bit (i.e., `4^0 = 1`, `4^1 = 4`, `4^2 = 16`, etc.). Therefore, if a number `n` is a power of four, then `(n - 1) % 3 == 0` is also true because of properties of power of four in modulus arithmetic.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        // Check if n is positive
        if (n <= 0) return false;
        // Check if n is a power of two
        if ((n & (n - 1)) != 0) return false;
        // Check if n - 1 is divisible by 3
        return (n - 1) % 3 == 0;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) - All operations are constant-time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - No additional space is required.

This solution efficiently checks if a number is a power of four using bitwise operations and modulus arithmetic, both of which are very efficient.
