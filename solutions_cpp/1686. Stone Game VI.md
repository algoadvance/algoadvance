[Leetcode 1686. Stone Game VI](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1686)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, the player should select if they will remove one stone from the left end or the right end of the row.

Once a stone is removed, it can't be taken again. The player who removes a stone gets a point equal to its value.

You are given two integer arrays `aliceValues` and `bobValues`, where `aliceValues[i]` describes the value of the `i-th` stone in the row for Alice, and `bobValues[i]` describes the value of the `i-th` stone in the row for Bob.

Both players play optimally to maximize their score. If Alice and Bob end up with the same score, the result is a draw. Otherwise, the player with the higher score wins.

Return:
- `1` if Alice wins,
- `-1` if Bob wins, or
- `0` if there is a draw.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are both arrays `aliceValues` and `bobValues` of the same length, `n`?**
   - Yes, both arrays have the length `n`.

2. **What are the constraints on `n`, and on the values within `aliceValues` and `bobValues`?**
   - The problem statement did not provide an explicit range, but we can assume typical ranges for such problems, usually `0 <= n <= 10^5` and `0 <= aliceValues[i], bobValues[i] <= 1000`.

3. **Do Alice and Bob always follow the optimal strategy to maximize their respective scores?**
   - Yes, both players play optimally.

## Strategy

To determine the winner, the following steps will be used:

1. **Compute Combined Value:**
   - We calculate combined values as `aliceValues[i] + bobValues[i]` for each stone `i`.
  
2. **Sort Stones by Combined Values:**
   - Sort the stones by the combined value in descending order. This will allow both players to maximize their scores as every round they will have the option to take the stone which will give them the highest possible advantage.
  
3. **Simulate the Game:**
   - Simulate the game by allowing Alice and Bob to take turns selecting from the sorted stone list. Alice, starting first, will select the stone with the maximum combined value left.

4. **Compute Scores:**
   - Calculate the total scores for Alice and Bob based on their selected stones.

5. **Determine the winner:**
   - Compare both scores to determine and return the winner.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameVI(std::vector<int>& aliceValues, std::vector<int>& bobValues) {
        int n = aliceValues.size();
        
        // Vector of tuples containing the combined values and original indices
        std::vector<std::tuple<int, int, int>> combinedValues(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            combinedValues[i] = {aliceValues[i] + bobValues[i], aliceValues[i], bobValues[i]};
        }
        
        // Sort the combinedValues by the first element (combined value) in descending order
        std::sort(combinedValues.begin(), combinedValues.end(), std::greater<std::tuple<int, int, int>>());
        
        int aliceScore = 0, bobScore = 0;
        
        // Simulate the game
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                // Alice's turn (even indices)
                aliceScore += std::get<1>(combinedValues[i]);
            } else {
                // Bob's turn (odd indices)
                bobScore += std::get<2>(combinedValues[i]);
            }
        }
        
        // Determine the winner
        if (aliceScore > bobScore) {
            return 1;
        } else if (bobScore > aliceScore) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the combined values takes O(n log n).
- **Simulation**: Simulating the game and computing scores takes O(n).

Thus, the total time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n log n)**.
