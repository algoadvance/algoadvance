[Leetcode 1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1963)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of even length consisting of characters `'['` and `']'` only. The string is considered balanced if it meets the following conditions:
- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as `AB`, where `A` and `B` are balanced strings, or
- It can be written as `[C]`, where `C` is a balanced string.

You need to find the minimum number of swaps to make the string balanced. A swap consists of choosing any two indices `i` and `j` (0-based) such that `i != j` and swapping `s[i]` with `s[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string? 
     - **Answer:** The length of the string can go up to 10^6.
   
2. **Nature of Swaps:**
   - Can the same index be swapped multiple times or is every index unique per swap?
     - **Answer:** Yes, the same index can be involved in multiple swaps.

### Strategy

1. **Tracking Balance:**
   - Calculate the "balance" of the string where starting balance is 0 and it increments by 1 for `'['` and decrements by 1 for `']'`. At any point if balance becomes negative, it indicates an imbalance.

2. **Utilizing Stacks:**
   - Use a counter `balance` to keep track of balance and a variable `maxImbalance` to store the maximum negative balance encountered. 

3. **Minimal Swaps Calculation:**
   - The minimum swaps necessary will be half of `maxImbalance + 1` because each swap can fix 2 units of imbalance (`[ ]` pair).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int minSwaps(string s) {
    int balance = 0, maxImbalance = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the string to find maximum imbalance
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '[') {
            balance++;
        } else {
            balance--;
        }
        maxImbalance = min(maxImbalance, balance);
    }
    
    // The minimum number of swaps required is half of maxImbalance + 1
    return (-maxImbalance + 1) / 2;
}

int main() {
    string s = "]]][[[";
    cout << "Minimum swaps needed: " << minSwaps(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we only need to iterate through the string once to determine the maximum imbalance.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a few integer variables for our calculation and no additional data structures that scale with the input size.

This solution is efficient and scales well even for large input sizes.
