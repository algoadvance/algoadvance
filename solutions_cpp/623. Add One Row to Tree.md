[Leetcode 623. Add One Row to Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l623)
## Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree and two integers `val` and `depth`. You need to add a row of nodes with value `val` at the given depth `depth`.

More specifically, the given depth `depth` is `1` means the row should be added at the root, and the tree nodes connected to the root should be moved down by one level.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we do if the tree is empty (`root` is `nullptr`)?**
   - If the tree is empty, we just need to create a new node with the given `val`.

2. **What are the constraints on `val` and `depth`?**
   - Typically, constraints would be such that `val` is an integer (`INT_MIN <= val <= INT_MAX`), and `depth` is a positive integer.

3. **Are there any constraints on the initial depth of the tree?**
   - No specific constraint, but typical constraints might apply depending on the problem's expected input size.

4. **What is the expected structure of the tree nodes?**
   - Each tree node is defined as:
     ```cpp
     struct TreeNode {
         int val;
         TreeNode *left;
         TreeNode *right;
         TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
         TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
         TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
     };
     ```

## Strategy
To add a new row at a specific depth:
1. If the desired `depth` is `1`, we create a new root node with value `val` and set the current tree as its left child.
2. To insert the new row at depth `depth`, we perform a level-order traversal (BFS), stopping at level `depth - 1`. For each node at this level, we insert new nodes with value `val` as their left and right children, preserving the original children of these nodes.

## Code
```cpp
#include <queue>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr, right(nullptr))) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* addOneRow(TreeNode* root, int val, int depth) {
        // Case when depth is 1
        if(depth == 1) {
            TreeNode* newRoot = new TreeNode(val);
            newRoot->left = root;
            return newRoot;
        }

        // Level order traversal (BFS) to find the nodes at depth - 1
        std::queue<TreeNode*> queue;
        queue.push(root);
        int currentDepth = 1;

        // Continue until we reach depth - 1
        while(currentDepth < depth - 1) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = queue.front();
                queue.pop();
                if(node->left) queue.push(node->left);
                if(node->right) queue.push(node->right);
            }
            ++currentDepth;
        }

        // Insert new row
        while(!queue.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = queue.front();
            queue.pop();
            TreeNode* oldLeft = node->left;
            TreeNode* oldRight = node->right;
            node->left = new TreeNode(val);
            node->left->left = oldLeft;
            node->right = new TreeNode(val);
            node->right->right = oldRight;
        }

        return root;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to perform a level-order traversal which visits each node exactly once. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the queue used for BFS traversal.
