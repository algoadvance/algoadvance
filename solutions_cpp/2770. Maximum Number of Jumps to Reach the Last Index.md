[Leetcode 2770. Maximum Number of Jumps to Reach the Last Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2770)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. In one step, you can move from index `i` to any index `j` such that `i < j` and `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= target`. The goal is to find the maximum number of jumps you can make to reach the last index. If you cannot reach the last index, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
   
2. **What is the length of the input array?**
   - The length of the input array can vary, but it should be reasonable enough to work within typical constraints (e.g., up to \(10^3\) elements).

3. **Are there any constraints on the value of `target`?**
   - `target` is a positive integer.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumJumps(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, -1); // dp[i] will store the maximum jumps to reach index i
        dp[0] = 0; // We are initially at index 0

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (dp[i] == -1) continue; // If dp[i] is -1, it means index i is not reachable

            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= target) {
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n-1];
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a vector `dp` of size `n` with `-1` (indicating unreachable), and set `dp[0]` to `0` since the start is always reachable.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Iterate through each index `i`, and for each `i`, iterate through all subsequent indices `j` where `j > i`.
   - For each `i` and `j`, check if `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= target`. If true, update `dp[j]` to be the maximum value between `dp[j]` and `dp[i] + 1`.

3. **Result**:
   - The value at `dp[n-1]` represents the maximum number of jumps to reach the last index. If it's still `-1`, that means the last index is not reachable.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) since each index `i` loops through all subsequent indices `j`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional `dp` array.

This approach ensures we systematically explore all possible jumps to determine the maximum number of jumps feasible to reach the last index.
