[Leetcode 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1737)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase English letters. In a single operation, you can change any character in any string to any lowercase English letter.

Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions with the minimum number of operations:

1. Every letter in `a` is strictly less than every letter in `b` in the alphabet.
2. Every letter in `b` is strictly less than every letter in `a` in the alphabet.
3. Both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter.

Return the minimum number of operations required to achieve one of the conditions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can both strings be empty or one of them be empty?**
   - **Answer:** No, both strings are non-empty.

2. **Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?**
   - **Answer:** Yes, only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to consider operations that satisfy each of the three conditions and choose the minimum from them:

1. **Condition 1:** Ensure all characters in `a` are less than all characters in `b`.  
   - For each possible division point `c` between 'a' and 'z', convert necessary characters in `a` to be less than or equal to `c` and convert necessary characters in `b` to be greater than `c`.

2. **Condition 2:** Ensure all characters in `b` are less than all characters in `a`.  
   - For each possible division point `c` between 'a' and 'z', convert necessary characters in `b` to be less than or equal to `c` and convert necessary characters in `a` to be greater than `c`.

3. **Condition 3:** Make both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter.  
    - Calculate the minimum operations to convert all characters in `a` and `b` to the most common character in either of the strings.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minCharacters(string a, string b) {
    vector<int> countA(26, 0);    // Frequency count for string a
    vector<int> countB(26, 0);    // Frequency count for string b

    // Count frequency of each character in a
    for (char ch : a) {
        countA[ch - 'a']++;
    }
     
    // Count frequency of each character in b
    for (char ch : b) {
        countB[ch - 'a']++;
    }

    int m = a.size();
    int n = b.size();
    int result = m + n;  // Maximum possible operations (change all characters)

    // Cumulative sums for the prefix
    vector<int> cumulativeA(26, 0);  // Cumulative frequency sum for a
    vector<int> cumulativeB(26, 0);  // Cumulative frequency sum for b

    cumulativeA[0] = countA[0];
    cumulativeB[0] = countB[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < 26; i++) {
        cumulativeA[i] = cumulativeA[i - 1] + countA[i];
        cumulativeB[i] = cumulativeB[i - 1] + countB[i];
    }

    // Condition 1 & 2
    for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {  // we can not separate on 'z'
        // a (<= c) and b (> c)
        int operationsA = cumulativeA[i];  // a ( <= c)
        int operationsB = n - cumulativeB[i];  // b ( > c)
        result = min(result, operationsA + operationsB);

        // b ( <= c) and a ( > c)
        operationsA = m - cumulativeA[i];  // a ( > c)
        operationsB = cumulativeB[i];  // b ( <= c)
        result = min(result, operationsA + operationsB);
    }

    // Condition 3: Make both a and b consist of one distinct letter.
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        int operationsA = m - countA[i];  // Convert all 'a' to (i+'a')
        int operationsB = n - countB[i];  // Convert all 'b' to (i+'a')
        result = min(result, operationsA + operationsB);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string a = "abc";
    string b = "def";
    cout << "Minimum operations: " << minCharacters(a, b) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(a + b + 26)`, where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the two strings. The `26` terms come from iterating over the fixed set of lowercase English letters. This is efficient given the constraint that only lowercase letters are considered.
