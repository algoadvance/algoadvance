### Problem Statement

231. Power of Two

Given an integer `n`, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - **Typical Response**: The input can range from \(-2^{31}\) to \(2^{31} - 1\).
   
2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: Should we consider negative numbers?
   - **Typical Response**: A negative number cannot be a power of two.

3. **Specific Examples**: Can you provide some examples?
   - **Typical Response**: 
     - Input: `n = 1`, Output: `true` (since \(2^0 = 1\))
     - Input: `n = 16`, Output: `true` (since \(2^4 = 16\))
     - Input: `n = 3`, Output: `false` (since 3 is not a power of two)
     - Input: `n = -16`, Output: `false` (negative numbers are not powers of two)

### Strategy

To determine if `n` is a power of two, we can use the following properties:
1. A power of two has exactly one `1` bit in its binary representation.
2. For a number `n` that is a power of two, \( n \) and \( n-1 \) have no common set bits. Hence `n & (n-1) == 0`.

Given these properties:
1. We can return `false` if `n` is less than or equal to zero.
2. Otherwise, we check if `n & (n-1)` is zero.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    int testCases[] = {1, 16, 3, -16, 1024};
    for (int n : testCases) {
        std::cout << "isPowerOfTwo(" << n << ") = " << (isPowerOfTwo(n) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The bitwise operations are constant-time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The function uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently checks whether the given number is a power of two, adhering to both time and space constraints expected in competitive programming.
