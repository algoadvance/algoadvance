[Leetcode 2543. Check if Point Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2543)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `x` and `y` representing the coordinates of a point in an infinite 2D grid. Initially, you are at point `(0, 0)`.

In one move, you can move from point `(x1, y1)` to either:
1. Point `(x1 + y1, y1)`
2. Point `(x1, y1 + x1)`

Return `true` if you can reach the point `(x, y)`, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are `x` and `y` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
2. Is there an upper bound on the values of `x` and `y`?
3. Can we assume only valid inputs within the problem constraints are provided?

Assumptions:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.

## Strategy

To determine if the point `(x, y)` is reachable from `(0, 0)`, let's reverse the process. Instead of moving forward, we move backward from `(x, y)` using the inverse operations:
1. From `(x1 + y1, y1)` to `(x1, y1)` if possible by subtracting `y1` from `x1`.
2. From `(x1, y1 + x1)` to `(x1, y1)` if possible by subtracting `x1` from `y1`.

The strategy leverages the following insights:
1. If we represent the operations in reverse, we reduce `x` and `y` until one of them reaches `0`.
2. If we reduce `x` and `y` successfully to one coordinate being `0`, we are at a base case and can move directly to `(0, 0)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

bool isReachable(int x, int y) {
    while (x > 0 && y > 0) {
        if (x > y) {
            x %= y;
        } else {
            y %= x;
        }
    }
    return x == 0 && y == 0;
}

int main() {
    // Example test cases
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "isReachable(5, 3): " << isReachable(5, 3) << "\n"; // Output: false
    std::cout << "isReachable(2, 4): " << isReachable(2, 4) << "\n"; // Output: true
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(log(max(x, y)))`:
- At each step, we reduce one of `x` or `y` by the modulus operation, which reduces the problem size geometrically.

The space complexity is `O(1)`:
- No additional space is used beyond input variables.
