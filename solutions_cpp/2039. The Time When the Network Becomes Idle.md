## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2039 - "The Time When the Network Becomes Idle"

You are given a graph representing a network where nodes are servers and edges are bidirectional cables connecting them. Each server sends out one packet of data to server 0 (the central server) once per second. The packets traverse the shortest path to reach server 0.

Once a packet reaches server 0, it takes `patience[i]` seconds to process it (for the i-th server). If a new packet from the same server arrives before the previous one has been processed, the server becomes overwhelmed and will skip processing the new packet until it can handle the first one.

The network becomes idle when there are no more packets in transit and no server is overwhelmed. Your task is to determine the earliest second when the network becomes idle.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the graph?**
   - The graph comprises `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where `2 <= n <= 10^5`. Each node `i` has `patience[i]` which is between `0` and `10^6`.

2. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - Yes, since there are `n-1` edges for `n` nodes, the graph is a tree and hence connected.

3. **Are there any constraints on the weights of the edges?**
   - Edges are unweighted and all connections are bidirectional. We just take the number of hops as the distance between nodes.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency list.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation:**
   - Use BFS to calculate the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes, as BFS is suitable for unweighted graphs.

3. **Calculate Time to Become Idle:**
   - For each server `i`, calculate the round-trip time to the central server (2 * shortest path distance).
   - Determine the last moment a server `i` sends out a packet that will arrive before it gets idle by checking how many packets are sent out before the last one returns.
   - The network becomes completely idle when the last packet from the farthest server is processed.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Build the graph as an adjacency list.
   - Use BFS to compute the shortest path from the central server to all other nodes.
   - Calculate the earliest idle time based on the above conditions.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int networkBecomesIdle(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& patience) {
    int n = patience.size();
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

    // Build the adjacency list
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    // BFS to find the shortest path from node 0
    vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);
    dist[0] = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (dist[neighbor] == INT_MAX) { // not visited
                dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    int maxTime = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int roundTripTime = 2 * dist[i];
        int lastPacketTime = (roundTripTime - 1) / patience[i] * patience[i];
        int totalIdleTime = lastPacketTime + roundTripTime;
        maxTime = max(maxTime, totalIdleTime);
    }

    return maxTime + 1; // Include the last second when the network becomes idle
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes since we have `n-1` edges.
- **BFS for Shortest Path:** `O(n + n) = O(n)` because each node and edge is processed once.
- **Idle Time Calculation:** `O(n)` as we iterate through each node to find the max time.

So the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, making the solution efficient for large-sized graphs.

And that's it! The above steps ensure that we have an optimal solution to determine when the network becomes idle.
