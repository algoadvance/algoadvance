[Leetcode 2049. Count Nodes With the Highest Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2049)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree rooted at node 0 consisting of `n` nodes. The nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and you are given a 2D integer array `parents` where `parents[i]` is the parent of the `i-th` node. The tree has the following rules:

- `parents[0] == -1` since node 0 is the root.
- Every node has exactly one parent except the root node.

The **score** of a node is defined as the product of the number of nodes in the following subtrees:

1. The left subtree of the node.
2. The right subtree of the node.
3. The remaining part of the tree that is not included in the subtrees of the node and the node itself.

Return the number of nodes that have the **highest score**.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input always a valid binary tree?
2. Can we assume there are no cycles in the tree?
3. Are the node values guaranteed to be unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`?
4. Can we have up to `100000` nodes, or should we expect more?

For now, I will assume the given input is always valid.

## Strategy

1. Parse the `parents` array to build the tree structure.
2. Perform a DFS (Depth-First Search) traversal to calculate the size of the subtree for each node.
3. Calculate the score for each node by combining the sizes of the left, right subtrees, and the rest of the tree.
4. Keep track of the highest score found and the number of nodes that have this score.
5. Return the count of nodes with the highest score.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countHighestScoreNodes(vector<int>& parents) {
        int n = parents.size();

        // Step 1: Build the tree.
        vector<vector<int>> children(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            children[parents[i]].push_back(i);
        }

        // Step 2: Calculate the size of subtrees.
        vector<int> subtreeSize(n, 0);
        calculateSubtreeSizes(0, children, subtreeSize);

        // Step 3: Calculate the scores for each node.
        long long maxScore = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            long long score = 1;
            int subtreeNodeCount = 0;

            for (int child : children[i]) {
                score *= subtreeSize[child];
                subtreeNodeCount += subtreeSize[child];
            }

            if (i != 0) { // If it's not the root node, consider the "rest of the tree"
                score *= (n - subtreeSize[i]);
            }

            if (score > maxScore) {
                maxScore = score;
                count = 1;
            } else if (score == maxScore) {
                ++count;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

private:
    int calculateSubtreeSizes(int node, const vector<vector<int>>& children, vector<int>& subtreeSize) {
        int size = 1; // Count the current node itself.
        for (int child : children[node]) {
            size += calculateSubtreeSizes(child, children, subtreeSize);
        }
        subtreeSize[node] = size;
        return size;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. Building the tree from the `parents` array: O(n)
2. Depth-First Search to calculate subtree sizes: O(n)
3. Calculating the score for each node: O(n)

Overall, the solution works in O(n) time complexity, which should be efficient enough for the input size constraints mentioned.
