[Leetcode 1754. Largest Merge Of Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1754)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct the largest string `merge` by concatenating the two words such that every prefix of `merge` is lexicographically smaller than or equal to every suffix of `merge`. At each step, you may choose to add either the first character from `word1` or the first character from `word2` to `merge`.

Return the lexicographically largest `merge` you can construct.

#### Example:
1. **Input:**
   - `word1 = "abcabc"`
   - `word2 = "abdcaba"`
   
   **Output:**
   - `"abdcabcabcaba"`
   
### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the characters from the strings be reused?
   **A:** No, each character from `word1` or `word2` can be used only once in the final merge.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the strings?
   **A:** Yes, in typical LeetCode problems like these, the constraints will usually be something like `1 <= |word1|, |word2| <= 3000`.

3. **Q:** Can the input strings be empty?
   **A:** No, both input strings will contain at least one character based on typical constraints.

### Strategy
To construct the largest possible merge:
1. We will iterate through both strings, comparing their current segments.
2. At each step, we will compare the remaining unmerged parts of the strings.
3. Append the greater prefix (lexicographically) to the `merge` string.
4. Continue this until both strings are fully merged.

We'll use a greedy approach to make sure at every step, the decision taken maximizes the lexicographic order of the result string.

### Code
The following code implements the described strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string largestMerge(string word1, string word2) {
        string merge;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < word1.size() && j < word2.size()) {
            if (word1.substr(i) > word2.substr(j))
                merge += word1[i++];
            else
                merge += word2[j++];
        }
        
        while (i < word1.size())
            merge += word1[i++];
            
        while (j < word2.size())
            merge += word2[j++];
        
        return merge;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively. Here's the breakdown:
- `substr()` operation at each step can seem `O(n)`, but because we're continuously moving forward and comparing only parts of the strings, it's effectively amortized to be linear.
- Thus, the comparison operations and concatenations are effectively `O(n + m)`.

**Space Complexity** is `O(n + m)`, as we are storing the result in the `merge` string which will be of size `n + m` in the worst case.
