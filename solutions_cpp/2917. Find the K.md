[Leetcode 2917. Find the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2917)
### Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers, `arr`, and an integer `k`. The task is to find the K-or of the array. The K-or of the array is defined as the maximum bitwise OR value of any k elements from the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range for the input array `arr`?**
   - Let's assume the size of the array is reasonably large, potentially up to 10^5 elements.

2. **What is the range of the values in the array?**
   - The values in the array can range from 0 to 10^9.

3. **What is the range for `k`?**
   - `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq \text{size of the array}\).

4. **What should be returned if `k` is 1?**
   - If `k` is 1, the function should return the maximum value of the array since picking one element will yield its own value as the OR result.

### Strategy

- To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the K-or efficiently.
- Starting from the highest bit position, we will try to build the maximum possible bitwise OR.
- This can be achieved by considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant bit and checking if selecting elements that have this bit set can form a valid OR.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findKOrOfArray(const std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    if (k == 1) {
        return *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    }
    
    int max_or = 0;
    for (int bit = 31; bit >= 0; --bit) {
        std::vector<int> candidates;
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num & (1 << bit)) {
                candidates.push_back(num);
            }
        }
        
        if (candidates.size() >= k) {
            max_or |= (1 << bit);
            arr = std::move(candidates);
        }
    }

    return max_or;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {3, 6, 9, 5};
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << "The K-or of the array is: " << findKOrOfArray(arr, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation and Time Complexity

#### Explanation
1. **Initial Check:**
   - If `k` equals 1, return the maximum element since OR'ing one number results in the number itself.

2. **Bitwise OR Calculation:**
   - Loop through each bit position starting from the most significant bit (31st bit for 32-bit integers).
   - For each bit position, filter out elements that have this bit set.
   - If the number of elements with the current bit set is at least `k`, update the `max_or` to include this bit and continue with the filtered list of elements.

#### Time Complexity
- **Overall Complexity:**
  - Each bit position is checked resulting in 32 iterations (constant time complexity, O(1)).
  - For each iteration, we might go through the array and filter elements, leading to a total complexity around O(31 * n), which is essentially O(n) due to constant multiplication.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is efficient enough for large arrays up to the order of \(10^5\).
