[Leetcode 3110. Score of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3110)
### Problem Statement
A problem on LeetCode titled "Score of a String-out" (Problem ID 3110) requires you to compute the score of a given string based on specific rules. Your task is to implement a function that calculates this score given a string `s`. The rules for scoring the string are not provided in your request, so let's make an assumption for the sake of crafting a solution.

Let's assume the scoring rules are as follows (you can provide the actual rules if different):
1. Each character in the string has a specific point value: 
   - 'a' scores 1 point
   - 'b' scores 2 points
   - 'c' scores 3 points
   - ..., and so forth.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the characters only lowercase a-z?
2. Should we consider uppercase characters differently?
3. Are there any special characters or constraints?
4. Is the string always non-empty?
5. Are there specific requirements about the approach or limitations on time/memory?

### Strategy
Based on our assumed rules:
1. Traverse the string character by character.
2. For each character, add its corresponding point value to the total score.
3. Return the final score.

### Code Implementation
Given our assumptions, let's write the C++ code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int scoreOfString(const std::string& s) {
    // Initialize total score to 0
    int score = 0;

    // Traverse each character in the string 
    for (char c : s) {
        // Calculate the score as per the assumed rule c - 'a' + 1
        score += (c - 'a' + 1);
    }
    
    // Return the total score
    return score;
}

// Driver code for testing
int main() {
    std::string test_str = "abc";
    std::cout << "Score of the string \"" << test_str << "\" is: " << scoreOfString(test_str) << std::endl; // Expected output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string because we are traversing each character in the string exactly once to calculate the score.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a single integer variable `score` to store the total score, irrespective of the length of the string.

If you provide the exact rules or additional constraints, we can adjust this solution accordingly.
