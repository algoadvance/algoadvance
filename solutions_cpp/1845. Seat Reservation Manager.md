[Leetcode 1845. Seat Reservation Manager](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1845)
### Problem Statement:
You are managing a multi-seat reservation system in a cinema. Initially, the cinema has `n` seats, numbered from `1` to `n`.

Implement the class `SeatManager` which supports the following functions:
1. `SeatManager(int n)` Initializes a SeatManager object that manages `n` seats numbered from `1` to `n`.
2. `int reserve()` Fetches and reserves the smallest-numbered unreserved seat. Returns the number of this seat.
3. `void unreserve(int seatNumber)` Unreserves the seat numbered `seatNumber`.

### Clarifying Questions:
- Is it guaranteed that `unreserve` will only be called on currently reserved seats?
    - Yes, `unreserve` will only be called on seats that have been reserved previously.
- Are the seat numbers contiguous from `1` to `n`?
    - Yes, the seats are numbered from `1` to `n`.
- Should we handle concurrent reservations (thread safety)?
    - For the sake of this problem, we can assume there is no need for thread safety.

### Strategy:
To efficiently manage the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, we can use a min-heap (priority queue). The operations that must be performed are:
1. Reserving the smallest numbered unreserved seat.
2. Adding back a reserved seat when it is unreserved.

Using a min-heap:
- Reserving a seat (fetching the smallest unreserved seat) becomes a simple `pop` operation from the heap.
- Unreserving a seat (adding back an unreserved seat) becomes a `push` operation to the heap.

### Implementation in C++:
We will use the `std::priority_queue` (by default it acts as a max-heap, but we can adjust it to work as a min-heap).

```cpp
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

class SeatManager {
private:
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize the SeatManager with n seats
    SeatManager(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            minHeap.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    // Reserves the smallest-numbered unreserved seat
    int reserve() {
        int seatNumber = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        return seatNumber;
    }
    
    // Unreserves the seat numbered seatNumber
    void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        minHeap.push(seatNumber);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Initialization (`SeatManager(int n)`):** O(n), where n is the number of seats. This is due to the heap creation.
- **Reserve (`reserve()`):** O(log n) as it involves a heap pop operation.
- **Unreserve (`unreserve(int seatNumber)`):** O(log n) as it involves a heap push operation.

By using a min-heap, we ensure that both `reserve` and `unreserve` operations are efficient, maintaining the overall performance required for seat management in a cinema setting.
