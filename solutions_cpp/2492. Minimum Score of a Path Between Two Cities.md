[Leetcode 2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2492)
### Problem Statement
You are given a graph representing the cities and roads between them in the form of a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a, b, distance]` denotes there is a road between cities `a` and `b` with a distance of `distance`. You need to find and return the minimum possible score of a path between the first city (node `1`) and the last city (node `n`). The score of a path is defined as the maximum "distance" edge in that path. If a path does not exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How many cities (nodes) are there?
   - Are the nodes indexed from 1 to n?
   - Can the graph have cycles?
   - Are all roads bidirectional?
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Are there guaranteed paths between the first and the last city?
   - What should be returned if there's no path between the two cities?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency list to store the cities and the distances between them.

2. **Algorithm Choice:**
   - Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) with a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the minimum possible score path efficiently.

3. **Steps:**
   - Initialize a min-heap (priority queue) with a tuple containing the current maximum distance and the starting city.
   - Use a visited set to avoid reprocessing nodes.
   - While traversing the graph, update the path score and continue until reaching the last node or concluding there is no path.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - This approach primarily hinges on the properties of BFS and priority queue operations, typically resulting in a time complexity of \(O(E \log V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges, and \(V\) is the number of vertices.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minScoreBetweenCities(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
    // Build the graph using an adjacency list
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n + 1);
    for (auto& road : roads) {
        int u = road[0], v = road[1], dist = road[2];
        graph[u].emplace_back(v, dist);
        graph[v].emplace_back(u, dist); // the graph is bidirectional
    }
    
    // Min-heap to store (maximum distance, current node)
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> minHeap;
    // start from the first city
    minHeap.emplace(0, 1);
    vector<int> minScore(n + 1, INT_MAX);
    minScore[1] = 0;
    
    unordered_set<int> visited;

    while (!minHeap.empty()) {
        auto [currentScore, node] = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        
        if (visited.count(node)) continue;   
        visited.insert(node);
        
        // If we reached the last city
        if (node == n) return currentScore;
        
        for (auto& [neighbor, dist] : graph[node]) {
            if (visited.count(neighbor)) continue;
            int newScore = max(currentScore, dist);
            
            // Update path score if the new path score is less
            if (newScore < minScore[neighbor]) {
                minScore[neighbor] = newScore;
                minHeap.emplace(newScore, neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // no path found from city 1 to city n
}
```

This approach ensures an efficient traversal of the graph to compute the minimum score path while considering the constraints and properties of the priority queue for optimal performance.
