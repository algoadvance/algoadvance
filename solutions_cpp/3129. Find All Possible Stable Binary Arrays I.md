[Leetcode 3129. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3129)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary array nums. A binary array is said to be stable if there is no index i such that nums[i] == 0 and nums[i+1] == 1. Your task is to find all the possible stable binary arrays that can be obtained by any combination of the following operations applied any number of times:

- Swap any adjacent 0 and 1.

Return a list of all possible stable binary arrays. The returned list can be in any order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What is the length range of the `nums` array?
   - Should I consider any specific constraints for edge cases, like empty arrays or arrays with all elements the same?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output arrays be in ascending order or any specific order, or can they be in any order?

3. **Duplicates:**
   - Can we expect duplicate elements in the `nums` array, and should we handle them differently?

4. **Example:**
   - Could you provide a few example inputs and outputs to help clarify the expected behavior?

## Strategy

A stable binary array, by definition, is an array where no '0' comes after '1'. This essentially means that all '0's must be on the left side followed by all '1's.

To achieve a stable binary array, you can simply count the number of '0's and the number of '1's in the given array. The stable array will be formed by placing all the '0's to the left followed by all the '1's.

### Steps:
1. Count the number of '0's in the array.
2. Count the number of '1's in the array.
3. Create a new array with all '0's at the beginning followed by all '1's.

This approach ensures that we cover all possible stable configurations because, irrespective of the order of operations, the stable configuration will always be the same.

### Time Complexity:
- Time complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input array, as we are merely traversing the array once to count the '0's and '1's.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For move
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> findStableArrays(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count0 = 0;
    int count1 = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 0)
            count0++;
        else if (num == 1)
            count1++;
    }

    vector<int> stableArray(count0, 0);
    stableArray.insert(stableArray.end(), count1, 1);

    return {stableArray};
}
```

### Example:

- **Input:** `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
- **Output:** `[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]`

- **Input:** `[0, 1, 0, 1]`
- **Output:** `[[0, 0, 1, 1]]`

This solution ensures that we provide all possible stable arrays by generating a single, unique sorted array of '0's followed by '1's.
