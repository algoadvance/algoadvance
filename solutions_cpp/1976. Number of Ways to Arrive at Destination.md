[Leetcode 1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1976)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with finding out the number of ways to arrive at a destination city `n` starting from city `0` given some roads that connect these cities.

You are given:

- `n`: Total number of cities (nodes) numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
- `roads`: A 2D array where each element is of the form `[u, v, time]`. This means there is a bidirectional road between city `u` and city `v` which takes `time` units of time to travel. 

The goal is to find the number of different ways to arrive at city `n-1` from city `0` in the shortest amount of time. Return this number modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the road network guaranteed to be connected?**
   - There's no explicit guarantee, but we need to return the number of ways to reach city `n-1` or `0` if it's unreachable.

2. **Are there multiple roads between two cities?**
   - Yes, multiple roads with different travel times can exist.

3. **Will all travel times be positive integers?**
   - Yes, all times will be positive integers.

4. **How large can `n` and the size of `roads` be?**
   - `1 <= n <= 200`
   - `1 <= |roads| <= 6000`

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Since we need the shortest path to `n-1`, use Dijkstra's algorithm, keeping track of the number of ways to achieve the shortest path.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP array to keep track of the number of ways to reach each city with the shortest path time.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int countPaths(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
    // Initialize graph
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (auto& road : roads) {
        int u = road[0], v = road[1], time = road[2];
        graph[u].emplace_back(v, time);
        graph[v].emplace_back(u, time);
    }
    
    // Min-heap priority queue to implement Dijkstra's algorithm
    priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, greater<pair<long long, int>>> pq;
    vector<long long> shortest(n, LLONG_MAX);
    vector<int> ways(n, 0);
    
    // Start from city 0
    pq.emplace(0, 0);
    shortest[0] = 0;
    ways[0] = 1;

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [time, u] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (time > shortest[u]) continue;

        for (auto& [v, travelTime] : graph[u]) {
            long long new_time = time + travelTime;
            if (new_time < shortest[v]) {
                shortest[v] = new_time;
                ways[v] = ways[u];
                pq.emplace(new_time, v);
            } else if (new_time == shortest[v]) {
                ways[v] = (ways[v] + ways[u]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    return ways[n - 1];
}

int main() {
    int n = 7;
    vector<vector<int>> roads = \{\{0, 6, 7}, {0, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 3}, {6, 3, 3}, {3, 5, 1}, {6, 5, 1}, {2, 5, 1}, {0, 4, 5}, {4, 6, 2}};
    cout << countPaths(n, roads) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: \(O(|roads|)\)
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: \(O((|roads| + n) \log n)\) as each road is processed once and each node is pushed/pop from the priority queue.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O((|roads| + n) \log n)\), which ensures that the solution is efficient given the constraints.
