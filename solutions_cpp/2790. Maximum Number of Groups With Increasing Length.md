[Leetcode 2790. Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2790)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers representing the lengths of various groups. Your task is to determine the maximum number of groups you can form such that each group has a strictly increasing length.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the number of elements in the array?
   - What are the smallest and largest possible values for the lengths of the groups?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the output if the array is empty?
   - Are all group lengths guaranteed to be positive integers?

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxIncreasingGroups(std::vector<int>& lengths) {
    // Sort the array to help group elements with increasing lengths
    std::sort(lengths.begin(), lengths.end());

    int count = 0;
    int currentLength = 0;

    for (int length : lengths) {
        if (length > currentLength) {
            count++;
            currentLength++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> lengths = {3, 1, 2, 1, 4};
    std::cout << "Maximum number of groups with increasing length: " << maxIncreasingGroups(lengths) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the array to make it easier to group elements with increasing lengths. After sorting, if we have an element `lengths[i]`, we only need to check if it can be the start or continuation of an increasing sequence.

2. **Tracking Groups:**
   - Keep a variable `currentLength` which denotes the length the next group must exceed.
   - Iterate through the sorted array. If the current element is greater than `currentLength`, it can form a new group, so we increment `currentLength` and also our group count `count`.

3. **Increment Logic:**
   - After forming each group, the next required length (`currentLength`) is incremented to ensure the next group is strictly longer.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The array is sorted initially, which takes \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Iteration:** We then iterate through the array once, which is \(O(N)\).

Combining these, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \(O(N \log N)\).

This approach ensures an optimal solution while being simple and efficient to implement.
