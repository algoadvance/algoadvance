[Leetcode 2959. Number of Possible Sets of Closing Branches](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2959)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `A` of size `N` where every element of the array is either `0` or `1`, we want to find the number of sets of indices `i` and `j` such that:
1. `A[i]` is `0`
2. `A[j]` is `1`
3. `j` is greater than `i`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of the array `N`?
   - Presumably, `N` can be up to \(10^5\) based on typical problem sizes on platforms like LeetCode.
   
2. **Input validation**: Should we assume the input array only contains `0`s and `1`s?
   - Yes, unless otherwise specified, we can assume that the array `A` contains only `0`s and `1`s.

3. **Output type**: What should the output be?
   - The output should be a single integer representing the number of valid `(i, j)` pairs.

## Strategy
1. Traverse the array once and count the number of `1`s on the fly.
2. For every `0` encountered, the number of valid pairs is incremented by the count of `1`s encountered so far.
   - This works because each `0` can pair with previously seen `1`s.

### Example
- For `A = [0, 1, 0, 1]`, the valid pairs are `(0, 1)`, `(0, 3)`, and `(2, 3)`. The count of valid pairs is `3`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int numberOfCloseSets(std::vector<int>& A) {
    int countOnes = 0;
    int result = 0;

    for (int elem : A) {
        if (elem == 1) {
            countOnes++;
        } else if (elem == 0) {
            result += countOnes;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with `countOnes = 0` and `result = 0`.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse each element in the array `A`.
   - If the element is `1`, increment `countOnes`.
   - If the element is `0`, add the current `countOnes` value to `result`.
3. **Return the result** which contains the number of valid `(i, j)` pairs.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of sets in linear time.
