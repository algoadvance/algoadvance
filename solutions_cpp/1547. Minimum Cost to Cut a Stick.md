[Leetcode 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1547)
### Problem Statement

Given a wooden stick of length `n` units, and an array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes the position along the stick where you need to make a cut. You should perform the cuts in such a way that the total cost is minimized. Note that the cost of making a cut at a position `x` is the length of the stick being cut. 

Example:
- Input: `n = 7, cuts = [1, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `16`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Lengths and Number of Cuts:**
   - What are the minimum and maximum values of `n`?
   - What are the minimum and maximum lengths of `cuts` array?
2. **Are cuts pre-sorted?**
   - No need to assume that cuts array is given in a sorted manner.
3. **Is the cost directly proportional to the length of the stick at any cut?**
   - Yes, the cost of making a cut is equal to the current length of the stick.

### Strategy

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem optimally. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Sorting:**
   - Sort the `cuts` array to handle cuts in a sequential manner.

2. **Augment Cuts:**
   - Include the boundaries `0` and `n` in the cuts array.

3. **DP Table Setup:**
   - Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost needed to cut the stick between `cuts[i]` and `cuts[j]`.

4. **Iterate Over Possible Cut Intervals:**
   - Iterate over possible lengths of intervals to consider all subproblems.
   - For each subproblem of starting point `i` and ending point `j`, try every possible cut `k` which is between `i` and `j`, updating the cost accordingly.

5. **Calculate the Minimum Cost:**
   - Use the recurrence relation to calculate the minimum cost for each subproblem, storing results in the DP table.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cuts) {
        // Add the boundaries (0 and n) to the cuts array
        cuts.push_back(0);
        cuts.push_back(n);
        
        // Sort the cuts array
        sort(cuts.begin(), cuts.end());
        
        int m = cuts.size();
        
        // DP table
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(m, 0));
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int length = 2; length < m; ++length) { // length must be at least 2 to form a valid segment
            for (int i = 0; i < m - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cuts[j] - cuts[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][m-1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(m^3)** where `m` is the number of elements in the augmented cuts array (`cuts.size() + 2`). This accounts for the following:
- Sorting the cuts array: **O(m log m)**
- Filling the DP table: **O(m^3)** due to the three nested loops.

Since `m` is at most `cuts.size() + 2`, and considering `cuts.size()` can be significant in large inputs, the dominant complexity is **O(m^3)**. However, this is generally efficient enough given the constraints implied by typical problem boundaries in competitive programming contexts.
