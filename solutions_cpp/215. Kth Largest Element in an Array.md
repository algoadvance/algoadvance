[Leetcode 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l215)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`th largest element in the array. 

Note that it is the `k`th largest element in the sorted order, not the `k`th distinct element.

### Example:

- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
  Output: 5
  ```

- Example 2:
  ```
  Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
  Output: 4
  ```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input array contain duplicate elements?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain duplicate elements.
   
2. **Q:** Are the elements in the array always integers?
   **A:** Yes, all elements in the array are integers.

3. **Q:** Is `k` always a valid index within the range of the array?
   **A:** Yes, `k` is always within the valid range as per the constraints given.

## Strategy
To solve the problem of finding the `k`th largest element, we can use one of the following approaches:

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the array in descending order and then return the element at the `(k-1)`-th index. This is straightforward but might not be the most efficient way.

2. **Min-Heap**:
   - Use a Min-Heap of size `k` to keep track of the `k` largest elements.
   - Iterate through the array, and for each element, maintain the heap of size `k`. At the end, the root of the heap will be the `k`th largest element.

3. **Quickselect Algorithm**:
   - This is a selection algorithm that works similar to QuickSort. It is more efficient on average for this type of problem. We can utilize a partitioning method to find the k-th largest element.

Given the constraints, using a Min-Heap seems to be a balanced approach in terms of implementation complexity and efficiency.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Min-heap to store the k largest elements
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            minHeap.push(num);
            
            // Keep the heap size to k
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.pop();
            }
        }
        
        // The root of the heap is the k-th largest element
        return minHeap.top();
    }
};

// Driver code for testing
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums1 = {3,2,1,5,6,4};
    int k1 = 2;
    cout << "The " << k1 << "-th largest element in the first array is: " << solution.findKthLargest(nums1, k1) << endl;

    vector<int> nums2 = {3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6};
    int k2 = 4;
    cout << "The " << k2 << "-th largest element in the second array is: " << solution.findKthLargest(nums2, k2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Building the min-heap takes O(n log k) time as each insertion operation in a heap of size `k` takes O(log k) and we do this for all `n` elements.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is O(k) due to the storage needed for the heap.

This method efficiently finds the `k`th largest element while managing the input constraints effectively.
