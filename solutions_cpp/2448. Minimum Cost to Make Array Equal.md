[Leetcode 2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2448)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `cost` of the same length. The elements of `nums` represent an array and `cost[i]` represents the cost of transforming the `i-th` element of `nums` to any other value.

You need to transform all elements of the array `nums` to the same value such that the total transformation cost is minimized. The total cost of transforming all the elements to the same value `x` is given by the sum of `|nums[i] - x| * cost[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length`.

Return the minimum cost to make all elements of `nums` equal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values?**: What is the range of values in `nums` and `cost`?
   - This is typically constrained by problem limits; assume reasonable integer ranges if unspecified.
   
2. **Size of arrays?**: What is the size of `nums` and `cost`?
   - This helps determine appropriate algorithm efficiency.

3. **Constraints?**: Are there any special constraints (e.g., no negative values) on the values in `nums` and `cost`?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, one effective method is to use **Median of Weighted Elements**:
1. First, understand that transforming all elements to the median minimizes the cost in the unweighted case. We extend this notion to handle the weights.
2. Use a binary search strategy to determine the optimal target value `x`.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array of values based on `nums` while maintaining the relationship with `cost`.
2. Use a form of weighted median to find the target value that minimizes the transformation cost.
3. Compute the total cost for transforming all elements to this target value.

### Pseudocode:
1. Sort `nums` and `cost` by `nums` values.
2. Accumulate the costs and find the weighted median.
3. Calculate the final cost using the weighted target value.

## Code

Below is the C++ implementation following the outlined strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

long long minCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> arr(n);
    
    // Combine nums and cost in pairs.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = {nums[i], cost[i]};
    }
    
    // Sort arr based on the nums values.
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    // Calculate the total costs sum.
    long long totalCost = accumulate(cost.begin(), cost.end(), 0LL);
    
    // Find the weighted median.
    long long cumulativeCost = 0;
    int medianNum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cumulativeCost += arr[i].second;
        if (cumulativeCost * 2 >= totalCost) {
            medianNum = arr[i].first;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the total minimum cost with the chosen median.
    long long minCost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        minCost += 1LL * abs(nums[i] - medianNum) * cost[i];
    }
    
    return minCost;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting step**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Weighted median finding step**: O(n).
- **Final cost calculation step**: O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step being the dominant factor.
