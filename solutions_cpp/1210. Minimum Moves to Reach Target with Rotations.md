[Leetcode 1210. Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1210)
### Problem Statement

The problem, number 1210 from Leetcode, is titled "Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations." Given an `n x n` binary grid, where `0` represents an empty cell and `1` represents an obstacle, you are tasked to move a snake from the top-left corner of the grid (starting position) to the bottom-right corner (target position). The snake consists of two segments of the size `1 x 2` that are initially positioned horizontally (head at (0,1) and tail at (0,0)).

The snake can move in three ways:
1. Move right if the two horizontal cells to the right are empty.
2. Move down if the two vertical cells below are empty.
3. Rotate clockwise around the tail if the two cells to the right of the tail and the cell right of the head are empty.
4. Rotate counterclockwise around the head if the two cells below the head and the cell below the tail are empty.

The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to get from the starting position to the target position or return -1 if it is not possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Are the initial and target positions fixed as described in the problem?**
   - A: Yes, the initial position of the snake is always at the top-left corner horizontally, and the target position is the bottom-right corner.

2. **Q: Can the snake's head or tail pass over obstacle cells?**
   - A: No, both segments of the snake cannot move over obstacle cells.

3. **Q: Is it guaranteed that the initial and target positions are free of obstacles?**
   - A: Yes, it is guaranteed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach due to its suitability for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. We need to keep track of both the position and orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the snake.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoves(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        queue<tuple<int, int, bool>> q; // (tail_x, tail_y, isHorizontal)
        set<tuple<int, int, bool>> visited;
        
        q.push({0, 0, true}); // Start with the snake's tail at (0,0) and horizontal orientation.
        visited.insert({0, 0, true});

        int moves = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                auto [tail_x, tail_y, isHorizontal] = q.front();
                q.pop();

                int head_x = tail_x + (isHorizontal ? 0 : 1);
                int head_y = tail_y + (isHorizontal ? 1 : 0);

                if (head_x == n - 1 && head_y == n - 1) {
                    return moves;
                }

                // Move right
                if (isHorizontal && head_y + 1 < n && grid[tail_x][head_y + 1] == 0 && grid[head_x][head_y + 1] == 0) {
                    if (visited.insert({tail_x, tail_y + 1, true}).second) {
                        q.push({tail_x, tail_y + 1, true});
                    }
                }

                // Move down
                if (!isHorizontal && head_x + 1 < n && grid[head_x + 1][tail_y] == 0 && grid[head_x + 1][head_y] == 0) {
                    if (visited.insert({tail_x + 1, tail_y, false}).second) {
                        q.push({tail_x + 1, tail_y, false});
                    }
                }

                // Rotate clockwise to vertical
                if (isHorizontal && tail_x + 1 < n && grid[tail_x + 1][tail_y] == 0 && grid[tail_x + 1][head_y] == 0) {
                    if (visited.insert({tail_x, tail_y, false}).second) {
                        q.push({tail_x, tail_y, false});
                    }
                }

                // Rotate counterclockwise to horizontal
                if (!isHorizontal && tail_y + 1 < n && grid[tail_x][tail_y + 1] == 0 && grid[head_x][tail_y + 1] == 0) {
                    if (visited.insert({tail_x, tail_y, true}).second) {
                        q.push({tail_x, tail_y, true});
                    }
                }
            }
            ++moves;
        }

        return -1; // If target is not reachable
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is generally O(N^2), where N is the size of the grid. This is because each cell can be visited for every possible orientation, and the BFS ensures that each state (position and orientation) is visited at most once.

### Summary

Using BFS, we systematically explore all possible moves and rotations to find the shortest path from the snake's initial position to the target, ensuring that all constraints (grid boundaries and obstacles) are respected. If the target is reachable, we return the minimum number of moves; otherwise, we return -1.
