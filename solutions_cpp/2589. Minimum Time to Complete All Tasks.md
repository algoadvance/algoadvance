[Leetcode 2589. Minimum Time to Complete All Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2589)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [start_i, end_i, duration_i]` indicates that the i-th task should be started within the inclusive time frame (`start_i`, `end_i`) and requires exactly `duration_i` units of time to complete. The task can be executed at any time within the given time frame, but must be completed in a single continuous interval.

Return the minimum time required to complete all the tasks.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input**: What are the limits on the length of the tasks array and the values within `start_i`, `end_i`, and `duration_i`?
    - *Assumption: The number of tasks can be up to `10^5` and the time frame values and duration are also within reasonable limits such as `10^5`.*

2. **Output Constraints**: Should the output be a single integer indicating the minimum total time?
    - Yes.

3. **Task Overlap Handling**: Can tasks overlap if they are within their respective intervals?
    - Tasks must be scheduled to avoid overlap but need to fit within their specified intervals.

## Strategy
1. **Sort Tasks**: First, sort the tasks based on their `end_i` values. This will help us to schedule tasks finishing earlier first and reduce the chances of overlapping within smaller intervals.
2. **Greedy Approach**: Use a greedy approach to schedule tasks, always choosing the earliest possible time slot available within the specified intervals.
3. **Priority Queue**: Maintain a priority queue to manage the scheduled tasks and to efficiently find the next available time slot.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minTimeToCompleteAllTasks(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
    // Sorting tasks based on the end time
    sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        if (a[1] == b[1]) {
            return a[0] < b[0];
        }
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });

    // Priority queue to track ending times of scheduled tasks
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> scheduledTasks;
    int currentTime = 0;

    for (auto& task : tasks) {
        int start = task[0], end = task[1], duration = task[2];
        
        // Fit the task within its start and end interval, checking with current time
        while (!scheduledTasks.empty() && scheduledTasks.top() + duration <= start) {
            currentTime = scheduledTasks.top();
            scheduledTasks.pop();
        }

        currentTime = max(currentTime, start);
        
        // Task to be scheduled must be within the end time
        if (currentTime + duration <= end) {
            currentTime += duration;
            scheduledTasks.push(currentTime);
        } else {
            return -1; // Task cannot be completed within the interval.
        }
    }

    return currentTime;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> tasks = {{1, 3, 2}, {2, 5, 3}, {4, 6, 1}};
    cout << minTimeToCompleteAllTasks(tasks) << endl; // Output: 6 (if all tasks can be completed within constraints)
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Sorting Tasks**: We sort the tasks by their end times to prioritize tasks that need to be finished earlier.
2. **Current Time Management**: Using a priority queue, we manage the completion times of scheduled tasks to find the earliest available slot.
3. **Scheduling Tasks**: For each task, we ensure it fits within its interval. If it can fit, we update the current time and push the completion time into the priority queue.

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting the tasks.
- **Scheduling**: \(O(n \log n)\) for managing the priority queue operations.
- **Overall**: The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints of the problem.

By following this strategy, we ensure that we minimize the time required to complete all tasks without conflicting the intervals.
