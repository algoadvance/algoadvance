[Leetcode 889. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l889)
## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays, `preorder` and `postorder` where `preorder` is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

* The arrays `preorder` and `postorder` will have distinct integer values.

**Example:**
```text
Input: 
preorder = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7]
postorder = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  // in the form of an in-order traversal for confirmation
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all tree nodes guaranteed to have unique values?**
   - Yes, all the node values are distinct.
 
2. **Can the binary tree be non-complete (i.e., nodes can have zero, one or two children)?**
   - Yes, the binary tree can be of any form as long as preorder and postorder sequences match a valid binary tree.

3. **Is the input size bounded by any constraints?**
   - The problem does not explicitly say, but typical constraints range from small inputs (like 1-1000 nodes).

Great, let's move on to the strategy to solve this problem.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Preorder and Postorder:**
   - Preorder: The order of nodes is `Root -> Left Subtree -> Right Subtree`.
   - Postorder: The order of nodes is `Left Subtree -> Right Subtree -> Root`.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Use the first element of `preorder` to identify the root of the tree.
   - The second element in the `preorder` will indicate the root of the left subtree.
   - Find this element in the `postorder` array to determine the boundary of the left subtree in both arrays.
   - Recursively repeat the process for the left and right subtrees until the tree is completely constructed.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - If the range in preorder or postorder becomes invalid (start index > end index), return `nullptr`.

## Code

Here's how to implement this solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* constructFromPrePost(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& postorder) {
        unordered_map<int, int> postorder_map;
        for (int i = 0; i < postorder.size(); ++i) {
            postorder_map[postorder[i]] = i;
        }
        return construct(preorder, 0, preorder.size()-1, postorder_map, 0, postorder.size()-1);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* construct(const vector<int>& preorder, int pre_start, int pre_end,
                        const unordered_map<int, int>& postorder_map, int post_start, int post_end) {
        if (pre_start > pre_end || post_start > post_end) {
            return nullptr; 
        }

        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(preorder[pre_start]);

        if (pre_start == pre_end) { // No more children
            return root;
        }

        int left_root_val = preorder[pre_start + 1];
        int left_subtree_size = postorder_map.at(left_root_val) - post_start + 1;

        root->left = construct(preorder, pre_start + 1, pre_start + left_subtree_size, postorder_map, post_start, post_start + left_subtree_size - 1);
        root->right = construct(preorder, pre_start + left_subtree_size + 1, pre_end, postorder_map, post_start + left_subtree_size, post_end - 1);

        return root;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis of this algorithm is as follows:

- Building the map of postorder indices takes O(n) time.
- The recursive construction itself will process each node once, leading to an overall complexity of O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed in constant time during the construction of the tree.

This solution is efficient and handles the problem constraints well.
