[Leetcode 3233. Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3233)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. A special number is defined as a number `m` such that every digit of `m` is a 2, 5, or 9. Your task is to find out how many numbers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) are not special numbers.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start, let's clarify a few things:
1. **Range of n:** What is the maximum value for `n`? This will help determine the most efficient solution.
2. **Exclusive of boundaries:** Should the range include 1 and `n` in the count?
3. **Output requirements:** Should the result be simply the count of non-special numbers or do we also need to print those numbers?

Assuming:
- `n` can be a large number (e.g., up to $10^9$).
- The boundaries are inclusive.
- We only need the count.

### Strategy
The strategy involves:
1. Iterating over each number from 1 to `n`.
2. Checking if a number is a special number.
3. Counting the numbers that are not special.

To determine if a number is special, we will check each digit of the number to ensure it is either 2, 5, or 9. This can be accomplished by converting the number into a string or by extracting digits through modulus and division operations.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is approximately \(O(n \cdot d)\), where \(d\) is the maximum number of digits in `n`. For large `n`, this will be efficient enough.

### Code Implementation

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool isSpecial(int number) {
    while (number > 0) {
        int digit = number % 10;
        if (digit != 2 && digit != 5 && digit != 9) {
            return false;
        }
        number /= 10;
    }
    return true;
}

int countNonSpecialNumbers(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (!isSpecial(i)) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Enter a positive integer n: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    
    int result = countNonSpecialNumbers(n);
    std::cout << "The count of numbers between 1 and " << n << " that are not special is: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **isSpecial Function**:
    - This function checks if a given number is special by examining each digit.
    - If any digit is not 2, 5, or 9, the function returns `false`.

2. **countNonSpecialNumbers Function**:
    - This function counts the numbers from 1 to `n` that are not special.
    - It iterates through all numbers in the range and utilizes the `isSpecial` function to filter out non-special numbers.

3. **main Function**:
    - Reads the input value `n`.
    - Computes and prints the count of non-special numbers between 1 and `n`.

Feel free to test and optimize further based on specific constraints and requirements!
