[Leetcode 1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1143)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

### Example
1. **Input**: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"  
   **Output**: 3  
   **Explanation**: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
   
2. **Input**: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"  
   **Output**: 3  
   **Explanation**: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

3. **Input**: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"  
   **Output**: 0  
   **Explanation**: There is no common subsequence, so the result is 0.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Length**: What is the maximum length for the input strings?
   - The length of both text1 and text2 will be in the range [1, 1000].

2. **Character Set**: What characters are the strings composed of?
   - The input strings consist of only lowercase English characters.

3. **Algorithm**: Are there any constraints on the time complexity or space complexity for the solution?
   - The problem does not impose any specific constraints on the complexity, but an efficient algorithm is preferred.

## Strategy
We'll use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. The idea is to build a 2D table (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of the substrings `text1[0...i-1]` and `text2[0...j-1]`. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `text1` and `text2`, respectively.
2. Iterate through each character pair `(i, j)`:
   - If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
3. The value `dp[m][n]` will contain the length of the longest common subsequence of `text1` and `text2`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(std::string text1, std::string text2) {
        int m = text1.size();
        int n = text2.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m+1, std::vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `text1` and `n` is the length of `text2`. We have to fill out an `m+1` by `n+1` matrix, performing constant-time operations in each cell.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is also `O(m * n)` because we need to store the `dp` matrix of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
