[Leetcode 1550. Three Consecutive Odds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1550)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example
- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
  Output: false
  Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
  ```
- Example 2:
  ```
  Input: arr = [1,2,34,3,4,5,7,23,12]
  Output: true
  Explanation: [5, 7, 23] are three consecutive odd numbers.
  ```

### Constraints
- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

---

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   **A:** No, based on the constraints, the values range from 1 to 1000.
2. **Q:** Is the array guaranteed to have at least three elements?
   **A:** No, the length of the array can be as short as 1.

---

## Strategy
1. **Iterate through the array:** We will use a loop to go through each element of the array.
2. **Check for three consecutive odd numbers:** Use a sliding window of three elements to check if they are all odd. If they are, return `true`.
3. **Return `false` if no such triplet is found:** If the loop completes without finding three consecutive odd numbers, return `false`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool threeConsecutiveOdds(vector<int>& arr) {
        // We need to check if there are at least three elements
        if (arr.size() < 3) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Iterate through the array with a window of size 3
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size() - 2; ++i) {
            if (arr[i] % 2 != 0 && arr[i + 1] % 2 != 0 && arr[i + 2] % 2 != 0) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        // If no triplet of consecutive odd numbers is found, return false
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We iterate through the array once, using a window of size 3.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
