[Leetcode 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1289)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to find the minimum falling path sum with different start indices in a given `n x n` integer matrix `grid`. Here, a falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row such that the next row's chosen element is not in the same column as the previous row's chosen element. The minimum falling path sum is the smallest possible sum of these paths. 

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: 13
Explanation: 
The path 1 → 5 → 7 gives the minimum sum = 13.
```

### Constraints:
- `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `-99 <= grid[i][j] <= 99`

## Clarifying Questions
- Can the elements in the grid be negative? Yes, the constraints indicate that elements can range from -99 to 99.
- Is there any restriction on the values within the rows? No, every element can be within the given range irrespective of their row or column.
- Are we correctly understanding that each element in the next row cannot be in the same column as the previous element? Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming:** 
   - Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`.
   - Initialize the first row of `dp` with the values from the first row of the grid.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the subsequent rows, calculate the minimum path sum considering the restriction that the next column cannot be the same as the previous column. This means for every cell `(i, j)`, we should consider the minimum of all other columns in the previous row except column `j`.
   - Finally, find the minimum value in the last row of the DP array, which gives the desired result.

2. **Optimization:**
   - To optimize finding the minimum value excluding a column from the previous row, keep track of the minimum and second minimum values in each row.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n^2) because we iterate through each cell of the matrix and perform a constant amount of work for each cell.
- Space complexity will be O(n^2) for the DP array, which could potentially be reduced to O(n) if we overwrite rows in a single dimension array.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        // Initialize the first row of dp array
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            int min1 = INT_MAX, min2 = INT_MAX;

            // Find the minimum and the second minimum values in the previous row
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (dp[i-1][j] < min1) {
                    min2 = min1;
                    min1 = dp[i-1][j];
                } else if (dp[i-1][j] < min2) {
                    min2 = dp[i-1][j];
                }
            }

            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                // Choose min1 unless it is the same column
                if (dp[i-1][j] == min1) {
                    dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min1;
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the minimum value in the last row
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            ans = min(ans, dp[n-1][j]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

This code follows the strategy to maintain the minimum path sum in a dynamic programming manner, optimizing finding the minimum path excluding certain columns by tracking the smallest and the second smallest values.
