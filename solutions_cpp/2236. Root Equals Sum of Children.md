[Leetcode 2236. Root Equals Sum of Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2236)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree where the root node has an integer value `val` and two children with their own integer values `left` and `right`, determine if the value of the root node is equal to the sum of its children. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly three nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are the integers in the nodes always non-negative?
   - Can the value of the nodes be zero?
   - Is the structure of the tree guaranteed to always be valid as described (exactly three nodes)?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the output be a boolean value indicating whether the root value equals the sum of the children's values?

Given the typical problem constraints and based on LeetCode's platform, these assumptions will be considered:
- The tree consists exactly of three nodes.
- Node values are valid integers.
- The function will return a boolean value.

### Code
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr || root->left == nullptr || root->right == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        return (root->val == root->left->val + root->right->val);
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Tree Structure Validation:**
   - Ensure the root and its children are not null. However, given the problem constraints, this validation can be seen as redundant but is included for fault tolerance.

2. **Summation Check:**
   - Calculate the sum of the values stored in `root->left->val` and `root->right->val`.
   - Compare this calculated sum to `root->val`.
   - Return `true` if they are equal, otherwise `false`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because:
- The operation consists of a few constant-time checks and a simple arithmetic operation.
- There is no traversal or recursion over the tree, hence no dependency on input size (which is fixed to three nodes).

The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) because only a constant amount of extra space is used.
