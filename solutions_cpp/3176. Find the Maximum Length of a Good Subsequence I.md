[Leetcode 3176. Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3176)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, find the maximum length of a good subsequence of `s`. A subsequence is considered good if it contains no consecutive `1`s.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a "subsequence" in this context?**
   * A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
   
2. **What is the significance of not having consecutive `1`s?**
   * For the subsequence to be "good," it must not contain any pair of consecutive `1`s.

3. **What is the constraint on the size of the string?**
   * This is essential to understand the time complexity considerations. For simplicity, let's assume the length of the string `s` can be up to 10^5.

### Strategy

1. **Greedy Approach**:
   * Traverse the string and keep track of the last character added to the subsequence.
   * Only add a character to the subsequence if it doesn't violate the "no consecutive `1`s" rule.

### Implementation in C++

Here is the C++ implementation of the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int maxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(string s) {
    // Variable to store the previous character added to the good subsequence
    char prev = '0'; // Starting with '0' so it can always accept the first '1'
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '0' || (c == '1' && prev == '0')) {
            maxLength++;
            prev = c; // Update the previous character
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    string s = "1001010001";  // Example input string
    cout << "Maximum length of a good subsequence: " << maxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are making a single pass through the string.
* **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are only using a few extra variables for our calculations.

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum length of a good subsequence by ensuring no two consecutive `1`s are present in the subsequence.
