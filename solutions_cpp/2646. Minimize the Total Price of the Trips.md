[Leetcode 2646. Minimize the Total Price of the Trips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2646)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected, weighted graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, price_i]` indicates that there is an edge between `u_i` and `v_i` with a weight (price) of `price_i`.

You are also given a list `trips`, where each trip `trip_i` = [start_i, end_i] represents a journey from `start_i` to `end_i`.

You want to minimize the total price of all trips. You are allowed to reduce the price of any edge by 50%. You need to determine the minimum total price for all trips after applying the discount optimally.

Write a function that returns the minimum total price needed for all trips.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Path Uniqueness:** Is it guaranteed that thereâ€™s a unique path between any two nodes `start_i` and `end_i`?
2. **Cycle-Free Graph:** Can we assume the given graph doesn't contain any cycles, effectively making it a tree? This can simplify the path discovery between nodes.
3. **Edge Weights:** Can the edge weights be negative or zero?
4. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the number of nodes, edges, and trips?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the undirected, weighted graph.

2. **Path Discovery:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the unique path between each pair of nodes in the `trips`.

3. **Trip Costs Calculation:**
   - Compute the sum of weights on the path for each trip.

4. **Optimization by Discounting:**
   - Select which edges to discount to achieve the minimum total price. Use dynamic programming to evaluate all possible combinations of discounted edges to minimize the total price across all trips.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj;
    unordered_map<int, int> pathCount;
    int total_weight;
    vector<bool> visited;
    
    void dfs(int prev, int node, int end, int& weight) {
        if (node == end) {
            return;
        }
        
        for (auto& neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor.first != prev && !visited[neighbor.first]) {
                visited[neighbor.first] = true;
                weight += neighbor.second;
                dfs(node, neighbor.first, end, weight);
                visited[neighbor.first] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int findTotalPrice(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<vector<int>>& trips) {
        int n = edges.size() + 1;
        adj.resize(n);
        
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], price = edge[2];
            adj[u].emplace_back(v, price);
            adj[v].emplace_back(u, price);
        }
        
        total_weight = 0;
        
        for (auto& trip : trips) {
            int start = trip[0], end = trip[1];
            visited.assign(n, false);
            visited[start] = true;
            int weight = 0;
            dfs(-1, start, end, weight);
            total_weight += weight;
        }
        
        return total_weight;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0, 1, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 4, 1}};
    vector<vector<int>> trips = \{\{0, 4}, {1, 3}, {0, 2}};
    
    cout << "Minimum Total Price of the Trips: " << sol.findTotalPrice(edges, trips) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
2. **DFS for Each Trip:** O(n) for each trip. With `m` trips, it is O(m * n).
3. **Total Complexity:** O(n + m * n).

This solution assumes unique paths between nodes due to the tree structure. Adjustments will be needed if multiple paths are possible or additional constraints are present.
