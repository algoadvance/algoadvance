[Leetcode 2914. Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2914)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. A binary string is said to be "beautiful" if it doesn't contain the substring "010".

Your task is to find the minimum number of changes required to make the given binary string beautiful. You can change any character in the string to either '0' or '1'.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The problem typically doesn't specify, so we assume it could be up to the maximum limit for an efficient algorithm.

2. **Is the input guaranteed to be valid consisting only of '0' and '1'?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, the string `s` consists only of '0' and '1'.

3. **Can the changes be made at any position in the string?**
   - Yes, you can change any character at any position in the string to either '0' or '1'.

### Strategy

We need to iterate through the given string and check for the substring "010". Whenever we find this pattern, we need at least one change to break it. We can make the minimal change by converting the middle '1' to '0' or either '0' to '1'.

Steps:
1. Iterate through the string.
2. Whenever you encounter the substring "010", increment the change count.
3. Modify the string by changing either '0' or '1' to prevent counting overlapping substrings.

### Code

Here is the C++ solution to implement the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minChangesToBeautifulBinaryString(const std::string &s) {
    int changes = 0;
    std::string modifiableString = s;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < modifiableString.length() - 2; ++i) {
        if (modifiableString.substr(i, 3) == "010") {
            changes++;
            // Modify the string to avoid overlapping issues
            // Change the last '0' to '1'
            modifiableString[i + 2] = '1'; // Alternatively: modifiableString[i + 1] = '1';
        }
    }
    
    return changes;
}

int main() {
    std::string s;
    std::cout << "Enter a binary string: ";
    std::cin >> s;
    
    int result = minChangesToBeautifulBinaryString(s);
    std::cout << "Minimum number of changes: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the binary string.

- **Explanation:** We iterate through the string once, examining every substring of length 3. Each substring check and possible modification operation takes constant time.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the `modifiableString`.

If you need further optimization, the original string can be modified directly. However, we've used an additional string for clarity and to avoid modifying the input string in the detailed example.
