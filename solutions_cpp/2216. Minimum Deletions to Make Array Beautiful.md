[Leetcode 2216. Minimum Deletions to Make Array Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2216)
## Problem Statement

**LeetCode Problem 2216: Minimum Deletions to Make Array Beautiful**

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to delete exactly `k` elements from this array such that the resulting array is "beautiful".

A "beautiful" array is defined as follows:

1. For every index `i` in the array (0-based), `i and (i+1)` (logical and operator) should not both be present in the "beautiful" array with the same value.

Return the minimum number of deletions required to make the array beautiful.

### Example 1

``` 
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,5], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The resulting array can be [1,2,3,5] which is beautiful.
```

### Example 2

``` 
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete the second '1' and the fourth '1', then the resulting array is [1,1] which is beautiful.
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same element appear multiple times and still be beautiful?**
   - Yes, as long as the criteria for beautiful arrays is met, which means the condition `i and (i+1)` having the same value does not occur.

2. **Is there a guaranteed solution such that a beautiful array is always possible?**
   - Yes, by the definition given, it should always be possible to delete certain elements to make it beautiful.

3. **Should the output be the minimum deletions required or the number of deletions actually performed to meet the criteria?**
   - The output should be the minimum number of deletions required.

## Strategy

Our objective is to enforce that no two consecutive indices have the same value in the array. We can iteratively process the array, keeping track of the number of deletions required to maintain this property.

1. Initialize a counter for deletions.
2. Traverse through the array, starting from the first element.
3. For each element, check if it is equal to the next; if they are the same increment the deletion counter.
4. Skip elements that would make the array non-beautiful until we find a distinct value.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int minDeletionsToMakeArrayBeautiful(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int deletions = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
            ++deletions;
            // To make sure we are not deleting elements more than required
            if(deletions == k) break;
            // Skip the next element to maintain the beautiful property
            ++i;
        }
    }
    
    return deletions;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse the array only once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space irrespective of input size.

The algorithm efficiently traverses the array, incrementing the deletion counter whenever consecutive elements are found to be the same, and handles them accordingly. This ensures that we find the minimum number of deletions required.
