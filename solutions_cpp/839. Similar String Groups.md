[Leetcode 839. Similar String Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l839)
## Problem Statement

839. Similar String Groups

Two strings `X` and `Y` are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of `X` to get `Y`. We can swap letters any number of times, but only two at a time.

A string `A` is in the same group as string `B` if `A` is similar to `B`.

Given an array `strs` of strings, return the number of groups of similar strings.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the array `strs`?**
   - The length of the array should be reasonably mentioned, typically would not exceed 2000.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of each string in `strs`?**
   - Each string length should typically not exceed 100.
   
3. **Are all strings in the input array `strs` of the same length?**
   - Yes, as per the problem's constraints.

4. **Is it guaranteed that all characters in the strings are lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, as per the problem's constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Define Similarity:**
   - Two strings are similar if they can be made identical by swapping two characters any number of times.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent each string as a node in a graph.
   - An edge exists from node `i` to node `j` if the corresponding strings `strs[i]` and `strs[j]` are similar.
   
3. **DFS/BFS for Connected Components:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the number of connected components in the graph.

4. **String Similarity Check:**
   - Two strings of the same length are similar if they have exactly two positions that differ, or are exactly the same.
   
## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

bool areSimilar(const std::string &a, const std::string &b) {
    int diffCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i) {
        if (a[i] != b[i]) {
            ++diffCount;
            if (diffCount > 2) return false;
        }
    }
    return diffCount == 2 || diffCount == 0;
}

void dfs(int node, std::vector<bool> &visited, const std::vector<std::vector<int>> &adj) {
    std::stack<int> stack;
    stack.push(node);
    
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        int u = stack.top();
        stack.pop();
        visited[u] = true;
        
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            if (!visited[v]) {
                stack.push(v);
            }
        }
    }
}

int numSimilarGroups(std::vector<std::string>& strs) {
    int n = strs.size();
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> adj(n);
    
    // Build adjacency list
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (areSimilar(strs[i], strs[j])) {
                adj[i].push_back(j);
                adj[j].push_back(i);
            }
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    int numGroups = 0;
    
    // Perform DFS to find connected components
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            dfs(i, visited, adj);
            ++numGroups;
        }
    }
    
    return numGroups;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building Graph:** `O(n^2 * m)` where `n` is the number of strings, and `m` is the length of each string.
- **DFS Traversal:** `O(n + E)` where `E` is the total number of edges in the graph.

Given the problem constraints, the solution should be efficient enough.

Overall time complexity: `O(n^2 * m)`
