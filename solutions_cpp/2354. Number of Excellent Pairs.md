[Leetcode 2354. Number of Excellent Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2354)
**Problem Statement:**

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, an excellent pair is defined as a pair `(num1, num2)` where `num1` and `num2` are in `nums` and the number of distinct bits in the bitwise OR of `num1` and `num2` is at least `k`.

Return the number of excellent pairs.

**Strategy:**

1. **Clarify Requirements:**
   - We need to count unique excellent pairs (allowing `num1` and `num2` to be identical as long as the condition is met).
   - The bitwise OR operation and counting distinct bits set to 1 are key.
   - `k` is the threshold for the number of set bits.

2. **Data Representation:**
   - Use a set to store unique elements in `nums` since duplicates don't affect the result.
   - Precompute the number of set bits (popcount) for each number in the set.

3. **Combine Pairs Efficiently:**
   - For each element, consider pairs with other elements (including itself).
   - If the number of set bits in the logical OR \( \text{popcount}(a \,|\, b) \) of two numbers in the set is at least `k`.

4. **Optimization Insight:**
   - Precompute and store the number of `set bits` for each unique number.
   - Use two nested loops to count excellent pairs using the precomputed bit counts.

**Code Implementation:**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <bitset>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int bitCount(int num) {
        return bitset<32>(num).count();
    }

    long long countExcellentPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_set<int> unique_nums(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        vector<int> bit_counts;

        // Precompute the bit counts for unique numbers
        for (int num : unique_nums) {
            bit_counts.push_back(bitCount(num));
        }

        long long count = 0;
        int n = bit_counts.size();

        // Count all combinations that meet the requirement
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                if ((bit_counts[i] + bit_counts[j]) >= k) {
                    count += (i == j) ? 1 : 2;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 1};
    int k = 3;
    cout << solution.countExcellentPairs(nums, k) << endl; // Example output
    return 0;
}
```

**Time Complexity:**

1. **Insert elements into set and compute bit counts:** \(O(n)\)
2. **Precompute bit counts (creation and storage):** \(O(u)\), where `u` is the number of unique elements.
3. **Nested loops to count pairs:** \(O(u^2)\), where `u` is the number of unique elements.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + u^2)\), where `n` is the length of the input array and `u` is the number of unique integers in the array.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is \(O(u)\) due to the storage of unique elements and their bit counts. 

This implementation effectively balances the need for accurate pair counting with efficiency in computation, avoiding redundant calculations.
