[Leetcode 1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1815)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `batchSize` and an integer array `groups` where `groups[i]` is the size of the i-th group of customers that wants to get fresh donuts. Each group will get donuts in batches of size `batchSize` (i.e., `batchSize` donuts in each batch).
If the sum of group sizes in one of the batches is divisible by `batchSize`, then all the customers of that batch will be satisfied and will leave the shop.
Your task is to determine the maximum number of groups that get fresh donuts and leave the shop.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, the primary strategy is understanding how to maximize the number of satisfied groups by optimally creating batches of donuts. Here are the steps we'll take:

1. **Remainder Calculation**: Because what we care about is whether the sum of group sizes is divisible by `batchSize`, we should work with remainders of `groups` elements when divided by `batchSize`.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: We'll likely use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to efficiently find the optimal batches. Given the constraints, a memoization approach will significantly reduce redundant calculations.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we dive into the code, here are a few questions that could help clarify the task:
1. What are the constraints on the size of `groups` and values in `groups`?
2. Can there be groups with size `0`?
3. Are the elements in `groups` always positive?
4. Does the total number of groups matter, or just the satisfaction based on divisibility?

Assuming typical constraints on the problem (1 <= group sizes <= 10^9 and `batchSize` <= 9), we will proceed with the coding solution.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxHappyGroups(int batchSize, std::vector<int>& groups) {
        std::vector<int> count(batchSize, 0);
        for (int group : groups) {
            count[group % batchSize]++;
        }
        
        int result = count[0];   // Groups with no remainder are already satisfied
        int halfSize = batchSize / 2;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= halfSize; ++i) {
            if (i == batchSize - i) {
                result += count[i] / 2;
            } else {
                int pairs = std::min(count[i], count[batchSize - i]);
                result += pairs;
                count[i] -= pairs;
                count[batchSize - i] -= pairs;
            }
        }
        
        // Use DP to maximize satisfied groups from remaining groups
        std::unordered_map<int, int> memo;
        int maxGroups = dfs(count, batchSize, 0, memo);
        
        return result + maxGroups;
    }

private:
    // Helper function for DFS
    int dfs(std::vector<int>& count, int batchSize, int currentRemainder, std::unordered_map<int, int>& memo) {
        int state = getState(count);
        if (memo.count(state)) {
            return memo[state];
        }
        
        int n = count.size();
        int maxGroups = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (count[i] > 0) {
                count[i]--;
                int newRemainder = (currentRemainder + i) % batchSize;
                int addGroup = (newRemainder == 0) ? 1 : 0;
                
                maxGroups = std::max(maxGroups, 
                                     dfs(count, batchSize, newRemainder, memo) + addGroup);
                
                count[i]++;
            }
        }

        memo[state] = maxGroups;
        return maxGroups;
    }
    
    // convert count vector to a unique state
    int getState(std::vector<int>& count) {
        int state = 0, base = 1;
        for (int x : count) {
            state += x * base;
            base *= 31;   // Similar to polynomial rolling hash
        }
        return state;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is complex due to the DP approach dealing with different states. However, it's optimized with memoization.
- The heaviest part is the DFS which explores various states but is pruned significantly by memoization.

By focusing on the remainders and optimizing batch formation with DP and memoization, this approach aims to solve the problem efficiently within typical constraints.
