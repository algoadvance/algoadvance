[Leetcode 36. Valid Sudoku](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l36)
### Problem Statement
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. A Sudoku board is valid if:

1. Each row contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid contains the digits 1-9 without repetition.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: Is the board always 9x9?
   - Yes, you can assume the board is always 9x9.

2. **Characters**: Confirm that only digits ('1'-'9') and '.' are valid characters in the grid.
   - Yes, only '1'-'9' and '.' will appear in the grid.

3. **Input format**: Is the input provided as a vector of vector of chars?
   - Yes, the input is provided as a vector of vector of chars.

### Strategy
To determine if the Sudoku board is valid:
1. Use three 2D arrays (`rows`, `cols`, `boxes`) to keep track of the digits we have seen in each row, column, and 3x3 box.
2. Iterate over each cell of the board.
3. For each digit:
   - Check if it has already appeared in the current row, column, or 3x3 box using the `rows`, `cols`, and `boxes` arrays.
   - If it has, return false immediately since the board is invalid.
   - Otherwise, mark this digit as seen in the respective row, column, and 3x3 box.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        vector<vector<bool>> rows(9, vector<bool>(9, false));
        vector<vector<bool>> cols(9, vector<bool>(9, false));
        vector<vector<bool>> boxes(9, vector<bool>(9, false));

        for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue;
                int num = board[i][j] - '1'; // convert char to int (0-8)
                int boxIndex = (i / 3) * 3 + j / 3;
                if (rows[i][num] || cols[j][num] || boxes[boxIndex][num]) {
                    return false;
                }
                rows[i][num] = cols[j][num] = boxes[boxIndex][num] = true;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - We iterate over each cell in the 9x9 board exactly once, performing constant-time operations for each cell.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use three 2D arrays of fixed size 9x9, which is effectively a constant amount of extra space.
