[Leetcode 1862. Sum of Floored Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1862)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. The `floor` of an integer `k` is defined as the greatest integer less than or equal to `k`. A pair `(x, y)` is a `floored pair` if `x` is divisible by `y`. For each element `x` in `nums`, for each element `y` in `nums`, compute the floor of `x / y`.

Return the sum of these floors for all pairs `(x, y)` in `nums`.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 5, 9]
Output: 10
Explanation:
floor(2/2) + floor(2/5) + floor(2/9) + 
floor(5/2) + floor(5/5) + floor(5/9) + 
floor(9/2) + floor(9/5) + floor(9/9) = 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `nums`?**: 
   - What is the range of the values in the nums array?
   - How many elements can be present in the nums array?

2. **Expected Output**:
   - Should the output be an integer representing the sum of the floors?

3. **Allowed Operations**:
   - Are there any constraints on the operations used? (e.g., should we avoid floating point divisions)

## Strategy

1. **Compute Frequencies**:
   - First, determine the frequency of each number in the `nums` array.
   
2. **Iterate Over Divisors**:
   - For each divisor, compute how many times each multiple of this divisor can be divided by any number in `nums`.

3. **Compute Floors Efficiently**:
   - Instead of computing each `floor(x/y)` directly, utilize properties of floor division to minimize redundant computations.

4. **Sum Them Up**:
   - Accumulate the results for all pairs and return the total sum.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Use prefix sums to make repeated range queries more efficient.

## Time Complexity

- Preprocessing (building frequency counts): O(N)
- Main processing loop:
  - Typically a nested loop over integers up to the maximum value in the array, which can be very large.
  - Optimize inner computations with prefix sums and better logic to loop over relevant factors only.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfFlooredPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int MAX_VAL = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        vector<int> freq(MAX_VAL + 1, 0);

        // Count frequency of each number in the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        // Compute prefix sums for frequencies to speed up further calculations
        vector<long> prefixSum(MAX_VAL + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_VAL; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + freq[i];
        }

        long long result = 0;
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        // Sum of floored pairs
        for (int i = 1; i <= MAX_VAL; ++i) {
            if (freq[i] == 0) continue;
            for (int j = i; j <= MAX_VAL; j += i) {
                result += freq[i] * (prefixSum[min(j + i - 1, MAX_VAL)] - prefixSum[j - 1]) * (j / i);
                result %= MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) result;
    }
};
```

By using prefix sums and segmenting the problem into counting and applying modular arithmetic, this solution is efficient and is designed to handle the upper bounds of constraints typically found in coding problems like this.
