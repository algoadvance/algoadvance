[Leetcode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l153)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values), and a rotation of `nums`, where `nums` is rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]`.

For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Return the minimum element of this rotated array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Example 1:
- Input: `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`
- Output: `1`

### Example 2:
- Input: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`
- Output: `0`

### Example 3:
- Input: `nums = [11,13,15,17]`
- Output: `11`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q1**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - **A1**: The array will have at least one element and can be as large as \(10^5\).

2. **Q2**: Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - **A2**: No, all elements are distinct as per the problem statement.

3. **Q3**: Can the initial sorted array be rotated zero times (i.e., still sorted)?
   - **A3**: Yes, that's a possibility. In this case, the smallest element will be the first element.

## Strategy

To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array in \(O(\log n)\) time, we can utilize a modified binary search approach:

1. **Identifying the Minimum Element**:
   - The minimum element is the only one which is smaller than its previous neighbor (considering array in circular way).
   - We need to find the point where the sorted order breaks, which is exactly the minimum element.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `n-1`.
   - While `left < right`, compute the `mid` index.
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, it means the smallest value is to the right of `mid`, so move `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, it means the smallest value is to the left of `mid` (including `mid` itself), so move `right` to `mid`.
   - When `left == right`, the smallest value is found.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm performs binary search, so the time complexity is \(O(\log n)\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        // Binary search for the smallest element
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                // The minimum is to the right of mid
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // The minimum can be at mid or to the left of mid
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return nums[left];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    
    // Test Cases
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2};
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2};
    std::vector<int> nums3 = {11, 13, 15, 17};

    std::cout << sol.findMin(nums1) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    std::cout << sol.findMin(nums2) << std::endl; // Output: 0
    std::cout << sol.findMin(nums3) << std::endl; // Output: 11

    return 0;
}
```

This solution successfully finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using an efficient \(O(\log n)\) approach with binary search.
