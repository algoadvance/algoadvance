[Leetcode 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l357)
### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `n`, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where `0 <= x < 10^n`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum value of `n` we should consider?
   - For the problem constraints, usually, `0 <= n <= 10`.

2. Should we account for numbers with leading zeros?
   - No, since leading zeros do not represent valid numbers in decimal notation.

3. Should we include single-digit numbers in the count?
   - Yes, single-digit numbers (0 through 9) should be included in the count if `n >= 1`.

### Strategy
1. **Base case handling**:
    - When `n = 0`, there is only one number (0).

2. **General case**:
    - For `n = 1`, there are 10 numbers (0 through 9), all of which are unique.
    - For `n = 2`, we need to count numbers from 0 to 99 with unique digits. 
      - This involves choosing digits for each place ensuring no repeats.
    - For higher `n`, we generalize using permutation principles:
      - The first digit has 9 options (1-9).
      - The second digit has 9 remaining options (0, 2-9 if the first is 1).
      - The third digit has 8 options, etc.
    - Compute the sum iteratively for each valid configuration up to `n`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    int unique_count = 10; // For n = 1, 0 to 9.
    int available_digits = 9; // Digits left to use for each new place
    int current_count = 9; // Remaining unique numbers to place for each position

    int max_digits = std::min(n, 10); // Since 10! has only 10 digits.
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= max_digits; ++i) {
        current_count *= available_digits;
        unique_count += current_count;
        --available_digits;
    }

    return unique_count;
}

int main() {
    int n = 2; // Example input
    int result = countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(n);
    std::cout << "Count of numbers with unique digits for n = " << n << " is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The runtime complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because the loop runs at most up to 10 times regardless of the specific input value of `n`.
- Space complexity is \(O(1)\) as well, since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
