[Leetcode 2034. Stock Price Fluctuation ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2034)
## Problem Statement

You are given a stream of records about the stock price of a company over time. Each record contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that timestamp.

You are required to implement a `StockPrice` class with the following functions:

1. `void update(int timestamp, int price)`: Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp. If the timestamp already exists, it will overwrite the previous price.
   
2. `int current()`: Returns the latest price of the stock.
   
3. `int maximum()`: Returns the highest price of the stock.
   
4. `int minimum()`: Returns the lowest price of the stock.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are timestamps given in the records unique, or can there be multiple records with the same timestamp?
   - Each timestamp is unique but might be updated.
   
2. Is there a fixed range for the timestamps or the prices?
   - There is no fixed range for timestamps, but prices are non-negative integers.

3. Do we need to handle any invalid inputs like negative prices?
   - No, we can assume inputs are valid.
   
## Strategy

To solve this problem, the following data structures can be utilized:

1. A hash map (`std::unordered_map`) to store the prices with their timestamps.
2. A variable to keep track of the latest timestamp (`current_timestamp`).
3. Two priority queues (`std::priority_queue`) to efficiently get the maximum and minimum prices.

For the implementation of the priority queues, we need a max-heap for maximum prices and a min-heap for minimum prices. These priority queues will store pairs of (price, timestamp). Since prices can be updated, we'll need to validate the top of the heaps by consulting the hash map.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class StockPrice {
private:
    unordered_map<int, int> timePriceMap;
    int current_timestamp;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>> maxHeap; // max-heap for maximum price
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> minHeap; // min-heap for minimum price

public:
    StockPrice() : current_timestamp(0) {}

    void update(int timestamp, int price) {
        timePriceMap[timestamp] = price;
        if (timestamp >= current_timestamp) {
            current_timestamp = timestamp;
        }
        maxHeap.push({price, timestamp});
        minHeap.push({price, timestamp});
    }

    int current() {
        return timePriceMap[current_timestamp];
    }

    int maximum() {
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            auto [price, timestamp] = maxHeap.top();
            if (timePriceMap[timestamp] == price) {
                return price;
            }
            maxHeap.pop();
        }
        return INT_MIN;
    }

    int minimum() {
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            auto [price, timestamp] = minHeap.top();
            if (timePriceMap[timestamp] == price) {
                return price;
            }
            minHeap.pop();
        }
        return INT_MAX;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. `update(int timestamp, int price)`: 
   - Insertion into the hash map is O(1).
   - Insertion into the heaps is O(log n), where n is the number of elements.

2. `current()`: 
   - O(1), as it directly accesses the hash map.

3. `maximum()` and `minimum()`: 
   - Amortized O(1) for the removal of outdated elements, overall O(log n) for insertion and removal operations in the heaps.

Overall, the solution is efficient with respect to both time and space, making use of appropriate data structures to handle the required operations.
