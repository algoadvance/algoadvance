[Leetcode 1367. Linked List in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1367)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree root and a linked list with head as the first node. 

Return True if all the elements in the linked list starting from the head correspond to some downward path connected in the binary tree otherwise return False.

In other words, check if there exists a segment of valid paths in the binary tree that corresponds to the linked list starting from the head.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if either the binary tree or the linked list is empty?**
   - If the binary tree or the linked list is empty, return False as per typical assumptions for such problems.

2. **Can the values in the linked list and binary tree be negative?**
   - Yes, the values can be negative as we are only concerned with structural correspondence, not value bounds.

3. **Do the values of nodes in the linked list and binary tree have to match exactly?**
   - Yes, the values need to match exactly to proceed down a path in the binary tree corresponding to the linked list.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to proceed with the following steps:

1. **Traverse the binary tree**: Use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse every node in the binary tree.
2. **Check for path match**: From each node, try to match the linked list using another recursive function.
3. **Recursive path match function**: In this helper function, if the current tree node's value matches the current linked list node's value, proceed to the children of the tree node and the next node in the linked list.
4. **Return true if a complete path is found**, otherwise return false.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubPath(ListNode* head, TreeNode* root) {
        if (!head) return true;      // An empty linked list is a subpath of any tree.
        if (!root) return false;     // Non-empty linked list cannot be a subpath of an empty tree.
        
        return dfs(root, head) || isSubPath(head, root->left) || isSubPath(head, root->right);
    }
    
private:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) return true;     // Reached the end of the linked list, path found.
        if (!root) return false;    // Reached a leaf in the tree without matching all linked list nodes.

        // Check if the current node matches and continue to both child nodes
        if (root->val == head->val) {
            return dfs(root->left, head->next) || dfs(root->right, head->next);
        }
        
        return false;    // Current node doesn't match.
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:

1. The `isSubPath` function potentially calls itself for each node in the tree resulting in `O(N)` calls where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
2. For each call of `isSubPath`, the `dfs` function might traverse the depths of the tree and the linked list simultaneously. In the worst case, this might take `O(L)` where `L` is the length of the linked list.

Combining these, the time complexity is `O(N * L)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree and `L` is the length of the linked list.
