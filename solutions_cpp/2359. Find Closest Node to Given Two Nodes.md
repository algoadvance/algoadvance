[Leetcode 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2359)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **directed** graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge. The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to `edges[i]`. Specifically, if `edges[i] == -1`, node `i` does not have any outgoing edge.

You are also given two nodes `node1` and `node2`.

Return **the closest node** to both `node1` and `node2` that can be reached from both nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index. If no such node exists, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What input size constraints should we account for?
   - **A**: You can assume `1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000`.

2. **Q**: How are cycles in the graph handled?
   - **A**: Since each node has at most one outgoing edge, each component is a single path, possibly with a cycle at the end.

3. **Q**: Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?
   - **A**: No, the graph might not be fully connected.

## Strategy

- Perform BFS or DFS from both `node1` and `node2` to calculate the distance from each of these nodes to all other nodes. 

- Track the minimum distance to a common node from both `node1` and `node2`.

- Return the closest common node or the smallest index node in case of a tie.

### Steps:
1. Use two arrays `dist1` and `dist2` initialized to `inf` to store distances from `node1` and `node2` respectively.
2. Perform BFS/DFS from `node1` to fill `dist1`.
3. Perform BFS/DFS from `node2` to fill `dist2`.
4. Find the smallest common node with minimum combined distance. If multiple nodes have the same distance, choose the smallest index.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int closestMeetingNode(vector<int>& edges, int node1, int node2) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> dist1(n, numeric_limits<int>::max());
        vector<int> dist2(n, numeric_limits<int>::max());
        
        auto bfs = [&](int start, vector<int>& dist) {
            queue<int> q;
            q.push(start);
            dist[start] = 0;
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int node = q.front(); q.pop();
                int next = edges[node];
                if (next != -1 && dist[next] == numeric_limits<int>::max()) {
                    dist[next] = dist[node] + 1;
                    q.push(next);
                }
            }
        };
        
        bfs(node1, dist1);
        bfs(node2, dist2);
        
        int min_dist = numeric_limits<int>::max();
        int result = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (dist1[i] == numeric_limits<int>::max() || dist2[i] == numeric_limits<int>::max()) continue;
            
            int max_dist = max(dist1[i], dist2[i]);
            if (max_dist < min_dist || (max_dist == min_dist && i < result)) {
                min_dist = max_dist;
                result = i;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **BFS from node1**: `O(n)`
2. **BFS from node2**: `O(n)`
3. **Finding minimal index with combined distances**: `O(n)`

So, overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

Space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the distance arrays.
