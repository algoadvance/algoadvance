[Leetcode 155. Min Stack](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l155)
## Problem Statement

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element val onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Should the stack handle only integer values?
   - **A:** Yes, the stack will handle integers.

2. **Q:** Can we use additional data structures?
   - **A:** Yes, you can use additional data structures as long as the time complexity requirements are met.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values that can be pushed (like negative numbers or very large numbers)?
   - **A:** No constraints are specifically mentioned, implying any integer is valid.

4. **Q:** What should happen on a pop operation if the stack is empty?
   - **A:** This shouldn't happen as per typical LeetCode problems, but ensuring robust code for this case avoids runtime errors.

5. **Q:** Should we handle exceptions or errors for operations on an empty stack?
   - **A:** Typically, LeetCode problems assume valid operations. However, graceful handling of such cases is good practice.

## Strategy

To maintain the minimum element, we can use an auxiliary stack that keeps track of the minimums. Hereâ€™s the idea:

1. **Main Stack:** The regular stack to store all the values.
2. **Min Stack:** An auxiliary stack to store the minimum values at each level. 

When pushing a new value:
- Add it to the main stack.
- Compare it with the current minimum (top of the min stack) and push the smaller value onto the min stack.

When popping a value:
- Pop from the main stack.
- Pop from the min stack.

When retrieving the minimum:
- The top of the min stack is always the current minimum.

This ensures all operations take constant time O(1).

## Code

```cpp
#include <stack>
#include <stdexcept>

class MinStack {
public:
    MinStack() {}

    void push(int val) {
        mainStack.push(val);
        if (minStack.empty() || val <= minStack.top()) {
            minStack.push(val);
        } else {
            minStack.push(minStack.top());
        }
    }

    void pop() {
        if (!mainStack.empty()) {
            mainStack.pop();
            minStack.pop();
        }
    }

    int top() {
        if (!mainStack.empty()) {
            return mainStack.top();
        }
        throw std::runtime_error("Stack is empty");
    }

    int getMin() {
        if (!minStack.empty()) {
            return minStack.top();
        }
        throw std::runtime_error("Stack is empty");
    }

private:
    std::stack<int> mainStack;
    std::stack<int> minStack;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Push Operation:** O(1) because pushing onto a stack takes constant time.
- **Pop Operation:** O(1) because popping from a stack takes constant time.
- **Top Operation:** O(1) because accessing the top element takes constant time.
- **Get Min Operation:** O(1) because accessing the top element of the min stack takes constant time.

This implementation ensures all operations have the required O(1) time complexity.
