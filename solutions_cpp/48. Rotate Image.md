[Leetcode 48. Rotate Image](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l48)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **Do not** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

### Constraints:
- `matrix.length == n`
- `matrix[i].length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we use extra space to store intermediate results?**
   - No, the problem explicitly states to rotate the matrix in-place without using extra space for another matrix.

2. **Is the input matrix always square?**
   - Yes, the input matrix is always `n x n`.

3. **What is the range of the size of the matrix `n`?**
   - The size `n` ranges from 1 to 20.

## Strategy

To achieve the in-place rotation of the matrix:
1. **Transpose the matrix:** Convert rows to columns.
2. **Reverse each row:** To get the required 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Here are the steps in detail:
1. **Transpose the matrix:**
   - Swap `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]` for each element in the upper triangle of the matrix (i.e., where `i < j`).
2. **Reverse each row:** 
   - For each row in the matrix, reverse the row.

### Example:
Given matrix:

```
[
 [1, 2, 3],
 [4, 5, 6],
 [7, 8, 9]
]
```

**Transpose the matrix:**

```
[
 [1, 4, 7],
 [2, 5, 8],
 [3, 6, 9]
]
```

**Reverse each row:**

```
[
 [7, 4, 1],
 [8, 5, 2],
 [9, 6, 3]
]
```

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void rotate(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    
    // Transpose the matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            std::swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
        }
    }
    
    // Reverse each row
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Transposing the matrix:** O(n^2) - Each element is visited once.
- **Reversing each row:** O(n^2) - Each element is visited once when reversing the rows.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**. 

## Space Complexity

Since we are performing the operation in-place and not allocating additional space for another matrix, the space complexity is **O(1)** (excluding the space required for the input matrix itself).

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification.
