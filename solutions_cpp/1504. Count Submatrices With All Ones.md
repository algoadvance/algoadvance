[Leetcode 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1504)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return the number of submatrices that have all ones.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size of the matrix?**
   - This information is crucial to understand the constraints and efficiency of the solution. 
2. **Should we consider 1x1 submatrices in our count?**
   - Yes, all possible submatrices that contain only ones should be counted.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved by transforming the matrix to compute the number of all-ones submatrices in an efficient manner. Here is a detailed plan:

1. **Precompute Heights**:
   - We'll create a height array `height[i][j]` where `height[i][j]` represents the number of consecutive ones in the column `j` up to row `i`.
   
2. **Count Submatrices**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, assume it as the bottom-right corner of the submatrix.
   - Scan upwards and compute the minimum height for all columns, which will determine the possible number of submatrices ending at `(i, j)`.

### Code

Here's the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> 

class Solution {
public:
    int numSubmat(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the height matrix
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> height(m, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    height[i][j] = (i == 0) ? 1 : height[i-1][j] + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        
        // Step 2: Count submatrices for each cell as bottom-right corner
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int minHeight = height[i][j];
                for (int k = j; k >= 0 && minHeight > 0; --k) {
                    minHeight = std::min(minHeight, height[i][k]);
                    count += minHeight;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation Step**: Filling the `height` array takes `O(m * n)` time.
- **Counting Step**: For each cell in the matrix, we might scan its entire row, yielding another `O(m * n)` time.
  
Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)**.
