[Leetcode 2817. Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2817)
### Problem Statement
In this problem, you are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `x`. Your task is to find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` of the array such that `|i - j| >= x`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the size of the array `arr`?
   - What is the range of the integers within the array `arr`?
   - What is the range of the integer `x`?

   These help in understanding the constraints which might influence the choice of the algorithm.

2. **Output:**
   - What should be returned if there's no valid pair with |i - j| >= x?

### Strategy
1. **Initial Constraints Handling:**
   - If `x` is greater or equal to the length of the array `arr`, it's impossible to have any valid pair, hence we can return a large number or some indication of no valid pairs.

2. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - The brute force way to find the minimum absolute difference with the constraint would involve a nested loop, which could lead to O(n^2) complexity. This is inefficient for large arrays.
   - To ensure efficiency, we can use a data structure with quick lookup times, such as a balanced binary search tree (BST) to store and lookup elements in the right subarray efficiently.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Iterate over the array from the start to the end.
   - Maintain a BST for elements that are `x` distance behind the current index.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, query the BST for the closest values and update the minimum difference.
   - Insert the current element into the BST for future comparisons.

### Code

```cpp
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int minAbsoluteDifference(std::vector<int>& arr, int x) {
        if (x >= arr.size()) {
            return -1;  // Or any indicator that there is no valid pair.
        }

        std::set<int> bst;
        int minDiff = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            // Insert elements that are at least x positions behind the current index
            if (i >= x) {
                bst.insert(arr[i - x]);
            }

            // Find the closest elements in the BST to arr[i]
            if (!bst.empty()) {
                if (auto it = bst.lower_bound(arr[i]); it != bst.end()) {
                    minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(arr[i] - *it));
                }
                if (it != bst.begin()) {
                    it--;
                    minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(arr[i] - *it));
                }
            }
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Insertion and Lookup in BST:** O(log n)
- **Loop Over the Array:** O(n)
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

This provides an efficient solution to find the minimum absolute difference with the given constraints without resorting to an O(n^2) brute force approach.
