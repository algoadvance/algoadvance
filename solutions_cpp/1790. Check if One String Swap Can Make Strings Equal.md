[Leetcode 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1790)
## Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem 1790**: Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A string swap is defined as choosing two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) of a string and swapping the characters at these indices.

Return `true` if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on any of the strings. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `s1` and `s2` always of equal length?**
   - Yes, the problem states that both strings are of equal length.
   
2. **What is the maximum possible length of the strings?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically, problems do not impose overly large lengths. 

3. **Is there any constraint on the characters in the strings?**
   - No, the characters can be any valid characters.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the approach can be as follows:

1. **Check if Both Strings are Already Equal**:
   - If `s1` is equal to `s2`, we can return `true` immediately.

2. **Identify Mismatch Indices**:
   - Traverse both strings simultaneously and record the indices where the characters differ.

3. **Evaluate the Mismatch Indices**:
   - If there are exactly two mismatching positions and swapping the characters at these indices in `s1` makes it equal to `s2`, then return `true`. 
   - For all other cases, return `false`.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool areAlmostEqual(string s1, string s2) {
    if (s1 == s2) return true;

    vector<int> mismatchIndices;
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i) {
        if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
            mismatchIndices.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    // There should be exactly 2 mismatch positions
    if (mismatchIndices.size() != 2) return false;

    int i1 = mismatchIndices[0], i2 = mismatchIndices[1];

    // Swap characters at these two positions in s1
    swap(s1[i1], s1[i2]);
    
    // Check if they become equal
    return s1 == s2;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input strings. The reason is that we are performing a single pass to compare the strings and store mismatched indices, and another very small constant-time operation to check and swap characters if needed. This makes the operation as efficient as possible for this problem.
