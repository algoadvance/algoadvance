[Leetcode 925. Long Pressed Name](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l925)
### Problem Statement

Suppose your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get long pressed, and the character might be typed one or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friend's name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in "alex" were long pressed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000`
- `name` and `typed` consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the input strings guaranteed to be non-empty?
    - Yes, as per the constraints.
2. Can we assume that both `name` and `typed` will only contain lowercase English letters?
    - Yes, as per the constraints.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using a two-pointer technique. The idea is to iterate through both strings simultaneously, comparing characters and handling long presses as needed.

1. Use two pointers, `i` for `name` and `j` for `typed`.
2. Iterate through the `typed` string with pointer `j`:
   - If the character at `typed[j]` matches the character at `name[i]`, move both pointers `i` and `j` forward.
   - If they don't match, then check if `typed[j]` matches `typed[j-1]` (indicating a long press). If it does, only move `j` forward.
   - If neither condition holds, return `false` because the strings don't match the criteria.
3. After the loop, check if we have traversed the entire `name` (i.e., `i == name.length()`).

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isLongPressedName(string name, string typed) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (j < typed.length()) {
            if (i < name.length() && name[i] == typed[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (j > 0 && typed[j] == typed[j - 1]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return i == name.length();
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `typed` string. This is because each character in `typed` is processed at most once.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using only a few extra variables.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check if `typed` can be derived from `name` considering the long press scenario.
