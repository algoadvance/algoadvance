[Leetcode 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1184)
### Problem Statement:
You have a circular route of bus stops represented as an array where `distance[i]` is the distance between the `i-th` bus stop and the `(i+1)th` bus stop (with the route wrapping around such that `distance[n-1]` is the distance between the `n-1`th bus stop and the `0th` bus stop). Given a start and destination stop, you are to find the shortest distance between the two stops.

Implement the function:
```cpp
int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination);
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Is `start` always less than `destination`, or can they be in any order?
   **A:** They can be in any order. So you need to consider the direction in which you calculate the distance.
   
2. **Q:** Can `start` and `destination` be the same?
   **A:** No, according to the problem, start and destination will always be different.

### Strategy:
1. Calculate the distance going clockwise from start to destination.
2. Calculate the total distance of the circle.
3. Calculate the distance going counterclockwise, which is the total distance minus the clockwise distance.
4. Return the minimum of the two distances.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination) {
    // If start is greater than destination, swap them to simplify the problem
    if (start > destination) {
        swap(start, destination);
    }
    
    int clockwiseDistance = 0;
    for (int i = start; i < destination; ++i) {
        clockwiseDistance += distance[i];
    }
    
    int totalDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < distance.size(); ++i) {
        totalDistance += distance[i];
    }
    
    int counterclockwiseDistance = totalDistance - clockwiseDistance;
    
    return min(clockwiseDistance, counterclockwiseDistance);
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the `distance` array. This is because we need to traverse the array once to compute the total sum and another traversal to compute the clockwise distance.
