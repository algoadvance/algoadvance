[Leetcode 879. Profitable Schemes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l879)
### Problem Statement

You are given `G`, the number of gang members, and `P`, the minimum profit required. Additionally, you are given two arrays: `group` and `profit`, where `group[i]` is the number of members required to participate in the i-th scheme and `profit[i]` is the profit that the i-th scheme generates.

Your task is to find the number of different ways to choose any subset of these schemes such that the total number of gang members employed in these schemes is at most `G`, and the total profit is at least `P`. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `G` or `P` be zero?
   - Yes. 
2. Are `group` and `profit` arrays the same length?
   - Yes, both arrays have the same length which represents the number of available schemes.
3. What is the size range of the input arrays?
   - The length of `group` and `profit` can be up to 100, and `G` and `P` can be up to 100.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP). We will maintain a DP table where `dp[g][p]` represents the number of ways to achieve exactly `g` gang members and exactly `p` profit. Then, we will iterate through each scheme and update the DP table accordingly. 

### Steps:

1. Initialize a DP table with dimensions `(G+1) x (P+1)` filled with zeros. Add an extra row and column to handle the boundary conditions smoothly.
2. Set `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is one way to choose no schemes resulting in zero members and zero profit.
3. Iterate over each scheme. For each scheme, iterate through the DP table in reverse to prevent overwriting results we need to consult.
4. For each `(g, p)`, update the DP state by including the current scheme if possible.
5. Sum up all values `dp[g][P]` for `0 <= g <= G` to get the final answer.

### Code

Here is the C++ code that implements the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int profitableSchemes(int G, int P, std::vector<int>& group, std::vector<int>& profit) {
        constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = group.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(G + 1, std::vector<int>(P + 1, 0));
        
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int members = group[i];
            int profits = profit[i];
            for (int g = G; g >= members; --g) {
                for (int p = P; p >= 0; --p) {
                    int newProfit = std::min(P, p + profits);
                    dp[g][newProfit] = (dp[g][newProfit] + dp[g - members][p]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int totalWays = 0;
        for (int g = 0; g <= G; ++g) {
            totalWays = (totalWays + dp[g][P]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return totalWays;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \times G \times P)\), where:
- `n` is the number of schemes,
- `G` is the number of gang members,
- `P` is the minimum required profit.

This complexity arises because we iterate through each scheme and for each scheme, we iterate through the DP table up to `G` times and within each iteration, we query up to `P` times. 

Given the constraints (with maximum values of 100 for `n`, `G`, and `P`), this solution should be performant enough.
