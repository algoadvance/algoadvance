[Leetcode 1904. The Number of Full Rounds You Have Played](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1904)
### Problem Statement:
Given two strings `start_time` and `finish_time` in "HH:MM" format representing the start and end time of a gaming session within a single day, return the number of full 15-minute rounds you have played during the session.

For instance, if the session starts at `"12:01"` and ends at `"12:44"`, the full 15-minute rounds are from `"12:15"` to `"12:30"` and from `"12:30"` to `"12:45"`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is `finish_time` guaranteed to be later than `start_time` within the same day?**
   - Yes, the problem states that both times are within a single day.
   
2. **How should edge cases be handled, like if `start_time` and `finish_time` are very close?**
   - If there are no full 15-minute rounds within the session, the answer should be `0`.

### Strategy:
1. **Convert Time to Minutes:**
   - Convert both `start_time` and `finish_time` to their respective minute counts from the start of the day.
   
2. **Round Up and Down:**
   - Round the `start_time` up to the next 15-minute mark if it is not already on a 15-minute boundary.
   - Round the `finish_time` down to the previous 15-minute mark if it is not already on a 15-minute boundary.
   
3. **Calculate Full Rounds:**
   - Calculate the difference between the rounded start and finish times.
   - Each 15-minute interval represents one full round, so dividing the difference in minutes by `15` will yield the number of full rounds.
   
4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Ensure that if the rounded `start_time` is greater than or equal to the rounded `finish_time`, return `0`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\) since all operations involve simple arithmetic and comparisons.

### Code:
Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int convertToMinutes(const string& time) {
    int hours = stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
    int minutes = stoi(time.substr(3, 2));
    return hours * 60 + minutes;
}

int numberOfRounds(string start_time, string finish_time) {
    int start_minutes = convertToMinutes(start_time);
    int finish_minutes = convertToMinutes(finish_time);

    int rounded_start = ceil(start_minutes / 15.0) * 15;
    int rounded_finish = floor(finish_minutes / 15.0) * 15;

    if (rounded_start > finish_minutes) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    return (rounded_finish - rounded_start) / 15;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    string start_time = "12:01";
    string finish_time = "12:44";
    int result = numberOfRounds(start_time, finish_time);
    cout << "Number of full rounds: " << result << endl;  // Output: 2
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The solution's time complexity is \(O(1)\), as we only perform a few arithmetic operations and string manipulations that do not depend on the size of the input.

With the above approach and implementation, you should be able to efficiently determine the number of full 15-minute rounds within any given start and finish time.
