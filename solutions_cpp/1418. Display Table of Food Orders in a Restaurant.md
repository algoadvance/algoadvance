[Leetcode 1418. Display Table of Food Orders in a Restaurant](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1418)
## Problem Statement

The problem "1418. Display Table of Food Orders in a Restaurant" asks you to display the food orders for each table in a restaurant in tabular form. Specifically, you are given a list of orders, where each order contains the name of the customer, the table number, and the food item ordered. You need to display a table where each row corresponds to a specific table number, each column corresponds to a specific food item, and the entries in the table are the number of times each food item was ordered by the table.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the list of orders always provided in a valid format?
   - What is the range of table numbers?
   - Will there be a fixed list of food items or can it vary?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the food items in the header row be sorted alphabetically?
   - How should the rows be ordered? By table number?

Assuming the answers are as follows:
1. - Yes, the input list of orders is valid.
   - Table numbers are positive integers.
   - The list of food items can vary and is not fixed.
2. - Yes, the food items in the header should be sorted alphabetically.
   - The rows should be ordered by table number in ascending order.

## Strategy

1. **Data Parsing:**
   - Parse the orders to keep track of the food items ordered per table.
   - Use a set to collect unique food items and a map to store the count of each food item per table.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Use a map of maps where the outer map has the table number as key and the inner map contains food items and their respective counts.

3. **Result Formatting:**
   - Sort the food items alphabetically for the table header.
   - Prepare the table with the first row as headers (table numbers and food items).
   - For each table, populate the rows with the count of each food item.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<string>> displayTable(vector<vector<string>>& orders) {
    // Map to store table number -> {food item -> count}
    map<int, unordered_map<string, int>> table_food_count;
    // Set to store all unique food items
    set<string> food_items;

    // Process each order
    for (const auto& order : orders) {
        int table_number = stoi(order[1]);
        string food_item = order[2];
        // Increment the count of the food item for the table
        table_food_count[table_number][food_item]++;
        // Add the food item to the set
        food_items.insert(food_item);
    }

    // Convert set of food items to a vector and sort alphabetically
    vector<string> food_list(food_items.begin(), food_items.end());
    sort(food_list.begin(), food_list.end());

    // Prepare the resulting table
    vector<vector<string>> result;

    // First row (header)
    vector<string> header = {"Table"};
    header.insert(header.end(), food_list.begin(), food_list.end());
    result.push_back(header);

    // Subsequent rows (table information)
    for (const auto& [table, food_count_map] : table_food_count) {
        vector<string> row = {to_string(table)};
        for (const auto& food : food_list) {
            // Get count of current food item for the table
            int count = food_count_map.count(food) ? food_count_map.at(food) : 0;
            row.push_back(to_string(count));
        }
        result.push_back(row);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<string>> orders = {
        {"David", "3", "Ceviche"},
        {"Corina", "10", "Beef Burrito"},
        {"David", "3", "Fried Chicken"},
        {"Carla", "5", "Water"},
        {"Carla", "5", "Ceviche"},
        {"Rous", "3", "Ceviche"}
    };
    
    vector<vector<string>> table = displayTable(orders);
    
    for (const auto& row : table) {
        for (const auto& item : row) {
            cout << item << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Data Parsing:** O(N) where N is the number of orders.
- **Sorting Food Items:** O(F log F) where F is the number of unique food items.
- **Constructing Result Table:**
  - Creating each row involves iterating over the food items, taking O(T * F) where T is the number of tables and F is the number of unique food items.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(N + F log F + T * F)

This approach ensures an efficient processing and clear structure for the desired table format.
