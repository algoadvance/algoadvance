[Leetcode 2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2769)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`. The task is to return the maximum achievable number by performing a series of operations on `num1`. Each operation consists of adding or subtracting `num2` from `num1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a limit on the number of operations that can be performed?**
   - No explicit limits are given, but it may be assumed to continue operations until achieving the maximum number.

2. **Are negative results allowed?**
   - It seems the focus is on finding the maximum achievable number, therefore we should avoid negative results, if this results in a higher value.

3. **Can both positive and negative values for `num1` and `num2` be used?**
   - Yes, all integer values for `num1` and `num2` are valid inputs.

### Strategy

1. Since there's no limit on the number of operations, the maximum achievable number will be influenced by continuously adding `num2` to `num1` while it increases the value.
2. Instead of an iterative approach, because addition is linear and unbounded, the problem might actually require rethinking regarding constraints considering time complexity.

### Code

The simplest approach, given the constraints, is the following:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>

int maxAchievableNumber(int num1, int num2) {
    if (num1 >= 0 && num2 > 0) {
        // Infinity in positive direction
        return INT_MAX;
    } else if (num1 < 0 && num2 > 0) {
        // Subtracting num2 makes num1 go negative
        return num1;
    } else if (num2 == 0) {
        // num2 being zero means num1 stays the same
        return num1;
    } else {
        // In case num2 is negative, adding it will decrease the number
        // We need to check the direction in which we approach max value
        return num1;
    }
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 2;
    std::cout << "Maximum Achievable Number: " << maxAchievableNumber(num1, num2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - The calculation is derived directly from logic-based conditions, provided there are no loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - The space used does not grow with the input size.

This basic code ensures that the problem is addressed considering most typical operations and constraints within simple integer scenarios.
