[Leetcode 1319. Number of Operations to Make Network Connected](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1319)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` and an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between computers `ai` and `bi`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through these connections.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations needed to connect all the computers. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

An operation involves connecting two computers with a cable.

#### Example
1. `Input: n = 4, connections = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]]`
   `Output: 1`
2. `Input: n = 6, connections = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]`
   `Output: -1`
3. `Input: n = 5, connections = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [3, 4], [2, 3]]`
   `Output: 0`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the `n` computers provided guaranteed to be unique?
   - Yes, each computer has a unique identifier from `0` to `n-1`.
2. Can there be duplicate connections in the `connections` array?
   - No, each connection is unique.
3. Is there a guaranteed minimum number of connections?
   - No, the number of connections can range from `0` to any possible number up to `n*(n-1)/2` in a completely connected network.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to figure out the number of connected components in the graph. Then, to connect all of these components, the minimum number of operations required would be the number of connected components minus one.

#### Steps

1. **Check if it's possible**: If the number of connections is less than `n-1`, return `-1` because it's not possible to connect all computers.
2. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
3. **Count Connected Components**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to count the number of connected components in the graph.
4. **Calculate Operations**: The number of operations required to connect the components is the number of connected components minus one.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int node, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& graph, unordered_set<int>& visited) {
        visited.insert(node);
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    int makeConnected(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        // If there are fewer connections than `n-1`, it's impossible to connect all computers
        if (connections.size() < n - 1) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Create an adjacency list for the graph
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
        for (const auto& connection : connections) {
            graph[connection[0]].push_back(connection[1]);
            graph[connection[1]].push_back(connection[0]);
        }

        // Use a set to track visited nodes
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        int componentCount = 0;

        // Go through all nodes and count the number of connected components
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (visited.find(i) == visited.end()) {
                dfs(i, graph, visited);
                componentCount++;
            }
        }

        // To connect all components, we need `componentCount - 1` operations
        return componentCount - 1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph**: O(E), where `E` is the number of edges (connections).
- **DFS for Connected Components**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of nodes (computers), and `E` is the number of edges (connections).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(V + E).

This implementation efficiently determines the number of operations needed to ensure all computers are connected in the network.
