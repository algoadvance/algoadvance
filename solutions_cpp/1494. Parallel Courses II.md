[Leetcode 1494. Parallel Courses II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1494)
### Problem Statement

Given the integer `n` representing `n` courses and an array `dependencies` where `dependencies[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates there is a prerequisite from course `xi` to course `yi`. Furthermore, you are given an integer `k` representing the maximum number of courses you can take at the same time.

You should return the minimum number of semesters required to complete all `n` courses. If it is impossible to complete all courses, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Are there any cycles in the dependency graph?
   - Answer: No, there are no cycles, as each `dependencies[i] = [xi, yi]` implies course `xi` must be completed before course `yi`, forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

2. **Course Properties**:
   - Can any course be taken at any time if prerequisites are not a restriction?
   - Answer: Yes, if there are no prerequisites for a course, it can be taken at any time within the limit of `k` courses per semester.

3. **Constraints**:
   - How large can `n` and `dependencies` get?
   - Answer: The integer `n` can be up to 15 (0 ≤ n ≤ 15), and the number of dependencies can be 0 ≤ dependencies.length ≤ n(n-1)/2.

### Strategy

We can use Dynamic Programming with bit masking to solve this problem efficiently given the constraints.

1. **State Representation**:
   - Use a bitmask to represent the set of completed courses.
   - Let `dp[mask]` be the minimum number of semesters required to complete all courses in the set represented by `mask`.

2. **State Transition**:
   - For each state `mask`, determine the available courses that can be taken based on the prerequisites.
   - Generate new states by trying all subsets of available courses that obey the limit of `k` courses per semester.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0] = 0`, as zero courses need zero semesters.

4. **Final Solution**:
   - The answer will be `dp[(1 << n) - 1]`, which represents the state where all courses have been completed.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstring>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, vector<vector<int>>& dependencies, int k) {
    vector<int> pre(n, 0);
    for (auto& dep : dependencies) {
        pre[dep[1] - 1] |= (1 << (dep[0] - 1));
    }
    
    vector<int> dp(1 << n, n); // Use n since we need at most n semesters in the worst case
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
        int available = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((mask & pre[i]) == pre[i]) { // all prerequisites are met
                available |= (1 << i);
            }
        }
        available &= ~mask; // remove the already taken courses
        
        for (int sub = available; sub > 0; sub = (sub - 1) & available) {
            if (__builtin_popcount(sub) <= k) { // count the number of set bits
                dp[mask | sub] = min(dp[mask | sub], dp[mask] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **State Count**: There are \( 2^n \) possible states since each course can independently be either completed or not.
- **Transition Complexity**: Each state transitions to \( O(2^k) \) possible next states because we are exploring each subset of available courses up to `k` at a time.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is \( O(n \cdot 2^n \cdot 2^k) \), which is manageable for \( n \leq 15 \).
