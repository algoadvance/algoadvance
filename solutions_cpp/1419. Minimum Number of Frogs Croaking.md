[Leetcode 1419. Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1419)
## Problem Statement

You are given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of croaking sounds by multiple frogs. The string is made up of the letters 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' only. To make the full "croak" sound, a frog has to make all the five sounds sequentially ('c' -> 'r' -> 'o' -> 'a' -> 'k').

Determine the minimum number of different frogs required to produce the given string. Return -1 if the given string is not a valid sequence of croak sounds.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the input string?**
   - The input string length is between 1 and 10^5.
   
2. **Are there any invalid characters, or can we assume all characters are 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k'?**
   - We can assume all characters in the string are one of 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k'.

3. **Are overlapping croaks possible?**
   - Yes, overlapping croaks are possible and should be considered.

4. **What should be returned if the string is invalid?**
   - Return -1 if the given string is not a valid sequence of croak sounds.

## Strategy

We need to track the counts of each character in the sequence "croak". Given an invalid sequence, we will return -1 immediately if the sequence fails the logical order.

We can solve this by maintaining counts for 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k' and ensure they are in a valid state anytime while parsing the string. This implies:
- A 'c' must be followed by an 'r'.
- An 'r' must be followed by an 'o'.
- An 'o' must be followed by an 'a'.
- An 'a' must be followed by a 'k'.
- When processing a 'k', a complete 'croak' has finished.

We'll also track the maximum number of simultaneous frogs making the sound at any point in time.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int minNumberOfFrogs(string croakOfFrogs) {
    unordered_map<char, int> count;
    for (char ch : "croak") count[ch] = 0;
    int frogs = 0, maxFrogs = 0;

    for (char ch : croakOfFrogs) {
        if (ch == 'c') {
            count[ch]++;
            frogs++;
            maxFrogs = max(maxFrogs, frogs);
        } else if (ch == 'r') {
            if (count['c'] < count['r'] + 1) return -1;
            count[ch]++;
        } else if (ch == 'o') {
            if (count['r'] < count['o'] + 1) return -1;
            count[ch]++;
        } else if (ch == 'a') {
            if (count['o'] < count['a'] + 1) return -1;
            count[ch]++;
        } else if (ch == 'k') {
            if (count['a'] < count['k'] + 1) return -1;
            count[ch]++;
            frogs--; // Completed one croak sequence
        } else {
            return -1; // Unexpected character
        }
    }

    // Check if we have balanced counts for a valid "croak"
    if (count['c'] == count['r'] && count['r'] == count['o'] && count['o'] == count['a'] && count['a'] == count['k']) {
        return maxFrogs;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string. We only iterate through the string once and perform constant-time operations for each character. The space complexity is **O(1)** since the unordered_map maintains a fixed number of characters regardless of input size.
