[Leetcode 1301. Number of Paths with Max Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1301)
### Problem Statement

Given a rectangular grid containing digits from '0' to '9' and the characters 'S' and 'E', where 'S' marks the starting point (top-left cell) and 'E' marks the ending point (bottom-right cell). The task is to find the number of paths to get from 'S' to 'E' with the maximum sum of the values on the path, and the maximum sum itself.

You can move right, down, or diagonally bottom-right direction at each step. If a cell is unreachable (e.g., contains an obstructed path represented by a character like 'X'), you cannot step on it.

Return a pair of integers [maximum sum, number of such paths]. If there's no valid path from 'S' to 'E', return [0, 0].

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - Typical constraints would be helpful. For simplicity, let's assume the dimensions are up to `100x100`.

2. **What characters can the grid contain?**
   - Only '0'-'9', 'S', 'E', and any obstacle character like 'X'.

3. **What are the movement constraints?**
   - You can move right, down, or diagonally bottom-right.

4. **Can the grid contain negative numbers?**
   - Based on the problem description, it seems the numbers are only digits '0'-'9', so no negative numbers.

### Strategy

1. **DP Table Definition:**
   - Use two DP tables: `maxSum` to track the maximum sum to reach each cell and `pathCount` to track the number of paths that yield this maximum sum.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the starting point `S` with `(0, 1)` since `S` itself does not contribute to the score.

3. **State Transition:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)` consider cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`.
   - Update `maxSum[i][j]` to the maximum value achievable from these adjacent cells.
   - Update `pathCount[i][j]` based on which cells contributed to the `maxSum`.
  
4. **Obstacles and Borders:**
   - Skip cells with obstacles and ensure not to go out of the grid bounds.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> pathsWithMaxScore(std::vector<std::string>& board) {
        int n = board.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> maxSum(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> pathCount(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Starting point
        pathCount[n-1][n-1] = 1;
        
        // Traverse the board from bottom-right corner to top-left corner
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = n-1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') continue;  // Obstacle
                
                if (board[i][j] == 'E' && !(i == n-1 && j == n-1)) continue;  // Skip 'E' if not in the start
                
                int currentValue = (board[i][j] == 'S' || board[i][j] == 'E') ? 0 : board[i][j] - '0';
                
                // Get the best maxSum from possible directions
                if (i + 1 < n && pathCount[i+1][j] > 0) {
                    if (maxSum[i][j] < maxSum[i+1][j] + currentValue) {
                        maxSum[i][j] = maxSum[i+1][j] + currentValue;
                        pathCount[i][j] = pathCount[i+1][j];
                    } else if (maxSum[i][j] == maxSum[i+1][j] + currentValue) {
                        pathCount[i][j] += pathCount[i+1][j];
                    }
                }
                
                if (j + 1 < n && pathCount[i][j+1] > 0) {
                    if (maxSum[i][j] < maxSum[i][j+1] + currentValue) {
                        maxSum[i][j] = maxSum[i][j+1] + currentValue;
                        pathCount[i][j] = pathCount[i][j+1];
                    } else if (maxSum[i][j] == maxSum[i][j+1] + currentValue) {
                        pathCount[i][j] += pathCount[i][j+1];
                    }
                }
                
                if (i + 1 < n && j + 1 < n && pathCount[i+1][j+1] > 0) {
                    if (maxSum[i][j] < maxSum[i+1][j+1] + currentValue) {
                        maxSum[i][j] = maxSum[i+1][j+1] + currentValue;
                        pathCount[i][j] = pathCount[i+1][j+1];
                    } else if (maxSum[i][j] == maxSum[i+1][j+1] + currentValue) {
                        pathCount[i][j] += pathCount[i+1][j+1];
                    }
                }
                
                pathCount[i][j] %= 1000000007;  // Ensure pathCount doesn't exceed modulo
            }
        }

        return pathCount[0][0] > 0 ? std::vector<int>{maxSum[0][0], pathCount[0][0]} : std::vector<int>{0, 0};
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) where n is the number of rows (assuming the grid is square with dimensions n x n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for the DP tables to store the maximum sums and path counts.

This solution efficiently computes the number of paths with the maximum sum and uses dynamic programming to ensure that all potential paths are considered within the constraints.
