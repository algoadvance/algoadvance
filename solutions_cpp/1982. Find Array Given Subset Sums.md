[Leetcode 1982. Find Array Given Subset Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1982)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1982: _Find Array Given Subset Sums_

**Description:**

You are given an integer `n` which is the size of an array you are to find, and an array called `subsetSums` which contains `2^n` elements representing the sum of every possible subset of the `n` integers.

You need to find the original array of integers which has those subset sums.

**Note:**
- The given array is unique as the sum of subset sums allows only one possible original array.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input:
n = 3
subsetSums = [0, -3, -2, -2, -1, -1, 0, 1]

Output:
[-3, -2, 2]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of the subset sum array guaranteed to be sorted?**
   - Yes, the subset sums are usually given in a sorted order as observed in traditional combinatorial problems like these.

2. **Can there be negative numbers in the subset sums?**
   - Yes, based on the problem example.

3. **Is there a constraint on the range of the input values?**
   - The size could be up to `2^n`, making it computationally intensive for large values of `n`.

### Strategy

The task can be approached as follows:

1. **Sort `subsetSums`** — Ensure the list is sorted. 
2. **Iteratively Determine Elements in Original Array**:
   - The smallest element from `subsetSums` correlates with the original smallest number.
   - Remove the contributions made by this number to its subsets from `subsetSums`.
3. **Repeat** — Extract the next smallest element and adjust `subsetSums` accordingly until the array is reconstructed.

### Steps

1. Initialize an `original` array.
2. Sort `subsetSums`.
3. Extract the minimum element, adjust `subsetSums` by removing this element and all its contributions to `original`.
4. Repeat until `subsetSums` is exhausted.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** subsetSums takes \(O(2^n \log(2^n))\).
- **Iterative removal and adjustment** of subsets involve operations that run in \(O(2^n)\).

Overall complexity: \(O(2^n \log(2^n) + n \cdot 2^n) \approx O(n \cdot 2^n)\).

Here’s the C++ code implementing the strategy:

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> findOriginalArray(int n, std::vector<int>& subsetSums) {
    std::sort(subsetSums.begin(), subsetSums.end());
    std::vector<int> result;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int smallest = subsetSums[1];
        result.push_back(smallest);

        // Use a map to count occurrences
        std::unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int sum : subsetSums) count[sum]++;
        
        std::vector<int> newSubsetSums;
        for (int sum : subsetSums) {
            if (count[sum] > 0 && count[sum - smallest] > 0) {
                --count[sum];
                --count[sum - smallest];
            } else if (count[sum] > 0) {
                newSubsetSums.push_back(sum);
            }
        }

        subsetSums = std::move(newSubsetSums);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: Ensures the `subsetSums` is ordered.
2. **Iterative extraction**:
   - `smallest` is derived from `subsetSums[1]` assuming the smallest non-zero element (since `subsetSums[0]` is zero).
   - Maintain counts using a map to match and remove occurrences based on the number extracted.
3. **Remaining subsets**: Filtered through computation, forming the basis for subsequent iterations. 

This procedure reconstructs the original array given the subset sums.
