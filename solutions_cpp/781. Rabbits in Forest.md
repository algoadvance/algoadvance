[Leetcode 781. Rabbits in Forest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l781)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to count the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest based on their answers. Each rabbit must answer "Y + 1" where 'Y' is the number of other rabbits that have the same color which it has.

Given an array of integers, where each integer `answers[i]` represents the answer a rabbit gave, calculate the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

*Example:*
``` 
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be of one color.
- The rabbit that answered "2" can't be the same color as the rabbits above. Hence, there would be at least 3 rabbits answering "2".
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input values?** 
   - The values in the `answers` array can be between 0 and 999. The length of the array can be between 1 and 1000.

2. **Can the `answers` array be empty?**
   - No, based on the constraints the array will have at least one element.

3. **What should be returned in the case of an empty input array?**
   - This is not applicable as per the problem constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Each `answers[i]` gives the number of other rabbits with the same color. Therefore, if a rabbit says `answers[i] = 2`, it means there are 2 other rabbits of the same color as it, totaling 3 rabbits with that color.

2. **Group Rabbits Based on Answers**:
   - For each unique answer, count how many rabbits gave that answer. 
   - From these counts, calculate the minimum number of groups required. Each group will have `answers[i] + 1` rabbits.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Rabbits**:
   - For each unique answer, if `n` rabbits say `answers[i]`, the minimum number of groups of rabbits of that color will be `(n // (answers[i] + 1)) + (n % (answers[i] + 1) != 0)`. The total number of rabbits for that answer will be the number of groups multiplied by `answers[i] + 1`.

## Code
Here's the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int answer : answers) {
            count[answer]++;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (auto& [answer, num_rabbits] : count) {
            int group_size = answer + 1;
            int groups = ceil(static_cast<double>(num_rabbits) / group_size);
            result += groups * group_size;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the `answers` array. This is because we go through the `answers` list once to create the count map and then iterate through the counts of each unique answer.

The space complexity is also O(N) due to the `unordered_map` used to store the count of each answer.
