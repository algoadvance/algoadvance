[Leetcode 738. Monotone Increasing Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l738)
## Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `N`, you need to find the largest number that is less than or equal to `N` and that its digits are in non-decreasing order (monotone increasing).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the input range for N?**
   - `N` will be a non-negative integer and the standard range for an integer would be assumed.

2. **Can N be 0?**
   - Yes, since the problem states N is non-negative.

3. **Are there built-in functions we can use to convert between characters and digits?**
   - Yes, we can leverage character manipulation functions in C++ to easily switch between digits and characters.

4. **What is the expected type for input and output?**
   - Input: `int N`
   - Output: `int`

## Strategy
1. **Convert N to a String**: This allows easy manipulation of its digits.
2. **Identify Violation Point**: Traverse from left to right to find where the order violation occurs (if any).
3. **Make Adjustment**: If a violation is found (i.e., a digit is smaller than the previous one),:
   - Reduce the digit just before the violation.
   - Change all subsequent digits to '9' to maximize the resultant number.
4. **Manage Propagation**: It might be needed to propagate the decrement to the left if converting a digit to '9' creates another violation.
5. **Convert Back to Integer**: After adjustments, convert the string back to an integer and return the result.

## Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the described solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int monotoneIncreasingDigits(int N) {
    std::string strN = std::to_string(N);
    int n = strN.size();
    int marker = n;
    
    // Find the first place where the order is violated.
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
        if (strN[i] < strN[i - 1]) {
            marker = i;
            strN[i - 1]--;
        }
    }
    
    // Change all digits after the marker to '9'.
    for (int i = marker; i < n; ++i) {
        strN[i] = '9';
    }
    
    return std::stoi(strN);
}

int main() {
    int N = 332;
    std::cout << "The largest number less than or equal to " << N << " with monotone increasing digits is " << monotoneIncreasingDigits(N) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm mainly involves linear pass through the digits of N.
- Let `d` be the number of digits in `N`. We perform a constant amount of work (comparing, decrementing, setting to '9') for each digit.
- Hence, the time complexity is **O(d)** where `d` is the number of digits in the integer N.

## Space Complexity
- We use some additional space to store the string representation of the number and other auxiliary variables.
- Hence, the space complexity is **O(d)** where `d` is the number of digits in the integer N.

This covers the strategy and solution to the problem, ensuring clarity and efficiency in implementation.
