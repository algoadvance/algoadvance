[Leetcode 929. Unique Email Addresses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l929)
## Problem Statement
Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign. For example, in alice@leetcode.com, `alice` is the local name, and `leetcode.com` is the domain name. Besides lowercase letters, these emails may also contain `'.'` or `'+'`.

1. If you add periods (`'.'`) to the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. For example, `"alice.z@leetcode.com"` and `"alicez@leetcode.com"` forward to the same address.
2. If you add a plus (`'+'`) to the local name, it will ignore everything after the plus sign. This allows certain email filtering. For example, `"alice+leetcode@leetcode.com"` and `"alice@leetcode.com"` forward to the same email address.

Given a list of email addresses, we need to determine the number of unique addresses. 

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:** List of strings representing the emails.
2. **Output Format:** A single integer representing the number of unique email addresses after normalization.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numUniqueEmails(std::vector<std::string>& emails) {
        std::unordered_set<std::string> uniqueEmails;
        
        for (const std::string& email : emails) {
            std::string localName;
            std::string domainName;
            bool atSymbol = false;
            bool ignoreRest = false;
            
            for (char c : email) {
                if (c == '@') {
                    atSymbol = true;
                }
                
                if (atSymbol) {
                    domainName += c;
                } else {
                    if (c == '+') {
                        ignoreRest = true;
                    }
                    if (!ignoreRest && c != '.') {
                        localName += c;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            uniqueEmails.insert(localName + domainName);
        }
        
        return uniqueEmails.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<std::string> emails = {
        "test.email+alex@leetcode.com", 
        "test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com", 
        "testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"
    };
    std::cout << sol.numUniqueEmails(emails) << std::endl;  // Output should be 2
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:** We initialize an unordered set (`uniqueEmails`) to store the unique email addresses.
2. **Traversal:** We iterate through each email in the provided list.
   - We split the email into the local name and the domain name.
   - We ignore any characters in the local name part after a `'+'`.
   - We also ignore `'.'` characters in the local name.
3. **Combining Local and Domain Names:** Combine the processed local name and the domain name, then insert it into the `uniqueEmails` set.
4. **Result:** The size of the `uniqueEmails` set represents the number of unique email addresses.

## Time Complexity
The overall time complexity is O(n*m), where `n` is the number of emails in the list, and `m` is the average length of an email address. This results from processing each character in each email once. The `unordered_set` operations (insert and lookup) are average O(1), making the solution efficient.
