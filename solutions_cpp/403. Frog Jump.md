[Leetcode 403. Frog Jump](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l403)
### Problem Statement

A frog is trying to cross a river. The river is divided into units, and in each unit, there may or may not be a stone. The frog can jump onto a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of `stones`' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit. 

If the frog's last jump was `k` units, then its next jump must be either `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` units. Note that the frog can only jump forward.

```
Example 1:
Input: [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by following these jumps [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Example 2:
Input: [0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between stone 4 and 8 is too large.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the frog start from any stone other than the first one?
   **A:** No, the frog must start from the first stone.
   
2. **Q:** Can there be multiple stones at the same position in the list?
   **A:** No, all stone positions are unique and sorted in ascending order.

3. **Q:** Are jumps always positive integers?
   **A:** Yes, the jumps are always positive integers.

4. **Q:** Is the length of the stones array guaranteed to be non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, it's given that the array will always have at least one stone.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming combined with a hash map. We'll use a dictionary to store the possible last jump lengths that will allow the frog to reach each stone. This helps in tracking the states.

The key steps are:
1. **Initialization:** Start from the first stone with an initial jump of 0.
2. **Iteration:** For each stone, iterate through the possible jump lengths stored for that stone.
3. **State Transition:** From each stone, calculate the reachable stones based on jump lengths adjusted by -1, 0, +1.
4. **State Storage:** Record possible jumps for each reachable stone in the dictionary.
5. **Termination:** Return true if the last stone is reached, otherwise return false.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

bool canCross(vector<int>& stones) {
    if (stones[1] != 1) return false; // First jump must be of 1 unit to land on the second stone
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> dp;
    for (int stone : stones) {
        dp[stone] = unordered_set<int>();
    }
    dp[0].insert(1); // The frog's initial jump to the first stone is of 1 unit

    for (int stone : stones) {
        for (int k : dp[stone]) {
            int reach = stone + k;
            if (reach == stones.back()) return true;
            if (dp.find(reach) != dp.end()) {
                if (k - 1 > 0) dp[reach].insert(k - 1);
                dp[reach].insert(k);
                dp[reach].insert(k + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> stones1 = {0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17};
    vector<int> stones2 = {0,1,2,3,4,8,9,11};

    bool result1 = canCross(stones1);
    bool result2 = canCross(stones2);

    // Expecting true
    printf("Test case 1: %s\n", result1 ? "true" : "false");
    // Expecting false
    printf("Test case 2: %s\n", result2 ? "true" : "false");

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(n^2) where n is the number of stones. This comes from the fact that for each stone, we are potentially updating the state of each other stone based on possible jump lengths. The operations within each stone are effectively constant due to the use of hash sets for quick lookups and insertions.

This should cover all required aspects to solve the problem effectively.
