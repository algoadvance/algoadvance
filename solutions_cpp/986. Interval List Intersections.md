[Leetcode 986. Interval List Intersections](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l986)
### Problem Statement

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and `secondList[j] = [start_j, end_j]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are present in both intervals. Formally, the intersection of `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is `[max(a, c), min(b, d)]`. Note that the intersection could be empty, which means there is no overlap between the intervals.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should the function return if there are no intersections?**
   - The function should return an empty list if there are no intersections between the intervals.

2. **Are the intervals within each list guaranteed to be non-overlapping?**
   - Yes, each list is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

3. **What are the constraints on the number of intervals in each list?**
   - The lengths of both lists can be up to \(10^3\).

4. **What is the range of the interval values?**
   - The values in the intervals can range from \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).

### Strategy

1. Use a two-pointer technique to iterate through both lists of intervals.
2. Compare intervals from `firstList` and `secondList`:
   - Determine the intersection, if any, of the two intervals being compared.
   - If an intersection exists, add it to the result list.
3. Move the pointer for the interval that ends first to the next interval in its list.
4. Continue until one of the lists is fully traversed.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(M + N)\), where \(M\) and \(N\) are the lengths of `firstList` and `secondList` respectively, because each interval from both lists is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\min(M, N))\), which is required for the storage of the resulting intersections (in the worst case, each list might contribute equally to the intersections).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>  // For max and min functions

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& firstList, vector<vector<int>>& secondList) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int i = 0, j = 0; // Pointers for firstList and secondList
    
    while (i < firstList.size() && j < secondList.size()) {
        // Get the starting and ending points of the intersection
        int startMax = max(firstList[i][0], secondList[j][0]);
        int endMin = min(firstList[i][1], secondList[j][1]);
        
        // If there's an intersection
        if (startMax <= endMin) {
            result.push_back({startMax, endMin});
        }
        
        // Move the pointer of the interval that ends first
        if (firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

- Initialize two pointers (`i` for `firstList` and `j` for `secondList`).
- While neither list is exhausted:
  - Calculate the maximum start and minimum end of the current intervals from both lists.
  - If these intervals intersect (`startMax <= endMin`), add this intersection to the result list.
  - Move the pointer of the interval that ends first to ensure no missed intersections.
- Return the result list containing all the intersections.
