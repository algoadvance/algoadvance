[Leetcode 2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2849)
### Problem Statement

You are given a grid of size `m x n` and a cell in the grid `(startRow, startCol)`. Each step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. Determine if you can reach the cell `(targetRow, targetCol)` starting from `(startRow, startCol)` in exactly `k` steps. If it is possible, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it allowed to move outside the boundaries of the grid?**
    - Based on typical grid problems, movements outside the grid would not be allowed unless specified.
  
2. **Can the grid have obstacles or is it an empty grid?**
    - The problem statement does not provide obstacle information, so we will assume an empty grid.

3. **Are negative indices for start or target cells allowed?**
    - Typically, start and target cells will be within the grid boundaries for meaningful results.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Manhattan Distance**: The key insight is to use the Manhattan distance to determine feasibility:
    - The Manhattan distance between two cells `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|`.
    - This distance represents the minimum number of steps required to move from a start cell to a target cell.

2. **Check Step Parity**: 
    - To check if exactly `k` steps can be taken, the steps `k` taken must be greater than or equal to the Manhattan distance and have the same parity (both even or both odd).
    - If the difference between `k` and the Manhattan distance is even, it means that you can achieve the exact number of steps by making additional detours.

### Code

```cpp
#include <cmath>

bool isReachableInSteps(int m, int n, int startRow, int startCol, int targetRow, int targetCol, int k) {
    // Calculate the Manhattan Distance
    int manhattanDistance = std::abs(targetRow - startRow) + std::abs(targetCol - startCol);
    
    // Check if k steps are valid:
    // 1. k should be >= Manhattan Distance
    // 2. (k - Manhattan Distance) should be even
    if (k >= manhattanDistance && (k - manhattanDistance) % 2 == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    int m = 5, n = 5;
    int startRow = 0, startCol = 0, targetRow = 4, targetCol = 4, k = 8;
    
    // Expected output: true (since you can reach (4, 4) in exactly 8 steps)
    bool result = isReachableInSteps(m, n, startRow, startCol, targetRow, targetCol, k);
    std::cout << "Is target reachable in " << k << " steps? " << (result ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - The calculation involves only a few arithmetic operations and comparisons.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - No extra space is used other than a few integer variables.

This code ensures that the cell is reachable in exactly `k` steps if `k` is at least the Manhattan distance and `(k - Manhattan distance)` is even.
