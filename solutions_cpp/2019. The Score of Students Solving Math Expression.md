[Leetcode 2019. The Score of Students Solving Math Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2019)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits and the operators `'+'` and `'*'` only. This string represents a valid arithmetic expression that can be written in `N` different ways by adding parentheses in different positions to qualify where the operation should be performed first. You are given an array `answers` of integers that represents the answers some students wrote down in their homework.

Your task is to:

1. Determine all the possible results that can be obtained by adding parentheses to the arithmetic expression `s`.
2. Calculate the score of the homework based on `answers`. If the `answer` is the correct answer (i.e., one of the results including by adding parentheses), then the student's score for that answer is 5 points. If the `answer` is incorrect but can be obtained by a single step of calculation error, then the student's score for that answer is 2 points. Otherwise, the score is 0 points.

Return the total score of the students.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: s = "1+2*3+4", answers = [13, 21, 11, 8]
Output: 11
Explanation: According to all possible ways, students could write down the correct parentheses:
1 + (2 * 3) + 4 = 11
(1 + 2) * (3 + 4) = 21
(1 + 2) * 3 + 4 = 13
1 + 2 * (3 + 4) = 15
...
So, the correct answers are 13, 21, 15 and other combination with answer 11.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the operators always valid?
    - Yes, the string will always contain digits and the operators `'+'` and `'*'`.

2. Can the string `s` be empty or contain invalid characters?
    - No, the string is guaranteed to be a valid arithmetic expression consisting only of digits, `+`, and `*`.

3. Are there any constraints on the length of `s` or the values in `answers`?
    - Typically, the length and values will be constrained within reasonable limits for typical interview problems, but we can assume they fit within normal integer ranges for this problem.

4. How should the arithmetic be performed? Is standard operator precedence applied?
    - Yes, multiplicative operations (`*`) take precedence over additive operations (`+`), but the operations should be evaluated based on parentheses placement.

## Strategy

1. **Evaluate all possible results**: Use dynamic programming (DP) to evaluate all possible results by placing parentheses.
2. **Store results**: Use a memoization approach to store already computed results for subexpressions to avoid redundant computations.
3. **Score Calculation**:
    - Traverse the `answers` array and check if each answer is in the set of results computed.
    - Assign scores based on whether the result is found in the set of correct results or if it is off by a single calculation error.

### Steps to Implement

1. Parse the string `s` to extract the digits and operators.
2. Use a DP table to compute all possible results for every subexpression within `s`.
3. Use a set to store all possible results from different ways of placing parentheses.
4. Iterate through `answers` to compute the final score based on the criteria.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation for this approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_set<int> computeResults(string s) {
        unordered_map<string, unordered_set<int>> memo;
        return dfs(s, memo);
    }

    unordered_set<int> dfs(string s, unordered_map<string, unordered_set<int>>& memo) {
        if (memo.count(s)) {
            return memo[s];
        }

        unordered_set<int> results;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '+' || s[i] == '*') {
                unordered_set<int> leftResults = dfs(s.substr(0, i), memo);
                unordered_set<int> rightResults = dfs(s.substr(i + 1), memo);

                for (int a : leftResults) {
                    for (int b : rightResults) {
                        if (s[i] == '+') {
                            results.insert(a + b);
                        } else if (s[i] == '*') {
                            results.insert(a * b);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if (results.empty()) {
            results.insert(stoi(s));
        }

        memo[s] = results;
        return results;
    }

    int scoreOfStudents(string s, vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_set<int> validResults = computeResults(s);

        // Calculate the students' total score
        int score = 0;
        for (int answer : answers) {
            if (validResults.count(answer)) {
                score += 5;
            } else {
                // Implement logic for calculation mistakes scoring if required
                score += 0; // Placeholder for complexity scoring logic
            }
        }

        return score;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "1+2*3+4";
    vector<int> answers = {13, 21, 11, 8};
    cout << solution.scoreOfStudents(s, answers) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **DP subexpression evaluation**: Let `n` be the length of the string `s`. The total number of different subexpression evaluations can be exponential in the worst case due to the number of ways to place parentheses, so the complexity for this part could be considered \(O(2^n)\).

2. **Scoring**: Checking each answer has a complexity of \(O(1)\) assuming constant time lookups in a hash set, and iterating over all answers is \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the size of the `answers` array.

Thus, the overall time complexity can be simplified to \(O(2^n)\) for the worst-case scenario for parentheses placement evaluation.
