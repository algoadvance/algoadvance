[Leetcode 2766. Relocate Marbles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2766)
### Problem Statement:

You are tasked with writing a function that, given an integer array `nums` and two integers `start` and `end`, will move all elements less than `start` to the beginning of `nums` and all elements greater than `end` to the end of `nums`, whilst maintaining the order of the remaining elements in between.

More formally, the function should rearrange the array `nums` such that:
- All elements `x` such that `x < start` are at the beginning,
- All elements `x` such that `x > end` are at the end,
- All other elements between `start` and `end` inclusive retain their original order.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be the desired signature of the function?**
   - Typically, the function can be of the form `void relocateMarbles(std::vector<int>& nums, int start, int end)`.

2. **Can we assume that the start and end values are such that `start <= end`?**
   - Yes, it's safe to assume that `start <= end`.

3. **Should we return the modified array, or are we required only to modify the array in place?**
   - We should modify the array in place.

4. **What kinds of values can `nums` contain (e.g., are there negative values, large integers, etc.)?**
   - The `nums` array can contain any integer values. 

5. **What do we do if there are no elements less than `start` or greater than `end`?**
   - That is fine; the function should handle such cases gracefully and still maintain the order of the elements.

### Strategy:

1. **Partition the Array:**
   - Use three partitions: one for elements less than `start`, one for elements between `start` and `end` inclusive, and one for elements greater than `end`.
   
2. **Collect in Order:**
   - Start by initializing three separate lists: `less`, `middle`, and `greater`.
   - Iterate through the array, and place each element into one of the three lists.
   
3. **Reassemble the Array:**
   - Concatenate the `less`, `middle`, and `greater` lists back into the original array maintaining the order within each partition.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void relocateMarbles(std::vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
    std::vector<int> less, middle, greater;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num < start) {
            less.push_back(num);
        } else if (num > end) {
            greater.push_back(num);
        } else {
            middle.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    nums.clear();
    nums.insert(nums.end(), less.begin(), less.end());
    nums.insert(nums.end(), middle.begin(), middle.end());
    nums.insert(nums.end(), greater.begin(), greater.end());
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The function traverses the array once, resulting in O(n) time complexity where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - Inserting elements into the vector operations is also O(n).
  - Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The use of three additional vectors (`less`, `middle`, `greater`) each of which can be as large as the original array.
  - This results in O(n) auxiliary space usage.

This solution ensures that the elements of the array are partitioned and reassembled correctly while maintaining the desired constraints and order.
