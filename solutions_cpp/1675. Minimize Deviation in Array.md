[Leetcode 1675. Minimize Deviation in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1675)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers. You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:

1. If the element is even, you can divide it by 2.
2. If the element is odd, you can multiply it by 2.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum value of the array after performing any number of the above operations.

#### Example:
```cpp
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [2,2,3,4], then to [2,2,3,2], then the maximum difference is 1.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Values**: What is the range of values for `n` and the elements in `nums`?
   - Elements can range from 1 to 10^9, and the array length `n` can be up to 10^5.

2. **Constraints on Operations**: Are there any constraints on how many times we can perform the operations?
   - No, we can perform the operations as many times as possible.

3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider scenarios like minimum array size, e.g., `n = 1`?
   - Yes, we should handle small or edge-case input scenarios as well.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Normalize the Array**: Convert all elements to their possible maximum values when odd by multiplying them by 2. This ensures that every number is even, and we can focus on dividing by 2.
2. **Use a Max-Heap**: Utilize a max-heap to keep track of the current maximum element and a variable to track the current minimum element.
3. **Iterate and Divide**:
    - Continuously monitor the difference between the max and min values.
    - Always divide the maximum element by 2 and update the max heap and minimum value accordingly.
    - Stop when the maximum element in the heap becomes odd (since further division is not possible).

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation following the discussed strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minimumDeviation(vector<int>& nums) {
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
    int minVal = INT_MAX;
    
    // Normalize the array: make all numbers even
    for (int &num : nums) {
        if (num % 2 != 0) {
            num *= 2;
        }
        maxHeap.push(num);
        minVal = min(minVal, num);
    }
    
    int minDeviation = INT_MAX;
    
    // Process the max heap until the largest element is no longer even
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        int maxVal = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        
        minDeviation = min(minDeviation, maxVal - minVal);
        
        // If the max value is even, divide it by 2 and continue
        if (maxVal % 2 == 0) {
            maxVal /= 2;
            minVal = min(minVal, maxVal);
            maxHeap.push(maxVal);
        } else {
            // If the max value is odd, we cannot do anything further
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return minDeviation;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << minimumDeviation(nums) << endl;  // Output should be 1
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap operations**: Each insertion and deletion from the heap takes \(O(\log n)\) time.
- **Upper Bound Operations**: Every integer can be divided a maximum of \(O(\log(maxValue))\) times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(n \log(maxValue) \log n)\).

This should be efficient given the constraints, and the code optimally reduces the deviation in the array.
