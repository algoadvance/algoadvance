[Leetcode 1309. Decrypt String from Alphabet to Integer Mapping](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1309)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` formed by digits ('0' - '9') and '#'. We want to map this string to lowercase characters as follows:

- Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
- Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.

Given a string `s`, *the task is to decrypt it to the original string*.

**Example:**

1. Input: `s = "10#11#12"`
   Output: `"jkab"`
2. Input: `s = "1326#"`
   Output: `"acz"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of the string:** What can be the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Assume that the length of `s` will be between 1 and 100.

2. **Characters of the string:** Will the input string `s` always be correctly formatted as per the encoding rules?
   - Yes, the string will always follow the rules as stated in the prompt.

3. **Edge cases:** How should we handle edge cases?
   - Consider edge cases like the shortest possible input `"1"` and long sequences without '#'.

### Strategy

To decrypt the string:

1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. For each character:
   - If you encounter a '#', look at the previous two characters to determine the letter (since '#' denotes a number from 10 to 26).
   - If there's no '#', it's a single digit which directly maps to letters 'a' to 'i'.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to achieve the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string freqAlphabets(std::string s) {
    std::string result;
    int n = s.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i + 2 < n && s[i + 2] == '#') {
            // We encountered a number followed by '#', indicating a mapping from 10 to 26
            int number = (s[i] - '0') * 10 + (s[i + 1] - '0');
            result.push_back('a' + number - 1);
            i += 2; // Skip the next two characters as they are part of the current encoding
        } else {
            // Single digit mapping from 1 to 9
            result.push_back('a' + (s[i] - '0') - 1);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "10#11#12";
    std::string s2 = "1326#";
    std::string s3 = "25#24#23#22#21#20#19#18#17#16#15#14#13#12#11#10#9#8#7#6#5#4#3#2#1#";
    
    std::cout << freqAlphabets(s1) << std::endl; // Outputs: "jkab"
    std::cout << freqAlphabets(s2) << std::endl; // Outputs: "acz"
    std::cout << freqAlphabets(s3) << std::endl; // Outputs: "yxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we traverse the string once, and each operation within the loop takes constant time.
