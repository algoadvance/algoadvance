[Leetcode 1024. Video Stitching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1024)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of video clips, where each clip is represented as an interval `[start_i, end_i]`. These clips cover different intervals of a video from `0` to `T`. We need to determine the minimum number of clips needed to cover the entire video duration `0` to `T`. If it is not possible to cover the interval, return `-1`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: clips = [[0, 2], [4, 6], [8, 10], [1, 9], [1, 5], [5, 9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: We take the clips [0, 2], [1, 9], [9, 10].

Input: clips = [[0, 1], [1, 2]], T = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to cover [0, 5] with these clips.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can clips have overlapping intervals?**
   * Yes, clips can overlap.
2. **What is the maximum length of the input array `clips`?**
   * Typically, the length can be in the range of \(10^4\).
3. **Are the intervals within the clips inclusive or exclusive?**
   * Intervals are inclusive.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow a greedy approach:
1. **Sort the clips**: Start by sorting the clips based on their starting times. If two clips have the same starting time, sort them by their ending times in descending order.
2. **Iterate through sorted clips**: Initialize variables to keep track of the farthest end we can reach within the current interval, the end of the previous interval, and the number of clips used.
3. **Choose clips optimally**: For each starting point of `0` to `T`, greedily choose the clip that extends our reach the farthest. If we can't make progress at any step, return `-1`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int videoStitching(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& clips, int T) {
        // Sort clips by the start time, if equal sort by end time descending
        std::sort(clips.begin(), clips.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[0] == b[0])
                return a[1] > b[1];
            return a[0] < b[0];
        });

        int currentEnd = 0, nextEnd = 0, clipsUsed = 0;
        int i = 0, n = clips.size();

        // Iterate over the range from 0 to T
        while (currentEnd < T) {
            // Find the best clip that starts within the current interval
            while (i < n && clips[i][0] <= currentEnd) {
                nextEnd = std::max(nextEnd, clips[i][1]);
                i++;
            }

            // If we can't find such a clip, return -1
            if (currentEnd == nextEnd) return -1;

            // Use this clip and move the current end to next end
            currentEnd = nextEnd;
            clipsUsed++;
        }

        return clipsUsed;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the clips is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of clips.
- **Iteration**: The while loop runs in \(O(n)\) time as it processes each clip exactly once.
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This efficient approach guarantees that we've minimized the number of clips needed and provides a solution in feasible time even for the largest constraints.
