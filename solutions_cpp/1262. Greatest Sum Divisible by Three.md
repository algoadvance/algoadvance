[Leetcode 1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1262)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of integers. Return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   - **A:** The array size can range from 1 to 10^4.

2. **Q:** Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - **A:** No, `nums` will contain only non-negative integers (0 or greater).

3. **Q:** What if the array is empty?
   - **A:** The array will contain at least one element, based on the constraints.

### Strategy

The main goal is to find the largest sum from the array elements such that it is divisible by three. A direct approach would involve generating all possible subsets, calculating their sums, and checking if they are divisible by three. However, this would be computationally expensive given the constraints.

A more efficient approach leverages dynamic programming:
1. Maintain three variables (`dp0`, `dp1`, `dp2`) representing the maximum sums that yield remainders 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3, respectively.
2. Traverse the array and update these variables based on the current number and its remainder modulo 3.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int maxSumDivThree(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Initialize remainders sums, they represent the maximum sum we've seen so far
    // that gives remainder 0, 1, and 2 respectively when divided by 3.
    std::vector<int> dp(3, 0);

    for (int num : nums) {
        // We create a copy of the current state of dp
        std::vector<int> current_dp(dp);
        for (int sum : current_dp) {
            dp[(sum + num) % 3] = std::max(dp[(sum + num) % 3], sum + num);
        }
    }

    // We want the maximum sum that is divisible by 3, which is stored in dp[0]
    return dp[0];
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 6, 5, 1, 8};
    std::cout << "Maximum sum divisible by 3: " << maxSumDivThree(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** `dp` is a vector of 3 elements initialized to 0, representing the maximum sum of numbers seen so far that give remainders 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3.

2. **Iterate through `nums`:** For each number, iterate through the current state of `dp` (copied to `current_dp` to prevent mutation during iteration) and update the states based on the sum of each element in `dp` and the current number modulo 3.

3. **Update `dp`:** Using the current sums, update the corresponding remainders in the `dp` array using the formula `(sum + num) % 3`.

4. **Result:** The value in `dp[0]` will give us the maximum sum that is divisible by 3.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the array `nums`, since we are processing each element once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we are using a fixed-size array (`dp`) of size 3, which does not scale with input size.

This solution efficiently computes the desired maximum sum using a dynamic approach rather than generating and checking all possible combinations.
