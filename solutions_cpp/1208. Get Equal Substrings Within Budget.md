### Problem Statement
[Leetcode 1208: Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/)

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`. You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i-th` character of `s` to `i-th` character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference of the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Length**: Can the strings `s` and `t` be very long?
   - Reason: This will help determine the most efficient algorithm to use.

2. **Output**: Is it correct to assume that the function should return an integer representing the length of the maximum substring?
   - Reason: Confirming the output format.

3. **Character Details**: Are characters in `s` and `t` guaranteed to be in full ASCII range?
   - Reason: This affects the calculation of differences.

4. **Edge Cases**: Should we handle case when both strings are empty or if `maxCost` is zero?
   - Reason: Confirming edge cases to handle.

### Assumptions
- The strings `s` and `t` have equal lengths.
- Valid ASCII characters in `s` and `t`.

### Strategy
We can use a sliding window approach to solve this problem. Here's the detailed strategy:
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the string.
2. Maintain a running sum of costs within the window `[left, right]`.
3. Expand the window by moving `right` and add the cost of changing `s[right]` to `t[right]`.
4. If the running sum exceeds `maxCost`, move the `left` pointer to reduce the window size and get it back within budget.
5. Track the maximum window size that stays within the cost.

The sliding window ensures that we check each substring only once, making the solution efficient.

### Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // for max function
#include <cmath> // for abs function

int equalSubstring(std::string s, std::string t, int maxCost) {
    int n = s.size();
    int left = 0, right = 0; 
    int currentCost = 0;
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    while (right < n) {
        currentCost += std::abs(s[right] - t[right]);
        
        while (currentCost > maxCost) {
            currentCost -= std::abs(s[left] - t[left]);
            left++;
        }
        
        maxLength = std::max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        right++;
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input strings. Each character is processed at most twice, once by `right` and once by `left`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

This sliding window approach efficiently finds the maximum substring length within the given cost.
