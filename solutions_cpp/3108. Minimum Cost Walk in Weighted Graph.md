[Leetcode 3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3108)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a weighted graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges where the weight of each edge could be positive or negative. The task is to find the minimum cost to travel from the starting node `s` to the destination node `d`. If it is impossible to reach the destination node from the starting node, return -1. If there is a negative weight cycle in the graph, also return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input format**: Could you provide details on how the graph edges and weights are given?
2. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the number of nodes and edges? 
3. **Negative cycles**: Should the solution handle graphs with negative weight cycles and return `-1` if one is detected?
4. **Nodes indexing**: Are nodes indexed from `1` to `n` or from `0` to `n-1`?

Assuming the following based on typical problem formats:
- Nodes are indexed from `0` to `n-1`.
- The graph is given as a list of edges `(u, v, w)` where `u` is the starting node, `v` is the ending node, and `w` is the weight of the edge.
- Constraints allow for the use of Bellman-Ford algorithm to handle negative weights and detect negative weight cycles.
- If the number of nodes `n <= 5000` and the number of edges `m <= 10000`.

### Strategy:
Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm which is well suited for graphs with negative weights and can detect negative weight cycles. 

1. Initialize the distance to all nodes as infinity, except for the start node which is set to 0.
2. Relax all edges up to `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of nodes.
3. Check for negative weight cycles by relaxing all edges one more time. If any distance can still be minimized, a negative cycle exists.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int u, v, w;
};

int minimumCostWalk(int n, int m, int s, int d, vector<Edge>& edges) {
    vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
    dist[s] = 0;

    // Step 2: Relax all edges |V| - 1 times
    for (int i = 1; i <= n-1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            int u = edges[j].u;
            int v = edges[j].v;
            int w = edges[j].w;
            if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Check for negative-weight cycles
    for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
        int u = edges[j].u;
        int v = edges[j].v;
        int w = edges[j].w;
        if (dist[u] != INT_MAX && dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
            return -1; // Negative cycle detected
        }
    }

    return dist[d] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dist[d];
}

// Driver code
int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<Edge> edges(m);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        cin >> edges[i].u >> edges[i].v >> edges[i].w;
    }

    int s, d;
    cin >> s >> d;

    int result = minimumCostWalk(n, m, s, d, edges);

    if (result == -1) {
        cout << "Negative cycle detected or destination unreachable" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Minimum cost walk from " << s << " to " << d << " is " << result << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Initialization**: \(O(n)\)
- **Edge relaxation**: \(O(n \times m)\)
- **Cycle detection**: \(O(m)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), which is feasible for typical constraints like \(n \leq 5000\) and \(m \leq 10000\). This algorithm ensures that we can handle both negative weights and detection of negative cycles efficiently.
