[Leetcode 2217. Find Palindrome With Fixed Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2217)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `intLength`. You need to generate the lexicographically smallest palindrome of given `intLength`. The palindrome should be in the format of string, starting from smallest lexicographically value i.e., from 'a' to 'z'.

**Example:**
```plaintext
FindPalindromeWithFixedLength(3) -> "aaa"  // all characters are 'a' as it is smallest lexicographically
FindPalindromeWithFixedLength(5) -> "aaaaa"
```

**Constraints:**
- The palindrome string should be of a fixed length, given by `intLength`.
- The characters in the palindrome should be from 'a' to 'z' lexicographically.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the input always be a positive integer?
    - Yes, the length of a palindrome will always be a positive integer.

2. Is the output always expected to be lower-case?
    - Yes, the palindrome should be composed of lower-case letters only.

### Strategy

To generate the lexicographically smallest palindrome of a given length, we can simply construct a string where all characters are 'a' since 'a' is the smallest letter in lexicographical order.

The detailed steps are:
1. Create a string with all characters initialized to 'a'.
2. The length of this string must be equal to `intLength`.
3. Return the constructed string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string FindPalindromeWithFixedLength(int intLength) {
    // Construct a string of `intLength` filled with 'a'
    string palindrome(intLength, 'a');
    return palindrome;
}

int main() {
    int intLength = 3;
    cout << FindPalindromeWithFixedLength(intLength) << endl;  // Output: "aaa"

    intLength = 5;
    cout << FindPalindromeWithFixedLength(intLength) << endl;  // Output: "aaaaa"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the palindrome. This is because constructing a string of length `n` with 'a' involves iterating `n` times. 

### Additional Considerations

1. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that `intLength` is always positive.
2. **Memory Usage**: The space complexity is **O(n)** due to storing the resulting string of length `n`.
