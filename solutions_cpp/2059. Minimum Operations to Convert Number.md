[Leetcode 2059. Minimum Operations to Convert Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2059)
### Problem Statement
Given a start integer, an array of integers `nums`, and a goal integer, you need to determine the minimum number of operations needed to convert `start` to `goal` using the following operations:

1. Add any element from `nums` to `start`.
2. Subtract any element from `nums` from `start`.
3. Bitwise XOR any element from `nums` with `start`.

The aim is to find out the minimum number of operations required to convert from `start` to `goal`. If there is no way to achieve `goal`, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** What is the range of `start` and `goal` values?
  - **A:** Both `start` and `goal` can range from 0 to 1000.
  
- **Q:** What can be the maximum size of the `nums` array?
  - **A:** The `nums` array can contain up to 1000 elements.
  
- **Q:** Are the operations reversible or resulting values could be negative?
  - **A:** Operations can result in negative values, and we need to handle transitions through negative space to reach the goal.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) technique because BFS systematically explores the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here, each state represents an integer, and each operation (addition, subtraction, XOR) transitions between states.

1. Use a queue to implement BFS. The queue will store pairs of the current value and the current operation count.
2. Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.
3. Begin by pushing `(start, 0)` into the queue, indicating the start value with 0 operations.
4. For each element in the queue, apply all three operations using each number in `nums`.
5. If any result of these operations equals `goal`, return the current operation count + 1.
6. Push the resulting value and increment the operation count into the queue only if the value has not been visited yet.
7. If the queue is exhausted without finding the `goal`, return -1.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int minimumOperations(int start, vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    unordered_set<int> visited;
    
    q.push({start, 0});
    visited.insert(start);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, steps] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // If the goal is reached, return the number of times
        if (current == goal) {
            return steps;
        }
        
        // Explore all operations
        for (int num : nums) {
            vector<int> nextValues = {current + num, current - num, current ^ num};
            for (int next : nextValues) {
                if (next == goal) {
                    return steps + 1;
                }
                
                // Only push the next value if it has not been visited yet
                if (visited.find(next) == visited.end() && next >= INT_MIN && next <= INT_MAX) { 
                    q.push({next, steps + 1});
                    visited.insert(next);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If the goal was never reached
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 4};  // Example input
    int start = 3;
    int goal = 7;
    cout << minimumOperations(start, nums, goal) << endl;  // Expected output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N * M), where N is the size of `nums` and M is the range of possible values (in the worst-case scenario, all possible values are visited). Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible.
