[Leetcode 119. Pascals Triangle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l119)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndex`-th (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two directly above it as shown:

```
Example:
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `rowIndex`?
     - Typically, in LeetCode, the constraints are 0 <= `rowIndex` <= 33.

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return the resulting row as a vector of integers?
     - Yes, a vector of integers representing the specified row of Pascal's triangle.

## Strategy

To compute the `rowIndex`-th row of Pascal's triangle efficiently:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with the first row `[1]`.

2. **Iteratively Generate Rows:**
   - Use the row from the previous iteration to generate the next row.

3. **Direct Calculations:**
   - Without constructing the entire triangle, we can use a single vector and iteratively update it to form each subsequent row.

4. **Update Mechanism:**
   - For each row, starting from the end towards the beginning (to avoid overwriting values too early).

5. **Memory Efficiency:**
   - By using a single vector and updating it in place, the memory usage remains minimal.

## Code

Here's a C++ function implementing the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
    // Create a vector initialized with 0s except for the first element.
    std::vector<int> row(rowIndex + 1, 0);
    row[0] = 1;  // The first element is always 1

    // Compute the rowIndex-th row
    for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; ++i) {
        // Update the row from the end to the beginning
        for (int j = i; j > 0; --j) {
            row[j] += row[j - 1];
        }
    }

    return row;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - A vector `row` of size `rowIndex + 1` is initialized with zeros, and the first element is set to 1.

2. **Iterative Updates:**
   - The outer loop runs from `1` to `rowIndex`, representing the current row being computed.
   - The inner loop updates the vector from the end to the beginning. This ensures that the updates within the same row do not interfere with each other.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(rowIndex^2)`
  - Each row requires updating a number of elements proportional to the row index.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(rowIndex)`
  - A single vector of size `rowIndex + 1` is used for the result.

This efficient approach ensures that we generate the desired row of Pascal's triangle without constructing the entire triangle.
