[Leetcode 1691. Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1691)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` cuboids where the dimensions of the `i-th` cuboid is `cuboids[i] = [width_i, length_i, height_i]` (0-indexed). Choose a subset of the given cuboids and place them on each other.

You can place cuboid `i` on cuboid `j` if width_i <= width_j, length_i <= length_j, and height_i <= height_j. You can rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by permuting `width_i`, `length_i`, and `height_i`.

Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the dimensions of each cuboid be freely permuted before stacking?**
   Yes, you can permute the dimensions of each cuboid before stacking to fit the rules.

2. **Is there a limit to the number of cuboids?**
   The constraints do not specify this specifically beyond typical constraints in programming problems—handling thousands of cuboids should generally be feasible.

3. **Is each cuboid unique in its dimensions or can there be duplicates?**
   There can be duplicates, but each cuboid must still be considered individually in terms of placement.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Each Cuboid’s Dimensions:**
   To simplify stacking rules, sort the dimensions of each cuboid so that `width <= length <= height`.

2. **Sort Cuboids:**
   Sort the list of cuboids based on their sorted dimensions.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum height achievable with the cuboid `i` as the topmost cuboid.

   - Initialize each `dp[i]` with the height of its own cuboid.
   - For each cuboid `i`, consider every cuboid `j` with `j < i` and check if cuboid `i` can be placed on `j`. If so, update `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + height_i)`.

4. **Result:**
   The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxHeight(vector<vector<int>>& cuboids) {
    int n = cuboids.size();
    
    // Step 1: Sort dimensions of each cuboid
    for (auto &cuboid : cuboids) {
        sort(cuboid.begin(), cuboid.end());
    }
    
    // Step 2: Sort cuboids by dimensions
    sort(cuboids.begin(), cuboids.end());
    
    // Step 3: Dynamic Programming to find the maximum height
    vector<int> dp(n, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = cuboids[i][2]; // Initialize with height of the cuboid itself
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (cuboids[j][0] <= cuboids[i][0] && 
                cuboids[j][1] <= cuboids[i][1] && 
                cuboids[j][2] <= cuboids[i][2]) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cuboids[i][2]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Step 4: Return the maximum height from the dp array
    return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Dimensions of Each Cuboid:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Sorting Cuboids:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Dynamic Programming Update:** \(O(n^2)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n^2 + n \log n)\), which is dominated by \(O(n^2)\).

### Conclusion

By following the above-discussed approach, we ensure that we stack the cuboids in an optimal way to achieve the maximal height. Using sorting and dynamic programming provides an efficient solution to this problem.
