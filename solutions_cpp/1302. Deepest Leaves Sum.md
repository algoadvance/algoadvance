[Leetcode 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1302)
## Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15

Explanation: 
The deepest leaves are 7 and 8, and their sum is 15.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should we return if the binary tree is empty?
   - If the binary tree is empty, the sum of leaves should be 0.
2. How is the input provided?
   - The input is given as a binary tree, usually through its root node.
3. Can there be any negative values in the tree?
   - Yes, tree nodes can have any integer values, including negative numbers.

## Strategy
1. **Level Order Traversal (BFS)**:
   - Perform a level order traversal (BFS) to traverse each level of the tree.
   - Keep track of the sum of nodes at the current level.
   - The sum of the last level traversed would be the sum of the deepest leaves.

2. **Depth Tracking with DFS**:
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
   - Maintain the current depth and track the sum of leaf nodes at the maximum depth encountered so far.

Given the simplicity and clarity of breadth-first search (BFS) for this problem, we will implement the BFS approach.

## Code
Here is the C++ code implementing the BFS approach to find the sum of the deepest leaves:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr) return 0;

    std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int currentSum = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        currentSum = 0;  // reset the sum for the current level
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            currentSum += node->val;
            
            if (node->left != nullptr) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right != nullptr) q.push(node->right);
        }
    }

    return currentSum;
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(4, new TreeNode(7), nullptr), new TreeNode(5));
    root->right = new TreeNode(3, nullptr, new TreeNode(6, nullptr, new TreeNode(8)));

    std::cout << "Deepest Leaves Sum: " << deepestLeavesSum(root) << std::endl;  // Output: 15

    // Clean up memory (not necessary for the problem's context but good practice)
    delete root->left->left->left;  // delete 7
    delete root->left->left;        // delete 4
    delete root->left->right;       // delete 5
    delete root->left;              // delete 2
    delete root->right->right->right; // delete 8
    delete root->right->right;        // delete 6
    delete root->right;               // delete 3
    delete root;                      // delete 1

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the tree. This is because we use a queue to store nodes of the current level.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the sum of the deepest leaves using BFS.
