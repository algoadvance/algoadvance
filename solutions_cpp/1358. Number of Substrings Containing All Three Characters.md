[Leetcode 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1358)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', your task is to find the number of substrings that contain at least one occurrence of all the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Length:** What is the maximum length of the string `s`? 
   - The problem states no explicit size limits, but standard constraints may apply (e.g., up to \(10^5\) characters).
   
2. **Character Assumptions:** Should we only consider lowercase 'a', 'b', 'c', or will the string contain any other characters?
   - The problem specifies that the string only contains 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

### Strategy:
1. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use a sliding window to track the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the current substring. Expand the window until it contains all three characters, then attempt to contract it from the left while maintaining the condition.
2. **Counting Substrings:** Each time you find a valid window `[left, right]`, all substrings ending at `right` and starting from any position `i` (where `left <= i <= right`) are valid. Therefore, add `len(s) - right` to the count of valid substrings.

### Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

int numberOfSubstrings(const std::string& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    int count = 0;
    std::unordered_map<char, int> window;
    
    while (right < n) {
        char charRight = s[right];
        window[charRight]++;
        
        while (window['a'] > 0 && window['b'] > 0 && window['c'] > 0) {
            count += n - right;  // All substrings ending from right to end of string are valid
            char charLeft = s[left];
            window[charLeft]--;
            left++;
        }
        
        right++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abcabc";
    std::cout << "Number of substrings: " << numberOfSubstrings(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup:** Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the start of the string, and a hash map `window` to track the count of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the current window.
2. **Expanding Window:** Increment the count of the character at the `right` pointer in the `window` map. Move the `right` pointer to the right.
3. **Valid Window:** When the window contains at least one of each character ('a', 'b', 'c'), calculate how many substrings can be formed with the current `right` pointer and update the count.
4. **Contracting Window:** Move the `left` pointer to the right, decrementing the count of the character at the `left` pointer in the `window` map, until the window is no longer valid.
5. **Count Update:** After each valid window is identified, increment the count of valid substrings by the number of possible substrings ending at or after the `right` pointer.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. The sliding window expands each pointer linearly throughout the string.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) constant space for the hash map since it only stores counts for three characters ('a', 'b', 'c').

This approach efficiently counts the number of substrings containing all three characters with minimal overhead.
