[Leetcode 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1466)
### Problem Statement
You are given `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` roads such that there is only one path between any two cities. The roads are represented by an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a road from city `a` to city `b`.

Your goal is to reorder the roads in such a way that all the paths lead to the city `0`. Return the minimum number of edges that need to be changed.

### Example
```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges (1, 3), (2, 3) and (4, 5) to make all paths lead to city 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can cities other than city 0 act as sources or destinations in the input?**
   - Yes, connections between any two cities are possible.
2. **Are the connections bidirectional initially?**
   - No, the connections have a direction as specified in the input.
3. **Is there guaranteed to be exactly `n-1` roads?**
   - Yes, since the problem guarantees there is one unique path between any two cities.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list where we store the directed edges as well as a set to keep track of the original directions.
2. **DFS/BFS Traversal**: Start traversal from city 0, and for each connection check if the direction needs to be reversed. If a reversal is needed, increment the count.
3. **Visited Array**: Use a visited array to keep track of visited cities to prevent cycles and redundant work.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minReorder(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        // Adjacency list for graph representation
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adjList;
        // Direction set to check original directions of edges
        unordered_set<string> directionSet;
        
        // Build the graph and direction set
        for (const auto& conn : connections) {
            adjList[conn[0]].push_back(conn[1]);
            adjList[conn[1]].push_back(conn[0]);
            directionSet.insert(to_string(conn[0]) + "_" + to_string(conn[1]));
        }
        
        // BFS initialization
        queue<int> q;
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        q.push(0);
        visited[0] = true;
        int result = 0;

        // BFS traversal
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int currentCity = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for (const int& neighbor : adjList[currentCity]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    // Check if the current edge needs to be reversed
                    if (directionSet.count(to_string(currentCity) + "_" + to_string(neighbor))) {
                        result++;
                    }
                    q.push(neighbor);
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 6;
    vector<vector<int>> connections = \{\{0,1}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {4,0}, {4,5}};
    cout << sol.minReorder(n, connections) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Building the adjacency list and direction set: O(n)
- BFS traversal: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**. This is efficient for the problem constraints.
