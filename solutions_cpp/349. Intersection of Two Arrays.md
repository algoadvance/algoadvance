[Leetcode 349. Intersection of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l349)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique, and you may return the result in any order.

**Example 1:**

- Input: `nums1 = [1,2,2,1]`, `nums2 = [2,2]`
- Output: `[2]`

**Example 2:**

- Input: `nums1 = [4,9,5]`, `nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]`
- Output: `[9,4]`
- Explanation: `[4, 9]` is also accepted.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the input arrays sorted?**
   - No, the arrays are not guaranteed to be sorted.

2. **Can we assume the input will always contain integers only?**
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies integer arrays.

3. **What should we return if there is no intersection?**
   - Return an empty array.

4. **Are there any constraints on the input size?**
   - The problem statement does not mention constraints, so we should handle general cases efficiently.

### Strategy

1. **Set Data Structure**: Use sets to easily manage and find the intersection of elements.
   
   - Convert both `nums1` and `nums2` to sets to eliminate duplicates.
   - Use the `set_intersection` algorithm to find common elements.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Convert `nums1` and `nums2` to sets.
   - Compute the intersection of these sets.
   - Convert the result back to a vector as required by the problem.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - Converting arrays to sets: O(n + m), where n is the size of `nums1` and m is the size of `nums2`.
   - Computing the intersection of two sets: O(min(n, m)).
   - Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> intersection(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    std::set<int> set1(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    std::set<int> set2(nums2.begin(), nums2.end());
    
    std::vector<int> result;
    std::set_intersection(set1.begin(), set1.end(), set2.begin(), set2.end(), std::back_inserter(result));
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We create a set from `nums1` and another set from `nums2` to eliminate duplicates and facilitate intersection finding.

2. **Finding Intersection**:
   - We use `std::set_intersection` from the Standard Library to find the common elements between the two sets.

3. **Result Compilation**:
   - The intersection set is then converted back to a vector and returned as the final result.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the unique intersection elements between the two input arrays.
