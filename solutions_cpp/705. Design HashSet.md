[Leetcode 705. Design HashSet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l705)
### Problem Statement
Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement `MyHashSet` class:
- `void add(int key)`: Inserts the value key into the HashSet.
- `bool contains(int key)`: Returns whether the value key exists in the HashSet or not.
- `void remove(int key)`: Removes the value key in the HashSet. If key does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the `key` values that we need to handle?
   - **Answer:** We can assume keys are non-negative integers in the range `[0, 10^6)`.

2. Is it necessary to ensure that the operations are time efficient?
   - **Answer:** Yes, the operations should ideally be O(1) on average.

### Strategy
We'll use a combination of a hash table with chaining to handle collisions and an array to store the values. Here is the strategy:
1. **Hash Function:** We'll design a simple hash function using modulo operation.
2. **Buckets:** Use an array of linked lists (or similar structure) for the hashing, with each index in the array representing a bucket.
3. **Handling Collisions:** When a collision occurs (two keys hashing to the same index), we will handle it by chaining nodes in a linked list at that index.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <list>

class MyHashSet {
private:
    static const int BUCKET_SIZE = 769;  // A prime number bucket size
    std::vector<std::list<int>> buckets;
    
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % BUCKET_SIZE;
    }

public:
    MyHashSet() {
        buckets.resize(BUCKET_SIZE);
    }
    
    void add(int key) {
        int bucket_idx = hash(key);
        auto &bucket = buckets[bucket_idx];
        for (int el : bucket) {
            if (el == key) return;  // Key already exists
        }
        bucket.push_back(key);
    }
    
    bool contains(int key) {
        int bucket_idx = hash(key);
        auto &bucket = buckets[bucket_idx];
        for (int el : bucket) {
            if (el == key) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    void remove(int key) {
        int bucket_idx = hash(key);
        auto &bucket = buckets[bucket_idx];
        bucket.remove(key);  // Removes the first occurrence of key
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyHashSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyHashSet* obj = new MyHashSet();
 * obj->add(key);
 * bool param_2 = obj->contains(key);
 * obj->remove(key);
 */
```

### Time Complexity
- **add(key)**: O(1) on average. This is because the average length of the bucket is constant, assuming a good distribution of keys.
- **contains(key)**: O(1) on average. Same reasoning as above.
- **remove(key)**: O(1) on average. Again, this holds if our hash function distributes keys well.

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: O(N + B)
  - N is the number of unique keys added.
  - B is the bucket size, which is a constant (769 in our case).

This approach effectively balances the need for simplicity and efficiency, ensuring that operations remain performant across a wide range of expected inputs.
