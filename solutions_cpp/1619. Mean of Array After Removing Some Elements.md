[Leetcode 1619. Mean of Array After Removing Some Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1619)
### Problem Statement
The problem is to find the mean of an array after removing some elements. Specifically, you are to remove the smallest 5% and the largest 5% of the elements, and then calculate the mean of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input always a list of integers?
   - Can the input list contain negative numbers?
   - What if the list length is less than required to perform the 5% removal?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the mean be returned as a float or can it be an integer if the result is a whole number?
   - To what precision should the mean be presented (number of decimal places)?

### Strategy
1. **Remove outliers:**
   - Calculate the 5% of the array's length.
   - Sort the array to easily remove the smallest and largest 5% of elements.

2. **Calculate the Mean:**
   - Sum the elements of the remaining array.
   - Divide by the new length of the array to get the mean.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If array length is too short (less than 20 elements), handle gracefully since 5% removal from both ends doesn't make sense (0.05 * n should be at least 1).

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Removing elements and calculating the sum: \(O(n)\)
- Overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code
Below is the C++ solution for the given problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    double trimMean(std::vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int removeCount = n * 0.05;   // 5% of the size
        
        // Sort the array
        std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        
        // Calculate the sum of the remaining array after removing smallest and largest 5%
        double sum = 0;
        for (int i = removeCount; i < n - removeCount; ++i) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        
        // Calculate the new length after removal
        int newLength = n - 2 * removeCount;
        
        // Calculate and return the mean
        return sum / newLength;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting:**
   - The array is sorted to facilitate easy removal of the smallest 5% and largest 5% elements.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - A loop runs from `removeCount` to `n - removeCount` to sum the middle portion of the array.

3. **Mean Calculation:**
   - The sum is then divided by the new length of the array to compute the mean.

### Test Cases
To verify the correctness of the solution, consider the following test cases:
1. An array with distinct elements.
2. An array with repeated elements.
3. An edge case where the array has fewer than 20 elements.

Example:
```cpp
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20};
    std::cout << sol.trimMean(arr1) << std::endl;  // Expected output: mean after removing 5% smallest and largest elements
    return 0;
}
```
Be sure to customize the test cases based on the mean of the results after removing the 5% of smallest and largest elements.
