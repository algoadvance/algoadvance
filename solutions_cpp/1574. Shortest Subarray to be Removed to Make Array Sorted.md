[Leetcode 1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1574)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, remove a subarray (can be empty) that makes the remaining elements of the array sorted in non-decreasing order. Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on array size and values?**
   - `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

2. **Output requirements?**
   - Return the length of the shortest subarray that needs to be removed to make the rest of the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Type of sorting?**
   - Non-decreasing order, meaning each element is less than or equal to the next element.

4. **Can the subarray be empty?**
   - Yes, if the array is already sorted, the length of subarray to remove would be 0.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following steps:

1. **Find Longest Non-Decreasing Subarray from Start:** Determine the length of the longest non-decreasing prefix from the beginning of the array.
2. **Find Longest Non-Decreasing Subarray from End:** Determine the length of the longest non-decreasing suffix from the end of the array.
3. **Combine Prefix and Suffix:** If they overlap or meet, the array is already sorted.
4. **Merge Possibilities:** Try to merge the prefix and suffix by removing elements in the middle. This involves:
   - Remove elements to make the arr prefix up to `i` and suffix from `j` valid.
   - Use two pointers to find valid combinations and calculate the minimum subarray to remove.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int findLengthOfShortestSubarray(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    
    // Step 1: Identify the longest non-decreasing prefix
    int left = 0;
    while (left < n - 1 && arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]) {
        ++left;
    }
    
    // If the whole array is already non-decreasing
    if (left == n - 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Identify the longest non-decreasing suffix
    int right = n - 1;
    while (right > 0 && arr[right - 1] <= arr[right]) {
        --right;
    }
    
    // Initialize the minimum length to remove to min remove prefix or suffix
    int minLengthToRemove = min(n - left - 1, right);
    
    // Step 3: Try to merge prefix with suffix
    int i = 0, j = right;
    while (i <= left && j < n) {
        if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
            minLengthToRemove = min(minLengthToRemove, j - i - 1);
            ++i;
        } else {
            ++j;
        }
    }
    
    return minLengthToRemove;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution processes the array in several linear scans and could involve a two pointer approach which can also be linear. Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, hence the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

This efficient approach ensures that the problem is solved in optimal time, especially given the input constraints.
