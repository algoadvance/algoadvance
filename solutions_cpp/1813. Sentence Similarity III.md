[Leetcode 1813. Sentence Similarity III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1813)
### Problem Statement

We are given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`. Each sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces that separate the words. We want to determine if they are similar. Two sentences are defined to be similar if one can be obtained from the other by inserting or deleting words at the beginning or the end of the sentence. We need to return `true` if the sentences are similar, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the sentences be empty?
    - Based on the problem definition, it's reasonable to assume the sentences will contain at least one word each.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the sentences?
    - The constraint is typically within the reasonable bounds for a typical interview problem (e.g., 1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100).

### Strategy

1. Split both sentences into words.
2. Check for similarity by comparing sections from both sentences:
   - Start by checking if the beginning of one sentence matches the beginning of another sentence.
   - Then, check if the end of one sentence matches the end of another sentence.

### Code

Below is the implementation of our strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<string> splitSentence(const string &sentence) {
    vector<string> words;
    istringstream stream(sentence);
    string word;
    while (stream >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }
    return words;
}

bool areSentencesSimilar(string sentence1, string sentence2) {
    vector<string> words1 = splitSentence(sentence1);
    vector<string> words2 = splitSentence(sentence2);

    // Early exit if both sentences are equal
    if (words1 == words2) {
        return true;
    }

    int n = words1.size();
    int m = words2.size();
    
    // Check common prefix
    int prefix = 0;
    while (prefix < n && prefix < m && words1[prefix] == words2[prefix]) {
        prefix++;
    }

    // Check common suffix
    int suffix = 0;
    while (suffix < n && suffix < m && words1[n - suffix - 1] == words2[m - suffix - 1]) {
        suffix++;
    }

    // Evaluate the overall similarity condition
    return prefix + suffix >= min(n, m);
}

int main() {
    string sentence1 = "my name is John";
    string sentence2 = "my name John";
    cout << (areSentencesSimilar(sentence1, sentence2) ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Splitting the sentences into words takes O(N + M) time where N and M are the lengths of `sentence1` and `sentence2`, respectively.
- Comparing the words from the start and the end takes O(min(K, L)), where K and L are the lengths of the word vectors derived from `sentence1` and `sentence2`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(N + M).
