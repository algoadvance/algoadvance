[Leetcode 2092. Find All People With Secret](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2092)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` denoting the total number of people labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Initially, a secret is known to a person with the label `0`. You are also given a 2D integer array `meetings`, where `meetings[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]` denotes that person `x_i` and person `y_i` met at time `time_i`. A person `A` can share the secret with person `B` if they meet at the same time. The secret spreads if one of them possesses the secret at the time of meeting.

Return a list of all the people, sorted in ascending order, that possesses the secret after all the meetings have taken place.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarification on Input:**
   - Should `meetings` be processed in any specific order?
   - Will there be duplicate meeting entries in the `meetings` array?
2. **Behavioral Clarifications:**
   - Should the result always be a sorted list of people who know the secret by the end?
   - If two people meet multiple times, does it matter in which instance the secret is shared, or should all instances be accounted for?

### Code

#### Strategy and Solution

1. **Sort Meetings by Time:** First, sort all the meetings based on the meeting time.
2. **Use Union-Find Structure:** To efficiently manage connections between people and propagate the secret, use a Union-Find data structure.
3. **Process Meetings in Groups:** For each unique time, unite people who met at that time and spread the secret if at least one of them knows it.

This approach ensures that we manage the propagation efficiently while respecting the meeting times.

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAllPeople(int n, vector<vector<int>>& meetings, int firstPerson) {
        // Union-Find helpers
        vector<int> parent(n), rank(n, 0);
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);

        function<int(int)> find = [&](int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        };

        auto unionSets = [&](int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        };

        // Initially, connect person 0 and firstPerson
        unionSets(0, firstPerson);

        // Sort meetings by time
        sort(meetings.begin(), meetings.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
            return a[2] < b[2];
        });

        int m = meetings.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < m;) {
            int currentTime = meetings[i][2];
            
            vector<pair<int, int>> currentMeetings;
            while (i < m && meetings[i][2] == currentTime) {
                currentMeetings.push_back({meetings[i][0], meetings[i][1]});
                i++;
            }

            for (auto& meeting : currentMeetings) {
                unionSets(meeting.first, meeting.second);
            }

            for (auto& meeting : currentMeetings) {
                int root1 = find(meeting.first);
                int root2 = find(meeting.second);
                if (find(0) != root1 && find(0) != root2) {
                    parent[meeting.first] = meeting.first;
                    parent[meeting.second] = meeting.second;
                }
            }
        }

        unordered_set<int> secrets;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (find(i) == find(0)) {
                secrets.insert(i);
            }
        }

        vector<int> result(secrets.begin(), secrets.end());
        sort(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting the Meetings:** `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of meetings.
- **Union-Find Operations:** Almost constant time due to path compression and union by rank, effectively `O(α(n))` per operation.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(m log m + n α(n))`, where `m` is the number of meetings and `n` is the number of people.
