[Leetcode 1616. Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1616)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `a` and `b`, of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting `a` into two substrings: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`, and splitting `b` into two substrings: `b[:i]` and `b[i:]`. Check if there is an index in such a way that `a[:i] + b[i:]` or `b[:i] + a[i:]` forms a palindrome.

Return `true` if there is such an index, otherwise return `false`.

### Examples:

- Example 1:
    ```
    Input: a = "x", b = "y"
    Output: true
    Explanation: If either of the strings is a single character, we can split at index 0 which would make both substrings "" and the entire other string remains, which is a single character and is trivially a palindrome.
    ```

- Example 2:
    ```
    Input: a = "abdef", b = "fecab"
    Output: true
    Explanation: Split at index 2 to get: "ab" + "cab" = "abcab" which is a palindrome.
    ```

- Example 3:
    ```
    Input: a = "ulacfd", b = "jizalu"
    Output: true
    Explanation: Split at index 3: "ula" + "alu" = "ulala" which is a palindrome.
    ```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum length of strings `a` and `b`?
   - The constraint on the length of the strings should be specified in the problem, but LeetCode typically handles strings up to lengths around \(10^3\) to \(10^5\).

2. Are the strings guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, since problem states that strings `a` and `b` are of the same (non-zero) length.

3. Can the strings contain special characters or just lowercase alphabets?
   - For simplicity, let's assume the strings comprise lowercase alphabets.

## Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Approach**:
   - Utilize a two-pointer technique to traverse the strings from both ends towards the middle.
   - When characters at the current pointers do not match, check if swapping substrings can form a palindrome.

2. **Helper Function**:
   - Use a helper function `isPalindrome` to check if a given string is a palindrome.

3. **Iterate through split points**:
   - For each split point, check if forming the substring by splitting at that point results in a palindrome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider cases with the smallest possible strings (e.g., single-character strings).

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool isPalindrome(const std::string &str, int left, int right) {
    while (left < right) {
        if (str[left] != str[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

bool checkPalindromeFormation(std::string a, std::string b) {
    int n = a.size();
    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    
    // Helper function to check the two possibilities iteratively
    auto check = [&](const std::string &a, const std::string &b) {
        while (i < j && a[i] == b[j]) {
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return isPalindrome(a, i, j) || isPalindrome(b, i, j);
    };

    // Check both combinations
    return check(a, b) || check(b, a);
}

int main() {
    std::string a, b;
    
    // Example 1
    a = "abdef";
    b = "fecab";
    std::cout << (checkPalindromeFormation(a, b) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    
    // Example 2
    a = "ulacfd";
    b = "jizalu";
    std::cout << (checkPalindromeFormation(a, b) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    
    // Example 3
    a = "x";
    b = "y";
    std::cout << (checkPalindromeFormation(a, b) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings `a` and `b`. This is because the two-pointer traversal and palindromic checks are linear in nature.

This completes the solution for the given problem.
