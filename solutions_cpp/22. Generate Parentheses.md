[Leetcode 22. Generate Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l22)
## Problem Statement
Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of `n`? 
      - Typically `n` can range from 1 to 8 or 10 for competitive programming problems due to the exponential growth in the number of combinations.

2. **Output Requirements:**
    - Should the output be a list of strings where each string represents a valid combination of parentheses?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, a common approach is to use backtracking. The idea is to build the parentheses string step by step and ensure that at every step the string being built is a valid prefix of some valid well-formed parentheses combination.

1. **Recursive Function Definition:**
   - Define a recursive function that takes the current state of the string, number of open brackets, and number of close brackets.
   - Base Case: When the current length of the string is equal to `2 * n`, add the string to the result list.
   - For every recursive call, you can:
     - Add an open parenthesis if it's allowed (i.e., the number of open parentheses used so far is less than `n`).
     - Add a close parenthesis if it's allowed (i.e., the number of close parentheses used so far is less than the number of open parentheses used).

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        vector<string> result;
        generateParenthesisRecursive(result, "", 0, 0, n);
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    void generateParenthesisRecursive(vector<string>& result, string current, int open, int close, int n) {
        if(current.size() == n * 2) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }
        
        // Try adding an open parenthesis if we can
        if(open < n) {
            generateParenthesisRecursive(result, current + "(", open + 1, close, n);
        }
        
        // Try adding a close parenthesis if we can
        if(close < open) {
            generateParenthesisRecursive(result, current + ")", open, close + 1, n);
        }
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 3;
    vector<string> result = solution.generateParenthesis(n);
    for(const string& combination : result) {
        cout << combination << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(4^n / sqrt(n))`. This is derived from the fact that the number of valid permutations of `n` pairs of parentheses is the Catalan number, which is `C(n) = (1 / (n + 1)) * (2n choose n)`. 

Thus, the number of function calls grows exponentially with `n`, explaining the exponential nature of `4^n`. The division by `sqrt(n)` comes from the combinatorial reduction factor related to Catalan numbers.
