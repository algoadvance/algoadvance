[Leetcode 502. IPO](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l502)
### Problem Statement

The problem is borrowed from LeetCode's 'IPO' problem (Problem #502):

You are given several projects. For each project `i`, you have a certain profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital `capital[i]` is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you obtain its profit and the profit is added to your total capital. 

Given the `n` projects and `k` maximum number of projects that you can start, find the maximum capital you can accumulate after finishing at most `k` different projects.

**Note:** You can only start one project at a time.

**Example:**
```
Input: k = 2, W = 0, Profits = [1,2,3], Capital = [0,1,1]
Output: 4

Explanation: 
Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
Then you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.
Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 1 + 3 = 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the projects guaranteed to have unique profits and capital requirements?
   **A:** No, they can have duplicates.
   
2. **Q:** Can the order of the projects in profits and capital differ?
   **A:** No, both arrays correspond to the same projects. profits[i] and capital[i] correspond to the same project.

3. **Q:** Can we implement auxiliary data structures like heaps?
   **A:** Yes, using a heap (priority queue) is encouraged to manage the selections efficiently.

4. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `k`, `W`, `profits`, or `capital`?
   **A:** Standard constraints apply, typically within the range of feasible computational limits for C++.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combination of a min-heap and a max-heap:
1. **Min-Heap:** To manage projects by their capital requirements.
2. **Max-Heap:** To manage the profits of the projects we are able to undertake.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - A min-heap to store projects by their capital requirements.
   - A max-heap to store eligible projects we can start based on current capital.

2. **Heap Population:**
   - Populate the min-heap with all projects sorted according to capital requirements.

3. **Processing Projects:**
   - For up to `k` iterations, do the following:
     - Move all projects from the min-heap to the max-heap if they can be started with the current available capital.
     - If the max-heap is empty and no project can be started, break the loop.
     - Otherwise, pick the project with the maximum profit from the max-heap, start it, and increase the current available capital by the profit.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int W, vector<int>& Profits, vector<int>& Capital) {
        // Create min-heap to sort projects by their capital requirements
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> minCapitalHeap;
        
        // Create max-heap to store projects by profits
        priority_queue<int> maxProfitHeap;
        
        // Populate the minCapitalHeap with all projects
        for (int i = 0; i < Profits.size(); i++) {
            minCapitalHeap.push({Capital[i], Profits[i]});
        }
        
        // Process up to k projects
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Transfer all projects that can be started with current available capital to maxProfitHeap
            while (!minCapitalHeap.empty() && minCapitalHeap.top().first <= W) {
                maxProfitHeap.push(minCapitalHeap.top().second);
                minCapitalHeap.pop();
            }
            
            // If no project can be started, break the loop
            if (maxProfitHeap.empty())
                break;
            
            // Otherwise, start the project with the highest profit
            W += maxProfitHeap.top();
            maxProfitHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return W;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the initial min-heap takes `O(n log n)`.
- Each insertion and extraction from the heaps will take `O(log n)`, and since we are processing up to `k` projects, this part will take `O(k log n)`.

**Overall complexity:** `O(n log n + k log n)` where `n` is the number of projects.
