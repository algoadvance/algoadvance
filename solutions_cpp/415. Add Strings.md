[Leetcode 415. Add Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l415)
## Problem Statement

You are given two non-negative integers represented as string `num1` and `num2`, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as Python's `int`) and without converting the inputs to integers directly.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the maximum length for the input strings?
   - *Response*: The input strings can be very large, up to \(10^4\) digits.

2. **Leading Zeros**: Can the input strings contain leading zeros?
   - *Response*: Yes, but the answer should not contain leading zeros, except when the answer is "0".

3. **Character Set**: Are the input strings guaranteed to only contain digits (0-9)?
   - *Response*: Yes, the input strings will only contain digits.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the elementary school addition method but performed on strings. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Append Zeros for Equal Length**: To make the addition easier, start by appending leading zeros to the shorter string so that both strings have the same length. This simplifies the digit-wise addition as we won't run into out-of-bound issues.

2. **Addition from Right to Left**: Perform the addition from the rightmost end (least significant digit) to the leftmost end (most significant digit). Keep track of the carry for each step.

3. **Construct Result**: Append the result of each digit's addition to the result string. Finally, if there's any carry left after the final addition, append it to the result.

4. **Edge Cases**: Ensure to handle cases where the strings have vastly different lengths and when there is an overflow carry at the final step.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string addStrings(std::string num1, std::string num2) {
    int n1 = num1.size();
    int n2 = num2.size();
    int maxLength = std::max(n1, n2);
    
    // Pad the shorter string with leading zeros
    if (n1 < maxLength) {
        num1.insert(num1.begin(), maxLength - n1, '0');
    } else if (n2 < maxLength) {
        num2.insert(num2.begin(), maxLength - n2, '0');
    }
    
    std::string result;
    int carry = 0;
    
    // Perform addition from right to left
    for (int i = maxLength - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int digit1 = num1[i] - '0';
        int digit2 = num2[i] - '0';
        
        int sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;
        carry = sum / 10;
        int current_digit = sum % 10;
        
        result.push_back(current_digit + '0');
    }
    
    if (carry > 0) {
        result.push_back(carry + '0');
    }
    
    // The result is in reverse order
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string num1 = "456";
    std::string num2 = "77";
    std::cout << "Sum: " << addStrings(num1, num2) << std::endl; // 533
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(max(N, M))**, where \(N\) and \(M\) are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`, respectively. This is because we are processing each digit of both strings exactly once. Additionally, the space complexity is also **O(max(N, M))** due to the storage of the result string and padding of the shorter string.
