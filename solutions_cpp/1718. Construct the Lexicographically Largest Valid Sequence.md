[Leetcode 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1718)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. You need to construct a sequence of length `2n - 1` where it contains numbers from `1` to `n` in such a way that each number `i` (for `i > 1`) appears exactly twice and the two occurrences of `i` are `i` distance apart. The number `1` appears exactly once. The objective is to construct the lexicographically largest valid sequence.

Return the lexicographically largest sequence.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be done if no valid sequence can be formed?
   **A:** It is guaranteed that a valid sequence can always be formed for the given `n`.

2. **Q:** What is the range of `n`?
   **A:** As per typical constraints, `1 <= n <= 20`.

3. **Q:** How should the output be represented?
   **A:** The output should be a vector representing the sequence.

### Strategy

To build the lexicographically largest sequence, we can use a backtracking approach:

1. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - Start from the largest number `n` to the smallest number `1`.
   - Ensure that the two positions for any number `i` are `i` distance apart.
   - If a number can be placed, recursively proceed with the next number.
   - If itâ€™s not possible to place the current number, backtrack and try again.

2. **Tracking State:**
   - Use a vector `result` of size `2n - 1` initialized with `0` to indicate unoccupied positions.
   - Use a vector `used` to keep track of the numbers that have been placed.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - The function attempts to place each number starting from `n` down to `1`.
   - For each valid placement of a number `i`, recursively place the next number.
   - If a placement does not lead to a solution, undo the placement and try the next possibility.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> constructDistancedSequence(int n) {
        std::vector<int> result(2 * n - 1, 0);
        std::vector<bool> used(n + 1, false);
        backtrack(result, used, 0, n);
        return result;
    }

private:
    bool backtrack(std::vector<int>& result, std::vector<bool>& used, int index, int n) {
        if (index == result.size()) {
            return true;
        }
        if (result[index] != 0) {
            return backtrack(result, used, index + 1, n);
        }

        for (int num = n; num >= 1; --num) {
            if (used[num]) {
                continue;
            }
            if (num == 1) {
                result[index] = 1;
                used[1] = true;
                if (backtrack(result, used, index + 1, n)) {
                    return true;
                }
                result[index] = 0;
                used[1] = false;
            } else {
                if (index + num < result.size() && result[index + num] == 0) {
                    result[index] = num;
                    result[index + num] = num;
                    used[num] = true;
                    if (backtrack(result, used, index + 1, n)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    result[index] = 0;
                    result[index + num] = 0;
                    used[num] = false;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O((2n-1)!)`. This is due to the recursive nature of backtracking where each step involves multiple branches. However, since `n` is typically small (e.g., `n <= 20`), this approach is computationally feasible.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - The `result` vector has size `2n - 1` with all elements initialized to `0`.
   - The `used` vector tracks whether a number has been placed in the sequence.

2. **Backtracking function:**
   - If the current index is already occupied (`result[index] != 0`), skip to the next index.
   - Try to place each number from `n` to `1`.
   - For `num = 1`, place it at the current index.
   - For `num > 1`, ensure both positions `index` and `index + num` are available.
   - Recursively try to complete the sequence with the current placements.
   - If placing the number does not work out, undo the placement (backtrack).

By following this strategy, the code constructs the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
