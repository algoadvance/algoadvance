[Leetcode 3226. Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3226)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return the number of bit positions in which the two numbers differ. In other words, find how many bits are different between the binary representation of `start` and `goal`.

For example:

- If `start` is `3` (which is `011` in binary) and `goal` is `5` (which is `101` in binary), the function should return `2` because the bits at positions 0 and 1 are different.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of input values for `start` and `goal`?
    - Typically, they are 32-bit integers.

2. Should we handle negative numbers?
    - Yes, negative numbers can be handled using their two's complement representation.

3. Is the function expected to be performant for any value within the 32-bit range?
    - Yes, the operation should ideally be O(1) since we mainly work on binary representation.

These clarifications confirm the scope and expected handling of the inputs.

## Strategy

1. To find the number of differing bits between `start` and `goal`, we can employ the XOR operation (`^`), which yields a bit set to `1` only where the bits of its operands differ.
    - Example: `start = 3 (011)`, `goal = 5 (101)`. The XOR result is `011 ^ 101 = 110`.

2. Next, we need to count the number of `1`s in the result of `start ^ goal`. This can be achieved using the __builtin_popcount method in GCC/Clang or manually counting the bits.

### Steps:

1. Compute the XOR of `start` and `goal`.
2. Count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the XOR result using a bitwise operation loop.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
    // Step 1: XOR start and goal to get differing bits
    int xor_result = start ^ goal;
    
    // Step 2: Count the number of 1 bits in the xor_result
    int count = 0;
    while (xor_result) {
        count += xor_result & 1;
        xor_result >>= 1;
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int start = 3;
    int goal = 5;
    std::cout << "Number of bit changes: " << minBitFlips(start, goal) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the proposed solution is:
- **O(1)**: Since we are operating on a fixed number of bits (e.g., 32 for standard integers), the loop to count bits set to `1` will always perform a constant number of operations.

The provided solution adheres to the expected performance considerations for bit manipulation problems involving fixed-width integers.
