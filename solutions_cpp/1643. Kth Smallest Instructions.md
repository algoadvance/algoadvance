[Leetcode 1643. Kth Smallest Instructions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1643)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `destination = [x, y]` representing your location at the coordinate (x, y). You are also given an integer `k`. You need to return the kth lexicographically smallest instructions to reach the destination. The four instructions "H" (move right) and "V" (move down) are used to reach the position (x, y) from the origin (0, 0).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints can we assume for `x`, `y`, and `k`?**
   - Constraints usually fit within the limits of the problem description, x and y will typically be positive integers and `1 <= k <= nCk(x + y, x)` where `nCk` is the binomial coefficient.

2. **What should we return if `k` is out of bounds?**
   - Assuming input will always be well-formed as per problem constraints.

3. **Does moving "H" right and "V" down exhaust the possible moves always?**
   - Yes, the total moves will always be `x` right ("H") and `y` down ("V").

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Character Count**: We should take exactly `x` "H" moves and `y` "V" moves.
2. **Lexicographical Order**: We need to determine the correct order of moves, starting from lexicographically smallest.

A useful observation here is to use combinatorial counting. Let's decide between "H" and "V" at each step by:
1. Counting how many valid sequences start with "H".
2. Using the binomial coefficient `C(x + y - 1, x - 1)` to count these sequences.
3. If k is less than or equal to this count, the next move will be "H", otherwise it will be "V" and adjust `k` accordingly.

Implementing this involves dynamic decisions to form the sequence based on remaining moves and `k`.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the C++ code to implement the above logic:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to compute binomial coefficient
long long binomialCoeff(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n - k)
        k = n - k;
    long long res = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        res *= (n - i);
        res /= (i + 1);
    }
    return res;
}

string kthSmallestPath(vector<int>& destination, int k) {
    int x = destination[0], y = destination[1];
    string result;
    
    // Iterate until we have formed the exact sequence
    while (x > 0 && y > 0) {
        int moveH = binomialCoeff(x + y - 1, y);
        
        // If k is less than or equal to count of paths starting with 'H'
        if (k <= moveH) {
            result += 'H';
            y--;
        } else {
            result += 'V';
            k -= moveH;
            x--;
        }
    }
    
    // Append remaining 'H' or 'V'
    result.append(y, 'H');
    result.append(x, 'V');
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The most time-consuming step is calculating the binomial coefficient which is O(min(x, y)).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is mainly O(1) for the extra variables, ignoring the output.

This approach ensures we intelligently determine each move based on the combinatorial counts and dynamically adjusts `k` to find the precise kth lexicographically smallest sequence.
