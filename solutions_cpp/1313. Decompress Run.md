[Leetcode 1313. Decompress Run](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1313)
### Problem Statement
Given a list `nums` of integers, where `nums[i]` for all `i` is part of a run-length encoded list. For example, consider the list `[freq1, val1, freq2, val2, ...]` where each pair `(frequencyn, valuen)` means that `val` appears `freq` times. Construct and return the decompressed list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: Is the length of `nums` guaranteed to be even?
   - **Yes**, the length of `nums` is guaranteed to be even.
2. **Value Constraints**: Can the values in `nums` be negative or zero?
   - **The frequencies (`freq`) will always be positive integers**, but the values (`val`) can be any integers.

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty result list.
2. Loop through the `nums` list in steps of 2, treating each pair of elements as `(freq, val)`.
3. For each pair, append `val` to the result list `freq` times.
4. Return the result list.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> decompressRLElist(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); i += 2) {
        int freq = nums[i];
        int val = nums[i + 1];
        for (int j = 0; j < freq; ++j) {
            result.push_back(val);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::vector<int> decompressedList = decompressRLElist(nums);

    for (int num : decompressedList) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(n * f)**, where `n` is the number of pairs (i.e., `nums.size() / 2`), and `f` is the average frequency of the values. The worst case occurs when the frequencies are large, causing many insertions into the result list.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(m)**, where `m` is the total number of elements in the decompressed list. This includes the space required for the result list.
