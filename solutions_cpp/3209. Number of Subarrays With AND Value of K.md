[Leetcode 3209. Number of Subarrays With AND Value of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3209)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays such that the bitwise AND of all the elements of the subarray is equal to `k`.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 1`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The subarrays are `[1]`, `[2, 1]`, `[3, 1]`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- `0 <= k <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the subarray required to be contiguous?**
   - Yes, subarrays are contiguous segments of the array.
2. **Can the result be larger than the array size?**
   - Yes, as the answer represents the count of such subarrays which could be more than the number of elements in `nums`.

## Strategy

Given the constraints, we need an efficient way to check subarray AND operations. The direct brute-force approach would not be efficient due to time complexity considerations. Instead, we should aim for an optimized approach:

### Detailed Approach:

1. **Iterate through each element in the array**: Use two nested loops but break early if the AND result cannot be `k`.
2. **Use bitwise AND to prune the search space**: If `AND` of a current subarray starting with element `i` doesn't align with `k` early in the subarray, there's no need to check it further.
3. **Optimization**: We can stop checking the subarray if at any moment the AND of that subarray becomes less than `k` because the AND value can only stay the same or decrease as the subarray expands.

## Time Complexity
- Worst-case scenario: `O(n^2)` but with early stopping condition which dramatically improves performance in most practical cases.

Now let's write the code.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysWithAndValueOfK(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int current_and = nums[i];
            if (current_and == k) {
                ++count;
            }
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                current_and &= nums[j];
                if (current_and == k) {
                    ++count;
                }
                if (current_and < k) { 
                    break;  // Optimization: stop early if AND is less than k.
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

```

This implementation ensures that we efficiently find all subarrays with an AND value of `k`. By early stopping subarray extension when the AND result is less than `k`, we avoid unnecessary computations.
