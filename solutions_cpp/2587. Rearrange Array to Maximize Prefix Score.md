[Leetcode 2587. Rearrange Array to Maximize Prefix Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2587)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You need to rearrange the elements of `nums` such that the sum of the values of the prefix scores is maximized.

The prefix score is calculated using the following formula:
\[ \text{Prefix Score}(k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \left( \sum_{j=0}^{i} \text{nums}[j] \right) \]
for \( k \) in range from 0 to the length of the array minus one.

Return the rearranged array such that the sum of values of the prefix scores is maximized.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of elements in `nums`**: What are the possible values for the elements in `nums`? Can it have negative numbers?
2. **Length of array**: What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
3. **Return type**: Should the function modify the array in place, or return a new array?

For the purpose of this problem, let's assume:
- Elements in `nums` can be both positive and negative.
- The length of the array `nums` is reasonably large but within typical problem constraints (e.g., <= 10^5).

### Strategy
1. **Observation**: The prefix score is maximized when larger numbers appear earlier in the array. This reduces negative contributions and makes positive contributions earlier.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the array in descending order to bring larger numbers to the front.
3. **Prefix Score Calculation**:
    - Calculate each prefix sum from the sorted array.
    - Compute the total prefix score using these prefix sums.
4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single element array.
    - All elements are positive.
    - All elements are negative.

### Code
Here's a C++ implementation of the described solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> rearrangeToMaximizePrefixScore(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Sort the array in descending order
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), std::greater<int>());
    return nums;
}

// Helper function to print vector for testing
void printVector(const std::vector<int>& v) {
    for (int x : v) std::cout << x << " ";
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Test the function
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 1, -2, 7, -3, 8, 4};
    std::vector<int> result = rearrangeToMaximizePrefixScore(nums);
    printVector(result); // Expected sorted array in descending order
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array.
- **Overall**: Since sorting is the dominant operation, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This implementation sorts the array in descending order to ensure that the larger numbers contribute to earlier prefix sums, thereby maximizing the prefix score.
