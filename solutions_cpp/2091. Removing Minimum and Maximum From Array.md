[Leetcode 2091. Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2091)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of distinct integers `nums`.

There is an element in `nums` that is the minimum value of the array and an element that is the maximum value of the array. These values may be the same if there's only one element in `nums`.

You need to remove both the minimum and maximum values. The cost of a removal is defined as the number of elements removed from the start or end of the array until you remove that element.

Return the minimum cost to remove both the minimum and maximum values.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected range of input size?**
   - The length of `nums` can range from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **What should be done if there's only one element in the array?**
   - If there's only one element, both the minimum and the maximum will be the same. The cost of removal will be 1.

3. **Are the elements in the array guaranteed to be distinct?**
   - Yes, as stated in the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Indices:**
   - Find the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

2. **Calculate the Costs:**
   - There are three possible strategies to remove both the minimum and maximum values:
     1. Remove both by always starting from the left (start to left-most index and start to right-most index).
     2. Remove both by always starting from the right (end to right-most index and end to left-most index).
     3. Remove one by starting from left and the other by starting from right.
   - Calculate the total cost for each scenario and return the minimum.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Iterate through the array to find the minimum and maximum values and their indices.
   - Compute the costs for the three strategies described.
   - Return the minimum cost calculated.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) return 1;

        int n = nums.size();
        int minIndex = 0, maxIndex = 0;

        // Step 1: Find the indices of the minimum and maximum elements.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIndex]) minIndex = i;
            if (nums[i] > nums[maxIndex]) maxIndex = i;
        }

        if (minIndex > maxIndex) swap(minIndex, maxIndex);

        // Step 2: Compute costs for three strategies.
        int cost1 = (maxIndex + 1); // Remove from start to maxIndex
        int cost2 = (n - minIndex); // Remove from end to minIndex
        int cost3 = (minIndex + 1) + (n - maxIndex); // Remove from start to min and end to max

        // Return the minimum cost
        return min({cost1, cost2, cost3});
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding Indices:** This involves a single scan through the array, which takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Computing Costs:** Each computation step is \(O(1)\).
- **Overall Complexity:** The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This solution ensures efficiency and handles arrays of varying lengths, including the special case where the array has only one element.
