[Leetcode 1140. Stone Game II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1140)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to determine the maximum number of stones a player can get.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Initially, M = 1. On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, it is the next player’s turn to play. The game continues until there are no more piles left. The goal of each player is to maximize the number of stones they can get. The next player’s value of M is the maximum of the current value of M and X.

Formally, the players choose `X` such that `1 <= X <= 2M`, take these piles of stones, then the next player’s "M" is `max(M, X)`.

Return the maximum number of stones Alice can get if she plays optimally.

### Example:

```
Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `piles` array length and the individual numbers in `piles`?**
   - The length of `piles` can be between `1` and `100`, and each element in `piles` is a positive integer up to `10^4`.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the length of `piles` will always be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, there will be at least one pile of stones.

3. **Should the solution be optimized for time complexity?**
   - Yes, given the length of the array can be up to `100`, we should aim for an efficient solution.

## Strategy

1. Use dynamic programming to solve this game theory problem.
2. Use memoization to store the intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
3. Define a function `dp[i][m]` that represents the maximum stones a player can get starting from pile `i` with the current value of `M` being `m`.
4. Compute the result recursively considering the choice of taking `X` piles where `1 <= X <= 2m`.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation for the given problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        int n = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, -1)); // Memoization table
        vector<int> suffixSum(n + 1, 0); // Suffix sums
        
        // Calculate suffix sums
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            suffixSum[i] = suffixSum[i + 1] + piles[i];
        }
        
        // Recursively compute the maximum stones starting from index i with M
        return dfs(0, 1, piles, suffixSum, dp);
    }

private:
    int dfs(int i, int m, vector<int>& piles, vector<int>& suffixSum, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (i >= piles.size()) return 0;
        if (dp[i][m] != -1) return dp[i][m];
        
        int maxStones = 0;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 2 * m && i + x <= piles.size(); ++x) {
            maxStones = max(maxStones, suffixSum[i] - dfs(i + x, max(m, x), piles, suffixSum, dp));
        }
        
        dp[i][m] = maxStones;
        return dp[i][m];
    }
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - We compute the suffix sums of the piles to efficiently fetch the total number of stones from any starting index to the end.

2. **Recursion and Memoization**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to recursively compute the maximum stones a player can collect starting from index `i` with a current value of `M`.
   - Memoization table `dp` is used to store intermediate results to avoid re-computation.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each possible choice of `X` piles (where `1 <= X <= 2M`), update the maximum number of stones a player can collect considering the opponent's optimal moves.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution:

- The recursive approach runs in `O(n^3)` time due to two levels of recursion with size `n` and another loop running up to `2M`.
  
- Given the problem constraints, this complexity is manageable and should run efficiently within the input size limits.
