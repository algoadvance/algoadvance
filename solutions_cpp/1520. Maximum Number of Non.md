[Leetcode 1520. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1520)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and a string array `dict`. You are tasked with finding the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings of `s` that exist in the array `dict`. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. You need to return the count of the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings that can be selected from `s`, each of which exists in `dict`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - What is the length of the string `s`?
    - What is the size of the array `dict`?
    - Are there any constraints on the characters within `s` or `dict`?
  
   **Response**: 
    - The length of string `s` can be up to 10^4.
    - The size of the array `dict` can be up to 10^4.
    - Both `s` and all elements in `dict` consist only of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output Format**:
    - Do we need to return the actual substrings or just the count?
    
   **Response**:
    - Return the count of the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings that can be selected.

3. **Overlap Definition**:
    - Can two substrings partially overlap by sharing some characters?
    
   **Response**:
    - The substrings must be completely non-overlapping.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize the Data Structures**:
   - We'll use a vector to track the positions of allowed substrings in `s`.
  
2. **Check for Substrings**:
   - For each substring in `dict`, check if it exists in `s` and record its starting and ending indices.
  
3. **Sort and Merge Intervals**:
   - Create intervals for each substring found in the previous step.
   - Sort these intervals based on their starting indices.
   - Merge the intervals to ensure non-overlapping and count the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings.

### Code
Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxNonOverlappingSubstrings(string s, vector<string>& dict) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> substrIntervals;
    
    for (const string& word : dict) {
        size_t pos = s.find(word);
        while (pos != string::npos) {
            substrIntervals.push_back({pos, pos + word.size() - 1});
            pos = s.find(word, pos + 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Sort intervals by the end point for greedy selection
    sort(substrIntervals.begin(), substrIntervals.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.second < b.second;
    });
    
    int count = 0;
    int last_end = -1;
    for (const auto& interval : substrIntervals) {
        if (interval.first > last_end) {
            ++count;
            last_end = interval.second;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    string s = "ababc";
    vector<string> dict = {"ab", "b", "ba"};
    int result = maxNonOverlappingSubstrings(s, dict);
    printf("Maximum number of non-overlapping substrings: %d\n", result);  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Finding each substring from `dict` in `s` takes O(n * m) where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the number of elements in `dict`.
  - Sorting the intervals takes O(k log k) where `k` is the number of found substrings.
  - Merging and counting intervals take O(k).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n * m + k log k).

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - O(k) to store the intervals, where `k` is the number of substrings found.
