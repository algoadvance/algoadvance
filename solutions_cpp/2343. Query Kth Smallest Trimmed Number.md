[Leetcode 2343. Query Kth Smallest Trimmed Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2343)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of strings `nums`, each of equal length, and an array of queries, where each query specifies two integers `k` and `trim`. You need to return an array with the result for each query which is the `k`-th smallest trimmed number derived from trimming `trim` number of digits from the right of the strings in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `k` in the queries?
   - Can `nums` contain duplicate numbers?
   - What is the maximum length of the strings in `nums`?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Do we return the `trim`-th smallest number as a string or its original index?

Based on the standard problem, here are the assumed constraints and requirements:
  - `nums`: List of strings of the same length.
  - `queries`: An array of arrays, where each sub-array contains two integers `[k, trim]`.
  - Return the `k`-th smallest trimmed number's original index for each query.
  
## Strategy

1. **Trim Numbers**: For each query, trim the last `trim` characters from each number in `nums`.
2. **Sort Trimmed Numbers**: Store the trimmed numbers along with their original indices. Sort these pairs based on the trimmed number.
3. **Find k-th Smallest**: Extract the `k`-th smallest trimmed number's original index.
4. **Return Result**: Collect and return the results for each query.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<int> smallestTrimmedNumbers(vector<string>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    
    for (const auto &query : queries) {
        int k = query[0];  // the "k" in the k-th smallest number
        int trim = query[1];  // number of digits to trim from the right
        
        vector<pair<string, int>> trimmed_nums;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            string trimmed = nums[i].substr(nums[i].size() - trim);
            trimmed_nums.push_back({trimmed, i});
        }
        
        sort(trimmed_nums.begin(), trimmed_nums.end());
        
        result.push_back(trimmed_nums[k - 1].second);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> nums = {"102", "473", "251", "814"};
    vector<vector<int>> queries = {{1, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 2}, {1, 2}};
    vector<int> result = smallestTrimmedNumbers(nums, queries);
    
    for(int i : result) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    // Output: 2 2 1 0
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis for this solution is as follows:
- Let `n` be the number of strings in `nums` and `m` be the length of each string.
- For each query:
  - Trimming takes O(n * trim) time.
  - Sorting the `n` trimmed numbers takes O(n log n) time.
- Since we handle each query independently, and let `q` be the number of queries, our final time complexity would be O(q * (n * trim + n log n)), which simplifies to O(q * n * (trim + log n)).
