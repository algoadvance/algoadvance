[Leetcode 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l448)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of size `n` where `nums` contains numbers in the range `[1, n]`. Some elements appear twice, and some elements appear once. Find all the elements from `1` to `n` that do not appear in `nums` and return them in any order.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What is the maximum value for `n`?
   - Can `nums` array have all unique elements?
   - Can `nums` array be empty?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Do we need to return numbers in sorted order?
   - Is it acceptable to return the result in a different order than the example provided?

3. **Space Complexity Constraints:**
   - Are there any limitations on the amount of extra space we can use?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use an in-place algorithm to effectively mark the numbers in the array `nums` to identify which numbers are missing. This approach will ensure O(1) auxiliary space, not including the output array.

### Steps:

1. **Mark Element's Index:**
   - Iterate through each element in the array `nums`.
   - For each element `num`, mark the number at index `abs(num) - 1` as negative to indicate that `abs(num)` is present in the array.

2. **Identify Missing Numbers:**
   - After marking, any index `i` that contains a positive value indicates that the number `i + 1` is missing from the array.

3. **Collect Results:**
   - Collect all such indices and return them as the result.

### Code

Here's the C++ code to implement this approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> result;

    // Mark each number's presence by negating the value at the corresponding index.
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int num = std::abs(nums[i]);
        nums[num - 1] = -std::abs(nums[num - 1]);
    }

    // Collect indices with positive values, which indicates missing numbers.
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) {
            result.push_back(i + 1);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate over the array twice: once for marking entries and once for collecting results.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) auxiliary space (not including the space for the output array). We modify the input array in place without using any additional significant space.

This approach efficiently identifies all the missing numbers within the given constraints.
