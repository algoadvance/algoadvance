[Leetcode 2829. Determine the Minimum Sum of a k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2829)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n` and an integer `k`, your task is to construct an array of length `n` (consisting of distinct positive integers) where none of the elements are equal to `k` or make any contiguous subarray sum to `k`. You need to ensure the sum of the entire array is minimized.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `n` and `k` guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   Yes, both `n` and `k` are positive integers greater than zero.

2. **Should the array only consist of positive integers?**
   Yes, the array should only involve positive integers.

3. **What is the expected output if it's impossible to avoid `k` in all subarrays?**
   This scenario should not occur based on the problem constraints.

4. **Can numbers in the array repeat?**
   No, all elements in the array must be distinct.

5. **What is the maximum reasonable value for `n` and `k` for typical test cases?**
   The problem statement does not specify, but we will assume they are within a practical range for calculations involving integers.

## Strategy
To minimize the sum of the array while ensuring no subarray sums to `k`, we should:
1. **Avoid the value `k` entirely:**
   Simply exclude `k` from being one of the numbers.
   
2. **Avoiding sums to `k`:**
   We can achieve this by choosing the smallest positive integers that sum up to a number more than `k` for the first `n` elements, skipping over `k` and ensuring the subset requirement where no subarray sums to `k`.

### Implementation Steps
1. Start by including the smallest integers starting from 1.
2. Skip the integer `k`.
3. Continue adding the next smallest integers until we reach the required array length `n`.

### Example
For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, you would construct the array as follows:
- Choose `1, 2` and `4` (skip 3).

For `n = 5` and `k = 7`:
- Choose `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8` (skip 7).

**Edge Cases:**
- Small values of `n` and `k`.
- Large consecutive integers being considered.

## Code

Here is the implementation of this strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> minimumSumKAvoidingArray(int n, int k) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    int current_number = 1;

    while (result.size() < n) {
        if (current_number != k) {
            result.push_back(current_number);
        }
        current_number++;
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3, k = 3;
    std::vector<int> result = minimumSumKAvoidingArray(n, k);
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    // Output should be: 1 2 4
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)** because:
- We iterate through numbers starting from 1, and we skip only one number (`k`), making the time proportional to `n`.

This also includes the space complexity, where we use an additional array of size `n`.

This solution effectively minimizes the sum and ensures no subarray sums to `k`.
