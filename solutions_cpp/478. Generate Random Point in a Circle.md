[Leetcode 478. Generate Random Point in a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l478)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to implement the `Solution` class that initializes with the radius and the x-y position of the center of a circle. The class should have a method `randPoint` that generates a random point within that circle. 

### Your `Solution` class should look like this:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center);
    vector<double> randPoint();
};
```

### Example:
```cpp
Solution solution = new Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
solution.randPoint(); // returns a random point in the circle [0.0,0.0] with radius 1.0
```

### Constraints:
- 0 < radius <= 10^8
- -10^7 <= x_center, y_center <= 10^7
- At most 3 * 10^4 calls will be made to `randPoint`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. How should the random points be distributed?
   - The points should be uniformly distributed within the circle.
   
2. Is using the standard C++ random library acceptable?
   - Yes, you can use the standard C++ random library for generating random numbers.

## Strategy
To generate a random point uniformly in a circle:
1. **Polar Coordinates:**
   - Generate a random angle `θ` between 0 and 2π.
   - Generate a random radius `r` using the inverse transform sampling method where `r` is adjusted by the square root of a uniform random variable to maintain uniform distribution.

2. **Convert to Cartesian Coordinates:**
   - Use the formulas:
     - \( x = r \cos(θ) + x_{center} \)
     - \( y = r \sin(θ) + y_{center} \)

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** O(1)
- **`randPoint()`:** O(1)

The time complexity for generating a point is constant because it involves basic arithmetic operations and random number generation which are O(1) operations.

## Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
private:
    double radius, x_center, y_center;

public:
    Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) 
        : radius(radius), x_center(x_center), y_center(y_center) {
        // Initialize random seed
        std::srand(std::time(nullptr));
    }

    std::vector<double> randPoint() {
        double theta = ((double) std::rand() / RAND_MAX) * 2 * M_PI;
        double raw_r = (double) std::rand() / RAND_MAX;
        double r = std::sqrt(raw_r) * radius;
        double x = r * std::cos(theta) + x_center;
        double y = r * std::sin(theta) + y_center;
        return {x, y};
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Constructor (`Solution`):** Initializes the circle's radius and center.
- **`randPoint` Method:**
  - Generates a random angle `θ` between 0 and 2π.
  - Generates a random scaled radius using the square root of a uniform random variable to ensure uniform distribution within the circle.
  - Converts the polar coordinates `(r, θ)` to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`.
  - Adjusts the coordinates by adding the circle's center coordinates.
  - Returns the computed point as a vector.
