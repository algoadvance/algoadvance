[Leetcode 2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2064)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of stores and an array `quantities` of size `m` where `quantities[i]` is the number of products of the `i-th` type. You need to distribute these products to the stores such that each store receives products of various types. However, the goal is to minimize the maximum number of products assigned to any store.

Return the minimized maximum number of products that can be assigned to any store.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can a store receive products from only one type of product or multiple types?
2. Can all stores receive zero quantities of a particular product?
3. Is there any specific order required for distributing products to stores?

Let's assume the following based on the typical problem framing:
1. A store can receive products from multiple types.
2. Stores should ideally receive products in such a way that we minimize the maximum number of products any single store gets.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a binary search approach to minimize the maximum products distributed to any store. The idea is to find the minimum feasible "maximum" quantity of products that can be assigned to any store, using the following steps:
1. Initialize the binary search boundaries. The lower bound (`low`) is `1` (because each store must receive at least one product if there are any products), and the upper bound (`high`) is the maximum value in the `quantities` array (since, in the worst case, one store could hold all products of one type).
2. While performing binary search, calculate the mid-point and check if it is a feasible maximum value by trying to distribute the products such that no store exceeds the mid-point.
3. Adjust the search range based on feasibility until you zero in on the minimized maximum value.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimizedMaximum(int n, std::vector<int>& quantities) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = *std::max_element(quantities.begin(), quantities.end());

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (low - high) / 2;
            if (canDistribute(quantities, n, mid)) {
                high = mid; // Try to minimize the maximum further
            } else {
                low = mid + 1; // Not enough, need to increase the allowed maximum
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    bool canDistribute(const std::vector<int>& quantities, int n, int maxQuantity) {
        int requiredStores = 0;
        for (const int& quantity : quantities) {
            requiredStores += (quantity + maxQuantity - 1) / maxQuantity;
            if (requiredStores > n) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - `low` is set to 1.
   - `high` is set to the maximum element in the `quantities` array.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Calculate `mid`.
   - Use the helper function `canDistribute` to check if distributing products such that no store gets more than `mid` products is possible.
   - Adjust `low` and `high` based on the feasibility check.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - `canDistribute` checks if we can distribute the products such that the number of stores required does not exceed `n` while ensuring no store gets more than `maxQuantity` products.

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: `O(log(max(quantities))`
- **Distribution Check**: `O(m)` where `m` is the size of the `quantities` array.

The overall time complexity is `O(m * log(max(quantities)))`, which is efficient for typical problem constraints on LeetCode.

This approach ensures we distribute the products in a way that minimizes the maximum load on any store effectively.
