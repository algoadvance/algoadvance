[Leetcode 916. Word Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l916)
## Problem Statement

You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.

A string `b` is a subset of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a` including multiplicity.

- For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".

A string `a` from `words1` is a universal string if for every string `b` in `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.

Return an array of all the universal strings in `words1`. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```

### Constraints:
1. `1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 10^4`
2. `1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10`
3. `words1[i]` and `words2[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
4. All the strings of `words1` are unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the words in `words1` and `words2` contain non-alphabetic characters?
   **A:** No, the problem states that all words consist only of lowercase English letters.

2. **Q:** Do we need to consider multiplicity of characters within the words for the subset condition?
   **A:** Yes, multiplicity must be accounted for. For example, "lll" is a subset of "hellooollow" but not "hello".

3. **Q:** Is the output order specific?
   **A:** No, the output can be in any order.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count for `words2`:**
   - Create a frequency map to store the maximum frequency required for each character in all strings of `words2`.

2. **Filtering `words1`:**
   - For each word in `words1`, verify if it meets the frequency requirements by comparing it against the frequency map created from `words2`.
   - If a word in `words1` meets the frequency requirements, add it to the result list.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<int> getFrequency(const string& word) {
    vector<int> freq(26, 0);
    for(char c : word) {
        freq[c - 'a']++;
    }
    return freq;
}

vector<string> wordSubsets(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
    vector<int> maxFreq(26, 0);
    
    // Calculate the max frequency required for each character in words2
    for (const string& word : words2) {
        vector<int> freq = getFrequency(word);
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            maxFreq[i] = max(maxFreq[i], freq[i]);
        }
    }
    
    vector<string> result;
    // Check each word in words1
    for (const string& word : words1) {
        vector<int> freq = getFrequency(word);
        bool isUniversal = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (freq[i] < maxFreq[i]) {
                isUniversal = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isUniversal) {
            result.push_back(word);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Preprocessing `words2`:**
   - Constructing the frequency map for `words2` involves examining each character of each word in `words2` once.
   - Thus, the time complexity is \(O(N1)\) where \(N1\) is the total number of characters across all words in `words2`.

2. **Filtering `words1`:**
   - For each word in `words1`, the algorithm computes its frequency and then compares it against the frequency map.
   - Thus, the time complexity for examining each word in `words1` is \(O(N2)\) where \(N2\) is the total number of characters across all words in `words1`.

Combining both steps, the overall time complexity is \(O(N1 + N2)\) where \(N1\) is the total number of characters in `words2` and \(N2\) is the total number of characters in `words1`. This ensures that the solution scales efficiently with the input sizes.
