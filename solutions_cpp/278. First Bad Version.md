[Leetcode 278. First Bad Version](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l278)
## Problem Statement
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version.

You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### Example
```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

### Function Signature
```cpp
int firstBadVersion(int n);
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`.

2. **Is there any guarantee that there is at least one bad version?**
   - Yes, you can assume there is at least one bad version.

3. **Can we use a binary search approach?**
   - Yes, binary search is a common approach to minimize the number of API calls.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize the binary search:**
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to `1` and `n` respectively.
   
2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - While `left` is less than `right`:
     - Compute the middle point `mid`.
     - If `isBadVersion(mid)` returns `true`, then the bad version is at `mid` or before. Move the right pointer to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
     
3. **Termination:**
   - When the loop ends, `left` will point to the first bad version.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log n) due to the binary search mechanism.

## Code
```cpp
// Forward declaration of isBadVersion API.
bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // To avoid potential overflow
            
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid; // Potential first bad version
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // First bad version must be after `mid`
            }
        }
        
        return left; // At the end of the loop, `left` should point to the first bad version.
    }
};
```
