[Leetcode 1840. Maximum Building Height](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1840)
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement:

Given the number of buildings `n` and a 2D array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [i, maxHeight_i]`, you want to determine the maximum height of any building. You are allowed to increase or decrease the height of any building by 1 unit for each unit of distance to the next building, ensuring that the final height does not exceed the building's restriction.

**Input:**
- `n`: An integer representing the number of buildings.
- `restrictions`: A 2D array where each element is of the form `[i, maxHeight_i]`.

**Output:**
- The maximum height any building can reach under the given conditions.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q: What are the constraints on the values of `n` and the elements in `restrictions`?**
   - A: `n` is between 2 and 10^9. The lengths of `restrictions` array are at most 10^5, and the buildings are 1-indexed.

2. **Q: Are the buildings in `restrictions` sorted?**
   - A: No, there is no guarantee that `restrictions` are sorted.

3. **Q: What is meant by "distance" in the problem?**
   - A: The distance refers to the difference in indices between two buildings.

### Strategy:

The strategy for solving this problem involves the following steps:

1. **Sort the Restrictions:** First, we need to sort the restrictions based on the building indices.
2. **Boundary Restrictions:** Add boundary restrictions `[1, 0]` and `[n, n-1]` to help manage edge cases.
3. **Forward Pass:** Traverse through the restrictions from left to right, ensuring that no building violates the height restrictions by adjusting the maximum possible height at each point forward.
4. **Backward Pass:** Traverse through the restrictions from right to left, ensuring the same constraints as in the forward pass, but now backward.
5. **Find Maximum Height:** Finally, calculate the maximum possible height for each section between two restricted buildings, and determine the overall maximum height achievable.

### Code:

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxBuilding(int n, vector<vector<int>>& restrictions) {
    // Step 1: Sort the restrictions by building index
    sort(restrictions.begin(), restrictions.end());

    // Adding boundaries restrictions
    restrictions.insert(restrictions.begin(), {1, 0});
    restrictions.push_back({n, n - 1});

    // Step 2: Forward pass to enforce height limit from left to right
    for (int i = 1; i < restrictions.size(); ++i) {
        restrictions[i][1] = min(restrictions[i][1], restrictions[i-1][1] + (restrictions[i][0] - restrictions[i-1][0]));
    }

    // Step 3: Backward pass to enforce height limit from right to left
    for (int i = restrictions.size() - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        restrictions[i][1] = min(restrictions[i][1], restrictions[i+1][1] + (restrictions[i+1][0] - restrictions[i][0]));
    }

    // Step 4: Calculate maximum possible height
    int max_height = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < restrictions.size(); ++i) {
        int start = restrictions[i-1][0];
        int end = restrictions[i][0];
        int h_start = restrictions[i-1][1];
        int h_end = restrictions[i][1];
        
        int max_possible_height = (h_start + h_end + end - start) / 2;
        max_height = max(max_height, max_possible_height);
    }

    return max_height;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    vector<vector<int>> restrictions = \{\{2, 1}, {4, 1}};
    cout << "Maximum Building Height: " << maxBuilding(n, restrictions) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting:** O(k log k) where k is the number of restrictions.
- **Two Passes:** Each pass is O(k), leading to a total of O(2k), which simplifies to O(k).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(k log k) due to the sorting step.
