[Leetcode 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2149)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified array follows these conditions:
1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have different signs.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in `nums` is preserved.

The rearranged array should be returned.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3, 1, 2]. The negative integers are [-2, -5, -4].
The only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer.
Hence, the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is [1,-1].
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `nums.length` is even.
- `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 10^5`
- `nums` consists of equal number of positive and negative integers.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the range of values for the elements in `nums`? 
   - Yes, the values range between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).
2. Are the positive and negative integers randomly placed in the array or do they follow a certain pattern?
   - They are randomly placed but will be present in equal numbers.
3. Should the rearranged array keep the original order of elements within their sign groups?
   - Yes, the relative order must be preserved.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create two vectors, one for storing positive integers (`positives`) and another for negative integers (`negatives`).
2. **Separation**: Traverse the `nums` array and separate the integers into the `positives` and `negatives` vectors.
3. **Merging**: Create the result array by picking elements alternatively from `positives` and `negatives`.
4. **Return Result**: The merged result should satisfy the alternating sign condition while maintaining the relative order of positive and negative integers as they appear in `nums`.

## Time Complexity

- O(n) for separating the integers into two vectors.
- O(n) for merging the integers from the two vectors into the result array.

Overall, the time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

## Code

Here's the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Separate positive and negative numbers
    vector<int> positives;
    vector<int> negatives;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 0) {
            positives.push_back(num);
        } else {
            negatives.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Merge them into the result array
    vector<int> result(nums.size());
    int idx = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < positives.size(); ++i) {
        result[idx++] = positives[i];
        result[idx++] = negatives[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This code successfully rearranges the elements in `nums` such that every consecutive pair has different signs, while preserving the initial order of positive and negative numbers within their respective groups.
