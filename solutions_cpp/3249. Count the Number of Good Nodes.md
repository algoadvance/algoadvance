[Leetcode 3249. Count the Number of Good Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3249)
# Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, we want to count the number of "good" nodes in it.

A node X in the binary tree is considered "good" if in the path from the root to X there are no nodes with a greater value than X's value.

You should implement your solution in C++.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the tree?**
   - The tree is a binary tree where each node contains an integer value.

2. **What is the range of values for the nodes?**
   - The node values can be any integer within the range of typical integer values in C++.

3. **What should be the output?**
   - The output should be the count of good nodes.

4. **Are there any constraints on the input size?**
   - Yes, the total number of nodes in the tree will not exceed 10^4.

# Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a Depth First Search (DFS) approach. Starting from the root, we will traverse the tree, keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far on the path from the root to the current node. If the current node's value is greater than or equal to the maximum value so far, the node is considered "good."

During the traversal:
1. Initialize a count for good nodes.
2. Traverse the tree using DFS.
3. For each node, if its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen in the path so far, increment the good node count.
4. Update the maximum value in the path if the current node's value is greater.
5. Recursively apply the same logic to left and right children.

This approach ensures that each node is visited exactly once, making it efficient.

# Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

// Define the structure for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int goodNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        return countGoodNodes(root, root->val);
    }
    
private:
    int countGoodNodes(TreeNode* node, int maxSoFar) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int goodNodesCount = 0;
        if (node->val >= maxSoFar) {
            goodNodesCount = 1;
        }
        
        maxSoFar = std::max(maxSoFar, node->val);
        goodNodesCount += countGoodNodes(node->left, maxSoFar);
        goodNodesCount += countGoodNodes(node->right, maxSoFar);
        
        return goodNodesCount;
    }
};
```

# Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This is due to the recursion stack used during the DFS traversal. In the worst case, this can be O(N) for a completely unbalanced tree or O(log N) for a balanced tree.
