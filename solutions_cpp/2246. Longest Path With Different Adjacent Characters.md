[Leetcode 2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2246)
## Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., an undirected, connected, acyclic graph) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a string `s` of length `n`. The string `s` is made up of lowercase English letters. You are looking to find and return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the input?**
   - The input will consist of an integer `n`, an array of edges representing the tree, and a string `s`.

2. **Can nodes be isolated or should we consider all nodes connected?**
   - Since the structure is a tree and it is connected, all nodes are connected, and there are no isolated nodes.

3. **Is each node guaranteed to have a unique character?**
   - No, nodes can have the same characters, which is part of the challenge. The path must respect the adjacencies of nodes with different characters.

4. **Can the tree be unbalanced, or does it have any particular structure?**
   - The tree can be unbalanced; there are no specific constraints on its structure other than being connected and acyclic.

## Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Use adjacency lists to represent the tree.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to explore each path in the tree.
   - Maintain the path length and ensure adjacent nodes have different characters.

3. **Dynamic Programming on Trees**:
   - Utilize DFS to compute the longest path ending at each node and then aggregate these results to find the desired path.
   - This will keep track of two longest paths for every node for optimal results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single-node tree.
   - All nodes having the same character.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestPath(vector<int>& parent, string s) {
        int n = parent.size();
        vector<vector<int>> tree(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            tree[parent[i]].push_back(i);
            tree[i].push_back(parent[i]);
        }
        int result = 1;
        dfs(0, -1, tree, s, result);
        return result;
    }

private:
    int dfs(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<int>>& tree, const string& s, int& result) {
        int maxDepth1 = 0, maxDepth2 = 0;
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            if (child == parent) continue;
            int childDepth = dfs(child, node, tree, s, result);
            if (s[child] != s[node]) {
                if (childDepth > maxDepth1) {
                    maxDepth2 = maxDepth1;
                    maxDepth1 = childDepth;
                } else if (childDepth > maxDepth2) {
                    maxDepth2 = childDepth;
                }
            }
        }
        result = max(result, maxDepth1 + maxDepth2 + 1);
        return maxDepth1 + 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> parent = {-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2};
    string s = "abacbe";
    cout << "Longest Path Length: " << solution.longestPath(parent, s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes, because we are performing a single DFS traversal over the entire tree.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the space required to store the adjacency list and the recursive stack space used by DFS.

Make sure to test this code with various test cases to ensure it handles edge cases effectively.
