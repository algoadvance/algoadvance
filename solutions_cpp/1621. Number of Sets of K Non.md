[Leetcode 1621. Number of Sets of K Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1621)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. We have `n` points numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, sorted in ascending order. You need to find the number of ways to select exactly `k` non-overlapping line segments from these points such that each segment contains at least 2 points and the segments do not overlap.

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= n - 1`

Your task is to return the number of ways to select `k` non-overlapping line segments modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input/Output:**
   - Input: Two integers `n` and `k`.
   - Output: An integer representing the number of ways to select exactly `k` non-overlapping line segments.

2. **Definitions:**
   - A line segment is defined by two endpoints, and it should contain at least 2 points. For example, the segment from point `0` to point `2` covers the points `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - Non-overlapping means that no two segments share any points.

### Strategy

Dynamic Programming is a suitable approach for this problem. We define a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to select `j` non-overlapping segments from the first `i` points.

#### Steps to Approach:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 1`: There's one way to select `0` segments from `0` points.
   - For every other `dp[i][0]` for \( i > 0 \), they should all be `1` since there's one way to pick `0` segments, by not picking any.

2. **DP Relation:**
   - To determine `dp[i][j]`, consider whether to include the `i-th` point in the `j-th` segment:
     - If we donâ€™t include the `i-th` point in the `j-th` segment, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.
     - If we include the `i-th` point in the `j-th` segment, to make it a valid segment we need an earlier segment ending at `m` where \(m \le i - 2\). Thus, we sum up all possible `dp[m][j - 1]` for \( m \le i - 2 \).

#### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm will have a time complexity of \(O(n^2 \times k)\) because we are iterating over each point and each segment, and summing over potential previous segments.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#define MOD 1000000007

int numberOfSets(int n, int k) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            for (int m = 0; m <= i - 2; ++m) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[m][j - 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k];
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::cout << numberOfSets(n, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Set `dp[i][0]` to `1` for all `i`, as picking `0` segments from any points has exactly one way.
- **DP Transitions**: 
  - Include the \(i-th\) point in \(j-th\) segment: `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + sum(dp[m][j - 1]) for m \le i - 2`.
  - To maintain modularity, we use `MOD` to prevent overflow and keep results within constraints.
  
This approach leverages dynamic programming to build up the result step by step efficiently within the given constraints.
