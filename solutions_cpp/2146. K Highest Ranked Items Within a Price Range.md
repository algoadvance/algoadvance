[Leetcode 2146. K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2146)
## Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` grid and an integer array `pricing` of size `2` where `pricing[0]` represents the minimum price and `pricing[1]` represents the maximum price. Each cell in the grid represents a product's price. You also have the coordinates of a cell `start` (represented as an array of size `2`), which is the starting point of your search.

Furthermore, the grid also contains walls, which are represented by `0`. In each step, you can move to any of the 4 adjacent cells in the grid, including cells with products whose prices fall within the specified price range.

You need to return the k highest-ranked items within the price range `[pricing[0], pricing[1]]` inclusively, starting from the start cell and in ascending order of distance, prices, and indices. If there are fewer than `k` items found, return all those items.

## Example
**Input**
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> grid = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {0, 2, 4},
    {7, 6, 5}
};
vector<int> pricing = {2, 5};
vector<int> start = {0, 0};
int k = 3;
```

**Output**
```cpp
{{0, 1}, {1, 1}, {2, 2}}
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What kind of grid can we expect? Any specific constraints on the grid size?
   - The grid can be of size `m x n` where `1 <= m, n <= 100`.

2. Are all values positive integers?
   - Yes, all values in the grid will be positive integers except for walls, which are represented by `0`.

3. Can we assume the start cell will always be within bounds?
   - Yes, you can assume the starting cell is always within bounds.

## Strategy
We can use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to traverse the grid starting from the given start cell. We will keep track of the visited cells to avoid processing them multiple times. During the traversal, all eligible items within the price range will be collected.

After completing the BFS traversal, we need to sort the collected items based on:
1. Distance from the start cell (in ascending order)
2. Price of the item (in ascending order)
3. Row index (in ascending order)
4. Column index (in ascending order)

We will then return the top `k` items from the sorted list.

## Code
Here's the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> highestRankedKItems(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<int>& pricing, vector<int>& start, int k) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>> items;
    queue<pair<int, pair<int, int>>> q; // {distance, {row, col}}
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
    
    q.push({0, {start[0], start[1]}});
    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = true;
    
    vector<int> dirs = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0}; // four directions
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [dist, cell] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        int r = cell.first;
        int c = cell.second;
        
        if (grid[r][c] >= pricing[0] && grid[r][c] <= pricing[1]) {
            items.push_back({dist, {r, c}});
        }
        
        // BFS traversal to adjacent cells
        for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++ d) {
            int nr = r + dirs[d];
            int nc = c + dirs[d + 1];
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] != 0 && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                q.push({dist + 1, {nr, nc}});
                visited[nr][nc] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    sort(items.begin(), items.end(), [&](pair<int, pair<int, int>>& a, pair<int, pair<int, int>>& b) {
        if (a.first != b.first) return a.first < b.first; // Sort by distance
        if (grid[a.second.first][a.second.second] != grid[b.second.first][b.second.second])
            return grid[a.second.first][a.second.second] < grid[b.second.first][b.second.second]; // Sort by price
        if (a.second.first != b.second.first)
            return a.second.first < b.second.first; // Sort by row index
        return a.second.second < b.second.second; // Sort by column index
    });
    
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < min(k, (int)items.size()); ++i) {
        result.push_back({items[i].second.first, items[i].second.second});
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- BFS traversal of the grid ensures each cell is visited at most once: \(O(m \times n)\) where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid.
- Sorting the items found: \(O(N \log N)\), where `N` is the number of cells within the specified price range.
- Extracting the top `k` items: \(O(k)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(m \times n + N \log N)\).
