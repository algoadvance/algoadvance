[Leetcode 3130. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3130)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to find out how many different binary arrays of length `n` have exactly `k` transitions. A transition is when consecutive elements are different. 

For example:
```plaintext
- For n = 3 and k = 1, the valid arrays include [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], and [0, 0, 1].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Definitions**:
   - **n**: Length of the binary array.
   - **k**: Exact number of transitions required.

2. **Examples**:
   - How many valid binary arrays exist for `n = 3` and `k = 1`?
   - Clarify edge cases: What if `k > n - 1`, or `k < 0`?

3. **Expected Output**:
   - An integer representing the count of valid arrays meeting the criteria.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Values for `n` and `k` can be considerable, but typically limited by practical constraints like `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`.

## Strategy

We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid arrays of length `i` with exactly `j` transitions.

### Initialization:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` (An empty array has no transitions by definition).

### Recurrence Relation:
- If the current element is the same as the previous (`0 or 1`):
  - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]`
- If the current element is different from the previous (`0 to 1` or `1 to 0`):
  - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]`, if `j > 0`.

Loop through the length of the array from `1` to `n` and keep updating our DP table based on the above relations.

### Final Solution:
- The answer will be in `dp[n][k]`.

### Time Complexity:
- `O(n * k)` due to the nested loops over `n` and `k`.

## Code

Here's the implementation of our strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int findStableBinaryArrays(int n, int k) {
    if (k >= n) return 0;
    
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j];
            if (j > 0) dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    cout << findStableBinaryArrays(n, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
