[Leetcode 1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1354)
### Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem 1354: Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums**

You are given an array `target` of n integers. From a starting array `arr` consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure:

1. Let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
2. Choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < n` and set the `value` of `arr` at index `i` to `x`. 

You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return `true` if it is possible to construct the `target` array from `arr`, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, let's clarify the problem with a few questions:

1. **Are there any constraints on the array size or the values within the array?**
   - The target array will have at least 1 element and can have a maximum of 10^5 elements. Individual elements of the target array can be as large as 10^9.

2. **Are there any specific requirements for the solution?**
   - The solution should be optimal in terms of time complexity to handle the upper constraints efficiently.

3. **Can the target array contain negative values?**
   - No, according to the problem statement, the array consists of integers, and it does not specifically mention negative values, indicating all components are positive.

### Strategy

The crucial insight here is to work backwards from the `target` array to the initial array of 1's. Instead of trying to perform the given operations from `arr` to `target`, we will emulate the reverse of the process:

1. Start from the given `target` array.
2. Identify the largest element (`max`) in the `target` array because it would have been created by summing all elements in the previous step and assigning this sum to a particular index.
3. Subtract the sum of the rest of the elements from `max`. This gives us the value of that element just before the last step.
4. If the remaining value is less than 1, it's not possible to reconstruct the array; otherwise, replace `max` with this remaining value.
5. Repeat the process until all elements are reduced to 1.

A max-heap (priority queue) can be used to efficiently get the largest element and update the heap structure after each modification.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <numeric> // for accumulate
using namespace std;

bool isPossible(vector<int>& target) {
    if (target.size() == 1) return target[0] == 1;
    
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap(target.begin(), target.end());
    long long totalSum = accumulate(target.begin(), target.end(), 0LL);
    
    while (true) {
        int largest = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        totalSum -= largest;
        
        // Edge cases
        if (largest == 1 || totalSum == 1) return true;
        if (largest < totalSum || totalSum == 0 || largest % totalSum == 0) return false;
        
        int newValue = largest % totalSum;
        totalSum += newValue;
        maxHeap.push(newValue);
    }
    
    return false; // should never reach here
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Creation of the max heap takes O(n log n).
- Each operation within the while loop involves a log n operation for the heap and a constant time operation for the arithmetic, leading to an amortized complexity of roughly O(log(maxElement) * log n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + log(maxElement) * log n), which should be efficient enough for the provided constraints.
