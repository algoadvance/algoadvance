[Leetcode 477. Total Hamming Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l477)
## Problem Statement
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of Hamming distances between all the pairs of the integers in the array.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [4, 14, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 3 pairs (4, 14), (4, 2), and (14, 2) with respective Hamming distances 2, 2, and 2; thus the sum is 6.
```

### Constraints:
- The number of elements in `nums` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- Each integer in `nums` will be in the range `[0, 10^9]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain duplicate numbers? 
   - Since there are no restrictions against duplicates in the constraints, yes, `nums` can contain duplicate numbers.
2. Can `nums` be empty?
   - No, the minimum size of `nums` is 1 based on constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Brute-force Approach**: Compute the Hamming distance for every pair and sum them. This is straightforward but inefficient for large arrays.
2. **Optimized Approach**: Utilize bit manipulation to compute Hamming distances in a more efficient manner.
   - For each bit position, count how many numbers have a `1` at this position and how many have `0`.
   - The Hamming distance contributed by this bit position is the product of these two counts (since a `1` and a `0` at the same position between any two numbers contribute 1 to the Hamming distance).

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int totalHammingDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
        int total = 0, n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int countOnes = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num & (1 << i)) {
                    countOnes++;
                }
            }
            int countZeros = n - countOnes;
            total += countOnes * countZeros;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. Initialize `total` to `0` and get the size of `nums`.
2. Loop over each of the 32 bit positions (since a max range of `10^9` can be represented in 32 bits).
3. For each bit position `i`:
   - Count how many numbers have a `1` at bit position `i` (`countOnes`).
   - The other numbers must have a `0` at bit position `i`, so `countZeros` is `n - countOnes`.
   - The contribution to the Hamming distance from bit position `i` is `countOnes * countZeros`.
   - Add this contribution to `total`.
4. Return `total`.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(32 * n) = O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
  - Looping over 32 bit positions is constant time, and for each bit position, we loop through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
