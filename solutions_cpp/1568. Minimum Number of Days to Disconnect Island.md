[Leetcode 1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1568)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid containing only `1`s (land) and `0`s (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `1`s. The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island, otherwise, it is disconnected. In one day, you are allowed to change any single land cell (`1`) into a water cell (`0`). You need to return the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Dimensions of the grid**: What is the expected size range for the grid?
   - Typically, grid sizes are up to 50x50 on competitive programming platforms.
   
2. **Input Constraints**: Are there any guarantees about initial input? For example, is the grid guaranteed to contain at least one land cell initially?
   - The problem guarantees a connected island as the initial input.

3. **Edge Cases**: How are edge cases handled, such as the entire grid being water initially, or forming a very large single island?

### Strategy
1. **Base Cases**:
   - If the grid is already disconnected, return 0.
   - If removing any single cell can lead to disconnection, return 1.

2. **DFS/BFS for Connectivity**: Utilize Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to check if the grid is connected.

3. **Simulation of Cell Removal**:
   - For each cell, simulate its removal and check if the grid becomes disconnected.
   
4. **Returning Results**:
   - If we find a situation where removing 1 cell disconnects the island, return 1.
   - Otherwise, the answer is 2 because:
     - Removing a single cell might not disconnect the grid but removing two cells usually will (consider the nature of the grid).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if the grid remains connected after removing a cell
    bool isConnected(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size(), cols = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(rows, vector<bool>(cols, false));
        queue<pair<int, int>> bfsQueue;
        
        // Find the first land cell to start the BFS
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    bfsQueue.push({i, j});
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!bfsQueue.empty()) break;
        }
        
        // BFS to mark all reachable land cells
        int landCells = 0;
        while (!bfsQueue.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = bfsQueue.front(); bfsQueue.pop();
            ++landCells;
            for (auto [dx, dy] : vector<pair<int, int>>{{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}}) {
                int nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
                if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < rows && ny < cols && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    bfsQueue.push({nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }

        // Check if all land cells are visited
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && !visited[i][j]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    int minDays(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        if (!isConnected(grid)) return 0;

        int rows = grid.size(), cols = grid[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    grid[i][j] = 0;
                    if (!isConnected(grid)) return 1;
                    grid[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return 2;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The connectivity check runs in O(R * C), where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns.
- We perform this check for each land cell, making the overall complexity O(R^2 * C^2).

This strategy and code aim to solve the problem by leveraging BFS/DFS to verify the connectivity of the grid and simulating the removal of each land cell to determine minimal disconnection days.
