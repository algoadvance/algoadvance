[Leetcode 833. Find And Replace in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l833)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an array of `indices`. Each `indices[i]` indicates where a substring begins within `s` that you want to replace with another string. The list of `source` strings (`sources[i]`) and the list of `target` strings (`targets[i]`) are also provided.

To be more precise, if the substring in `s` starting at the index `indices[i]` and of length equal to `len(sources[i])` matches `sources[i]`, then you will replace that substring with `targets[i]`. If it doesn't match, do nothing.

Return the modified string after all replacements have occurred.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**:
   - Can `indices` be provided in any order, or will they always be sorted?
   - (Assuming any order) How do we handle overlapping replacements?

2. **Output**:
   - Will there be any constraints on the length of `s`, `indices`, `sources`, or `targets`?

Letâ€™s assume the following example inputs for further clarity:

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
```

### Strategy

1. **Sort By Indices**: To handle the replacements without affecting subsequent indices, we will sort the indices and the related sources and targets.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a pointer to traverse the string and reconstruct it while applying the replacements.
3. **String Matching**: Check if the substring that starts at each index matches the source. If yes, append the target; otherwise, append the original character and move to the next index.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string findReplaceString(std::string s, std::vector<int>& indices, std::vector<std::string>& sources, std::vector<std::string>& targets) {
    // Create a list of tuples (index, source, target) and sort them by index
    std::vector<std::tuple<int, std::string, std::string>> replacements;
    for (int i = 0; i < indices.size(); ++i) {
        replacements.emplace_back(indices[i], sources[i], targets[i]);
    }
    std::sort(replacements.begin(), replacements.end());

    // Creat a result string builder
    std::string result;
    int lastIndex = 0;

    for (const auto& [index, source, target] : replacements) {
        // Append the non-modified parts to the result
        result.append(s.substr(lastIndex, index - lastIndex));

        // Check and replace the matching segment
        if (s.substr(index, source.size()) == source) {
            result.append(target);
            lastIndex = index + source.size();
        } else {
            // If no match, just skip to the next index
            lastIndex = index;
        }
    }

    // Append the rest of the original string
    result.append(s.substr(lastIndex));

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abcd";
    std::vector<int> indices = {0, 2};
    std::vector<std::string> sources = {"a", "cd"};
    std::vector<std::string> targets = {"eee", "ffff"};
    
    std::string updatedString = findReplaceString(s, indices, sources, targets);
    std::cout << updatedString << std::endl;  // Output: "eeebffff"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of replacements.
- **String Operations**: The traversal of string `s` and replacements altogether take `O(m + k)` where `m` is the length of `s` and `k` is the total length of all sources and targets.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in:
```
O(n log n + m + k)
```
