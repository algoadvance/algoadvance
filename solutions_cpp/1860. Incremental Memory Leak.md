[Leetcode 1860. Incremental Memory Leak](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1860)
### Problem Statement:

You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the available memory in two memory banks. The memory leak starts at time `t = 1` and every second `t`, you lose `t` units of memory from one of the memory banks. More formally:

- During the `t-th` second, you will lose `t` units of memory from either memory bank 1 or memory bank 2. You must choose the bank with more available memory at every step. If both memory banks have the same available memory, you lose `t` units of memory from memory bank 1.

Return an array containing `[t, memory1, memory2]`, where `t` is the time at which you can no longer continue your task due to insufficient memory in either memory bank and `memory1` and `memory2` are the remaining amounts of memory in both banks.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Is `memory1` always greater than or equal to zero?
2. Is `memory2` always greater than or equal to zero?
3. Is there any upper bound on the values for `memory1` and `memory2`?

We will assume `memory1` and `memory2` are non-negative integers without any specific bounds, but large values should be properly handled.

### Strategy:

1. Initialize `t` to 1.
2. At each time step, compare `memory1` and `memory2`.
3. Subtract `t` from the bank with more memory.
4. If they are equal, subtract from `memory1`.
5. Check if the corresponding bank still has enough memory to subtract `t`.
6. Increment `t` and repeat until one of the banks doesn't have enough memory.
7. Return the result as `[t, memory1, memory2]`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
    int t = 1;
    while (true) {
        if (memory1 >= memory2) {
            if (memory1 >= t) {
                memory1 -= t;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        } else {
            if (memory2 >= t) {
                memory2 -= t;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        t++;
    }
    return {t, memory1, memory2};
}
```

### Explanation:

- Start with `t = 1`.
- At each second `t`, decide which memory bank to subtract from based on their current values.
- If `memory1` is greater than or equal to `memory2`, subtract from `memory1`.
- If `memory1` equals `memory2`, still subtract from `memory1`.
- If the memory bank chosen can't fulfill the `t` amount, terminate and return the state.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(âˆšn)`, where `n` is the initial maximum memory between `memory1` and `memory2`. This is because in each step, the time `t` increases linearly, and the summation of `t` that leads to the termination is in the ballpark of square roots. Specifically, it can be approximated that if you sum the first `k` integers, the sum is around `k^2 / 2`, which gives an intuitive idea of the square root behavior.
