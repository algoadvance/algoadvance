[Leetcode 1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1105)
## Problem Statement
Given a list `books` where `books[i] = [thickness_i, height_i]` represents the thickness and height of the `i-th` book. Given a shelf of width `shelf_width`, we want to place all the books in such a way that the total height of the bookshelf is minimized.

You can place the books to build more than one row, but each row's width should not exceed `shelf_width`. Each row's height is determined by the tallest book in that row.

Return the minimum possible height of the bookshelf.

### Example
```
Input: books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]], shelf_width = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
The first shelf contains the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th book.
The second shelf contains the 2nd and 3rd book.
The third shelf contains only the third book.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= books.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= thickness_i <= shelf_width <= 1000`
- `1 <= height_i <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume all books must be placed on the shelf?
   - Yes.
2. Is there any specific ordering of books or can we rearrange them freely?
   - The books must be placed in the order given.
3. Are thickness and height always positive integers?
   - Yes, based on the constraints.

## Strategy
We will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. We will maintain a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum height needed to place the first `i` books.

### Steps
1. Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[0] = 0` (no books means 0 height).
2. For each book, determine the minimum height of the bookshelf by checking all possible rows ending at the current book.
3. To do this, we will iterate backwards from the current book, keeping track of the maximum height in the current row and the total thickness.
4. Update the `dp` array with the minimal height by comparing the inclusion of the current book into the row or starting a new row.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;
 
int minHeightShelves(vector<vector<int>>& books, int shelf_width) {
    int n = books.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0; // No books no height

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int width = 0;
        int height = 0;
        
        for (int j = i; j > 0; --j) {
            width += books[j-1][0];
            if (width > shelf_width) break;
            height = max(height, books[j-1][1]);
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + height);
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of books. For each book, we iterate backwards to compute the possible heights by adding previous books to the current row. This results in quadratic time complexity.
