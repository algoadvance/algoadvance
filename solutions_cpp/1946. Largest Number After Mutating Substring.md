[Leetcode 1946. Largest Number After Mutating Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1946)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `num`, which represents a large integer. You are also given a `change` array of length 10 where `change[i]` is the digit that you can change digit `i` to, i.e., you can replace digit `i` in the string `num` with digit `change[i]`.

Return the largest possible number you can get by mutating (replacing) a substring of `num`.

## Example
```cpp
Input: num = "132", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]
Output: "832"

Input: num = "021", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]
Output: "934"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the string `num` have leading zeros?
   **A**: The string `num` might represent a number with leading zeros, but they should be preserved unless the whole number becomes zero.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of `num`?
   **A**: Yes, constraints are given, but let's assume reasonable length limits typical of LeetCode problems. 

## Strategy
1. Traverse the string `num` from left to right.
2. For each character, if the corresponding digit in `change` is greater than the current digit in `num`, start mutating the string.
3. Continue mutating as long as it results in a larger number.
4. Stop the mutation once it no longer produces a larger number.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string maximumNumber(string num, vector<int> &change) {
    bool mutating = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); ++i) {
        int digit = num[i] - '0';
        if (change[digit] > digit) {
            num[i] = '0' + change[digit];
            mutating = true;
        } else if (change[digit] < digit && mutating) {
            break; 
        }
    }
    
    return num;
}

int main() {
    string num = "132";
    vector<int> change = {9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8};
    
    string result = maximumNumber(num, change);
    cout << "Output: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of string `num`. This is because we only traverse the string once and perform a constant amount of work for each character.
