[Leetcode 1352. Product of the Last K Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1352)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, implement the class `ProductOfNumbers` that supports two methods:

1. `void add(int num)`: Adds the number `num` to the back of the current list of numbers.
2. `int getProduct(int k)`: Returns the product of the last `k` numbers in the current list.

You can assume that always the current list has at least `k` numbers when you call the `getProduct` method.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input:
["ProductOfNumbers","add","add","add","add","add","getProduct","getProduct","getProduct","add","getProduct"]
[[],[3],[0],[2],[5],[4],[2],[3],[4],[8],[2]]

Output:
[null,null,null,null,null,null,20,40,0,null,32]

Explanation:
ProductOfNumbers productOfNumbers = new ProductOfNumbers();
productOfNumbers.add(3);        // [3]
productOfNumbers.add(0);        // [3,0]
productOfNumbers.add(2);        // [3,0,2]
productOfNumbers.add(5);        // [3,0,2,5]
productOfNumbers.add(4);        // [3,0,2,5,4]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 20. The product of the last 2 numbers is 5 * 4 = 20
productOfNumbers.getProduct(3); // return 40. The product of the last 3 numbers is 2 * 5 * 4 = 40
productOfNumbers.getProduct(4); // return 0. The product of the last 4 numbers is 0 * 2 * 5 * 4 = 0
productOfNumbers.add(8);        // [3,0,2,5,4,8]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2); // return 32. The product of the last 2 numbers is 4 * 8 = 32
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the numbers added to the list guaranteed to be non-negative?
   - No specific guarantee. There may be negative numbers.
  
2. Could there be considerations for performance when there are multiple add operations followed by frequent getProduct calls? 
   - Yes, ideally, we want to optimize both add and getProduct operations.

3. Are we guaranteed to never have a call to getProduct with `k` larger than the number of elements currently in the list?
   - Yes, always assume the list has at least `k` numbers for each `getProduct` call as stated in the problem statement.

## Strategy
To optimize the `getProduct` method, we can maintain a list of prefix products. The idea is to store cumulative products such that:
- `prefix_products[i]` represents the product of all elements from the start up to the i-th element.
Thus, the product of the last `k` numbers can be calculated in constant time using the prefix products as follows:
- `getProduct(k) = prefix_products.back() / prefix_products[prefix_products.size() - k - 1]`

If a `0` is encountered, it breaks the product, and we need to skip or restart our product calculation.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

class ProductOfNumbers {
private:
    std::vector<int> prefix_products;

public:
    ProductOfNumbers() {
        // Start with a dummy 1 for ease of calculations (to avoid division by zero).
        prefix_products.push_back(1);
    }

    void add(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            // Reset the prefix products due to the 0.
            prefix_products = {1};
        } else {
            int last_product = prefix_products.back();
            prefix_products.push_back(last_product * num);
        }
    }

    int getProduct(int k) {
        int size = prefix_products.size();
        if (size <= k) {
            // This handles the case where we have more calls than numbers available, as per guarantee this won't happen.
            return 0;
        }
        return prefix_products.back() / prefix_products[size - k - 1];
    }
};

```

## Time Complexity
- `add(int num)`:
  - Amortized `O(1)` because each addition takes constant time to update the prefix product array.
  
- `getProduct(int k)`:
  - Constant time `O(1)` for calculating the product of the last `k` numbers using prefix product division.

This approach ensures efficient handling of both operations, making it suitable for scenarios with high-frequency calls to both `add` and `getProduct` methods.
