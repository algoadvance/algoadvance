[Leetcode 1138. Alphabet Board Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1138)
### Problem Statement
Given a string target, you have an alphabet board that is a grid of 5x5 characters. The board contains the lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' in row-major order, i.e., the board is:
```
a b c d e
f g h i j
k l m n o
p q r s t
u v w x y
z
```

You start at the position of character 'a', and you want to spell out the string target. You can only move:
- 'U' (up), 
- 'D' (down), 
- 'L' (left), or 
- 'R' (right).

You have to find the path from the current letter to the next letter in the target string and construct the path string. The return path should also indicate when you select a letter using '!'.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that the input string will always constitute letters from 'a' to 'z'?**
   - Yes, the input will only contain letters from 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Is there any limit on the length of the target string?**
   - For simplicity, we can assume the target string length fits within the problem constraints of typical competitive programming problems, often within the range of 1 to 1000 characters.

3. **Do we need to handle moving off the board?**
   - No, each move stays within the board's boundaries.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Coordinates:**
   - First, calculate the coordinates of each character from 'a' to 'z' on the 5x5 board. We can use the index of a character and perform integer division and modulus to get the row and column.

2. **Generate Path from One Character to the Next:**
   - For each character transition, calculate the difference in rows and columns.
   - When moving to 'z' from any other character, handle moving 'L' and 'R' before moving 'D' to avoid going out of bounds ('z' is at the bottom-left corner).
   - Conversely, when moving from 'z' to any other character, you must move 'U' first.

3. **Construct Result:**
   - Append the path directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') followed by '!' when a character is reached.

### Time Complexity
The solution involves iterating through the target string and calculating directions based on coordinates, which takes linear time with respect to the length of the target string, O(n).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

std::string alphabetBoardPath(std::string target) {
    std::string path;
    int curRow = 0, curCol = 0; // Starting position is 'a' (0, 0)
    
    for (char ch : target) {
        int nextRow = (ch - 'a') / 5;
        int nextCol = (ch - 'a') % 5;
        
        // Special case: if moving to 'z'
        if (ch == 'z') {
            if (nextCol < curCol) {
                path.append(curCol - nextCol, 'L');
            } else if (nextCol > curCol) {
                path.append(nextCol - curCol, 'R');
            }
            if (nextRow > curRow) {
                path.append(nextRow - curRow, 'D');
            } else if (nextRow < curRow) {
                path.append(curRow - nextRow, 'U');
            }
        } else {
            if (nextRow < curRow) {
                path.append(curRow - nextRow, 'U');
            } else if (nextRow > curRow) {
                path.append(nextRow - curRow, 'D');
            }
            if (nextCol < curCol) {
                path.append(curCol - nextCol, 'L');
            } else if (nextCol > curCol) {
                path.append(nextCol - curCol, 'R');
            }
        }
        
        path += '!';
        curRow = nextRow;
        curCol = nextCol;
    }
    
    return path;
}

int main() {
    std::string target = "zdz";
    std::string result = alphabetBoardPath(target);
    std::cout << result << std::endl; // Output should be "DDDDD!UUUUURRRRR!DDDDD!"
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `alphabetBoardPath` function calculates and appends the required path for each character in the target string.
- Special handling ensures we don't move out of bounds when dealing with 'z', aligning moves to 'L' and 'R' before 'D'.
- Subsequent positions are adjusted, and '!' is appended whenever a letter is selected.

### Performance:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — it processes each character of the target string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) — path string size grows with the target input size.
