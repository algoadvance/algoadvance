[Leetcode 365. Water and Jug Problem](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l365)
## Problem Statement
You are given two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity` liters. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.

If `targetCapacity` liters of water is measurable, you must do it by using these operations:
1. Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
2. Empty any of the jugs.
3. Pour water from one jug into another jug until one of the jugs is either full or empty.

Return `true` if `targetCapacity` liters can be measured using the two jugs, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on `jug1Capacity`, `jug2Capacity`, and `targetCapacity`? Are they all non-negative integers?
2. Can the `targetCapacity` be greater than the sum of `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`?
3. Is it possible for any of the capacities (`jug1Capacity`, `jug2Capacity`, `targetCapacity`) to be zero?

With these clarifications in mind, let's move on to defining the solution strategy.

## Strategy
The problem boils down to a classic mathematical problem that can be solved using BÃ©zout's identity and the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

**Key Insight:**
A solution exists if and only if the `targetCapacity` is a multiple of the GCD of `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`, and `targetCapacity` does not exceed the sum of the two jug capacities. 

### Steps:
1. Calculate the GCD of `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
2. Check if `targetCapacity` is less than or equal to the sum of the two jug capacities.
3. Verify if `targetCapacity` is a multiple of the GCD obtained.

### Time Complexity:
- Calculating the GCD has a time complexity of `O(log(min(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity)))` using the Euclidean algorithm.
- All other operations are constant time.

## Code

```cpp
#include <algorithm> // for __gcd function

class Solution {
public:
    bool canMeasureWater(int jug1Capacity, int jug2Capacity, int targetCapacity) {
        // If the target capacity is greater than the sum of both jugs, it's impossible
        if(targetCapacity > jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Calculate the GCD of both jug capacities
        int gcd = std::__gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity);
        
        // Check if targetCapacity is a multiple of GCD
        return targetCapacity % gcd == 0;
    }
};
```

## Explanation:
1. **GCD Calculation:** We use the built-in `std::__gcd` function to compute the GCD of `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
2. **Capacity Check:** We first check if `targetCapacity` is greater than the total capacity of both jugs combined. If it is, then it's impossible to measure that amount of water.
3. **Multiple of GCD Check:** Finally, we validate if `targetCapacity` is a multiple of the GCD, which ensures it's measurable by using the two jugs.

This completes our solution. The strategy leverages basic number theory to determine the feasibility of measuring the desired water capacity with two jugs.
