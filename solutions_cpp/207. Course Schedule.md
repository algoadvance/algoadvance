[Leetcode 207. Course Schedule](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l207)
### Problem Statement
You are given a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`. You are also given a list of prerequisite pairs `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you must take course `b_i` before course `a_i`.

Given the total number of courses and the list of prerequisites, determine if it is possible for you to finish all courses.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there duplicate prerequisite pairs in the input?
   **A:** No, each prerequisite pair is unique.
   
2. **Q:** Can the prerequisite list contain self-dependency (e.g., `[0, 0]`)?
   **A:** No, a course does not require itself as a prerequisite.

3. **Q:** What should be returned if no courses are to be taken (`numCourses = 0`)?
   **A:** Return `true` since there are no courses to complete.

### Strategy
This problem can be viewed as a cycle detection problem in a directed graph. Here, courses are represented as nodes and prerequisites as directed edges.

We'll solve this problem using two different approaches:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
2. **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS for Topological Sort)**

For both approaches:
- **Nodes** represent courses.
- **Edges** represent prerequisites.

#### DFS Approach:
1. **Graph Representation**: Build an adjacency list from prerequisites.
2. **Cycle Detection with Recursive DFS**:
   - Use a visitation state array: `0` (unvisited), `1` (visiting), `2` (visited).
   - If revisiting a `visiting` node, a cycle is detected.
    
#### BFS Approach (Kahn’s Algorithm):
1. **Graph Representation**: Build an adjacency list for the graph and an array for in-degrees.
2. **Topological Sort**:
   - Use a queue to track nodes with zero in-degrees.
   - Process each node, decrementing in-degree of neighboring nodes.
   - If the sorted order contains all courses, there is no cycle.

### Time Complexity
Both approaches have similar time complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of nodes (courses), and \(E\) is the number of edges (prerequisites).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\) due to the graph representation and auxiliary data structures.

Let's implement both approaches.

### Implementation in C++
#### DFS Approach
```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        for (auto& prereq : prerequisites) {
            graph[prereq[1]].push_back(prereq[0]);
        }
        
        vector<int> visit(numCourses, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (hasCycle(i, graph, visit)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
private:
    bool hasCycle(int node, const vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& visit) {
        if (visit[node] == 1) return true;
        if (visit[node] == 2) return false;
        
        visit[node] = 1;
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (hasCycle(neighbor, graph, visit)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        visit[node] = 2;
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### BFS Approach (Kahn’s Algorithm)
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        vector<int> inDegree(numCourses, 0);
        
        for (auto& prereq : prerequisites) {
            graph[prereq[1]].push_back(prereq[0]);
            ++inDegree[prereq[0]];
        }
        
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        int completedCourses = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int course = q.front();
            q.pop();
            ++completedCourses;
            
            for (int neighbor : graph[course]) {
                if (--inDegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return completedCourses == numCourses;
    }
};
```

### Summary
- We discussed and clarified the problem requirements.
- We established two strategies: DFS for cycle detection and BFS for topological sorting.
- Time complexity for both approaches is \(O(V + E)\).
