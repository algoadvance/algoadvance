[Leetcode 1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1359)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` orders, each order consists of pickup and delivery services. Count all valid pickup/delivery sequences such that deliveries are made in the same order as their pickups. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**:
    - How is `n` provided?
        - `n` is given as an integer.
   
2. **Output Format**:
    - Should the result be returned or printed?
        - The result should be returned as an integer.
   
3. **Constraints**:
    - What are the constraints on `n`?
        - \(1 \leq n \leq 500\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a few elements:
- Let `dp[i]` be the number of valid pickup and delivery sequences for `i` orders.

### Derivation:
To find the number of ways to arrange `i` pairs, we can start with the result for `i-1` pairs and add one more pair (`P_i`, `D_i`).
- First, choose a free position from the `(2*(i-1)+1)` for `P_i`.
- Once `P_i` is placed, there will be exactly `(2*i-1)` places left for `D_i`.

Thus, the relation can be constructed as:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] \times (2*i-1) \times i \]

The `(2*i-1) * i` comes from:
- `2*i-1`: ways to place `P_i`.
- `i`: chooses a position for `P_i` among the remaining positions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        
        // Handling the base case
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        
        std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[1] = 1; // With 1 pair, there's only one way to arrange it
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * (2 * i - 1) * i % MOD;
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};

// Example of usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     int n = 3;
//     int result = sol.countOrders(n);
//     std::cout << result << std::endl;  // Output for n = 3 should be 90
//     return 0;
//}

```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\) since it iterates through from `1` to `n` filling up the `dp` array.

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage used for `dp` array.

Thus, the solution is both time and space efficient for the given problem constraints.
