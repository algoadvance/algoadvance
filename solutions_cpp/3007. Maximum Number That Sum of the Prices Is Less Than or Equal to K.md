[Leetcode 3007. Maximum Number That Sum of the Prices Is Less Than or Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3007)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of prices and an integer K, determine the maximum number of distinct items that can be purchased such that the sum of their prices does not exceed K.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are prices positive integers?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can prices have duplicates in the list?**
   - No, prices in the list are distinct integers.

3. **What should be returned if no items can be purchased?**
   - Return 0 if no items can be purchased under the given constraint.

4. **What is the maximum size for the list of prices?**
   - Let's assume the list length `n` can be up to 10^5.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the List**: Start by sorting the list of prices in ascending order. This allows us to try purchasing the cheapest items first and maximize the number of items we can buy without exceeding `K`.

2. **Iterate through Sorted List**: Use a running sum to keep track of the total price of items being considered. Add items to the running sum until adding another item would exceed `K`.

3. **Count the Items**: Keep a count of the number of items added to the running sum before the next item's price would cause the sum to exceed `K`.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the list takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration**: A single pass through the sorted list takes \(O(n)\).
- **Overall**: The total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int maxItemsWithinBudget(std::vector<int>& prices, int K) {
    // Sort prices in ascending order
    std::sort(prices.begin(), prices.end());
    
    int currentSum = 0;
    int itemCount = 0;
    
    for (int price : prices) {
        if (currentSum + price <= K) {
            currentSum += price;
            itemCount++;
        } else {
            break; // stop, as adding the next item would exceed K
        }
    }
    return itemCount;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> prices = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4};
    int K = 9;
    
    int result = maxItemsWithinBudget(prices, K);
    std::cout << "Maximum number of items: " << result << std::endl; // Expected output is 3
    
    return 0;
}
```

Replace the `main` function with the appropriate test cases to validate the function as necessary. This approach ensures that we maximize the number of items bought without exceeding the given budget `K`.
