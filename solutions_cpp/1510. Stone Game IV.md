[Leetcode 1510. Stone Game IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1510)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first. Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones from the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game assuming both players play optimally.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are valid moves?**
    - Players can remove any perfect square number of stones that does not exceed the current number of stones.

2. **What does "playing optimally" mean?**
    - Both players make the best possible move at each step to maximize their chances of winning.

3. **What is the range of `n`?**
    - Given `n` is a positive integer. Typically LeetCode problems will have constraints, but let's assume moderately large values (up to 10^4) for general efficiency needs.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). We'll create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether the player whose turn it is can win given `i` stones remaining.

1. **Initialization**: Set `dp[0]` to `false` as no stones mean the current player loses.
2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Iterate through all possible numbers of stones from `1` to `n`.
   - For each number `i`, check all possible perfect squares `k*k` such that `k*k <= i`.
   - If for any `dp[i - k*k]` is `false`, it means the current player can win by making the move that leaves `i - k*k` stones.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        // dp[i] will be true if the current player can win with i stones
        std::vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int k = 1; k * k <= i; ++k) {
                if (!dp[i - k * k]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    // Example test
    int n = 7;
    bool result = sol.winnerSquareGame(n);
    std::cout << (result ? "Alice can win." : "Alice cannot win.") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of filling out each state `i` is `O(sqrt(i))` because we check all perfect squares up to `i`.
- Hence, for all `n` states, the overall time complexity is `O(n * sqrt(n))`.

## Space Complexity

- We use a single DP array of size `n+1`, so the space complexity is `O(n)`.
