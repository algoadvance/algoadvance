[Leetcode 897. Increasing Order Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l897)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only one right child.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values within the nodes?**
   - The values within the nodes are unique.
  
2. **What is the size range for the tree?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 100].

3. **Do we need to handle any cases where the tree is invalid or null?**
   - The problem guarantees a non-null root within the specified node range.

4. **Is there a specific output structure or format required?**
   - The output should be the new root of the modified tree structured as described.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will employ an in-order traversal to visit the nodes of the tree in ascending order. During the traversal, we will rebuild the tree such that each node only has a right child.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. **In-Order Traversal**: Traverse the tree using in-order traversal to ensure that nodes are processed in ascending order.
2. **Reconstruction**: As we traverse the tree, reconstruct it such that each node only has a right child.

To implement this, weâ€™ll maintain a dummy node that helps in reconstructing the tree. We will use a current pointer that starts at the dummy node and moves right as we attach nodes to the new tree.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* increasingBST(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        TreeNode* dummy = new TreeNode(0);
        TreeNode* current = dummy;

        inorderTraversal(root, current);

        return dummy->right;
    }

private:
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* node, TreeNode*& current) {
        if (!node) return;

        inorderTraversal(node->left, current);

        // At this point, node is the next node in inorder sequence
        node->left = nullptr; // We do not need left children in the new tree
        current->right = node; // Attach current's right to node
        current = node; // Move current

        inorderTraversal(node->right, current);
    }
};

// Helper function to create a new TreeNode
TreeNode* createNode(int val) {
    return new TreeNode(val);
}

// Helper function to print the resulting tree (for testing)
void printRightSkewedTree(TreeNode* root) {
    TreeNode* current = root;
    while (current) {
        std::cout << current->val << " ";
        current = current->right;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    Solution sol;
    
    TreeNode* root = createNode(5);
    root->left = createNode(3);
    root->right = createNode(6);
    root->left->left = createNode(2);
    root->left->right = createNode(4);
    root->left->left->left = createNode(1);
    root->right->right = createNode(8);
    root->right->right->left = createNode(7);
    root->right->right->right = createNode(9);

    TreeNode* result = sol.increasingBST(root);
    printRightSkewedTree(result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves a single in-order traversal of the tree, which visits each node once. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursive stack used during the in-order traversal. In the worst case, this could be O(n) for a completely unbalanced tree, but on average, it will be O(log n) for a balanced tree.
