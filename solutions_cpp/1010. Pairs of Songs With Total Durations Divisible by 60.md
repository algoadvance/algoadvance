[Leetcode 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1010)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of songs where the i-th song has a duration `time[i]` in seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we need the number of indices `i, j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(30,150), (20,100), (20,40)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs (60,60) have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10^4`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the duration of the songs exceed 60 seconds?
   **A:** Yes, each song's duration can be between 1 and 500 seconds as per constraints.

2. **Q:** Are the indices i and j distinct?
   **A:** Yes, the indices need to satisfy \(i < j\).

3. **Q:** Can a song be paired with itself?
   **A:** No, each pair must be formed by two different songs.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:
1. Use an array `remainder` of size 60 to count occurrences of each remainder when divided by 60.
2. For each song duration, compute its remainder when divided by 60.
3. To form pairs:
   - If the remainder is 0, pair it with other 0 remainders.
   - For other remainders `r`, pair it with `60-r` remainders.
4. Use combinatorial counting to find the number of such pairs.

This approach allows us to count pairs efficiently, with a time complexity of O(n).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
    vector<int> remainder(60, 0);  // Create a remainder array of size 60
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int t : time) {
        int rem = t % 60;
        if (rem == 0) {  // If time exactly divisible by 60, pair with other 0 remainders
            count += remainder[0];
        } else {  // Otherwise, pair with (60 - rem) remainders
            count += remainder[60 - rem];
        }
        remainder[rem]++;  // Increment the count of this remainder
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> time1 = {30, 20, 150, 100, 40};
    cout << "Example 1 Output: " << numPairsDivisibleBy60(time1) << endl; 
    
    vector<int> time2 = {60, 60, 60};
    cout << "Example 2 Output: " << numPairsDivisibleBy60(time2) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of songs.
- Space complexity is \(O(60)\) which simplifies to \(O(1)\).
