[Leetcode 3015. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3015)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree representing a neighborhood, where each node represents a house. The root of the tree represents the center of the neighborhood, and each edge represents a direct path between two houses. Each node has an integer value representing the number of residents in the house.

Given a target node and a distance `k`, return the number of houses that are exactly `k` distance away from the target node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Nodes and Structure:**
   - What does each node contain? Is it just the house number or additional data?
   - Are the edges between nodes of equal weight, meaning can we assume the distance between directly connected nodes is always 1?

2. **Binary Tree Properties:**
   - Is the tree a binary tree?
   - Can the tree have cycles?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should we return if there are no houses `k` distance away from the target node?
   - If the root doesn't exist or if the distance `k` is beyond the tree height, should we return 0?

### Strategy

1. **Model the Graph:**
   - Represent the neighborhood (tree) using an adjacency list for easy traversal.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Use BFS to explore all nodes exactly `k` levels away from the target node. This way, we can efficiently keep track of distances.

3. **Track the Distance:**
   - Start from the target node and track the distance using a queue. Mark visited nodes to avoid cycles.

### Code Solution

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

// Helper function to build the graph
void buildGraph(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* parent, std::unordered_map<TreeNode*, std::vector<TreeNode*>>& graph) {
    if (!node) return;
    if (parent) {
        graph[node].push_back(parent);
        graph[parent].push_back(node);
    }
    buildGraph(node->left, node, graph);
    buildGraph(node->right, node, graph);
}

int countHousesAtDistanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int k) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    // Build the graph from the tree
    std::unordered_map<TreeNode*, std::vector<TreeNode*>> graph;
    buildGraph(root, nullptr, graph);

    // Perform BFS from the target node
    std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
    std::unordered_set<TreeNode*> visited;
    q.push(target);
    visited.insert(target);

    int distance = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        if (distance == k) return size;

        distance++;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (TreeNode* neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                    q.push(neighbor);
                    visited.insert(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return 0; // If there are no nodes at distance k
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);

    TreeNode* target = root->left; // target node with value 2

    int distance = 2;
    int result = countHousesAtDistanceK(root, target, distance);
    std::cout << "Number of houses at distance " << distance << ": " << result << std::endl;

    // Clean up memory
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **BFS Traversal:** `O(N)`, since each node and edge will be traversed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N)`.
