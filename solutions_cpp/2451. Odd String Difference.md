[Leetcode 2451. Odd String Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2451)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `words`. Each string consists of lowercase English letters and has the same length.

We'll define the difference value of a string as an array of integers, where each integer represents the difference between the ASCII values of consecutive characters in the string.

For example, the difference value of "abcd" is `[b-a, c-b, d-c]` which translates to `[1, 1, 1]`.

Your task is to find and return the unique string within the array `words` based on these difference values. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one such unique string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Format of input and output**:
    - Input: An array of strings `words`
    - Output: A single string which is the unique one based on the difference values.
2. **Length of the strings**:
    - All strings in `words` are of the same length.
3. **Guaranteed constraints**:
    - There is exactly one unique string in terms of difference values.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Difference Values**: For each string in the array, compute the difference value.
2. **Store Difference Values**: Use a dictionary to store the difference value as the key and maintain a list of strings that have that particular difference.
3. **Identify Unique String**:
    - Normally, strings with the same difference values should be grouped together.
    - The unique string will be the one whose difference value appears exactly once in the dictionary.
4. **Return the Unique String**.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<int> getDifferenceValue(const string &s) {
    vector<int> diff;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        diff.push_back(s[i] - s[i - 1]);
    }
    return diff;
}

string oddStringDifference(vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> diffMap;
    
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        vector<int> diffVec = getDifferenceValue(word);
        string diffStr;
        for (const int& num : diffVec) {
            diffStr += to_string(num) + ",";
        }
        diffMap[diffStr].push_back(word);
    }
    
    for (const auto& entry : diffMap) {
        if (entry.second.size() == 1) {
            return entry.second[0];
        }
    }
    
    return ""; // This line should not be reached due to problem constraints
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"adc", "wzy", "abc"};
    cout << oddStringDifference(words) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Calculating difference value: \(O(n \times m)\)
  - Where \(n\) is the number of strings,
  - \(m\) is the length of each string.
- Storing difference values in the map: \(O(n \times m)\)
- Identifying unique string: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\).
