### Problem Statement

1846. Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging

You are given an array `arr` of positive integers. You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
1. Decrease the value of any element of the array to a smaller positive integer.
2. Rearrange the elements of the array.

Return the maximum possible value of the smallest element after performing the above operations any number of times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The length of `arr` is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
   - Each element in `arr` is a positive integer in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Output**:
   - We need to return an integer representing the maximum possible value of the smallest element after modifying and rearranging the array.

3. **Examples**:
   - Example 1:
     - Input: `arr = [2,2,1,2,1]`
     - Output: `2`
   - Example 2:
     - Input: `arr = [100,1,1000]`
     - Output: `3`
   - Example 3:
     - Input: `arr = [1,2,3,4,5]`
     - Output: `5`

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Sorting**: Sort the array to simplify the subsequent operations.
2. **Adjust Elements**: Iterate through the sorted array and adjust each element to be as small as possible without breaking the conditions.
   - Start with setting the first element to `1` because we want the smallest possible starting point.
   - For any subsequent element, if it's greater than the previous element plus one, set it to the previous element plus one.
   - Otherwise, leave it as is.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- Iterating through the array and adjusting elements takes \(O(n)\).
- Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Sort the array
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    // Set the first element to 1
    arr[0] = 1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        // Ensure each element is at most one more than the previous
        if (arr[i] > arr[i-1] + 1) {
            arr[i] = arr[i-1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // The last element will be the maximum element after reconfiguration
    return arr.back();
}

// Example usage:

// #include <iostream>

// int main() {
//     std::vector<int> arr1 = {2, 2, 1, 2, 1};
//     std::cout << maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(arr1) << std::endl;  // Output: 2

//     std::vector<int> arr2 = {100, 1, 1000};
//     std::cout << maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(arr2) << std::endl;  // Output: 3

//     std::vector<int> arr3 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//     std::cout << maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(arr3) << std::endl;  // Output: 5

//     return 0;
// }
```

### Explanation
- **Sort the Array**: Sorting ensures that we can process each element in a straightforward manner.
- **Adjust Each Element**: By setting the first element to `1` and making sure each subsequent element is at most one more than the previous, we achieve the maximum possible value for the smallest element.
- **Return the Result**: The last element in this adjusted array will be the maximum value of the smallest element after all operations.
