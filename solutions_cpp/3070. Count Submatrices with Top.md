[Leetcode 3070. Count Submatrices with Top](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3070)
## Problem Statement
You are given a matrix `mat` and an integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of submatrices such that:
1. The top-left element of the submatrix (the element on the first row and first column of the submatrix) is equal to an integer `out`.
2. The sum of all elements in the submatrix is less than `k`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the matrix guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. What are the range and constraints for the dimensions of the matrix and the integer `k`?
3. Should the submatrices have at least one element (i.e., 1x1 submatrix is allowed)?
4. Is there a limit on the values within the matrix?

## Assumptions
1. The matrix is non-empty.
2. The size of the matrix is `m x n` where `1 <= m, n <= 100`
3. The elements of the matrix and `k` are in the range of `1 <= mat[i][j], k <= 1000`.

## Strategy
1. Iterate through each element in the matrix to serve as the potential top-left corner of a submatrix.
2. For each potential top-left corner `(i, j)`:
   - If the element matches the integer `out`, consider it as a valid starting point.
   - Explore all possible submatrices starting from `(i, j)` and extending to the bottom-right direction.
   - For each submatrix, keep a running sum to ensure that the sum of its elements is less than `k`.
   - Increment the count if the submatrix sum is valid.
   
3. Utilize a nested loop where the outer loops fix the top-left corner and the inner loops extend the submatrix.

## Time Complexity
- The worst-case time complexity will be `O(m^2 * n^2)` due to the nested loops involved in considering all possible submatrices starting from each element of the matrix. For each potential top-left corner, we may iterate through all possible extensions of the submatrix, resulting in a possible complexity of `O(m*n)` for each top-left element.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int countSubmatrices(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k, int out) {
    int m = mat.size();
    int n = mat[0].size();
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {

            // Check if current element is the top-left element `out`
            if (mat[i][j] != out) {
                continue;
            }

            // Initialize sum for submatrix starting at (i, j)
            for (int p = i; p < m; ++p) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int q = j; q < n; ++q) {
                    sum += mat[p][q];
                    if (p > i) sum += mat[p-1][q];
                    if (q > j) sum += mat[p][q-1];
                    if (p > i && q > j) sum -= mat[p-1][q-1];

                    // Check if sum of current submatrix is less than k
                    if (sum < k) {
                        ++count;
                    }
                    else {
                        break; // No need to continue if sum exceeds k
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {{1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}};
    int k = 4;
    int out = 1;
    cout << "Count of required submatrices: " << countSubmatrices(mat, k, out) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
1. We iterate through each element and check if it's the starting point for our submatrices.
2. We dynamically expand the submatrices and keep track of the sum to confirm validity.
3. The sum is maintained to ensure it remains lower than `k`, allowing us to count valid submatrices effectively.
