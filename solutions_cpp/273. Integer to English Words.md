[Leetcode 273. Integer to English Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l273)
### Problem Statement
Convert a non-negative integer to its English words representation. Given input is guaranteed to be less than 2^31 - 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the input?
   **A**: Yes, the input will be a non-negative integer less than 2^31 - 1.
   
2. **Q**: Should the output be in lowercase or uppercase?
   **A**: The problem usually specifies lowercase English words.

3. **Q**: Do we need to handle edge cases such as zero?
   **A**: Yes, you should handle zero and it should be converted to "Zero".

### Strategy

1. **Break down the problem**:
   - Convert each segment of the number into hundreds, tens, and units.
   - Map each segment to its corresponding English words.
   
2. **Divide the number by segments**:
   - Segments can be "Billion", "Million", "Thousand", and the remainder can be directly processed.
   
3. **Convert segments**:
   - Use a helper function to convert numbers less than 1000 to English words.

4. **Combine segments**:
   - Collect the words for each segment and combine them appropriately.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(1) because there is a constant amount of work done since we are only dealing with a fixed number of segments (billion, million, thousand, hundreds).

### Code

Here is the C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> below_twenty = {"", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", 
                                   "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Eleven", 
                                   "Twelve", "Thirteen", "Fourteen", "Fifteen", 
                                   "Sixteen", "Seventeen", "Eighteen", "Nineteen"};
    
    vector<string> tens = {"", "Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty", 
                           "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"};
    
    vector<string> thousands = {"", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"};
    
    string numberToWords(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return "Zero";
        
        int i = 0;
        string words = "";
        
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 1000 != 0) {
                words = helper(num % 1000) + thousands[i] + " " + words;
            }
            num /= 1000;
            i++;
        }
        
        // Remove trailing spaces
        while (words.back() == ' ') words.pop_back();
        
        return words;
    }
    
    string helper(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return "";
        } else if (num < 20) {
            return below_twenty[num] + " ";
        } else if (num < 100) {
            return tens[num / 10] + " " + helper(num % 10);
        } else {
            return below_twenty[num / 10] + " Hundred " + helper(num % 100);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int num = 1234567891;
    cout << solution.numberToWords(num) << endl; 
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Arrays Initialization**:
   - `below_twenty`: English words for numbers 0-19.
   - `tens`: English words for multiples of ten.
   - `thousands`: Placeholders for thousand, million, and billion.

2. **numberToWords Function**:
   - Checks if the input is zero and returns "Zero".
   - Iterates over segments of the number (thousands, millions, billions).
   - Adds the corresponding English words for each segment.

3. **helper Function**:
   - Converts numbers less than 1000 into words.

4. The main function demonstrates converting the number 1234567891 to its English words representation.

This solution effectively breaks down the number into manageable segments and converts each into its English representation using an iterative approach.
