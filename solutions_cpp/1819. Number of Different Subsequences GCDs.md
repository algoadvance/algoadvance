[Leetcode 1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1819)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to find the number of unique greatest common divisors (GCDs) among all non-empty subsequences of a given array `nums`.

### Definition:
Given an array of integers `nums`, we need to count how many distinct values of GCD can be obtained from all possible non-empty subsequences of `nums`.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [6, 10, 3]
Output: 5
Explanation: The GCDs of all non-empty subsequences are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` contain negative integers or zeros?
   - No, typically `nums` contains only positive integers (based on the problem's standard constraints).

2. What is the range of values for the integers in `nums`?
   - This will help in determining the feasible solution approaches.

3. What are the constraints on the length of `nums`?
   - This will help us understand the efficiency needed in our solution.

For the purposes of this problem, assume:
- `nums` consists of positive integers.
- Constraints will generally be around:
  - 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^4
  - 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 2 * 10^4

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Subsequences and GCDs**:
   - Given that a subsequence maintains the order but can skip elements, we can derive that the subsequence GCD focuses on the GCD property rather than the sequence itself.

2. **Approach**:
   - We need to find the maximum possible element in `nums`, say `maxVal`.
   - For every number from 1 to `maxVal`, we treat it as a potential GCD value.
   - For each potential GCD value, iterate through the `nums` array to check if it can be constituted by some subsequence of elements having this as the GCD.
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute GCD efficiently.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Iterating from 1 to `maxVal` is an O(maxVal) operation.
   - For each value, checking divisibility for each element in `nums` is O(n).
   - Overall `O(n * maxVal)` complexity is feasible within given constraints.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

int countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxVal = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    vector<bool> present(maxVal + 1, false);
    
    // Mark elements present in nums
    for (int num : nums) {
        present[num] = true;
    }
    
    int distinctGCDs = 0;
    
    // Iterate through all possible GCD values
    for (int i = 1; i <= maxVal; ++i) {
        int currentGCD = 0;
        // Check if any multiple of `i` is present in nums
        for (int j = i; j <= maxVal; j += i) {
            if (present[j]) {
                // Calculate the GCD of currentGCD and j
                currentGCD = gcd(currentGCD, j);
                // If currentGCD equals `i`, we found a valid subsequence GCD
                if (currentGCD == i) {
                    ++distinctGCDs;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return distinctGCDs;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * maxVal)
  - Iterating through `i` from 1 to `maxVal`: O(maxVal)
  - For each `i`, iterating through multiples: this itself accumulates an O(n) complexity.
  - Overall: O(n * maxVal)

- **Space Complexity**: O(maxVal)
  - For the auxiliary `present` array marking presence of elements.

This approach balances the necessity for checking each element/multiple relationship while ensuring the operation remains within reasonable computational bounds.
