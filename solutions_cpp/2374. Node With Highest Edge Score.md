[Leetcode 2374. Node With Highest Edge Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2374)
Certainly! Let's break down the problem in a structured way:

### Problem Statement
You are given a directed graph represented by an array `edges` where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

The **edge score** of a node `i` is defined as the sum of all node indices `j` for which there's a directed edge from `j` to `i`.

Your task is to return the node with the highest edge score. If there is a tie, return the node with the smallest index.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of node indices in the array?**
   - Typically, the node indices range from `0` to `n-1` where `n` is the size of the `edges` array.

2. **Are there any constraints on the edge values?**
   - Generally, `edges[i]` will be within index range `0` to `n-1`.

3. **What is the possible size of the `edges` array?**
   - It depends on the problem constraints, but we can assume it could be large.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a score array**: We will create an array to keep track of the edge scores of each node. The size of this array will be the same as the `edges` array.
2. **Accumulate scores**: We will iterate through the `edges` array and for each node `i`, we will add `i` to the edge score of `edges[i]`.
3. **Find the maximum edge score**: After accumulating scores, we will iterate through the score array to find the maximum edge score. In case of a tie, we return the node with the smallest index.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <climits> // For INT_MAX
#include <iostream>

int nodeWithHighestEdgeScore(const std::vector<int>& edges) {
    int n = edges.size();
    
    // Step 1: Initialize score array
    std::vector<long long> scores(n, 0);
    
    // Step 2: Accumulate scores
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        scores[edges[i]] += i;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Find the node with the highest edge score
    long long maxScore = LLONG_MIN;
    int resultNode = -1;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if(scores[i] > maxScore) {
            maxScore = scores[i];
            resultNode = i;
        }
    }
    
    return resultNode;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> edges = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 5};
    std::cout << "Node with highest edge score: " << nodeWithHighestEdgeScore(edges) << std::endl; 
    // Expected output: 0 or 7 based on scores, depending on the input.
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initializing the score array**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the `edges` array.
- **Accumulating the scores**: \(O(n)\), as we iterate through the `edges` array once.
- **Finding the maximum score**: \(O(n)\), as we iterate through the score array once.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Space Complexity
- **Score array**: \(O(n)\) additional space is used for the score array.

Thus, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).
