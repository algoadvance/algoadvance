### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1342: **Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero**

Given an integer `num`, you need to repeatedly perform the following steps until `num` becomes 0:

1. If `num` is even, divide it by 2.
2. If `num` is odd, subtract 1 from it.

Return the number of steps to reduce `num` to zero.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of the input number? 
   - The problem typically ensures `0 <= num <= 10^6`.
2. **Output**: Should the result be of any specific type?
   - The function should return an integer indicating the number of steps.

### Strategy
1. Start with `num` and initialize a counter to 0.
2. Use a loop to repeatedly apply the given rules:
   - If `num` is even, divide it by 2.
   - If `num` is odd, subtract 1 from it.
   - Increment the counter for each operation.
3. Stop the loop when `num` is zero.
4. Return the counter as the result.

### Code

Here's the C++ function to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int numberOfSteps(int num) {
    int steps = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            num /= 2;
        } else {
            num -= 1;
        }
        steps++;
    }
    return steps;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    int num = 14;
    std::cout << "Number of steps to reduce " << num << " to zero: " << numberOfSteps(num) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is **O(log n)** where `n` is the value of the input number. This is because each division by 2 operation (for even numbers) effectively halves the size of `num`, and subtraction operations are constant time.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. 

This solution efficiently and correctly follows the steps to reduce the given number to zero.
