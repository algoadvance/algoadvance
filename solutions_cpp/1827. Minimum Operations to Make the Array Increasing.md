[Leetcode 1827. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1827)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` (0-indexed), you are required to make the array strictly increasing. An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` for every `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `nums` strictly increasing.

In one operation, you can increment an element of the array by 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input size constraints**: What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
   - The length of the array can be up to `10^4`.
   
2. **Element value constraints**: What are the possible value ranges for the elements in `nums`?
   - Elements of the array can be in the range `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.
   
3. **Output requirements**: Do we need to return anything specific other than the minimum number of operations?
   - Just return the minimum number of operations required.

### Strategy
1. Traverse through the array starting from the second element.
2. For each element, check if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element (i.e., `nums[i] <= nums[i-1]`).
3. If so, calculate the difference and increment the current element to `nums[i-1] + 1`. This will ensure the array remains strictly increasing.
4. Count the number of operations needed to make all necessary increments.
5. Continue the process for all elements in the array.
6. Return the total count of operations.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                // The number of increments needed
                int increment = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
                nums[i] += increment;
                operations += increment;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are modifying the array in place and using only a constant amount of extra space.
