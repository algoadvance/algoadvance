[Leetcode 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l744)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of sorted characters `letters` containing only lowercase letters, and a target letter `target`, find the smallest element in the list that is greater than the given target.

Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is `z` and `letters` contains letters from `a` to `c`, the answer is `a`.

You can assume:
- `letters` has at least two characters.
- `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `letters` contains only lowercase English letters from `a` to `z`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Is the input list guaranteed to be non-empty and sorted?**
   - A: Yes, the input list `letters` is guaranteed to be non-decreasingly sorted and contains at least two characters.
   
2. **Q: Are there any constraints on the length of the list?**
   - A: No specific constraints are mentioned, but typical constraints are the size fitting within typical memory and execution time limits.
   
3. **Q: Can `letters` contain duplicate characters?**
   - A: Yes, `letters` can contain duplicate characters.

4. **Q: What should be returned if there is no character in the list greater than the target?**
   - A: Since the list wraps around, we will return the smallest character in this case.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a Binary Search algorithm due to the sorted nature of the `letters` list. The steps will be:
1. Use a binary search to find the smallest character greater than `target`.
2. If no such character is found within the range, return the first character of the list (due to the wrap-around property).

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

char nextGreatestLetter(std::vector<char>& letters, char target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = letters.size() - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (letters[mid] <= target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    // Element at 'left' is the smallest element greater than target,
    // or the element is wrap around the list
    return letters[left % letters.size()];
}

int main() {
    std::vector<char> letters = {'c', 'f', 'j'};
    char target = 'd';
    std::cout << "The smallest letter greater than " << target << " is " << nextGreatestLetter(letters, target) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(log n)** due to the binary search mechanism. 

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
