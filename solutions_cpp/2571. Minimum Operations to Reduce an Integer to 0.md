[Leetcode 2571. Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2571)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2571: Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0

Given an integer `n`, your task is to reduce it to zero using the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can:
1. Subtract 1 from the integer,
2. Divide the integer by 2 (if it is even),
3. Divide the integer by 3 (if it is divisible by 3).

Return the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the integer `n` to 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`:** What is the range of the integer `n`?
    - Assume `n` is a positive integer within the range from `1` to `10^5`.

2. **Operations Explanation:** Can I combine operations in a single step?
   - No, each operation is a discrete step.

### Strategy

Given the nature of the operations allowed, this problem can be effectively tackled using a breadth-first search (BFS) which explores the minimum path through the state space from `n` to 0.

1. **BFS Explanation:** 
    - We will use BFS because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which in this case represents the number of operations needed to reach 0.

2. **Queue Initialization:** Start with a queue initialized with the pair `(n, 0)` where `n` is the current value and `0` is the initial depth (number of operations).
   
3. **Visited Set:** Use a set to keep track of visited states to prevent redundant work.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int minimumOperations(int n) {
    // Queue to store the current state and the operations count
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    unordered_set<int> visited;
    
    // Initialize the queue with the starting integer 'n' and depth '0'
    q.push({n, 0});
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, steps] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // If we reach 0, return the number of steps
        if (current == 0) {
            return steps;
        }
        
        // If the current state has been visited, continue to the next
        if (visited.find(current) != visited.end()) {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Mark the current state as visited
        visited.insert(current);
        
        // Perform the allowed operations
        // Subtract 1
        if (current - 1 >= 0) {
            q.push({current - 1, steps + 1});
        }
        
        // Divide by 2 if even
        if (current % 2 == 0 && current / 2 >= 0) {
            q.push({current / 2, steps + 1});
        }
        
        // Divide by 3 if divisible by 3
        if (current % 3 == 0 && current / 3 >= 0) {
            q.push({current / 3, steps + 1});
        }
    }
    
    // If n is within the expected range and valid input, 
    // we should never reach here.
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Minimum operations to reduce " << n << " to 0: " << minimumOperations(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this BFS approach is O(n) in the worst case since the queue may grow linearly if we have to subtract by 1 each time, though practically it's often faster because of division operations, reducing the number of steps quickly:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the queue and visited set storage.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum number of operations to reduce the input integer `n` to 0.
