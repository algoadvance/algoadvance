[Leetcode 2546. Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2546)
### Problem Statement
You are given two binary strings `s` and `target`, of the same length. You can do the following operation on `s` any number of times:

- Choose two indices `i` and `j` that are initially unequal and then set `s[i]` to `s[j]` and `s[j]` to `s[i]`.

Return `true` if you can make the string `s` equal to the string `target`, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the ranges for the lengths of `s` and `target`?
   - Typical constraints include `1 ≤ s.length, target.length ≤ 1000`.

2. **Initial Conditions**: Are `s` and `target` of the same length always?
   - Yes, both strings are always of the same length.

3. **Valid Characters**: Are the only valid characters in `s` and `target` '0' and '1'?
   - Yes, since they are binary strings.

4. **Operations Definition**: Can the swap operation change the bit positions irreversibly?
   - Yes, you can swap any two bits any number of times.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

bool canBeEqual(std::string s, std::string target) {
    // If strings are already equal
    if (s == target) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Count zeros and ones in both s and target
    int countS0 = std::count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0');
    int countS1 = s.length() - countS0; // Since s is binary, total length - countS0 gives countS1
    
    int countT0 = std::count(target.begin(), target.end(), '0');
    int countT1 = target.length() - countT0; // Similarly for target
    
    // Compare counts
    return (countS0 == countT0) && (countS1 == countT1);
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "1100";
    std::string target = "1001";
    
    bool result = canBeEqual(s, target);
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << result << std::endl; // Output: true
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initial Check**: If `s` and `target` are already equal, simply return `true`.
2. **Counting Bits**: Since the problem only allows swaps and both strings are binary, we can count the number of '0's and '1's in both strings.
3. **Compare Counts**: If the counts of '0's and '1's match for both strings, then it is possible to transform `s` into `target` by swapping bits around. Otherwise, it is not possible.
4. **Return Result**: If the counts match, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the strings. The primary operations are counting '0's and '1's, each of which runs in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space used, as we are only storing count variables and a few constants.

By utilizing counting and leveraging the constraints of binary strings, we efficiently determine whether the transformation is possible within linear time.
