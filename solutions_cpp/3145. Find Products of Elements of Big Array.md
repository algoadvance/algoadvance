[Leetcode 3145. Find Products of Elements of Big Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3145)
## Problem Statement

You are given a big array `arr` and a small array of indices `indices`. For each index in the `indices`, you need to calculate the product of all elements in the `arr` except for the element at that index. The goal is to return a new array where each element is the product of elements of `arr` except the one at the corresponding index.

**Example:**
```cpp
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
indices = [1, 3]
```
For this example, the output should be:
- At index 1 (0-based): Product of elements except arr[1] => 1 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 60
- At index 3 (0-based): Product of elements except arr[3] => 1 * 2 * 3 * 5 = 30

Hence, the result is `[60, 30]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Properties:**
   - Are the elements in `arr` always non-zero?
   - How large can the arrays be?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if an index in the `indices` array is out of range for the `arr`?
   - Are duplicate indices in `indices` allowed?

3. **Output:**
   - Should the result array have the same length as `indices`?

## Strategy

1. **Initial Calculation:** 
   - Calculate the total product of all elements in `arr`.
   
2. **Zero Handling:**
   - Have a counter for zeros, since if there are more than one zeros in `arr`, the product for any index will be zero.

3. **Iterate over `indices`:**
   - If no zeros in `arr`, divide the total product by `arr[indices[i]]`.
   - If one zero in `arr`, and the current index points to the zero, the product for that index will be the product of the remaining elements, otherwise it will be zero.

4. **Edge Case:**
   - Handle cases where indices may be out of the bounds of `arr` if such a condition is possible.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the size of `arr` and `m` is the number of elements in the `indices` array. Calculating the total product is `O(n)` and processing each index in `indices` is `O(1)` resulting in `O(n + m)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<long long> productExceptIndex(const std::vector<int>& arr, const std::vector<int>& indices) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int m = indices.size();
    
    std::vector<long long> result(m, 0);
    long long totalProduct = 1;
    int zeroCount = 0;
    
    // calculate total product and count zeros
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (num == 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        } else {
            totalProduct *= num;
        }
    }
    
    // handle case with zeros
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int index = indices[i];
        
        // Out of range index
        if (index < 0 || index >= n) {
            result[i] = 0;
            continue;
        }
        
        if (zeroCount == 0) {
            result[i] = totalProduct / arr[index];
        } else if (zeroCount == 1) {
            if (arr[index] == 0) {
                long long productWithoutZero = totalProduct;
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (arr[j] != 0) {
                        productWithoutZero *= arr[j];
                    }
                }
                result[i] = productWithoutZero;
            } else {
                result[i] = 0;
            }
        } else {
            result[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> indices = {1, 3};
    std::vector<long long> result = productExceptIndex(arr, indices);
    
    for (auto num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This solution takes into account the multiple cases of having zeros in the array and processes the products accordingly.
