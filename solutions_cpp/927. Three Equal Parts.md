[Leetcode 927. Three Equal Parts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l927)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` of size `n` containing only `0`s and `1`s. We want to split the array into three non-empty parts (`left`, `mid`, `right`) such that all three parts represent the same binary value with no leading zeros. If it is possible, return any `[i, j]` where `left` is the part of `arr` from the start to `i`, `mid` is the part of `arr` from `i + 1` to `j`, and `right` is the part of `arr` from `j + 1` to the end of `arr`. If it is not possible, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we return if `arr` cannot be split into three equal parts?
   - **A:** Return `[-1, -1]`.

2. **Q:** Can the sizes of the parts `left`, `mid`, and `right` be different?
   - **A:** Yes, they can be different, but they must all represent the same binary number.

3. **Q:** Should we consider leading zeros for the binary values?
   - **A:** No, the binary values should not have leading zeros, i.e., each part's binary value should be represented without leading zeros.

### Strategy

1. **Count the Number of 1's:** First, we should count the number of `1`s in the array. If this count is not a multiple of three, it’s impossible to split the array as required.

2. **Identify Target Sum:** If it is possible to partition them, each part must contain `target` number of `1`s where `target = total number of 1's / 3`.

3. **Find Partition Points:** Identify the indices where such partitions can occur:
   - Use three pointers to track potential start positions for the parts containing equal numbers of `1`s.
   - Track the first occurrence of the 1st, (target + 1)th and (2 * target + 1)th 1’s to mark the starting point of each segment.

4. **Validate Identical Parts:** Compare the binary values segment by segment to ensure they are equal.

### Code

Below is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

vector<int> threeEqualParts(vector<int>& arr) {
    int numOnes = 0;
    for (int num : arr) {
        numOnes += num;
    }

    if (numOnes == 0) {
        return {0, 2};
    }

    if (numOnes % 3 != 0) {
        return {-1, -1};
    }

    int target = numOnes / 3;
    int k = 0;
    int first = -1, second = -1, third = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            if (k == 0) first = i;
            else if (k == target) second = i;
            else if (k == 2 * target) third = i;
            k++;
        }
    }

    int len = arr.size() - third;
    if ((first + len <= second) && (second + len <= third)) {
        int i = 0;
        while (third + i < arr.size()) {
            if (arr[first + i] != arr[second + i] || arr[first + i] != arr[third + i]) {
                return {-1, -1};
            }
            i++;
        }
        return {first + len - 1, second + len};
    }

    return {-1, -1};
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}; // Example input
    vector<int> result = threeEqualParts(arr);
    cout << "[" << result[0] << ", " << result[1] << "]" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution runs in O(n) time since we are making a couple of passes through the `arr` to count ones and find segment delimiters, and then validate segments.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The solution uses O(1) extra space, disregarding the input and output vectors.
