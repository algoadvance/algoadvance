[Leetcode 3175. Find The First Player to win K Games in a Row](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3175)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` representing the results of a series of games between two players, where `nums[i]` is the result of the i-th game (0-indexed). 
- If `nums[i] == 1`, it means Player 1 won the i-th game; 
- if `nums[i] == 2`, it means Player 2 won the i-th game.

Given an integer `k`, return the name of the first player to win `k` consecutive games. If no player wins `k` consecutive games, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should we return if the input array is empty or if `k` is greater than the number of games played?
   - We should directly return an empty string in these cases.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the `nums` array or the value of `k`?
   - We will assume typical constraints for this type of problem (e.g., length of `nums` up to 10^5, and 1 <= k <= length of the array).
3. What if `k` is less than or equal to 0?
   - We will treat a non-positive `k` as invalid input and return an empty string.

## Strategy

1. We will loop through the `nums` array and keep count of consecutive wins for each player.
2. If at any point the count for a player reaches `k`, we will return the name of that player ("Player 1" or "Player 2").
3. If the loop completes and no player has `k` consecutive wins, we will return an empty string.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array since we are processing each element in the array exactly once.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string findFirstPlayerToWinKGames(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (nums.empty() || k <= 0) return "";

    int countP1 = 0, countP2 = 0;

    for (int result : nums) {
        if (result == 1) {
            countP1++;
            countP2 = 0;
        } else if (result == 2) {
            countP2++;
            countP1 = 0;
        } else {
            countP1 = countP2 = 0; // In case of invalid input
        }

        if (countP1 == k) return "Player 1";
        if (countP2 == k) return "Player 2";
    }

    return "";
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1};
    int k = 3;
    std::string result = findFirstPlayerToWinKGames(nums, k);
    std::cout << "First player to win " << k << " consecutive games: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- We first check for edge cases where the input array is empty or `k` is less than or equal to zero and return an empty string.
- We iterate through the `nums` array, maintaining counters for the consecutive wins of each player.
- If one of the counters reaches `k`, we immediately return the respective player's name.
- If the loop completes without either counter reaching `k`, we return an empty string.

This solution ensures we find the first player to achieve `k` consecutive wins efficiently with O(n) time complexity.
