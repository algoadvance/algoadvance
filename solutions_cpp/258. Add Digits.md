[Leetcode 258. Add Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l258)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

### Example
```
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is as follows: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of input value for `num`?
   - **A:** The input integer `num` can range from 0 to 2^31 - 1.

2. **Q:** Can the input number be negative?
   - **A:** According to the problem description, `num` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Q:** Do we need to handle very large numbers efficiently?
   - **A:** Yes, even for very large numbers the solution should be efficient.

### Strategy
A straightforward strategy involves repeatedly summing the digits of the number until a single digit remains. However, there is a well-known mathematical shortcut for this problem using properties of numbers and modular arithmetic (digital root problem). 

The digital root can be directly calculated using:
- If `num == 0`, then it returns 0.
- If `num % 9 == 0` and `num != 0`, then it returns 9.
- Else, it returns `num % 9`.

This is based on the property that any number modulo 9 yields the same result as the sum of its digits modulo 9.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 0;
        if (num % 9 == 0) return 9;
        return num % 9;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int num = 38;
    cout << "The result of adding digits for " << num << " is: " << solution.addDigits(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Condition for Zero:** If `num` is `0`, then we immediately return `0`.
2. **Modulo Condition:** If `num` is divisible by `9`, the result should be `9` (except when `num` is `0`).
3. **Direct Modulo:** If none of the above conditions hold, return `num % 9`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)`. The reason is that we are using a direct formula to compute the result, which involves constant-time operations. Thus, this method is very efficient and scalable even for the upper bounds of input size constraints.
