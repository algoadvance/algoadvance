[Leetcode 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2125)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix `bank` of binary strings representing security devices in a bank. Each string contains only characters '0' and '1'. A '1' represents a security device, and a '0' represents no security device. The matrix represents the floor plan of the bank where each row is a different floor.

Security devices can send laser beams to each other as follows:
- Devices have one horizontal beam.
- A beam is formed between two devices if and only if they are in different rows and positioned in the columns without another device interrupting the beam's path.

Determine the number of laser beams that can be formed in the bank.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the rows independent of each other in terms of placing laser devices, or can beams cross multiple rows?
   **A:** Beams are only considered between devices in different rows and must not be interrupted by another device in between.

2. **Q:** Are the columns independent or do they need to be kept straight above each other?
   **A:** The columns in different rows can intersect only if there are no other devices interrupting the direct path in any intermediary rows.

### Strategy

1. Parse the `bank` matrix and count the number of devices (`'1'`) in each row.
2. Ignore rows that have no devices (`'0'`).
3. For rows with devices, tallying each device in one row with each device in the next row.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBeams(std::vector<std::string>& bank) {
        std::vector<int> deviceCounts;
        
        // Count devices in each row and add to deviceCounts if non-zero
        for (const std::string& row : bank) {
            int count = 0;
            for (char c : row) {
                if (c == '1') {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count > 0) {
                deviceCounts.push_back(count);
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate number of beams
        int numberOfBeams = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < deviceCounts.size() - 1; ++i) {
            numberOfBeams += deviceCounts[i] * deviceCounts[i + 1];
        }
        
        return numberOfBeams;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Parsing the Matrix:** O(N*M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns.
- **Counting Devices:** O(N), where N is the number of effective rows with at least one device.
- **Calculating Beams:** O(N), where N is the number of effective rows with at least one device.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N*M).

### Example

Consider the matrix:
```
["011001",
 "000000",
 "010100"]
```

- Device counts per row: `[3, 0, 2]`
- Number of beams: `3 (from row 1) * 2 (from row 3) = 6 beams total.`
