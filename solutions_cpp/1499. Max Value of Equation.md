[Leetcode 1499. Max Value of Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1499)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `points` containing points, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represent the coordinates of the `i-th` point on a 2D plane. The formula to maximize is:

\[ yi + yj + |xi - xj| \]

where `| xi - xj |` is the absolute difference between `xi` and `xj`. You need to find the maximum value of this equation for any pair of points \((i, j)\) with the constraint that \( xi < xj \).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: What is the maximum size of the points array?
   - **Assumption**: Typical size constraints apply, with maximum size up to 10^5 elements.

2. **Value range**: What are the possible ranges for the values of `xi` and `yi`?
   - **Assumption**: Values for both `xi` and `yi` can be large, typically in the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

3. **Order of [xi, yi] pairs**: Are the points naturally sorted by `xi`?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, the points array is sorted based on the `xi` coordinate.

4. **Output requirements**: What is the expected output?
   - **Assumption**: The output is a single integer representing the maximum value of the equation \( yi + yj + |xi - xj| \).

## Strategy

Given that \( xi < xj \), the absolute difference \( |xi - xj| \) simplifies to \( xj - xi \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[ yi + yj + (xj - xi) \]
\[ = (yi - xi) + (yj + xj) \]

To maximize this:
1. Iterate through the points while maintaining a data structure (like a max-heap or a monotonic deque) to keep track of the best possible value of \( yi - xi \) seen so far.
2. For each new point \( (xj, yj) \), compute the potential value \( (yj + xj) + \) the best value in the data structure.
3. Update the data structure with the current point's \( yi - xi \) as we examine each point.

Given `points` are sorted by `xi`, a deque can be used efficiently to maintain the values in a way that facilitates quick access to the maximum value.

## Code

Here's the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

int findMaxValueOfEquation(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
    int maxResult = INT_MIN;
    deque<pair<int, int>> deq; // stores pairs of (yi - xi, xi)
    
    for (const auto& point : points) {
        int xi = point[0];
        int yi = point[1];
        
        // Remove elements from deque that are out of range xi - xj > k
        while (!deq.empty() && (xi - deq.front().second) > k) {
            deq.pop_front();
        }
        
        // If the deque is not empty, we can update the result with current (xi, yi)
        if (!deq.empty()) {
            maxResult = max(maxResult, yi + xi + deq.front().first);
        }
        
        // Maintain the deque by removing values that are less than current (yi - xi)
        while (!deq.empty() && deq.back().first <= (yi - xi)) {
            deq.pop_back();
        }
        
        // Add current point to the deque
        deq.emplace_back(yi - xi, xi);
    }
    
    return maxResult;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> points = {{1,3},{2,0},{3,10},{4,5}};
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Max value of equation: " << findMaxValueOfEquation(points, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Deletion from Deque**: Each point is inserted and deleted exactly once from the deque, making this \(O(n)\).
- **Total Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of points. This is efficient given the constraints.
