[Leetcode 494. Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l494)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an expression out of nums by adding one of the symbols '+' and '-' before each integer in nums and then concatenate all the integers.

- For example, if nums = [2, 1], you can add a '+' before 2 and a '-' before 1 and concatenate them to build the expression "+2-1".

Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to target.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 20
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
- 0 <= sum(nums[i]) <= 1000
- -1000 <= target <= 1000


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on memory usage?**
   - No, typical constraints for a problem of this nature apply.

2. **Will the arrays always be non-empty?**
   - Yes, `nums.length` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

3. **Can `nums` contain zeros?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain zeros.

## Strategy

The problem is essentially to find the number of ways to assign `+` and `-` signs to the elements of the array so that their sum equals the target. This is a variation of the subset sum problem and can be approached using dynamic programming.

Hereâ€™s a concise step-by-step plan:

1. **Transformation**: Convert the problem into a subset sum problem.
   - Let `P` be the subset of elements that are given the `+` sign.
   - Let `N` be the subset of elements that are given the `-` sign.
   - We need to find subsets such that `sum(P) - sum(N) = target`.

   Rearranging, we get:

   `sum(P) = (target + sum(nums)) / 2`

   This essentially transforms the problem into finding a subset with a sum of `(target + sum(nums)) / 2`.

2. **Check Feasibility**: 
   - If `(target + sum(nums))` is odd, return 0 since it's not possible to partition the sum into integers.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Define a dp array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve sum `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 since there is one way to achieve the sum 0: use no elements.
   - Iterate over the elements in `nums` and update the `dp` array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int sum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        
        // If target + sum is not even, return 0 because (sumP) will not be an integer
        if ((sum + target) % 2 != 0) return 0;
        
        int subsetSum = (sum + target) / 2;

        if(subsetSum < 0) return 0; // Negative subset sum is not feasible

        std::vector<int> dp(subsetSum + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // There's one way to get to sum 0: pick nothing
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int j = subsetSum; j >= num; --j) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - num];
            }
        }

        return dp[subsetSum];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * subsetSum)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, and `subsetSum` is `(sum + target) / 2`.
- The space complexity is `O(subsetSum)` due to the dp array.
