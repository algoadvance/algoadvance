## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1061: Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String

Given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2`, and a string `baseStr`, the strings `s1` and `s2` are "equivalent". For example, if `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "cde"`, then we can consider `a ≡ c`, `b ≡ d`, and `c ≡ e`. The equivalence relation is transitive, i.e., if `a ≡ c` and `c ≡ e`, then `a ≡ e`.

Our goal is to generate the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr` by using the equivalence information from `s1` and `s2`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input strings `s1` and `s2` contain other characters apart from lowercase English alphabets?
   - No, all strings `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` are composed of lowercase English alphabets.

2. Will the strings `s1` and `s2` always be of the same length?
   - Yes, `s1` and `s2` have the same length.

3. What is the maximum possible length of the strings?
   - The maximum length for `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` is `1000`.

## Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** We'll use this to manage the equivalences.
   
   - **Union Operation** will connect two characters (`a` and `b`) indicating `a ≡ b`.
   - **Find Operation** will help determine the smallest equivalent character in the equivalence class.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Create a parent array where `parent[i]` initially points to `i` itself for every character `i`.

3. **Processing Equivalences:** 
   - For each pair `(s1[i], s2[i])`, union their corresponding equivalence classes.
   
4. **Generating Result:**
   - For each character in `baseStr`, find its lexicographically smallest equivalent character using the `find` operation, and construct the result string.

5. **Time Complexity:** The union-find operations are almost constant time (amortized) if implemented with path compression and union by rank.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string smallestEquivalentString(string s1, string s2, string baseStr) {
        vector<int> parent(26);
        
        // Initialize the parent array
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        
        // Helper functions for union-find
        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // path compression
            }
            return parent[x];
        }
        
        void unionSets(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                // Union by lexicographically smaller
                if (rootX < rootY) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int n = s1.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            unionSets(s1[i] - 'a', s2[i] - 'a');
        }
        
        // Constructing the result string
        string result;
        for (char c : baseStr) {
            result += (char)(find(c - 'a') + 'a');
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser";
    cout << solution.smallestEquivalentString(s1, s2, baseStr) << endl; // Output: "makkek"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of the parent array:** O(26) ≈ O(1)
- **Union operations:** O(n * α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, very close to O(1).
- **Construction of result string:** O(m), where m is the length of `baseStr`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m) ≈ O(n) since n, m ≤ 1000.

The space complexity is O(26) for the parent array, which is constant space, O(1).

This solution efficiently computes the lexicographically smallest equivalent string using union-find with path compression and union by rank.
