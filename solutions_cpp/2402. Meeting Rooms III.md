[Leetcode 2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2402)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of meeting intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` as well as an integer `n` representing the number of meeting rooms. Some meetings must be held in different rooms, and no two meetings can be held in the same room at the same time. If a meeting ends at time `t`, it can start at time `t`. Return the minimum number of rooms you should allocate to schedule all the meetings.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed to coding, let's clarify any potential ambiguities in the problem statement:
1. **Meeting Duration**: Is it guaranteed that `start_i <= end_i` for all intervals? (This generally would be true based on the problem context.)
2. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of `intervals` and values within `intervals`? This will ensure our solution approach is optimal.
3. **Exact Inputs**: Are there any specific edge cases we need to consider, such as empty arrays or nested intervals?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the start and end times of the meetings:
1. **Sort Events**: We separate out the start and end times of the meetings and sort them.
2. **Sweep Line Technique**: We use a sweeping line technique to count the number of ongoing meetings at any point in time. We will:
   - Use two pointers to traverse through the sorted start and end times.
   - Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of ongoing meetings.
   - Increment the counter for each start time we encounter and decrement it for each end time.
   - Keep track of the maximum counter value during the traversal.

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity is determined by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of meetings.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    if (intervals.empty()) return 0;

    // Separate out start and end times
    vector<int> starts, ends;
    for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
        starts.push_back(interval[0]);
        ends.push_back(interval[1]);
    }

    // Sort the start and end times
    sort(starts.begin(), starts.end());
    sort(ends.begin(), ends.end());

    // Two pointers to traverse the start and end times
    int numRooms = 0, maxRooms = 0;
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    int n = starts.size();
    
    // Traverse the events
    while (i < n) {
        // If meeting starts before the current meeting ends
        if (starts[i] < ends[j]) {
            numRooms++;
            i++;
        } else {
            numRooms--;
            j++;
        }
        maxRooms = max(maxRooms, numRooms);
    }

    return maxRooms;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Separating and Sorting**: Start by separating start and end times into two separate vectors and sort them.
2. **Traversing with Two Pointers**: Use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to traverse through sorted start and end times.
3. **Counting Rooms**: If the current start time is less than the current end time, it means a new meeting starts before the current one ends, requiring an additional room. Otherwise, decrement the room count when a meeting ends.
4. **Tracking Maximum Rooms**: Continuously update `maxRooms` during traversal to find the maximum number of rooms required at any time.

This approach effectively utilizes the sweeping line algorithm by leveraging two-pointer technique to manage the room allocation efficiently.
