[Leetcode 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1052)
## Problem Statement

There is a bookstore owner who has a `customer` array representing the number of customers visiting the store at each time segment and a `grumpy` array representing whether the owner is grumpy (1) or not (0) at each time segment. When the owner is not grumpy, customers are satisfied. However, when grumpy, customers are dissatisfied.

The owner has a technique to suppress their grumpy mood for `X` consecutive minutes (time segments), during which all customers in that segment become satisfied even if the owner is initially grumpy.

Given the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays of the same length and an integer `X`, your goal is to maximize the number of satisfied customers by choosing the best time segment to suppress grumpiness for `X` minutes.

### Input:
- `customers` array: integer array where `customers[i]` is the number of customers at the `i`-th minute.
- `grumpy` array: integer array where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the owner is grumpy at the `i`-th minute, and `0` otherwise.
- `X`: integer representing the number of consecutive minutes the owner can suppress grumpiness.

### Output:
- Integer: the maximum number of satisfied customers that can be achieved.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - What is the length of the arrays? Can it be very large?
   - Can `X` be larger than the length of the arrays?
   - Are all elements in the arrays non-negative integers?
   - How should we handle cases where there are no grumpy minutes?

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int X) {
    int n = customers.size();
    int totalSatisfied = 0;

    // Calculate initial total satisfied customers when shop owner is not grumpy
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
            totalSatisfied += customers[i];
        }
    }

    // Calculate the additional satisfied customers we can achieve by suppressing grumpiness for X minutes
    int additionalSatisfied = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < X; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
            additionalSatisfied += customers[i];
        }
    }

    int maxAdditionalSatisfied = additionalSatisfied;

    // Slide the X-minute window across the entire period
    for (int i = X; i < n; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
            additionalSatisfied += customers[i];
        }
        if (grumpy[i - X] == 1) {
            additionalSatisfied -= customers[i - X];
        }
        maxAdditionalSatisfied = max(maxAdditionalSatisfied, additionalSatisfied);
    }

    return totalSatisfied + maxAdditionalSatisfied;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> customers = {1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5};
    vector<int> grumpy = {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1};
    int X = 3;

    cout << "Maximum Satisfied Customers: " << maxSatisfied(customers, grumpy, X) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initial Satisfied Customers Calculation:**
   - First, compute the total number of satisfied customers without considering any suppression of grumpiness using the `grumpy` array.

2. **Sliding Window for Additional Satisfied Customers:**
   - Use a sliding window approach with the size of `X` to find the maximum number of additional satisfied customers by suppressing grumpiness.

3. **Window Creation:**
   - Create an initial window covering the first `X` time segments and calculate the total additional satisfied customers during that window.

4. **Sliding the Window:**
   - Slide the window one segment at a time to the right and update the additional customers' count by considering the new element entering the window and the one leaving it.
   - Keep track of the maximum additional satisfied customers during any window.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - Add the maximum additional satisfied customers from the sliding window to the initial satisfied customers to get the final result.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `customers` array. The sliding window approach ensures that each element is considered a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently finds the optimal solution by leveraging the sliding window technique, ensuring that we achieve the best possible customer satisfaction outcome.
