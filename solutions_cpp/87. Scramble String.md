[Leetcode 87. Scramble String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l87)
## Problem Statement

We are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length. We want to determine if `s2` is a scrambled version of `s1`.

A scrambled string is defined recursively as follows:
1. If a string can be created by swapping the two non-empty substrings of some string.
2. Given a string `s`, we may choose any non-leaf nodes and swap its two children.

Formally, `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1` if we can split `s1` into two parts `X` and `Y`, and `s2` can be obtained from `s1` by recursively swapping `X` and `Y`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of strings `s1` and `s2`?**
    - This helps us to understand the constraints and optimize our approach.

2. **Are both input strings guaranteed to be of the same length?**
    - Essential for pre-condition checks.

3. **Can we assume that the input will only have valid strings with alphabetical characters?**
    - Ensures we are handling only specific character sets.

4. **Are both strings case-sensitive?**
    - Determines if we need to consider case differences in our comparisons.

## Strategy

1. **Base Case Comparison:**
   - If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then they are scrambled strings.
   - If lengths of `s1` and `s2` are not equal or their sorted versions are not equal, then `s2` cannot be a scrambled string of `s1`.

2. **Recursive Division:**
   - Divide both strings into two non-empty parts in all possible ways.
   - Recursively check the two conditions:
        a. Direct match of parts: `X1` matches `X2` and `Y1` matches `Y2`.
        b. Cross match of parts: `X1` matches `Y2` and `Y1` matches `X2`.

3. **Memoization:**
   - Use a 3D memoization table to store results for substrings of `s1` and `s2` to avoid redundant computations.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isScramble(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
        int n = s1.size();
        if (n != s2.size()) return false;
        if (s1 == s2) return true;
        
        if (!isAnagram(s1, s2)) return false;

        std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> memo(n, 
                                        std::vector<std::vector<int>>(n, 
                                        std::vector<int>(n+1, -1)));
        return isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, 0, 0, n, memo);
    }

private:
    bool isAnagram(const std::string &s1, const std::string &s2) {
        std::string sorted_s1 = s1;
        std::string sorted_s2 = s2;
        std::sort(sorted_s1.begin(), sorted_s1.end());
        std::sort(sorted_s2.begin(), sorted_s2.end());
        return sorted_s1 == sorted_s2;
    }

    bool isScrambleHelper(const std::string &s1, const std::string &s2, 
                          int i1, int i2, int length, 
                          std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> &memo) {
        if (memo[i1][i2][length] != -1) {
            return memo[i1][i2][length];
        }

        if (s1.substr(i1, length) == s2.substr(i2, length)) {
            memo[i1][i2][length] = 1;
            return true;
        }

        if (!isAnagram(s1.substr(i1, length), s2.substr(i2, length))) {
            memo[i1][i2][length] = 0;
            return false;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < length; ++i) {
            if ((isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i1, i2, i, memo) && 
                 isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i1 + i, i2 + i, length - i, memo)) ||
                (isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i1, i2 + length - i, i, memo) &&
                 isScrambleHelper(s1, s2, i1 + i, i2, length - i, memo))) {
                memo[i1][i2][length] = 1;
                return true;
            }
        }

        memo[i1][i2][length] = 0;
        return false;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string s1 = "great";
    std::string s2 = "rgeat";
    std::cout << (sol.isScramble(s1, s2) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this approach is `O(n^4)`. This is due to the recursive checks combined with the number of substrings and their comparisons. The memoization helps reduce redundant work significantly, but the worst-case scenario still involves a large number of checks.
- Space complexity is `O(n^3)` for storing results in the memoization table.
