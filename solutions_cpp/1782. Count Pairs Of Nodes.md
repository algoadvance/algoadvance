[Leetcode 1782. Count Pairs Of Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1782)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by  `n` nodes and multilabel edges. Your task is to count pairs of nodes that have at least one common neighboring node. Formally, given `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n` and some edges, count the number of pairs `(u, v)` (where `u < v`) such that there exists at least one node `w` which is adjacent to both `u` and `v`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - `n`: the number of nodes.
   - `edges`: a 2D list where each element is a pair `[u, v]` indicating an edge between node `u` and node `v`.

2. **Output Format:**
   - Return the count of pairs of nodes `(u, v)` that have at least one common neighboring node.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The graph is undirected.
   - Node indices are 1-based.
   - The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops.
   - `1 <= n <= 1000`
   - `0 <= edges.length <= 10^4`

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   
2. **Common Neighbors Calculation:**
   - For each node, determine its neighbors and store them.
   - For each possible node pair `(u, v)`, use their neighbor lists to check if there is any common neighbor.

3. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Use a set or hash map to efficiently check for common neighbors.
   
4. **Optimization:**
   - Since edge count could reach up to `10^4`, ensure that neighbor lookups and common checks are efficient.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>

int countPairs(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges) {
    // Create adjacency list
    std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_set<int>> adjList;
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
        adjList[u].insert(v);
        adjList[v].insert(u);
    }

    int count = 0;

    // Iterate over all pairs (u, v) with u < v
    for (int u = 1; u <= n; ++u) {
        for (int v = u + 1; v <= n; ++v) {
            // Check if there is a common neighbor w
            bool hasCommonNeighbor = false;
            for (int w : adjList[u]) {
                if (adjList[v].find(w) != adjList[v].end()) {
                    hasCommonNeighbor = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (hasCommonNeighbor) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Adjacency List Creation:** `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
2. **Counting Pairs:**
    - The nested loops over nodes ensure `O(n^2)`.
    - For each pair `(u, v)`, we perform a check for common neighbors.
    - The check requires iterating over neighbors of `u` and checking their presence in `v`'s neighbors, leading to `O(D)`, where `D` is the average degree of nodes.
   Thus the total complexity for counting pairs is `O(n^2 * D)`.

Given the constraints, this approach should work efficiently within the limits.
