[Leetcode 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l882)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph (you can think of it as bidirectional for our purposes) with `n` nodes. Each edge in the graph can be subdivided into a given number of new nodes. The task is to determine the maximum number of reachable nodes starting from node `0`.

Let's define it more formally: 

- You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes.
- You are given an array `edges` where each element is a list `[u, v, cnt]` representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v`, which can be subdivided into `cnt` new nodes. That is, the edge `u-v` can have `cnt` new intermediate nodes.
- An integer `maxMoves` which indicates how many edges you can move at most.

The goal is to return the maximum number of nodes that can be reached from node `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - No, the graph can be disconnected.

2. **What does reaching a node mean in this context?**
   - Reaching a node means that it can be accessed from node `0` within the limit of `maxMoves`.

3. **Can `maxMoves` be zero or negative?**
   - `maxMoves` can be zero, but it cannot be negative since it represents a number of moves.

4. **Is it necessary to use every move optimally?**
   - The goal is to maximize the number of reachable nodes, not necessarily to use all moves.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is the classic shortest-path algorithm for graphs with non-negative weights. Given each edge can be divided into `cnt` nodes, we treat the new nodes as being placed between each pair of original nodes.

Steps:
1. **Representation of Subdivided Nodes:** Consider each edge `[u, v, cnt]` to be expanded with intermediate nodes. This will increase the complexity of the algorithm, but we use a priority queue to handle the shortest paths efficiently.
2. **Use of Priority Queue:** A priority queue (or min-heap) helps in always expanding the least cost edge first.
3. **Tracking Moves:** Keep track of remaining moves from the starting node to decide when to push the next node into the priority queue.
4. **Edge Relaxation:** As standard in Dijkstra's algorithm, check if a shorter path to a node is found and update the path cost accordingly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

int reachableNodes(vector<vector<int>>& edges, int maxMoves, int n) {
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], cnt = edge[2];
        graph[u].emplace_back(v, cnt + 1);
        graph[v].emplace_back(u, cnt + 1);
    }

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
    pq.emplace(0, 0);
    vector<int> dist(n, INT_MAX);
    dist[0] = 0;
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> used;

    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [currDist, u] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (currDist > dist[u]) continue;

        for (const auto& [v, cost] : graph[u]) {
            int vCost = currDist + cost;
            if (vCost <= maxMoves) {
                if (vCost < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = vCost;
                    pq.emplace(vCost, v);
                }
                used[u][v] = min(cost - 1, maxMoves - currDist);
            } else {
                used[u][v] = min(cost - 1, maxMoves - currDist);
            }
        }
    }

    int result = 0;
    for (int d : dist) {
        if (d <= maxMoves) result++;
    }

    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], cnt = edge[2];
        int usedUtoV = used[u][v], usedVtoU = used[v][u];
        result += min(cnt, usedUtoV + usedVtoU);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Priority Queue Operations:** Each node is pushed into and popped from the priority queue, hence the time complexity is \(O((n + e)\log n)\) where \(e\) is the number of edges.
- **Edge Relaxation:** Each edge is relaxed at most once with \(O(e)\) operations.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O((n + e)\log n)\).

### Space Complexity

- We use a priority queue of size \(O(n)\).
- We also store distances of each node, hence \(O(n)\) space.
- Additionally, we store the used edges information which can take up to \(O(e)\) space.

Hence, the overall space complexity is \(O(n + e)\).
