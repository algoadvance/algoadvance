## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2043: Simple Bank System

You have been tasked with creating a simple bank system that can manage the bank accounts of its customers. The system supports the following operations:

1. **Initialize the bank system** with an array of integers representing the initial balance of each bank account.
2. **Transfer** money from one account to another if possible.
3. **Deposit** money into a specific account.
4. **Withdraw** money from a specific account if possible.

You need to implement the following functions:

- `Bank(vector<long long>& balance)`: Initializes the object with a balance vector.
- `bool transfer(int account1, int account2, long long money)`: Transfers money from `account1` to `account2`. Return `true` if the transfer is successful, `false` otherwise.
- `bool deposit(int account, long long money)`: Deposits the specified `money` into the `account`. Return `true`.
- `bool withdraw(int account, long long money)`: Withdraws the specified `money` from the `account` if possible. Returns `true` if the transaction is successful, `false` otherwise.

References:
- An account number is 1-indexed, meaning the first account is 1, the second is 2, and so on.
- Ensure efficient and accurate operations to handle multiple accounts and large transactions.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Account Numbers & Indexing**: The account numbers provided in the operations are 1-indexed, correct?
   - **Yes, account numbers are 1-indexed.**
2. **Initial Balances**: Is there any constraint or range on the values of initial balances?
   - **No specific constraints were mentioned, but typically it could be large given the use of `long long`.**
3. **Edge Cases**: Should the solution handle the case where account numbers are out of bound?
   - **Yes, transactions should return `false` if the account numbers are out of bound.**
4. **Concurrency**: Do I need to handle concurrency or multi-threading operations?
   - **No, this problem assumes operations are done in a single-threaded environment.**

## Strategy

1. **Data Storage**: Use a vector to store the balance of each account.
2. **Account Validation**: Before performing any operation, validate the account numbers to ensure they are within bounds.
3. **Transfer Operation**: 
    - Check if both accounts are valid.
    - Ensure there is enough balance in `account1`.
    - Perform the transfer if all checks pass.
4. **Deposit Operation**: Validate the account and add the money to the specific account.
5. **Withdraw Operation**: Validate the account, check if sufficient funds are available, and withdraw the specified amount if possible.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Bank {
private:
    vector<long long> balance;

    bool isValidAccount(int account) {
        return account >= 1 && account <= balance.size();
    }

public:
    Bank(vector<long long>& balance) : balance(balance) {}

    bool transfer(int account1, int account2, long long money) {
        if (!isValidAccount(account1) || !isValidAccount(account2)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (balance[account1 - 1] < money) {
            return false;
        }
        balance[account1 - 1] -= money;
        balance[account2 - 1] += money;
        return true;
    }

    bool deposit(int account, long long money) {
        if (!isValidAccount(account)) {
            return false;
        }
        balance[account - 1] += money;
        return true;
    }

    bool withdraw(int account, long long money) {
        if (!isValidAccount(account)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (balance[account - 1] < money) {
            return false;
        }
        balance[account - 1] -= money;
        return true;
    }
};
```
## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: O(n) where n is the number of accounts (length of `balance`).
2. **Transfer**: O(1) for constant-time validation and updates.
3. **Deposit**: O(1) for constant-time validation and update.
4. **Withdraw**: O(1) for constant-time validation and update.

The operations are efficiently handled in constant time except for the initialization phase which depends on the number of accounts.
