[Leetcode 1189. Maximum Number of Balloons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1189)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `text`, you want to use the characters of `text` to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible. You can only use each character in `text` once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the input string `text`? 
     - *The length can be up to 10^4.*
   
2. **Character Constraints:**
   - Can the input string `text` contain characters other than lowercase English letters?
     - *No, the input string will only contain lowercase English letters.*

3. **Output Expectations:**
   - Should the function return just the count, or do we need to print each instance as well?
     - *The function should return just the count of the maximum number of "balloon" instances.*

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Count:**
   - Count the frequency of each letter in the string.
   
2. **Check "balloon" Requirements:**
   - The word "balloon" consists of the characters: b, a, l, l, o, o, n.
   - From the frequency count:
     - One 'b'
     - One 'a'
     - Two 'l's
     - Two 'o's
     - One 'n'
     
3. **Determine the Maximum Instances:**
   - Using the frequency dictionary, determine the limiting character â€” the one which has the least occurrence compared to its required frequency.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int maxNumberOfBalloons(const std::string& text) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> char_count;
    
    // Count frequency of each character in the text
    for (char ch : text) {
        char_count[ch]++;
    }
    
    // Calculate the maximum number of "balloon"
    int b_count = char_count['b'];
    int a_count = char_count['a'];
    int l_count = char_count['l'] / 2;
    int o_count = char_count['o'] / 2;
    int n_count = char_count['n'];
    
    // Minimum of these counts will be the answer
    return std::min({b_count, a_count, l_count, o_count, n_count});
}

int main() {
    std::string text = "nlaebolko";
    std::cout << "Maximum number of 'balloon' instances: " << maxNumberOfBalloons(text) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we only need to traverse the string once to count the frequencies of the characters.

### Explanation
- Firstly, we traverse through the string and count the occurrence of each character using a hashmap (`unordered_map`).
- Then, we calculate how many times we can form the word "balloon" by considering the required frequency of each character.
- Finally, return the smallest count obtained, since that will be the limiting factor for forming the word "balloon".
