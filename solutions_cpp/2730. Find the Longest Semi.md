[Leetcode 2730. Find the Longest Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2730)
### Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, find and return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring.

A semi-repetitive substring is a substring that contains at most one contiguous pair of equal characters.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Can the string `s` contain non-alphabetic characters?
   - Are there any constraints on the characters within the string? For example, ASCII characters only?

2. **Output Definition**:
   - Should the output be the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if the input string is empty?
   - How to handle cases with very short strings, like a single-character string?

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the string and keep track of the longest "semi-repetitive" substring using two pointers. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Use two pointers, `start` and `end`.
2. **Count Contiguous Pairs**: Use a counter to keep track of contiguous pairs of equal characters.
3. **Expand Window**: Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and check the substring.
4. **Update Start Pointer**: If more than one contiguous pair is found, increment the `start` pointer until the condition is met.
5. **Track Maximum Length**: Keep track of the maximum length of valid substrings found.

### Code:

Here's an implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(const std::string &s) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    int maxLength = 0;
    int start = 0;
    int countPairs = 0;

    for (int end = 0; end < n; ++end) {
        // Check if current character forms a contiguous pair with the previous one
        if (end > 0 && s[end] == s[end - 1]) {
            countPairs++;
        }
        
        // If there are more than one contiguous pairs, move the start pointer
        while (countPairs > 1) {
            if (s[start] == s[start + 1]) {
                countPairs--;
            }
            start++;
        }
        
        maxLength = std::max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "915254";
    std::cout << "Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring Length: " << longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each character in the string is processed at most twice (one in the `for` loop and potentially again in the `while` loop).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently finds the longest semi-repetitive substring by leveraging the sliding window technique with two pointers.
