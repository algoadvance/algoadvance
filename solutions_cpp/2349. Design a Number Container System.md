[Leetcode 2349. Design a Number Container System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2349)
## Problem Statement

Design a number container system that can do the following:

1. **Insert or Replace** a number at the given index. 
   - `void change(int index, int number)`

2. **Find the Smallest Index** for the given number.
   - `int find(int number)`

You will be given multiple calls to these two functions. Implement the NumberContainerSystem class, which has the following methods:

```cpp
class NumberContainerSystem {
public:
    NumberContainerSystem();
    void change(int index, int number);
    int find(int number);
};
```

- `NumberContainerSystem` initializes the system.
- `void change(int index, int number)` changes the index to hold the given number if the index already had a number, it replaces the old number.
- `int find(int number)` returns the smallest index for the given number, or -1 if no index holds that number.


## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the size of the index range?
2. Can the same index be changed multiple times?
3. What is the expected range of numbers?
4. Should insertion and querying operations be optimal in terms of time complexity?

## Strategy

To efficiently manage and query the numbers:

1. Use a hashmap (unordered_map) to map each index to its corresponding number.
2. Use a second hashmap (unordered_map) where each number maps to a set of indices. The set will help maintain the sorted order of indices automatically.

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

class NumberContainerSystem {
private:
    std::unordered_map<int, int> indexToNum; // Maps index to its number
    std::unordered_map<int, std::set<int>> numToIndices; // Maps number to a set of its indices
    
public:
    NumberContainerSystem() {}

    void change(int index, int number) {
        if (indexToNum.find(index) != indexToNum.end()) {
            int oldNumber = indexToNum[index];
            numToIndices[oldNumber].erase(index);
            if (numToIndices[oldNumber].empty()) {
                numToIndices.erase(oldNumber);
            }
        }
        indexToNum[index] = number;
        numToIndices[number].insert(index);
    }

    int find(int number) {
        if (numToIndices.find(number) != numToIndices.end() && !numToIndices[number].empty()) {
            return *(numToIndices[number].begin());
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. `change(int index, int number)`: 
   - Access and modification in `unordered_map` is O(1) average case.
   - Insertion and deletion in `set` is O(log n) where n is the number of indices associated with a number.
   - Thus, overall complexity is O(log n).

2. `find(int number)`:
   - Access in `unordered_map` is O(1) average case.
   - Finding the smallest index in the `set` is O(1) since the set maintains order.
   - Thus, overall complexity is O(1).

This design ensures that both operations are efficient, maintaining optimal performance for applications requiring frequent updates and queries.
