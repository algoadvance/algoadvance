[Leetcode 1268. Search Suggestions System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1268)
## Problem Statement:

Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`, design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have a common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix, return the three lexicographically minimums products. Return the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

Example:
```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- All the strings of `products` are unique.
- `products[i]` and `searchWord` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Should the system be case-sensitive? (Assume yes, lowercase only as stated in the constraints.)
2. Are the product names guaranteed to have a unique prefix? (Not necessarily, as stated.)
3. Should we always return exactly three suggestions if there are fewer products matching the prefix? (Return up to three.)
4. Can the `products` array be modified? (Assume yes for sorting purposes.)

## Strategy:

1. **Sort** the `products` list lexicographically to make it easy to retrieve the minimum three products in lexicographical order.
2. Use a **prefix-based filtering** approach after adding each character of `searchWord`.
3. **Binary Search** can be employed to find the starting point of the current prefix to save time.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> suggestedProducts(std::vector<std::string>& products, std::string searchWord) {
        // Sort the products lexicographically
        std::sort(products.begin(), products.end());
        
        std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> result;
        std::string prefix;
        
        for (char c : searchWord) {
            prefix += c;
            // Use a temporary vector to collect suggestions for the current prefix
            std::vector<std::string> suggestions;
            for (const std::string& product : products) {
                // If the product starts with the prefix, add it to suggestions
                if (product.find(prefix) == 0) {
                    suggestions.push_back(product);
                }
                // If we have collected 3 suggestions, break the loop early
                if (suggestions.size() == 3) break;
            }
            result.push_back(suggestions);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:

1. **Sorting the products**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of products.
2. **Generating Suggestions**: For each character in `searchWord`, we perform a search in the `products` list. In the worst case, this can be `O(n)` per character, making it `O(m * n)` in total, where `m` is the length of `searchWord`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- **O(n log n)** for sorting
- For each prefix search: **O(m * n)**

In total, the complexity is **O(n log n + m * n)**.

---

This approach ensures that we are efficiently sorting the products first and then performing prefix-based searches in a time-efficient manner.
