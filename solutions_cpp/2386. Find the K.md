[Leetcode 2386. Find the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2386)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`. The `k`-sum is defined as the `k`-th largest possible sum of a non-empty subsequence of `nums`. A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Return the `k`-Sum to be exact.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` array and the value of `k`?**
   - This will help in understanding if a brute force solution is feasible.
   
2. **Are there negative numbers in the array?**
   - This might affect the sum calculations and strategies.

3. **Can `k` be larger than the number of possible subsequences?**
   - This is essential to ensure that `k` is within valid bounds.

## Strategy

Given that the brute force way of finding all possible subsequences and then sorting their sums is infeasible for large arrays due to exponential growth, we will leverage a more efficient approach:

1. **Max-Heap and Subsequence Logic:**
   - We will use a max-heap (priority queue) to track the sums of subsequences.
   - Sort the array to aid in understanding the range of possible sums from combining various elements.
   
2. **Iterative Addition:**
   - Initialize the heap with the sum of the full array (all elements considered).
   - Iteratively, consider removing each element in a controlled manner to generate possible sums.
   - Push these new sums back into the heap.

The refined steps include:
- Sort the `nums` array in non-increasing order.
- Initialize a priority queue (max-heap in behavior).
- Start with the largest possible sum and iteratively generate smaller sums.
- Continue until the k-th element is found in a sorted manner.

## Time Complexity

Considering the operations:
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- Each heap operation (insert and extract) takes `O(log k)`, performed `k` times.

Thus, the overall complexity roughly stands around `O(n log n + k log k)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long kSum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Calculate the total sum of positive numbers
        long long totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                totalSum += num;
            }
        }

        // Convert to non-negative values by taking absolute value
        for (int& num : nums) {
            num = abs(num);
        }

        // Sort in descending order
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());

        // Max-Heap to store sums
        priority_queue<pair<long long, int>> maxHeap;
        maxHeap.push({totalSum, 0});

        // Since totalSum is the largest, we decrement k first
        long long result = totalSum;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
            auto [currentSum, index] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();

            // Option without nums[index]
            if (index < nums.size()) {
                maxHeap.push({currentSum - nums[index], index + 1});
            }
            // Option with nums[index]
            if (index > 0) {
                maxHeap.push({currentSum - nums[index] + nums[index - 1], index + 1});
            }
            result = currentSum;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

This solution incorporates both considerations about the problem constraints and optimization techniques for more efficient computation. The code also handles negative numbers adequately by converting them into non-negative equivalents for easier sum calculations.
