[Leetcode 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1438)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest continuous subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of input:** What is the size range of the input array `nums`, and what is the range of the integer values within `nums`?
   
   **Answer:** The input array size can be up to 10^5, and the values in `nums` are within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

2. **Edge cases:** What should be returned when thereâ€™s only one element in the array?

   **Answer:** The length of the longest subarray in that case is 1 because a single element satisfies any limit.

3. **Performance:** Given the constraints, can we assume that a solution that works in linear time is required?

   **Answer:** Yes, due to the potentially large size of `nums`, a linear time solution is ideal.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the Sliding Window along with two Deques (Double-ended Queues) to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the current window. The idea is as follows:

1. Use two deques:
   a. One to keep the indexes of the elements in an increasing order.
   b. Another to keep the indexes of the elements in a decreasing order.
   
2. Traverse the `nums` while maintaining these two deques.

3. For each position `i`, include it in the window and adjust the deques accordingly to maintain the required conditions.

4. If the absolute difference condition is violated, slide the window from the left by removing elements from the deques until the condition is satisfied.

5. Track the maximum length of any valid window seen during the process.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
    deque<int> maxD, minD;
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    int res = 0;
    
    while(right < nums.size()) {
        // Maintain decreasing deque for max
        while (!maxD.empty() && nums[maxD.back()] <= nums[right]) {
            maxD.pop_back();
        }
        maxD.push_back(right);
        
        // Maintain increasing deque for min
        while (!minD.empty() && nums[minD.back()] >= nums[right]) {
            minD.pop_back();
        }
        minD.push_back(right);
        
        // Check if the current window is valid
        while (nums[maxD.front()] - nums[minD.front()] > limit) {
            left++;
            if (!maxD.empty() && maxD.front() < left) {
                maxD.pop_front();
            }
            if (!minD.empty() && minD.front() < left) {
                minD.pop_front();
            }
        }
        
        // Update the result with the current window size.
        res = max(res, right - left + 1);
        right++;
    }
    
    return res;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {8, 2, 4, 7};
    int limit = 4;
    cout << "Longest Continuous Subarray: " << longestSubarray(nums, limit) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the proposed solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because each element is inserted and removed from each deque at most once. Hence, the operations within the while loop are efficiently managed to ensure linear time complexity.
