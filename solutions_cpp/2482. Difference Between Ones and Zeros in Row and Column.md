[Leetcode 2482. Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2482)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. A binary matrix has only `0`s and `1`s as its entries. You need to find a matrix `diff` where `diff[i][j]` is equal to the absolute difference between the number of `1`s and the number of `0`s in the `i-th` row and `j-th` column.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the dimensions of the matrix (minimum and maximum values for `m` and `n`)?
   - Are there any specific edge cases to consider, such as very small or very large matrices?

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Should the difference matrix `diff` be of the same dimensions (`m x n`) as the input grid?
   - How should we handle empty grids or grids with all zeros or all ones?

Assuming reasonable constraints (e.g., `1 <= m, n <= 200`), let's solve the problem with provided information.

### Strategy

1. **Count Ones and Zeros**:
   - Compute the number of `1`s and `0`s for each row and each column.
   - Use two arrays `rowOnes` and `colOnes` to store the count of `1`s in each row and each column respectively.
   - Similarly, `rowZeros` and `colZeros` to store the count of `0`s in each row and each column.

2. **Compute Differences**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the difference `diff[i][j]` as:
     \[
     diff[i][j] = |(rowOnes[i] + colOnes[j] - rowZeros[i] - colZeros[j])|
     \]

3. **Construct the Result Matrix**:
   - Create and populate the result matrix `diff` with the computed differences.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> onesMinusZeros(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    vector<int> rowOnes(m, 0);
    vector<int> rowZeros(m, 0);
    vector<int> colOnes(n, 0);
    vector<int> colZeros(n, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                rowOnes[i]++;
                colOnes[j]++;
            } else {
                rowZeros[i]++;
                colZeros[j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> diff(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int diffValue = abs((rowOnes[i] + colOnes[j]) - (rowZeros[i] + colZeros[j]));
            diff[i][j] = diffValue;
        }
    }
    
    return diff;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Counting Rows and Columns**:
   - The first nested loop runs through each cell in the matrix, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\).

2. **Computing Differences**:
   - The second nested loop also runs through each cell in the matrix, again resulting in a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\), which is efficient and manageable within the given constraints.
