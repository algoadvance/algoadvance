[Leetcode 367. Valid Perfect Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l367)
## Problem Statement

Determine if a given positive integer `num` is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of some integer. In other words, a perfect square is the product of some integer with itself.

For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 10 are not.

### Function Signature:

```cpp
bool isPerfectSquare(int num);
```

### Example:
- Input: `num = 16`
  - Output: `true`
- Input: `num = 14`
  - Output: `false`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input integer `num`?**
   - The constraints are typically within the range of a 32-bit signed integer, i.e., `1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`.

2. **Can we use built-in functions like `sqrt()`?**
   - For the sake of a comprehensive solution, it's better not to use the built-in `sqrt()` function. Instead, we should demonstrate an algorithmic approach.

3. **Should we account for very large inputs?**
   - Given C++ can handle squares up to `2^31 - 1`, a solution should be efficient for large inputs within this range.

## Strategy

The problem can be solved using several methods, but we'll demonstrate a couple of efficient approaches:

### Approach 1: Binary Search
Binary search can determine if `num` is a perfect square efficiently by checking the middle of the range from `1` to `num`.

#### Steps:
1. Set `left` to 1 and `right` to `num`.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
    - Compute `mid` as the midpoint between `left` and `right`.
    - If `mid * mid` equals `num`, return true.
    - If `mid * mid` is less than `num`, move `left` to `mid + 1`.
    - If `mid * mid` is more than `num`, move `right` to `mid - 1`.
3. If no perfect square is found, return false.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of binary search is \( O(\log n) \).

### Approach 2: Newton's Method
Newton's Method (or Newton-Raphson method) can also be employed to iteratively approach the square root of `num`.

#### Steps:
1. Start with an initial guess `x` equal to `num`.
2. Iteratively update `guess` using the formula:
    - `guess = (guess + num / guess) / 2`
3. Stop when `guess * guess` is close enough to `num`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for Newton's method is typically \( O(\log n) \).

Here is the implementation using the Binary Search approach:

## Code

```cpp
bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    if (num < 1) return false; // Edge case handling

    long left = 1, right = num; // Use long to prevent potential overflow

    while (left <= right) {
        long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        long square = mid * mid;

        if (square == num) {
            return true;
        } else if (square < num) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Conclusion

This solution ensures that `num` is efficiently checked for being a perfect square using binary search. Given its logarithmic time complexity, it works well even for larger values within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
