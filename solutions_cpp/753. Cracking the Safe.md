[Leetcode 753. Cracking the Safe](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l753)
### Problem Statement

You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', ..., '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example, changing '9' to '0' changes the digit by one. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a string `target` representing the state of the wheels that you want to reach.

You must return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, starting from '0000' and ending at the `target`.

**Example 1:**
```cpp
Input: target = "0202"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A sequence of moves that reaches the target is "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that "0000" -> "9000" -> "9100" -> "9200" -> "9201" -> "9202" -> "0202" is also valid.
```

**Example 2:**
```cpp
Input: target = "8888"
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A sequence of moves that reaches the target is "0000" -> "1000" -> "2000" -> "3000" -> "4000" -> "5000" -> "6000" -> "7000" -> "8000" -> "8100" -> "8200" -> "8300" -> "8400" -> "8500" -> "8600" -> "8700" -> "8800" -> "8880" -> "8888".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any restrictions or "dead ends" in the lock where certain combinations cannot be used? - No.
2. Can one wheel be moved in both the forward and backward direction? - Yes.
3. Will the target always be reachable from "0000"? - Yes, it will always be reachable.

### Strategy

1. We can treat the problem as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph where each node represents a lock combination.
2. We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) since it is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
3. We'll keep track of visited states to avoid revisiting nodes and getting stuck in cycles.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minTurnsToOpenLock(string target) {
    string start = "0000";
    if(start == target) return 0; // Quick return if start and end are the same

    queue<pair<string, int>> q; // Queue to maintain the current state and number of turns
    unordered_set<string> visited; // Set to keep track of visited nodes
    q.push({start, 0});
    visited.insert(start);

    vector<int> directions = {1, -1};

    while(!q.empty()) {
        auto current = q.front();
        q.pop();
        string currentState = current.first;
        int turns = current.second;

        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for(int dir : directions) {
                // Create a new state by moving one wheel
                string newState = currentState;
                newState[i] = (newState[i] - '0' + dir + 10) % 10 + '0'; // Wrap around 0-9
                
                if(newState == target) {
                    return turns + 1;
                }

                if(visited.find(newState) == visited.end()) {
                    visited.insert(newState);
                    q.push({newState, turns + 1});
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return -1; // We should never reach here since target is always reachable
}

int main() {
    string target = "0202";
    cout << "Minimum turns to reach " << target << ": " << minTurnsToOpenLock(target) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(10^n \* n)** where `n` is the number of wheels (which is 4 in this problem). This is because in the worst case, we need to explore every possible combination of 4 wheels, and for each combination, we consider 2 possible moves (up or down) for each of the 4 wheels.

The space complexity is also **O(10^n)** due to the storage requirements of the queue and the visited set.
