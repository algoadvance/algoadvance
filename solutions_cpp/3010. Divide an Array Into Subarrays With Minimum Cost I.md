[Leetcode 3010. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3010)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to divide the array into exactly `k` non-empty subarrays such that the cost is minimized. The cost of a subarray is the square of its length. The total cost is the sum of the costs of the individual subarrays.

Your task is to implement a function that finds the minimum possible total cost.

### Function Signature
```cpp
int minCost(vector<int>& nums, int k);
```

### Example
```cpp
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: We can divide the array as [1,2], [1,2], [1,2]. The cost is 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Size:** What constraints are there on the size of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?
   * **Response:** The size of the array `nums` ranges from 1 to 1000, and values for `k` range from 1 to `nums.size()`.

2. **Array Contents:** Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums`?
   * **Response:** No, the values are just integer values and there are no specific constraints on them.

3. **Solution Permissibility:** Is using dynamic programming permissible in solving this problem?
   * **Response:** Yes, you can use dynamic programming to solve it.

## Strategy

We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

### Steps:

1. **Define DP State:**
   Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost to divide the first `i` elements into `j` subarrays.

2. **Base Case:**
   `dp[0][0]` = 0, because the cost of dividing zero elements into zero subarrays is zero.

3. **Transition:**
   For each `i` (from 1 to n) and `j` (from 1 to k):
   - We will consider dividing the array from every possible previous index `m` (from 0 to i-1), and calculate the cost of making a subarray from `m+1` to `i`.
   - The cost of each subarray `[m+1, i]` will be `(i - m) * (i - m)`.
   - Then update `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of its current value and `dp[m][j-1]` + cost of the subarray.

4. **Final Answer:**
   The value `dp[n][k]` will hold the minimum cost to divide the array into exactly `k` subarrays.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

int minCost(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX));
    
    // Base case
    dp[0][0] = 0;
    
    // DP array to keep result
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
            for (int m = 0; m < i; ++m) {
                int length_squared = (i - m) * (i - m);
                if (dp[m][j-1] != INT_MAX) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + length_squared);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Space Complexity:**
   The space complexity is `O(n * k)` due to the use of the `dp` table with dimensions `(n+1) x (k+1)`.

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The dp table filling takes `O(n^2 * k)` since for each `i` and `j`, weâ€™re iterating over all possible previous indices `m`.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * k)`.

This solution should be efficient enough for the input constraints provided (considering `n` and `k` up to 1000).
