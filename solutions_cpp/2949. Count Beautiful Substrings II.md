[Leetcode 2949. Count Beautiful Substrings II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2949)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters only. A substring is defined as beautiful if the number of distinct characters in it is at most `maxLetters`. We need to count the number of beautiful substrings of length exactly `substringLength`.

Constraints:
- \( 1 \leq s.length \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 1 \leq maxLetters \leq 26 \)
- \( 1 \leq substringLength \leq s.length \)

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are overlapping substrings allowed?**
   - Yes, overlapping substrings should be considered.

2. **Do substrings need to be continuous?**
   - Yes, substrings must be contiguous sequences of characters within the given string.

3. **Is it guaranteed that `substringLength` will not exceed the length of the string?**
   - Yes, it is mentioned in the constraints that `substringLength` is at most equal to `s.length`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. We'll use a sliding window of size `substringLength`:
   - As we move the window across the string, we maintain a frequency count of characters within the current window.
   - We also maintain a count of distinct characters in the current window.
2. For each window position, check if the number of distinct characters is less than or equal to `maxLetters`. If yes, increment our count of beautiful substrings.
3. Start by initializing a frequency array (or a map) to count characters in the current window. Slide the window one position at a time and update the counts and distinct character count efficiently.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize:** Frequency array/map and count of distinct characters.
2. **Initial Window:** Set the character frequency and distinct count for the first window.
3. **Sliding the Window:** For each new character added, update the frequency map and distinct character count. Remove the effect of the character that slides out of the window.
4. **Count Check:** For each window, check if it is beautiful by comparing the count of distinct characters to `maxLetters`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int countBeautifulSubstrings(std::string s, int maxLetters, int substringLength) {
    if (substringLength > s.length()) return 0;

    std::unordered_map<char, int> freqMap;
    int distinctCount = 0, beautifulCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < substringLength; ++i) {
        if (++freqMap[s[i]] == 1) {
            distinctCount++;
        }
    }
    if (distinctCount <= maxLetters) beautifulCount++;

    for (int i = substringLength; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        char newChar = s[i], oldChar = s[i - substringLength];
        
        if (--freqMap[oldChar] == 0) {
            distinctCount--;
        }
        if (++freqMap[newChar] == 1) {
            distinctCount++;
        }

        if (distinctCount <= maxLetters) {
            beautifulCount++;
        }
    }

    return beautifulCount;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "aabcabcab";
    int maxLetters = 2;
    int substringLength = 3;
    std::cout << "Number of beautiful substrings: " << countBeautifulSubstrings(s, maxLetters, substringLength) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(substringLength) — Populating initial window character frequencies.
- **Sliding Window:** O(n) — We update the frequency map and distinct character count while sliding the window across `s`.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) if considering a fixed alphabet size (26 lowercase English letters). Otherwise, it can be considered O(1) due to the constant number of possible distinct characters (at most 26).
