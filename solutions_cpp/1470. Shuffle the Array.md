[Leetcode 1470. Shuffle the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1470)
### Problem Statement

Given the array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn]`. Return the array in the form `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]`.

Example:
```cpp
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7]

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2], n = 2
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will the array always have an even number of elements?
   - Yes. The array is guaranteed to have `2n` elements.

2. What are the possible values of `x` and `y` in the array?
   - `x` and `y` are integers and are within the bounds given by the problem constraints.

3. Is it required to shuffle the array in-place?
   - No, we can create a new array to hold the shuffled values.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a new array to hold the shuffled result.
2. Iterate through the first half and the second half of the given array simultaneously.
3. Append elements from the first half and second half alternately to the new array.
4. Return the new array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> shuffle(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
    vector<int> result(2 * n);  // Initialize result array with size 2n
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[2 * i] = nums[i];  // Add element from the first half
        result[2 * i + 1] = nums[n + i];  // Add element from the second half
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Driver code to test the function
int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 7};
    int n1 = 3;
    vector<int> result1 = shuffle(nums1, n1);
    for (int num : result1) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    vector<int> nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    int n2 = 4;
    vector<int> result2 = shuffle(nums2, n2);
    for (int num : result2) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** because we iterate through the array once, where `n` is the half-length of the array `nums` (or alternatively, `2n` operations for an array of size `2n`).
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the additional space used to store the result array of size `2n`.

By following this strategy, we can efficiently shuffle the array as required by the problem statement.
