[Leetcode 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l172)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, and you need to return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (n factorial).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are trailing zeroes?**
   - Trailing zeroes are the number of zeroes at the end of a number. For example, the number `100` has two trailing zeroes.

2. **How do trailing zeroes in a factorial appear?**
   - Trailing zeroes in a factorial appear due to the factors of `10` in the number. Since `10` is the product of `2` and `5`, we need to count the number of `2`s and `5`s in the factors of `n!`. Generally, there are more factors of `2` than `5`, so we only need to count the number of times `5` is a factor in the numbers from `1` to `n`.

## Strategy
1. **Count factors of 5:**
   - For every number `k` in the range `1` to `n`, count how many times `5` is a factor in `k`.
   - Finally, sum these counts to get the number of trailing zeroes.
   
2. **Efficiency:**
   - Instead of checking each number's prime factors, we can use:
     - `floor(n / 5)` to count multiples of `5`
     - `floor(n / 25)` to count multiples of `25` (since every 25 contributes an additional factor of `5`)
     - Continue this pattern with `floor(n / 5^i)` until `5^i > n`

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm primarily involves a series of divisions which run in logarithmic time with respect to `n`, so its time complexity is `O(log n)`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n >= 5) {
            n /= 5;
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 100;  // Example input
    std::cout << "The number of trailing zeroes in " << n << "! is: " << solution.trailingZeroes(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
- We initialize `count` to 0.
- In a while loop, we repeatedly divide `n` by `5`, adding the result to `count`.
- This loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `5`.
- Finally, we return the `count`, which gives the total number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

In this solution, we efficiently count the number of factors of `5` in the factorial, leading to the calculation of trailing zeroes.
