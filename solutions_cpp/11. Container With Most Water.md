[Leetcode 11. Container With Most Water](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l11)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `height` of `n` non-negative integers where each element represents the height of a vertical line on a 2D plane. The goal is to find two lines such that, together with the x-axis, they form a container that holds the maximum amount of water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

### Example
Given the array `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`, the maximum amount of water the container can store is `49` (formed by the lines at index `1` and `8`).

### Assumptions
- The input array will have at least two elements.
- Each element in the array is a non-negative integer.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the input array?**
   - The array length can range from 2 to \(10^5\).

2. **What is the range of heights in the input array?**
   - Each height is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to \(10^4\).

3. **Can there be multiple solutions or just one?**
   - We only need to return the maximum water capacity, so the number of optimal solutions does not matter.

4. **Do we need to handle any specific edge cases?**
   - As long as we adhere to the input constraints where there are at least two elements and all heights are non-negative, typical edge cases should be manageable by ensuring the algorithm can handle small and large input sizes efficiently.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the two-pointer approach:

1. **Initialize two pointers**:
   - One at the beginning (`left = 0`) and one at the end (`right = n-1`) of the array.

2. **Calculate the area**:
   - Compute the area formed between the lines at the two pointers and determine the minimum of the heights of these two lines to determine the water level.
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward by one position since the limiting factor in height will need to potentially find a taller line to increase the area.

3. **Iterate**:
   - Repeat the process while adjusting the pointers towards each other until they meet.

4. **Track the maximum area**:
   - Keep track of the maximum area encountered during iterations.

This approach ensures an efficient O(n) time complexity with a single pass through the array.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(std::vector<int>& height) {
        int left = 0; 
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        int max_area = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int current_area = (right - left) * std::min(height[left], height[right]);
            max_area = std::max(max_area, current_area);

            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                ++left;
            } else {
                --right;
            }
        }

        return max_area;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we only make a single pass through the array with the two pointers, moving them towards the center.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space.
