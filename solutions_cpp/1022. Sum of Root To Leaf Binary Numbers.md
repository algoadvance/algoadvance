[Leetcode 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1022)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree containing 0s and 1s, each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the root. For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0, then the binary number is 0110, which is 6 in decimal. Return the sum of these numbers computed for all such paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the tree node?**
   - The tree node has `int val` for the value (0 or 1), and pointers `TreeNode* left` and `TreeNode* right` for its children.

2. **What is the range of the number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The number of nodes ranges from 1 to 1000.

3. **Is the tree guaranteed to be valid and well-formed (no cycles)?**
   - Yes, it's a valid binary tree with no cycles.

4. **What should we return if the tree is empty?**
   - Given the constraints, we can assume the tree is never empty.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int currentSum) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        currentSum = (currentSum << 1) | node->val;
        
        // If it's a leaf node, return the current accumulated sum
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            return currentSum;
        }
        
        // Otherwise, continue the DFS on both subtrees
        return dfs(node->left, currentSum) + dfs(node->right, currentSum);
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - We'll use DFS to traverse the tree from the root to each leaf.
   - For each node, we update the current binary sum by shifting left by 1 bit (`currentSum << 1`) and adding the node's value (using binary OR `| node->val`).

2. **Leaf Node Check:**
   - Once a leaf node is reached (both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`), we add the accumulated binary sum to the total sum.

3. **Recursive Traversal:**
   - Apply the same process recursively for both left and right subtrees.
   - Sum the values obtained from the left and right subtrees and return the result.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack during the DFS traversal. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), h could be n. In the best case (a balanced tree), h would be log(n).

With the above approach, we can efficiently compute the sum of all root-to-leaf binary numbers in the given binary tree.
