[Leetcode 135. Candy](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l135)
## Problem Statement

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume that the `ratings` array will always have at least one element?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume that the `ratings` array contains at least one element.
   
2. **Q:** Are the ratings unique or can there be duplicates?
   **A:** The ratings can have duplicate values.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use a two-pass greedy algorithm:

1. **First Pass (Left to Right):** 
   - Distribute candies in increasing order of indices such that each child gets one more candy than the previous child if their rating is higher than the previous child's rating.
   
2. **Second Pass (Right to Left):**
   - Ensure that each child gets more candies than the next child if their rating is higher than the next child's rating. Adjust the candies accordingly from the second-to-last child to the first child.
   
The two-pass strategy ensures that both conditions are met efficiently.

## Code

Here's how you can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int candy(std::vector<int>& ratings) {
    int n = ratings.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    std::vector<int> candies(n, 1);

    // First pass: from left to right
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Second pass: from right to left
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
            candies[i] = std::max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
        }
    }

    int totalCandies = 0;
    for (const int candy : candies) {
        totalCandies += candy;
    }

    return totalCandies;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of children. This is because both the left-to-right and right-to-left passes run in O(n) time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional `candies` vector used to store the number of candies each child receives.
