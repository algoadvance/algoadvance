[Leetcode 1955. Count Number of Special Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1955)
## Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers `nums` which consists of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. We need to find the number of subsequences that follow the specific order: forms of `0,1,2`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A special subsequence is a subsequence that follows the order of 0s, then 1s, then 2s. We need to determine the number of such special subsequences in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array? 
   - Are there any constraints on the size of each element in `nums`?

2. **Output:**
   - Is there a restriction on the modulo value for the answer?

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countSpecialSubsequences(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        std::vector<long long> dp(3, 0);
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                dp[0] = (dp[0] * 2 + 1) % MOD;
            }
            else if (num == 1) {
                dp[1] = (dp[1] * 2 + dp[0]) % MOD;
            }
            else if (num == 2) {
                dp[2] = (dp[2] * 2 + dp[1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[2];
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Arrays:**
   - We will maintain a dynamic programming array `dp` of size 3 where:
     - `dp[0]` keeps track of the count of valid subsequences ending with `0`.
     - `dp[1]` keeps track of the count of valid subsequences ending with `1`.
     - `dp[2]` keeps track of the count of valid subsequences ending with `2`.

2. **Transition:**
   - For each `0`, it can either start a new subsequence or double the existing subsequences ending with `0`.
   - For each `1`, it can either extend each subsequence that ends with `0` by adding `1` or double the existing subsequences ending with `1`.
   - For each `2`, it can either extend each subsequence that ends with `1` by adding `2` or double the existing subsequences ending with `2`.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of valid subsequences might be large, we will take the result as modulo `1e9 + 7`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - The time complexity is O(n) as we are iterating through the input array just once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** 
  - The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a few extra variables irrespective of the input size.
