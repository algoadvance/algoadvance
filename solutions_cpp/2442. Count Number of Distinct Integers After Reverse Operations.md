[Leetcode 2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2442)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. You have to perform the following operations:

1. Reverse the digits of each integer in the array `nums`.
2. Add the reversed numbers to the original array.
3. Count and return the number of distinct integers in the final array.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
Output: 6
Explanation: After reversing the digits of each number,
we get [1, 31, 1, 21, 13]. Adding these to the original array gives [1, 13, 10, 12, 31, 1, 31, 1, 21, 13].
The distinct numbers are [1, 13, 10, 12, 31, 21]. Thus, the answer is 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the integers in `nums`?**
   - `nums` consists of integers that are within the range `[1, 10^6]`.

2. **What is the maximum size of the array `nums`?**
   - The array `nums` can contain up to `10^4` elements.

3. **Can the array `nums` contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

### Strategy

1. **Reverse Digit Function:** We need a helper function to reverse the digits of a number.
2. **Unique Elements Container:** We'll use a `std::unordered_set` to store unique integers since it provides an average time complexity of O(1) for insert and lookup operations.
3. **Insert Original and Reversed:** Insert all original elements into the set, then reverse each element and insert the reversed elements.
4. **Count Unique Elements:** The size of the set after all insertions will give the number of distinct integers.

### Time Complexity

- **Reversing Digits:** Reversing digits of a number takes O(log10(n)), where `n` is the integer.
- **Insertions to Set:** Each insertion operation on the set is O(1) on average.
- **Overall Complexity:** Given `m` as the maximum number of digits and `n` as the array size, the overall complexity is O(n * m), which simplifies to O(n * log10(k)) where `k` is the maximum value in `nums`.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

int reverseDigits(int num) {
    int reversed = 0;
    while (num != 0) {
        reversed = reversed * 10 + (num % 10);
        num /= 10;
    }
    return reversed;
}

int countDistinctIntegers(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_set<int> distinctNumbers;
    for (int num : nums) {
        distinctNumbers.insert(num);
        int reversed = reverseDigits(num);
        distinctNumbers.insert(reversed);
    }
    return distinctNumbers.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 13, 10, 12, 31}; // Example input
    std::cout << countDistinctIntegers(nums) << std::endl; // Output should be 6
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Reverse Digits Function:**
   - This function takes an integer, reverses its digits, and returns the reversed number.
   
2. **Main Function (`countDistinctIntegers`):**
   - Uses a `std::unordered_set` to store unique integers.
   - Inserts each original number from `nums` and its reversed counterpart into the set.
   - Returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct integers.

3. **Main Execution:**
   - Demonstrates the function with an example input and prints the result.

This solution efficiently counts the distinct integers after performing the described operations.
