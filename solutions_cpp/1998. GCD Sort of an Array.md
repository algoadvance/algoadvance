[Leetcode 1998. GCD Sort of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1998)
## Problem Statement
The problem "1998. GCD Sort of an Array" on LeetCode is formulated as follows:

You are given an integer array `nums`, and you can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
- Pick two prime indices `i` and `j` such that `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`, and swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]`.

Your goal is to sort the array using the above operation and return `true` if it is possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all elements in the array positive integers?**
   - Yes, all elements in the array are positive integers.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

3. **Is the array indexed starting from `0`?**
   - Yes, like standard arrays, the indices start from `0`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will utilize the properties of prime factors and the union-find (disjoint-set) data structure. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Prime Factorization**: Precompute the smallest prime factor (SPF) for each number up to the maximum value in `nums` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This will allow us to quickly determine the prime factors of any number.

2. **Union-Find Initialization**: Initialize the union-find data structure where each number from `1` to the maximum value in `nums` is its own parent initially.

3. **Union Operations**: For each number in `nums`, find its prime factors and perform union operations on its prime factors and itself. This step groups numbers with common prime factors into the same connected component.

4. **Check Sort Possibility**: To determine if it is possible to sort `nums`, fetch the prime factors for each pair of elements `(nums[i], sorted_nums[i])` in the original and sorted arrays, respectively. Ensure each of these pairs belongs to the same connected component using the union-find structure.

## Code 

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        std::iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0); // Initialize with 0 to n-1
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x)
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unionSets(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> parent;
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool gcdSort(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxNum = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Step 1: Smallest Prime Factors (SPF) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes
        std::vector<int> spf(maxNum + 1);
        for (int i = 2; i <= maxNum; ++i) {
            spf[i] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= maxNum; ++i) {
            if (spf[i] == i) {
                for (int j = i * i; j <= maxNum; j += i) {
                    if (spf[j] == j) {
                        spf[j] = i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Union-Find initialization
        UnionFind uf(maxNum + 1);

        // Step 3: Union numbers with their prime factors
        for (const int& num : nums) {
            int current = num;
            while (current > 1) {
                int primeFactor = spf[current];
                uf.unionSets(num, primeFactor);
                while (current % primeFactor == 0) {
                    current /= primeFactor;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Check if `nums` can be sorted by GCD swap
        std::vector<int> sortedNums = nums;
        std::sort(sortedNums.begin(), sortedNums.end());

        for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (uf.find(nums[i]) != uf.find(sortedNums[i])) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Prime Factorization with Sieve of Eratosthenes**: O(n log log n) for precomputing the smallest prime factor up to the maximum value in `nums`.
2. **Union Operations**: O(n log n) on average due to the union-find with path compression and union by rank.
3. **Sorting the Array**: O(n log n).
4. **Checking Components**: O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n), which is efficient for typical input sizes on competitive programming platforms.
