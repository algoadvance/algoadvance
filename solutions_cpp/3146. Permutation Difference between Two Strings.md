[Leetcode 3146. Permutation Difference between Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3146)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. Selecting a substring from each string, check if there exists a permutation of the substring of `s1` that matches with the substring of `s2`. Write a function that returns `true` if such a permutation exists, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the two substrings always of the same length?
   - Yes, the substring from `s1` and `s2` should be of the same length.
   
2. Can the strings `s1` and `s2` contain special characters or numbers?
   - The problem doesn't restrict characters, so assume the strings can be comprised of any characters.

3. Do the substrings need to be contiguous?
   - Yes, the substrings are contiguous parts of the strings `s1` and `s2`.

4. Should the function be case-sensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are considered different?
   - Yes, consider the function case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.

## Strategy

1. Use a sliding window approach combined with a character frequency count to avoid having to recompute frequency counts for overlapping parts of the strings.
2. Initialize frequency counts for the first window in both `s1` and `s2`.
3. Slide the window across the strings and update the counts, checking after each slide if the two frequency counts match.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity should be `O(n*26) (effectively O(n) since 26 is a constant)` where n is the length of the strings, because we're processing each character once and updating/counting frequencies in constant time.

## Code

Here is the C++ solution for the given problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool checkEqualCounts(const std::vector<int>& count1, const std::vector<int>& count2) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        if (count1[i] != count2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

bool findPermutationSubstring(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    int n = s1.length();
    if (n != s2.length()) return false;
    
    std::vector<int> s1Count(26, 0);
    std::vector<int> s2Count(26, 0);
    
    // Initialize the counts for the first window
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        s1Count[s1[i] - 'a']++;
        s2Count[s2[i] - 'a']++;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (checkEqualCounts(s1Count, s2Count)) return true;

        if (i < n) {
            s2Count[s2[i] - 'a']--;
            s2Count[s2[i + n - 1] - 'a']++;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "abc";
    std::string s2 = "bca";
    bool result = findPermutationSubstring(s1, s2);
    std::cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we slide a window over `s2` and update the frequency counts in O(1) time, checking if the frequency counts of the two windows match to determine if a permutation exists.
