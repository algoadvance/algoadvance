[Leetcode 3079. Find the Sum of Encrypted Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3079)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers. You need to encrypt these integers and then find their sum. The encryption process is defined as follows:

1. **Encryption of each integer:**
    - If the integer is positive, reverse its digits.
    - If the integer is negative, reverse its digits (ignoring the sign) and then reapply the negative sign.

2. **Sum of encrypted integers:**
    - Compute the sum of all encrypted integers.

Give the result as an integer.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Values:**
    - What is the range of the integer values we can expect in the input list? (e.g., is there a maximum or minimum value for the integers?)
    
    *Clarification:* Assume the input values range between standard 32-bit integer limits (`-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`).

2. **Input List:**
    - Should we assume the input list will always have at least one integer?
    
    *Clarification:* Yes, assume the input list is non-empty.

3. **Output Format:**
    - Should the output be returned or printed?

    *Clarification:* The output should be returned.

## Strategy

1. **Reverse Digits Function:**
    - Create a helper function to reverse the digits of an integer. This function will handle both positive and negative integers.
    
2. **Iterate Through List:**
    - Iterate through the input list, applying the encryption process to each integer.
    
3. **Sum Encrypted Integers:**
    - Sum all the encrypted integers.

4. **Return Result:**
    - Return the final sum.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int reverseDigits(int num) {
        int reversedNum = 0;
        int sign = num < 0 ? -1 : 1;
        num = std::abs(num);
        
        while (num > 0) {
            reversedNum = reversedNum * 10 + (num % 10);
            num /= 10;
        }
        
        return reversedNum * sign;
    }

    int sumOfEncryptedIntegers(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += reverseDigits(num);
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> nums = {123, -456, 789};
    std::cout << "Sum of Encrypted Integers: " << solution.sumOfEncryptedIntegers(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Reverse Digits Function:**
    - The time complexity of reversing the digits of a single integer is \(O(d)\), where \(d\) is the number of digits in the integer. 
    - Since \(d\) is in the order of \(O(\log N)\) where \(N\) is the integer value, the time complexity for reversing digits is \(O(\log N)\).

- **Total Time Complexity:**
    - Let \(n\) be the number of integers in the input list.
    - Each integer in the list needs to be processed by the `reverseDigits` function.
    - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log N)\). 

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the `reverseDigits` process since it uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The overall space complexity is \(O(n)\) considering the input list.
