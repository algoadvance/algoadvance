[Leetcode 303. Range Sum Query ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l303)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, handle multiple queries of the following type:

**Calculate the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` inclusive where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers and `left <= right`.**

Implement the `NumArray` class:
- `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
- `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` inclusive (i.e., `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

### Example

```cpp
Input:
["NumArray", "sumRange", "sumRange", "sumRange"]
[[[-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]], [0, 2], [2, 5], [0, 5]]

Output:
[null, 1, -1, -3]

Explanation:
NumArray numArray = new NumArray([-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]);
numArray.sumRange(0, 2); // return 1
numArray.sumRange(2, 5); // return -1
numArray.sumRange(0, 5); // return -3
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the input array elements bounded by any constraints (such as range of values)?**
   - Typically in such problems, the array elements can be as large as the language allows for `int` type in C++.

2. **How frequent are the `sumRange` queries?**
   - Usually, for such problems, multiple `sumRange` queries are expected. We should optimize for multiple queries after initial preprocessing.

3. **What should be the behavior if `left` or `right` are out of bounds?**
   - We can assume that the problem statement will ensure `left` and `right` are within valid bounds and `left <= right`.

### Strategy

To efficiently answer the sum queries, we use the concept of **prefix sums**. This allows us to preprocess the array and then answer any range sum query in constant time `O(1)`. 

**Steps:**

1. **Preprocessing (O(n)):**
   - Create a prefix sum array `prefixSums` where `prefixSums[i]` holds the sum of the array from the start up to the i-th index.
   - This can be computed in a single pass over the array.

2. **Query (O(1)):**
   - For any query `(left, right)`, the sum can be obtained using `prefixSums[right + 1] - prefixSums[left]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class NumArray {
private:
    vector<int> prefixSums;
    
public:
    NumArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        prefixSums.resize(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + nums[i];
        }
    }
    
    int sumRange(int left, int right) {
        return prefixSums[right + 1] - prefixSums[left];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Time:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Query Time:** `O(1)` for each `sumRange` query.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the prefix sums.

This ensures that after a linear time preprocessing, each range sum query can be answered in constant time, making the overall approach highly efficient.
