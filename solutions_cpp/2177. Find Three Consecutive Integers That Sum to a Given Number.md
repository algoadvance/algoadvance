[Leetcode 2177. Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2177)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `num`. You need to return three consecutive integers `[x, x+1, x+2]` such that their sum is equal to the given integer `num`. If no such integers exist, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: What is the range of the input number `num`? 
   - **Assume**: The number `num` is within the range of a typical 32-bit signed integer, i.e., `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.
2. **Output Format**: Should the output be in any specific format?
   - **Output**: Return an array or vector of three integers.

### Strategy

1. We know that the sum of three consecutive integers can be written as:
   \[
   x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x + 3 = num
   \]
   
2. Simplify the equation to find the value of `x`:
   \[
   3x + 3 = num \implies 3x = num - 3 \implies x = \frac{num - 3}{3}
   \]

3. To ensure `x` is an integer, `(num - 3)` must be divisible by 3 without leaving a remainder.

4. If `x` is an integer, the three consecutive integers are `[x, x+1, x+2]`.

5. If `(num - 3) % 3 != 0`, return an empty array as no such integers exist.

### Code Implementation

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<long long> findThreeConsecutiveIntegers(long long num) {
    if ((num - 3) % 3 != 0) {
        return {};  // Return an empty vector if num - 3 is not divisible by 3
    }

    long long x = (num - 3) / 3;
    return {x, x + 1, x + 2};
}

int main() {
    long long num = 33;  // Example input
    std::vector<long long> result = findThreeConsecutiveIntegers(num);
    
    if (!result.empty()) {
        std::cout << "Three consecutive integers are: ";
        for (long long n : result) {
            std::cout << n << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No three consecutive integers found that sum to " << num << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because:
- We are performing a constant number of arithmetic operations regardless of the size of `num`.

### Explanation

1. **Line 1 - 5**: We define the function `findThreeConsecutiveIntegers` which takes `num` as input and checks if `(num - 3)` is divisible by 3.
2. **Line 6**: If `(num - 3)` is not divisible by 3, return an empty vector.
3. **Line 9**: Calculate `x` by `(num - 3) / 3`.
4. **Line 10**: Return the vector containing the consecutive integers `[x, x+1, x+2]`.
5. **Main function**: Provides an example of how to call the function and print the results. 

This approach ensures that we only return valid values and handle edge cases efficiently.
