[Leetcode 2542. Maximum Subsequence Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2542)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length `n` and an integer `k`. Your task is to select a subsequence of indices from the given integer arrays, preferably `i1, i2, ..., ik` having a maximum subsequence score.

- The `score` of the chosen subsequence is defined as `sum(nums1[i1] + nums1[i2] + ... + nums1[ik]) * min(nums2[i1], nums2[i2], ..., nums2[ik])`.

Return the maximum possible score.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the indices in the subsequence unique?**
   - Yes, each index should be unique and selected indices should have valid elements from both `nums1` and `nums2`.

2. **Can the same element from `nums1` and `nums2` be used in multiple subsequences?**
   - No, each element from `nums1` and `nums2` can be used only once in the selected subsequence.

### Strategy
To maximize the subsequence score, the following steps can be used:

1. **Sort indirection based on another array:** 
   - Create an array of pairs where each pair contains elements from `nums2` and its corresponding index.
   - Sort this array based on the elements of `nums2` in descending order. The reason behind sorting is to always try to include the highest possible numbers from `nums2` to be `min(nums2[i1], ..., nums2[ik])`, which will give a chance for a higher score.

2. **Select Elements Efficiently:**
   - By iterating through the sorted pairs, use a max-heap (priority_queue in C++) to track the `k` largest elements from `nums1` corresponding to the indices. This ensures we are selecting the largest possible elements from `nums1`.
   
3. **Calculate Subsequence Score:**
   - For each selection from `nums2`, compute the current score using the sum of the top `k` elements from `nums1` and the current `nums2` element after they have been sorted.
   - Maintain a running total sum of the top `k` elements from `nums1`.

4. **Track Maximum Score:**
   - Keep track of the maximum score encountered during the iteration of the array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxScore(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        // Create pairs of (nums2[i], i) and sort in descending order by nums2[i]
        vector<pair<int, int>> paired;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            paired.emplace_back(nums2[i], i);
        }
        sort(paired.rbegin(), paired.rend());
        
        // Using a min-heap to keep the k largest elements from nums1
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
        long long sum = 0;
        long long maxScore = 0;

        for (auto [nums2Val, idx] : paired) {
            // Always push current nums1[idx] to the heap
            minHeap.push(nums1[idx]);
            sum += nums1[idx];
            
            // If heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest element to maintain only k elements
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                sum -= minHeap.top();
                minHeap.pop();
            }

            // Calculate the current score once we have exactly k elements
            if (minHeap.size() == k) {
                maxScore = max(maxScore, sum * nums2Val);
            }
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums1 = {1,3,3,2};
    vector<int> nums2 = {2,1,3,4};
    int k = 3;
    cout << sol.maxScore(nums1, nums2, k) << endl;  // Outputs the maximum score
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array of pairs will take O(n log n).
- Processing each element (pushing to the heap and maintaining it) takes O(n log k).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n) + O(n log k)**. Given that typically k << n, this is efficient for large input sizes.
