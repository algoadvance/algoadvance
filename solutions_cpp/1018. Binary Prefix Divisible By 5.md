[Leetcode 1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1018)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of binary digits (`0`s and `1`s), you need to return a list of booleans `answers`, where `answers[i]` is `true` if the binary number represented by the prefix `A[0]` to `A[i]` is divisible by 5.

For example:
- Input: `A = [0, 1, 1]`
- Output: `[true, false, false]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of array `A`? 
     - Typically, the length can vary from `1` to `30000`.
   - Are there only binary digits (`0` or `1`) in array `A`?
     - Yes, array `A` contains only `0` or `1`.

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - The output should be an array of boolean values (`true`/`false`) of the same length as input array `A`.

3. **Performance Constraints:**
   - Should the solution be optimized for both time and space complexity?
     - Yes, it is preferable.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a variable `num` to `0`. This variable will represent the current binary number formed by the prefix.
2. Iterate through the array `A`, and for each digit:
   - Left shift the `num` by 1 bit and add the current digit to `num`. This effectively builds the binary number.
   - To avoid handling very large numbers, use modulo operation `num % 5` to keep `num` manageable.
   - Check if the `num` is divisible by 5, and append the result (`true` or `false`) to the answer list.

This strategy ensures that we work with manageable numbers and avoids potential overflow issues. Modulo operation aids in keeping the number within practical bounds.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `A`. Each element is processed exactly once.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<bool> prefixesDivBy5(std::vector<int>& A) {
    std::vector<bool> result;
    int num = 0;
    
    for (int digit : A) {
        // Left shift num by 1 and add the current digit
        num = ((num << 1) + digit) % 5;
        // Check if current num is divisible by 5
        result.push_back(num == 0);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

Hereâ€™s the functionality breakdown:
- **`num = ((num << 1) + digit) % 5`**: This combines the current binary digit to form the number, then takes modulo `5` to keep `num` in a manageable range.
- **`result.push_back(num == 0)`**: Checks if the current number is divisible by 5 and stores the result.

This solution is both efficient and straightforward. Each binary digit is processed in constant time, ensuring an `O(n)` complexity overall.
