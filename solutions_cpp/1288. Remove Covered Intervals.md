[Leetcode 1288. Remove Covered Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1288)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [li, ri]` represent the inclusive interval `[li, ri]`.

An interval `[a, b]` is covered by an interval `[c, d]` if and only if `c <= a` and `b <= d`.

You need to remove all the intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

Return the number of remaining intervals.

Example:

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], but [1,4] and [2,8] are not covered by any interval.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of values for the interval limits?
   - Can intervals be overlapping or be of zero length?

2. **Output Details**:
   - Are we required to return the count of non-covered intervals or the intervals themselves?

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int removeCoveredIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // Sort the intervals primarily by start time in ascending order.
        // If start times are the same, sort by end time in descending order.
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] > b[1] : a[0] < b[0];
        });

        int count = 0;  // Number of non-covered intervals
        int end = 0;    // The end point of the current interval that's under consideration

        for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
            // If the current interval's end is not covered by the previous interval's end
            if (interval[1] > end) {
                count++;
                end = interval[1];  // Update the end to the current interval's end
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the intervals by their start time (`li`) in ascending order.
   - If two intervals have the same start time, sort them by their end time (`ri`) in descending order.
   - This sorting ensures that if an interval is covered by another, it will be next to it and we can easily find covered intervals.

2. **Iterate and Count**:
   - Initialize `end` to track the largest `ri` seen so far that isn't covered.
   - Iterate through the intervals and count those that aren't covered by the current `end`.
   - If an interval's end is greater than `end`, it's not covered, so increment the count and update the `end`.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the intervals takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of intervals.
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the intervals to check for coverage takes `O(n)` time.
- The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
