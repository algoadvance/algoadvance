[Leetcode 704. Binary Search](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l704)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, write a function to search for `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:**
   - What is the range of the integer values in `nums`?
   - How large can the array `nums` be?

2. **Duplicates:**
   - Are there duplicate elements in the array, or is it guaranteed that all elements are unique?

### Example

```cpp
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9
Output: 4

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 2
Output: -1
```

### Constraints

- You must implement a binary search algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
- The input array `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- The size of the array `nums` can be up to \(10^4\) elements.
- The values in `nums` can range between \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem using binary search, follow these steps:

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, do the following:
   - Calculate the middle `mid` index.
   - Compare the mid-value to the `target` value.
   - If the mid-value equals the `target`, return the `mid` index.
   - If the mid-value is less than the `target`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If the mid-value is greater than the `target`, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
3. If the `target` is not found, return -1.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int search(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. The binary search algorithm divides the search interval in half with each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently searches the sorted array for the target value using the binary search algorithm and meets the required O(log n) runtime complexity.
