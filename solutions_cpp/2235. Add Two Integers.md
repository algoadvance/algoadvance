[Leetcode 2235. Add Two Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2235)
### Problem Statement

The task is to write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

#### Example:
Input: 
```
a = 3, b = 2
```
Output: 
```
5
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the input integers? (Assuming 32-bit signed integers for typical use cases)
2. **Output Type**: Should the function always return an integer? (Assuming yes, based on the problem statement)
3. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases like negative numbers and large integers.

### Strategy

This problem is straightforward. Given two integers, we simply return their sum. 

1. **Function Definition**: Define a function that takes two parameters.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Use the `+` operator to compute the sum of the two integers.
3. **Return Result**: Return the result.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    int a = 3, b = 2;
    std::cout << "Sum of " << a << " and " << b << " is " << solution.sum(a, b) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this function is \(O(1)\) because it performs a constant-time operation: the addition of two integers. Both the addition and the return operation take constant time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) because no additional space is required besides the variables `a` and `b`.

### Summary

This problem is very straightforward as the core task is simply to sum two integers. Ensure that you properly handle edge cases such as extreme values within the 32-bit integer range.
