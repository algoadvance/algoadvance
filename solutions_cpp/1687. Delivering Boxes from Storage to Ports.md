[Leetcode 1687. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1687)
## Problem Statement
The problem involves several boxes that need to be delivered from a storage to various ports using a truck. Each box has an associated weight and destination port. The rules are:
1. The truck can carry a limited maximum weight.
2. The truck can only carry a limited maximum number of boxes.
3. Delivering to a port where the last box's destination is different from the current port counts as a new trip.

Given a list of boxes, and the constraints on the truck's capacity in terms of weight and number of boxes, you are asked to determine the minimum number of trips required to deliver all the boxes.

**Example:**
```
Input:
boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1],[4,2],[3,2],[2,3],[1,3],[3,1]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 4, maxWeight = 6

Output: 6
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the ports indexed starting at 1?
2. Should our focus only be on minimizing the number of trips disregarding time or any other component?
3. Is it guaranteed that weights and the number of boxes will always allow for at least one box to be transported?

## Strategy
1. We will iterate through the list of boxes while tracking the current load of the truck until it exceeds the `maxWeight` or `maxBoxes`.
2. Maintain two main counters: 
   - The current travel distance (trips due to different ports)
   - The total number of trips
3. When the load exceeds the limits, calculate the number of trips required to deliver the current load, reset the counters, and move on to the next batch of boxes.

Weâ€™ll use a two-pointer technique to maintain the current window of boxes being transported and update trips accordingly.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

int boxDelivering(vector<vector<int>>& boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
    int n = boxes.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX); // dp[i] is the min number of trips to deliver the first i boxes
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    deque<int> dq;
    dq.push_back(0); // initially, we are at port 0

    int j = 0, currentPorts = 0, currentWeight = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        while (j < n && j - i < maxBoxes && currentWeight + boxes[j][1] <= maxWeight) {
            currentWeight += boxes[j][1];
            if (j == 0 || boxes[j][0] != boxes[j - 1][0]) currentPorts++;
            j++;
        }

        if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() < i) dq.pop_front();

        dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + currentPorts);
        if (j < n && (j - i < maxBoxes)) {
            while (!dq.empty() && dp[dq.back()] - dq.back() == dp[i] - i) dq.pop_back();
            dq.push_back(i);
        }

        currentWeight -= boxes[i][1];
        if (i == n - 1 || boxes[i][0] != boxes[i + 1][0]) currentPorts--;
    }

    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> boxes = \{\{1,1},{2,1},{1,1},{4,2},{3,2},{2,3},{1,3},{3,1}};
    int portsCount = 3;
    int maxBoxes = 4;
    int maxWeight = 6;

    cout << boxDelivering(boxes, portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the number of boxes. Each box is processed a constant number of times, and operations within the main loop (like deque operations) are performed in amortized constant time. Therefore, the overall complexity remains linear with respect to the number of boxes.
