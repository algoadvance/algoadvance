[Leetcode 332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l332)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`. Reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK". Thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

Example:
```
Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. One must use all the tickets exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - How many tickets can I assume will be given in the input?
   - Are all airport codes exactly three letters?
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Do we need to handle cases where there is no valid itinerary, or can we assume the input always leads to at least one valid itinerary?
   
3. **Multiple Valid Itineraries**:
   - In case of multiple valid itineraries, should the output itinerary have the smallest lexical order or some other ordering criteria?
   
The following assumptions are typically made based on the problem statement:

- You can assume there are at most 300 tickets.
- Airport codes are always exactly 3 uppercase English letters.
- The input will always form at least one valid itinerary.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - We will use a directed graph where each node represents an airport and each directed edge represents a flight between airports.
   
2. **Hierholzer's Algorithm**:
   - This algorithm is suitable for finding Eulerian paths in graphs. An Eulerian path visits every edge exactly once.
   - Because the problem specifies that the itinerary should start from "JFK", we will modify our algorithm to start from "JFK".
   
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to construct the itinerary.
   - Maintain a priority queue to ensure we choose the next airport in lexical order.
   
4. **Backtracking**:
   - During DFS, once we reach an airport, we backtrack only if all outgoing flights from that airport have been exhausted.
   
5. **Reversing the Order**:
   - Since we are building the itinerary in reverse (end to start), reverse the list at the end to get the correct order.

### Time Complexity

- Building the graph: O(N log N) due to sorting the edges.
- DFS traversal: O(N), where N is the number of edges (tickets).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <map>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
        unordered_map<string, multiset<string>> graph; // Use multiset to maintain lexical order
        vector<string> result;

        // Build the graph
        for (const auto& ticket : tickets) {
            graph[ticket[0]].insert(ticket[1]);
        }

        // DFS traversal from 'JFK'
        deque<string> stack;
        stack.push_back("JFK");

        while (!stack.empty()) {
            string node = stack.back();
            if (graph[node].empty()) {
                result.push_back(node);
                stack.pop_back();
            } else {
                stack.push_back(*graph[node].begin());
                graph[node].erase(graph[node].begin());
            }
        }

        // The result will be in reverse order
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<string>> tickets = {{"MUC", "LHR"}, {"JFK", "MUC"}, {"SFO", "SJC"}, {"LHR", "SFO"}};
    vector<string> itinerary = solution.findItinerary(tickets);

    for (const string& airport : itinerary) {
        cout << airport << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This solution constructs the itinerary by leveraging DFS combined with a stack to backtrack correctly. The construction of the result in reverse allows for an easy flip at the end to obtain the final itinerary starting from "JFK".
