[Leetcode 2182. Construct String With Repeat Limit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2182)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `repeatLimit`, construct a new string `result` using the characters from `s` such that no character appears more than `repeatLimit` times consecutively. The resulting string should be lexicographically largest possible. Return the resultant string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
   - What are the constraints on `repeatLimit`?

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - If multiple strings satisfy the conditions, should we always return the lexicographically largest one?
   - Can the resulting string contain characters in any order except when limited by `repeatLimit`?

3. **Character Considerations:**
   - Are the characters in string `s` always lowercase English letters?
   - Should leading or trailing spaces in the resulting string be considered?

Let's assume the following for this problem:
- The length of string `s` can be up to 10^5.
- `repeatLimit` is a positive integer.
- We are working with lowercase English letters.
- The result should be lexicographically the largest possible.

## Strategy

1. **Character Count:**
   - Count occurrences of each character.
   
2. **Max Heap:**
   - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of characters in descending lexicographical order.
   
3. **Construct Result:**
   - Repeatedly add the highest possible character while observing the `repeatLimit`.
   - If the character exceeds `repeatLimit`, place a different character and then resume.

4. **Handling Exceeding Characters:**
   - When adding a different character to prevent exceeding `repeatLimit`, make sure to return readily to the original highest character after allowing one insertion.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>

std::string constructStringWithRepeatLimit(std::string s, int repeatLimit) {
    // Create frequency map
    std::unordered_map<char, int> freq;
    for (char ch : s) {
        freq[ch]++;
    }
  
    // Max-Heap - priority queue
    std::priority_queue<std::pair<char, int>> maxHeap;
    for (auto& [ch, count] : freq) {
        maxHeap.push({ch, count});
    }
  
    std::string result;
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        auto [firstChar, firstCount] = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
    
        int useCount = std::min(firstCount, repeatLimit);
        result.append(useCount, firstChar);
        firstCount -= useCount;
    
        if (!maxHeap.empty() && firstCount > 0) {
            auto [secondChar, secondCount] = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
      
            result.push_back(secondChar);
            if (--secondCount > 0) {
                maxHeap.push({secondChar, secondCount});
            }
      
            if (firstCount > 0) {
                maxHeap.push({firstChar, firstCount});
            }
        } else if (firstCount > 0) {
            // If only one char remains and it exceeds repeatLimit, return early.
            return result;
        }
    }
  
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "cczazcc";
    int repeatLimit = 2;
    std::cout << constructStringWithRepeatLimit(s, repeatLimit) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting frequency:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Heap operations:** O(26 log 26) for push and pop operations which simplifies to O(1) in practical terms since the maximum size is constant (26).
- **Result construction:** O(n) since each character in `s` is processed.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n) which is efficient given the constraints.
