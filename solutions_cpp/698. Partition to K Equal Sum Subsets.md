[Leetcode 698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l698)
### Problem Statement

The problem "Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets" is defined as follows:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, determine if it is possible to partition this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can some elements be zero or negative?**
   - No, all elements in the array are positive integers.

2. **Is k guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of the array?**
   - Yes, k is always less than or equal to the length of the array.

3. **Can the array be modified?**
   - Yes, in the context of solving the problem, modifying the array is allowed.

4. **Are duplicate elements in the array allowed?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate elements in the array.

### Strategy

We need to partition the array into `k` subsets such that each subset has the same sum. Here's the strategy:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - Calculate the total sum of the array. If this sum is not divisible by `k`, then it's impossible to partition as required.
   - Determine the target sum for each subset as `target = total_sum / k`.

2. **Backtracking:**
   - Use a backtracking approach to try and form subsets with the target sum.
   - Keep track of which elements have been used in forming subsets.
   - Recursively attempt to form each subset, reducing the target sum as elements are added to a subset. 

3. **Pruning:**
   - Sort the array in descending order. Larger elements first helps in faster invalidation of paths that can't reach the target sum.
   - If an element is larger than the target sum, return false.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canPartitionKSubsets(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int val : nums) {
            totalSum += val;
        }
        
        if (totalSum % k != 0) return false;
        
        int target = totalSum / k;
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), std::greater<int>());
        std::vector<bool> used(nums.size(), false);
        
        return backtrack(nums, used, k, 0, 0, target);
    }
    
private:
    bool backtrack(const std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<bool>& used, int k, int currentSum, int startIndex, int target) {
        if (k == 1) return true;  // Only one subset remaining, it must be valid
        if (currentSum == target) {
            return backtrack(nums, used, k - 1, 0, 0, target);
        }
        
        for (int i = startIndex; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (used[i] || currentSum + nums[i] > target) continue;
            used[i] = true;
            if (backtrack(nums, used, k, currentSum + nums[i], i + 1, target)) {
                return true;
            }
            used[i] = false;
            
            // Optimization: If adding the current element can't satisfy the condition, no need to try other elements
            if (currentSum == 0) return false;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Time Complexity:**
   - `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Backtracking Time Complexity:**
   - There are potentially `O(2^n)` subsets to check in the worst case, but pruning and sorting elements reduce the actual number of checks significantly.

3. **Overall Time Complexity:**
   - The backtracking solution is optimized with pruning and sorting, but in the worst case scenario, it is still exponential: `O(k * 2^n)`. However, typical cases will be faster due to early exits on invalid paths.
