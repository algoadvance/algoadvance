[Leetcode 103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l103)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the tree be empty?
   **A:** Yes, the tree can be empty. In such a case, the function should return an empty list.
2. **Q:** How large can the tree be (i.e., number of nodes)?
   **A:** The constraints are typically reasonable for a tree traversal problem, but you should ensure the solution is efficient enough for large trees with, say, up to 10^4 nodes.
3. **Q:** What should be done if only one node exists in the tree?
   **A:** If there is only one node, the output should be a list with one sublist containing that single node.

### Strategy
1. Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with the help of a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
2. Use an indicator (`leftToRight`) to keep track of the current traversal direction (left-to-right or right-to-left).
3. For each level, collect nodes in a list, and based on the direction indicated by `leftToRight`, append this list to the result (reverse the list if needed).
4. Flip the `leftToRight` indicator after processing each level.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), mainly due to the storage requirement for the result vector, and auxiliary space used by the queue, which in the worst case, holds nodes from the last level.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <deque>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (root == nullptr) return result;
        
        queue<TreeNode*> nodeQueue;
        nodeQueue.push(root);
        bool leftToRight = true;
        
        while (!nodeQueue.empty()) {
            int size = nodeQueue.size();
            deque<int> currentLevel;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = nodeQueue.front();
                nodeQueue.pop();
                
                if (leftToRight) {
                    currentLevel.push_back(currentNode->val);
                } else {
                    currentLevel.push_front(currentNode->val);
                }
                
                if (currentNode->left != nullptr) {
                    nodeQueue.push(currentNode->left);
                }
                if (currentNode->right != nullptr) {
                    nodeQueue.push(currentNode->right);
                }
            }
            result.push_back(vector<int>(currentLevel.begin(), currentLevel.end()));
            leftToRight = !leftToRight;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Queue Initialization**: A queue (`nodeQueue`) is initialized and the root node is pushed into it if the root is not null.
2. **Traversal**: While there are nodes in the queue,
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (`size`).
   - Use a deque (`currentLevel`) to store the values of nodes at the current level.
   - Iterate through nodes at the current level. If `leftToRight` is true, append the values to the end of the deque; otherwise, append to the front.
   - Push the left and right children of the current node into the queue if they exist.
3. **Direction Toggle**: After finishing traversing a level, toggle the `leftToRight` flag.
4. **Store Result**: Convert the deque to a vector and store it in the result list.

This ensures that each level is properly captured in zigzag manner.
