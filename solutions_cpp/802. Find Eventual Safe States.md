[Leetcode 802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l802)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge. The graph is represented by an adjacency list `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes `j` for which the edge `i -> j` exists. A node is eventually safe if and only if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (i.e., a node with no outgoing edges). 

Return an array containing all the eventual safe nodes in ascending order.

#### Example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  [2,4,5,6]
  ```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the graph contain cycles?**
   - Yes, the graph can contain cycles.

2. **Are self-loops allowed in the graph?**
   - Yes, a node can have a self-loop as it is valid for it to point to itself.

3. **Can there be multiple edges between two nodes?**
   - No, the graph is given as an adjacency list where each node points to a list of unique nodes.

4. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` will be between 1 and 10^4.

### Strategy

We can solve the problem using **depth-first search (DFS)** combined with a **memoization** strategy to identify safe nodes. We'll also use the following state labels to keep track:
- `0`: The node has not been visited yet.
- `1`: The node is being visited (still in the recursion stack).
- `2`: The node is safe (all paths from it lead to a terminal node).
- `3`: The node is not safe (it leads to a cycle).

Hereâ€™s the approach:
1. Initially, mark all nodes as unvisited (`0`).
2. Define a DFS function that will traverse from the current node:
   - If the node is in the recursion stack (`1`), mark it as unsafe (`3`).
   - If the node is safe (`2`), no need to process further.
   - Recursively check the connected nodes.
   - If any connected node leads to an unsafe path, then the current node is also unsafe.
   - Otherwise, mark it safe.
3. Collect all nodes marked as safe (`2`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<int> state(n, 0); // 0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: safe, 3: unsafe

        vector<int> result;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (isSafe(i, graph, state)) {
                result.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

private:
    bool isSafe(int node, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& state) {
        if (state[node] != 0) {
            return state[node] == 2;
        }

        state[node] = 1; // Mark node as visiting

        for (int next_node : graph[node]) {
            if (!isSafe(next_node, graph, state)) {
                state[node] = 3; // Mark as unsafe due to unsafe neighbor
                return false;
            }
        }

        state[node] = 2; // Mark as safe
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)
  - Each node and edge is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(V)\)
  - Storage for the state vector and recursion stack.

This ensures we efficiently find all eventual safe nodes in the given graph.
