[Leetcode 1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1594)
### Problem Statement

Given a grid of integers `A`, you need to find the maximum non-negative product of a path in the matrix. The path should start from the top-left corner of the matrix and end in the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down at any point in time. Return the maximum non-negative product modulo `10^9 + 7`. If no such path exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Dimensions**: Is there a constraint on the size of the grid?
   - Typically, we assume a reasonable size for competitive problems (e.g., `1 <= m, n <= 15` where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns).
   
2. **Range of Values**: What is the range of the integer values in the grid?
   - This will help understand if there can be zero or negative values in the grid which are crucial considerations for handling paths correctly.

3. **Path Validity**: Are we guaranteed to always have a valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right?
   - This determines if returning -1 is necessary when a path is not achievable.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll employ dynamic programming. Here’s the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Create two DP tables `max_product` and `min_product` to keep track of the maximum and minimum products encountered up to each cell `(i, j)`.
   - `max_product[i][j]` will store the maximum product path ending at cell `(i, j)`.
   - `min_product[i][j]` will store the minimum product path ending at cell `(i, j)` because multiplying two negative numbers can result in a positive product.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing the top-left cell `max_product[0][0]` and `min_product[0][0]` with the grid's first element.

3. **Filling the DP Tables**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the products from the cell directly above `(i-1, j)` and from the cell directly to the left `(i, j-1)`.
   - Update `max_product[i][j]` and `min_product[i][j]` based on these possible transitions.

4. **Compute Results**:
   - The result is found at the bottom-right cell of the `max_product` table. If this value is non-negative, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`. If it’s negative, return -1.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns. This is because we are iterating through each cell of the grid once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) due to the additional space required for the `max_product` and `min_product` tables.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the proposed strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProductPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<long long>> max_product(m, vector<long long>(n));
        vector<vector<long long>> min_product(m, vector<long long>(n));

        max_product[0][0] = min_product[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        // Fill the first row and first column
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            max_product[i][0] = min_product[i][0] = max_product[i-1][0] * grid[i][0];
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            max_product[0][j] = min_product[0][j] = max_product[0][j-1] * grid[0][j];
        }

        // Fill the remaining cells
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] >= 0) {
                    max_product[i][j] = max(max_product[i-1][j], max_product[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j];
                    min_product[i][j] = min(min_product[i-1][j], min_product[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j];
                } else {
                    max_product[i][j] = min(min_product[i-1][j], min_product[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j];
                    min_product[i][j] = max(max_product[i-1][j], max_product[i][j-1]) * grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        long long result = max_product[m-1][n-1];
        return result < 0 ? -1 : result % MOD;
    }
};
```

This solution should address all constraints and handle various edge cases effectively.
