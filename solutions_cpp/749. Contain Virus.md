[Leetcode 749. Contain Virus](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l749)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an `m x n` matrix `isInfected` where `isInfected[i][j] == 0` represents uninfected cells, and `isInfected[i][j] == 1` represents cells being infected by the virus. A wall (a one-dimensional integer) can be installed to prevent the spread of the virus from an infected cell into four neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right).

Each day, the virus spreads to all adjacent cells in all four directions but stops when it hits a wall.

You need to find out how many walls you need to install to contain the virus completely, and then return the number of walls installed.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the dimensions of the matrix `m` and `n`? (Assume reasonable constraints typical of LeetCode problems.)
   - Is it possible for `isInfected` matrix to be all `0s`? (Yes, and the output would be `0` walls.)
  
2. **Output**:
   - Is it required to return the number of walls required each day, or just the final number?
   - What should be the output if the virus cannot be fully contained?

### Strategy:

1. **Identify infection clusters**: Each cluster is a connected group of `1`s.
2. **Determine walls required**: For each cluster, identify how many walls are required to contain it, and how many new infections it will cause the next day.
3. **Contain the most dangerous cluster**: Install walls around the cluster that would cause the most new infections.
4. **Continue until all clusters are contained**: Repeat the process for subsequent days until there are no new infected cells left to spread.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int containVirus(vector<vector<int>>& isInfected) {
        int m = isInfected.size(), n = isInfected[0].size();
        int result = 0;
        
        while (true) {
            // To store information about each cluster.
            vector<vector<int>> clusters;
            vector<vector<int>> wallsRequired;
            vector<unordered_set<int>> potentialNewInfections;
            vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
            
            // Identify all clusters in the grid.
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if (isInfected[i][j] == 1 && !visited[i][j]) {
                        vector<int> cluster;
                        vector<int> walls(1, 0); // walls[0] keeps track of walls required.

                                int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                                if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {

                                }
                            }
                        }
                        
                        clusters.push_back(cluster);

                    maxSpreadIdx = i;
                }
            }
            
            // Contain the most dangerous cluster.
            result += wallsRequired[maxSpreadIdx][0];
            for (int cell : clusters[maxSpreadIdx]) {
                int x = cell / n, y = cell % n;
                isInfected[x][y] = -1;  // Mark as contained.
            }

                    isInfected[x][y] = 1;
                }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:

- Identifying clusters: \(O(m \times n)\)
- Checking potential spreads: \(O(m \times n)\)
- Each step involves multiple BFS/DFS traversals which are \(O(m \times n)\).

Overall, in the worst case, the complexity remains \(O(m \times n)\) due to the BFS/DFS traversals required to inspect and contain the virus.

Note: This is a basic version. Depending on the actual complexity and constraints of the problem, additional optimizations might be necessary.
