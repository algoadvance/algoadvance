[Leetcode 913. Cat and Mouse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l913)
### Problem Statement

A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, at positions `1` and `2` respectively.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.

Mouse starts at node 1 and Cat starts at node 2. There is also a Hole at node 0.

During each move, Mouse and Cat alternate turns with Mouse going first. In each turn, they can travel along any edge of the graph. However, the Cat cannot travel to the Hole (node 0). 

The game can end in three possible ways:
1. If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.
2. If the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.
3. If a position repeats (i.e., the game is in a loop), the game is a draw.

You are given a `graph`, `graph[a][b]` represents a bidirectional edge between node `a` and node `b`.

Return the outcome of the game:
- 1 if the mouse wins,
- 2 if the cat wins,
- 0 if it's a draw.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum size of the graph?**
   - The graph size can be from 3 up to 50 nodes.
2. **Can the graph have cycles?**
   - Yes, the graph can have cycles.
3. **Is the graph connected?**
   - The problem does not explicitly state this, so the graph might be disconnected.
4. **Does each node have at least one edge?**
   - It can be assumed from the input format that nodes do have edges as `graph[a][b]` implicitly suggests a connected edge.

### Strategy

The strategy involves using Dynamic Programming and Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the outcome. The main idea is to simulate the game and track the states using a 3-dimensional table:
- `dp[mouse][cat][turn]`:
  - `mouse` is the position of the mouse.
  - `cat` is the position of the cat.
  - `turn` is 1 if it's Mouse's turn and 2 if it's Cat's turn.

#### Steps
1. **Initialize State Values:**
   - If the mouse is at the hole (node 0), the mouse wins.
   - If the cat catches the mouse, the cat wins.
   - If repeating a state: Mark as a draw initially.

2. **BFS/Multistage DP:**
   - From the leaf nodes (base cases where outcomes are straightforward) propagate backwards to determine the results for initial states.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^3)` because of the three-dimensional DP table (`n` being the number of nodes).

### Code

Here's a detailed implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
    // Define enumeration for result
    static const int MOUSE_WIN = 1;
    static const int CAT_WIN = 2;
    static const int DRAW = 0;

public:
    int catMouseGame(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int N = graph.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(N, vector<vector<int>>(N, vector<int>(3, -1)));  // 3D DP table
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> degree(N, vector<vector<int>>(N, vector<int>(3, 0)));  // Degree counter

        // BFS queue: (mouse, cat, turn)
        queue<tuple<int, int, int>> q;

        // Initialize base cases (Mouse at 0 wins, Cat catches Mouse, etc.)
        for(int m = 0; m < N; ++m) {
            for(int t = 1; t <= 2; ++t) {
                dp[0][m][t] = MOUSE_WIN;  // Mouse wins by reaching the Hole
                q.push({0, m, t});
                if(m > 0) { // Do not count Cat at Hole
                    dp[m][m][t] = CAT_WIN;  // Cat wins by catching the Mouse
                    q.push({m, m, t});
                }
            }
        }

        // Initialize out-degree for each state
        for(int m = 0; m < N; ++m) {
            for(int c = 0; c < N; ++c) {
                degree[m][c][1] = graph[m].size(); // Mouse's turn
                degree[m][c][2] = graph[c].size(); // Cat's turn
                for(int nextCat : graph[c]) {
                    if(nextCat == 0) degree[m][c][2]--; // Cat cannot move into the hole
                }
            }
        }

        // Process all initial states
        while(!q.empty()) {
            auto [mouse, cat, turn] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            int result = dp[mouse][cat][turn];

            // Predecessor states
            vector<tuple<int, int, int>> preds;
            if (turn == 2) {
                // Cat's turn, so previous turn was Mouse's turn
                for (int prevMouse : graph[mouse]) {
                    preds.emplace_back(prevMouse, cat, 1);
                }
            } else {
                // Mouse's turn, so previous turn was Cat's turn
                for (int prevCat : graph[cat]) {
                    if (prevCat != 0) preds.emplace_back(mouse, prevCat, 2);
                }
            }

            // Update predecessors
            for (auto [pm, pc, t] : preds) {
                if (dp[pm][pc][t] == -1) {  // Only update if undecided
                    if ((t == 1 && result == MOUSE_WIN) || (t == 2 && result == CAT_WIN)) {
                        dp[pm][pc][t] = result;
                        q.push({pm, pc, t});
                    } else {
                        degree[pm][pc][t]--;
                        if (degree[pm][pc][t] == 0) {
                            dp[pm][pc][t] = result;
                            q.push({pm, pc, t});
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[1][2][1];
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the DP table and degree counter.
   - Set base cases (Mouse at Hole wins, Cat catching Mouse wins).

2. **BFS Queue:**
   - Use BFS to propagate backward from the base cases.
   - Use a queue to process state changes iteratively.

3. **State Propagation:**
   - For each state, calculate predecessor states based on whose turn it is, and update DP table accordingly.

4. **Result:**
   - Return the result from the perspective of the initial state (Mouse at 1, Cat at 2, Mouse's turn).

This approach ensures all states are evaluated accurately, and the outcomes are determined based on the game's rules.
