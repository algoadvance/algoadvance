[Leetcode 2942. Find Words Containing Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2942)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a character `ch`. A string in `words` is considered containing `ch` if the character is present in the string.

Return an array of all the strings in `words` that contain the character `ch`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:**
   - Is `words` guaranteed to be a non-empty array of strings? 
   - Can the character `ch` be any valid character including whitespace and special characters? 
   - What should be the output if no strings contain the character `ch`?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output array maintain the order of input strings in `words`?
    
## Strategy

1. **Input Parsing and Edge Case Handling:**
   - Ensure the input is not an empty list of words.
   - Handle edge cases where `ch` is not present in any string within `words`.

2. **Filtering:**
   - Traverse the list `words` and for each word, check if `ch` is present.
   - If `ch` is found in the word, include it in the result list.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - Return the list of words that contain the character `ch`.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words in the list and `m` is the average length of the words. This complexity arises because we may need to check each character of each word.
- **Space Complexity:** O(p), where `p` is the total length of the words that contain the character `ch`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

vector<string> findWordsContainingCharacter(vector<string>& words, char ch) {
    vector<string> result;
    for (const string& word : words) {
        // Check if the character `ch` is in the word
        if (word.find(ch) != string::npos) {
            result.push_back(word);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Explanation

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

1. **Check Each Word:**
   - A loop iterates over the list of words.
   - For each word, `word.find(ch) != string::npos` checks if the character `ch` is present in the word.
   
2. **Add to Result:**
   - If the character `ch` is found in the word, it is added to the `result` list.
   
3. **Return Result:**
   - The function returns the `result` list containing all words that have the character `ch`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently filter out the required words while maintaining simplicity and readability.
