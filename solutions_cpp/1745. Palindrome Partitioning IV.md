[Leetcode 1745. Palindrome Partitioning IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1745)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase letters. Return `true` if it is possible to split the string `s` into three non-empty palindromic substrings. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a palindrome in this context?**
   A palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Could the string contain special characters or uppercase letters?**
   No, the problem states that the string `s` contains only lowercase letters.

3. **Is there a minimum or maximum length for the input string `s`?**
   The constraint on the string length will typically be defined in the problem, but for the purpose of algorithm design, we can assume general string lengths that fit typical constraints on platforms like LeetCode (e.g., up to `10^4` characters).

4. **Are the substrings required to be contiguous segments of the original string?**
   Yes, the substrings must be contiguous segments of the string `s`.

### Strategy

1. **Precompute Palindromic Substrings:**
   - Create a 2D boolean table `isPalindrome` where `isPalindrome[i][j]` is `true` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction:**
   - Use dynamic programming (DP) to fill the `isPalindrome` table in O(n^2) time. Start by checking single characters and progressively check longer substrings by expanding around centers.

3. **Try All Possible Splits:**
   - Iterate over possible splits of `s` into three parts:
     - Let `i` be the end of the first part `s[0:i+1]`.
     - Let `j` be the end of the second part `s[i+1:j+1]`.
     - The third part would then be `s[j+1:]`.
   - Check if each of these parts is a palindrome using the precomputed `isPalindrome` table.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If any valid triplet of palindromic substrings is found, return `true`.
   - If no such triplet is found by the end of iteration, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPartitioning(std::string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        std::vector<std::vector<bool>> isPalindrome(n, std::vector<bool>(n, false));

        // Fill the isPalindrome table
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            isPalindrome[i][i] = true;  // Every single character is a palindrome.
        }

        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (len == 2) {
                    isPalindrome[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]);
                } else {
                    isPalindrome[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j] && isPalindrome[i+1][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Try all possible splits
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
            if (isPalindrome[0][i]) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                    if (isPalindrome[i + 1][j] && isPalindrome[j + 1][n - 1]) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Precomputation (DP Table):**
   - Constructing the `isPalindrome` table takes O(n^2) time as we need to check each substring of `s`.

2. **Possible Splits:**
   - Trying all possible splits also takes O(n^2) time in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity for this solution is O(n^2).

This dual O(n^2) complexity is efficient for typical input sizes constrained to up to `10^4` characters. The space complexity, dominated by the `isPalindrome` table, is also O(n^2).
