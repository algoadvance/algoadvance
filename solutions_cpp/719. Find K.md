[Leetcode 719. Find K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l719)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th smallest distance among all the pairs `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the length constraints for `nums`?
   - What range of values can `nums` and `k` take?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be a single integer representing the `k`-th smallest distance?

3. **Repetition:**
   - Can the elements in `nums` be repeated?
   
## Provided Information
- The input is an array `nums` and an integer `k`.
- The problem asks for the `k`-th smallest pair distance.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting:** Sort the array `nums` to make pairwise distance calculations easier.
2. **Binary Search:** Use binary search to find the `k`-th smallest pair distance.
3. **Helper Function:** Implement a helper function that counts how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to a given value.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Sort the Array:** Begin by sorting the array `nums`.
2. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - Define the search rangeâ€”`low` (0) and `high` (the difference between the maximum and minimum value in the array).
3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - In each iteration, compute the mid-point of the search range.
   - Use the helper function to count the number of pairs with distances less than or equal to the mid-point.
   - Adjust the search range based on whether the count is less than or greater than `k`.
4. **Helper Function:** Implement a function to count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to a given distance leveraging the property of the sorted array.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Function to count pairs with distance <= mid
int countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int mid) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        while (j < n && nums[j] - nums[i] <= mid) {
            ++j;
        }
        count += j - i - 1;
    }
    return count;
}

int smallestDistancePair(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Sort the input array
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    int n = nums.size();
    int low = 0;
    int high = nums[n - 1] - nums[0];
    
    // Binary search for the k-th smallest distance
    while (low < high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        
        int count = countPairs(nums, mid);
        
        if (count < k) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    
    return low;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 1};
    int k = 1;
    cout << "k-th smallest distance is: " << smallestDistancePair(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** The time complexity of sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Binary Search:**
   - Each iteration of the binary search takes \(O(n)\) due to the pair counting.
   - The binary search itself runs for \(O(\log (\text{max} - \text{min}))\) where max and min are the maximum and minimum values in the array respectively.
   
   Therefore, the overall complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log (\text{max} - \text{min}))\).

By following this approach, we ensure that we efficiently find the k-th smallest pair distance using performant algorithms and data structures.
