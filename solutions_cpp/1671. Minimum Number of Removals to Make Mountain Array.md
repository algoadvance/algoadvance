[Leetcode 1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1671)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1671: Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array

You are given an integer array `nums` which has a length of `n`. A mountain array is defined as an array that:

1. Has at least three elements.
2. There exists some index `i` (0-indexed) with `0 < i < n-1` such that:
   - `nums[0] < nums[1] < ... < nums[i]`
   - `nums[i] > nums[i+1] > ... > nums[n-1]`

In other words, it needs to be strictly increasing until some peak element at index `i` and then strictly decreasing.

You need to return the **minimum** number of elements that need to be removed to make the input array `nums` a mountain array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: Can `nums` contain negative numbers, and how large can the array be?
2. **Edge Cases**: What should the function return if `nums` is already a mountain array?
3. **Constraints**:
   - `3 <= nums.length <= 1000`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Strategy

To determine the minimum number of removals to get a mountain array, we can use the concept of Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) and Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS). Here is the plan:

1. **Define LIS for every element**: Compute the length of the increasing subsequence ending at each index.
2. **Define LDS for every element**: Compute the length of the decreasing subsequence starting from each index.
3. **Combine LIS and LDS**: For each possible peak, compute the mountain array length. The total length of the mountain array that includes `nums[i]` is given by `LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1`.
4. Find the peak that yields the longest mountain array.
5. Subtract the length of this mountain array from the total length of `nums` to get the minimum removals.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimumMountainRemovals(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    
    // Compute LIS ending at each index
    vector<int> lis(n, 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Compute LDS starting at each index
    vector<int> lds(n, 1);
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int j = n - 1; j > i; --j) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                lds[i] = max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the longest mountain array length
    int maxMountainLength = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1) { // Ensure both side sequences are valid
            maxMountainLength = max(maxMountainLength, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);
        }
    }
    
    return n - maxMountainLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Computing LIS takes O(n^2) time.
- Computing LDS also takes O(n^2) time.
- Combining them in a loop takes O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraint \( n \leq 1000 \).
