[Leetcode 151. Reverse Words in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l151)
## Problem Statement
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**Example:**
```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
```
Input: "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```
```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty? (Typically, it could be empty so assume it can be.)
   - Can we consider special characters within words?
   - Should we handle tabs or newlines, or is it guaranteed to only contain spaces for separation?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Is there any specific constraint on the length of the output string?

## Strategy
1. **Trim Leading/Trailing Spaces:** First, we will trim any leading or trailing spaces from the input string.
2. **Split Words:** We will split the string by spaces into individual words.
3. **Reverse Words:** We will reverse the order of these words.
4. **Join Words:** Finally, we will join these reversed words with a single space to form the final reversed string.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::string reverseWords(std::string s) {
    // Trim leading and trailing spaces
    s.erase(s.begin(), std::find_if(s.begin(), s.end(), [](int ch) {
        return !std::isspace(ch);
    }));
    s.erase(std::find_if(s.rbegin(), s.rend(), [](int ch) {
        return !std::isspace(ch);
    }).base(), s.end());

    std::istringstream stream(s);
    std::string word;
    std::vector<std::string> words;

    // Split by space and store words in the vector
    while (stream >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }

    // Reverse the vector of words
    std::reverse(words.begin(), words.end());

    // Join words with a single space
    std::ostringstream reversedStream;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        if (i != 0) {
            reversedStream << " ";
        }
        reversedStream << words[i];
    }

    return reversedStream.str();
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "  the sky is blue  ";
    std::cout << "\"" << reverseWords(s) << "\"" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Trimming spaces:** The complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
- **Splitting words:** This operation takes \(O(n)\) because we need to traverse the string once.
- **Reversing words:** Reversing a vector of words takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of words.
- **Joining words:** This operation also takes \(O(n)\), as we iterate over all characters in the words.

So, the total time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
