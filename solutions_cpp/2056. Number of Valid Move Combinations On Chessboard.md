[Leetcode 2056. Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2056)
## Problem Statement

The problem requires us to determine the number of valid ways to move k pieces on an N x N chessboard so that none of them attack each other. Different types of chess pieces have different movement patterns. Our task is to implement a function in C++ that returns the number of valid configurations. 

To clarify:
- Each piece has a specific movement pattern.
- No two pieces can attack each other.
- We need to consider all potential placements of the pieces.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the types of pieces involved?** Understanding their movements helps in formulating a strategy.
2. **Are all the k pieces identical, or can they be of different types?**
3. **Can multiple pieces of the same type be placed on the board?**
4. **Is the problem requesting placements for a specific type of chess pieces like rooks, queens, etc., or different combinations of pieces are involved?**
5. **What does it mean for pieces to "attack each other" exactly? Are we considering standard chess rules for attacks?**

Let's assume:
- The piece in question is a queen (thus it attacks all squares in the same row, column, and diagonals).
- All k pieces are queens.
- We use standard chess rules for attacking moves.

## Strategy

The problem then boils down to the classic "N Queens Problem" for k â‰¤ N considering an N x N board:
1. **Backtracking Approach:** Use backtracking to place each queen on the board one by one, ensuring that no two queens are in a position to attack each other.
2. **Check Validity:** For each placement, ensure the queen is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as any previously placed queen.
3. **Count Configurations:** Record valid placements and count them as we recursively explore possible configurations.

## Code in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countValidMoves(int n, int k) {
        if (k > n) return 0; // Not possible to place more than n queens on an n x n board
        // Vector to store positions of queens
        std::vector<int> position(n, -1);
        return placeQueens(position, 0, n, k);
    }

private:
    int placeQueens(std::vector<int>& position, int row, int n, int k) {
        if (row == k) return 1; // All k queens placed successfully
        int ways = 0;
        for (int col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
            if (isValid(position, row, col, n)) {
                position[row] = col;
                ways += placeQueens(position, row + 1, n, k);
                position[row] = -1; // Backtrack
            }
        }
        return ways;
    }

    bool isValid(const std::vector<int>& position, int row, int col, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < row; ++i) {
            if (position[i] == col || position[i] - i == col - row || position[i] + i == col + row) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 8; // Size of the chessboard (8x8)
    int k = 8; // Number of queens to place
    std::cout << "Number of valid move combinations: " << solution.countValidMoves(n, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

### Time Complexity
- The worst-case time complexity for a backtracking solution of the N Queens problem is O(N!), where N is the size of the board.
- Given that we are considering backtracking to place up to k queens:
  - The backtracking has a complexity of O(K * N!). However, the outer branching factor reduces gradually since fewer positions are valid as more queens are placed.

### Space Complexity
- The extra space used is O(N) to store the positions of queens.
