[Leetcode 1824. Minimum Sideway Jumps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1824)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 1-based indexed array `obstacles` of non-negative integers. `obstacles[i]` describes the type of obstacle present at the `i-th` point along a `3-lane road. 
- `obstacles[i] = 0` means no obstacles exist at the `i-th` point.
- `obstacles[i] = 1` means there is an obstacle in lane 1.
- `obstacles[i] = 2` means there is an obstacle in lane 2.
- `obstacles[i] = 3` means there is an obstacle in lane 3.

There is a frog starting at lane 2 (middle lane) of the road, and it wants to travel to the last point (n-th point) in the minimum number of side jumps.

The frog can only travel forward by one point or make a side jump to change its lane. Side jumps are optional but can be made only in the forward direction to avoid obstacles. When making a side jump, the frog can skip multiple lanes at once.

Return the minimum number of side jumps required to reach the last point.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the `obstacles` array?
   
   The maximum length is 500,000.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Can the input `obstacles` array be empty?
     
     No, the array has at least one element.
   
   - Are there any invalid obstacle placements?
     
     No, obstacles are placed according to the problem constraints and are valid.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming table `dp[lane][i]` where `dp[lane][i]` is the minimum number of sideway jumps required to reach position `i` on lane `lane`.
   - Initialize `dp[2][0]` (starting point at lane 2) to 0 and all other `dp[lane][0]` to infinity since the frog starts from lane 2.
   - Process each lane at each position considering forward movement (if no obstacles) and possible side jumps if there are obstacles ahead.
   - Update the `dp` table based on these movements to track the minimum jumps required.
   - The answer will be the minimum value among `dp[1][n-1]`, `dp[2][n-1]`, and `dp[3][n-1]` where `n-1` is the last position in the array.

2. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Optimize the table updates to avoid unnecessary recalculations and ensure efficiency.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm will process each lane for each position exactly once leading to a complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the `obstacles` array.
- **Space Complexity**: We'll use an auxiliary space to store the dynamic programming table which is O(3n), simplifying to O(n).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSideJumps(vector<int>& obstacles) {
    int n = obstacles.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(3, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    // Initialize start position
    dp[1][0] = 0;  // Lane 2 index is 1 in this 0-indexed dp array

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int lane = 0; lane < 3; ++lane) {
            if (obstacles[i] != lane + 1) {  // No obstacle on this lane at position i
                dp[lane][i] = dp[lane][i - 1];
            }
        }
        for (int lane = 0; lane < 3; ++lane) {
            if (obstacles[i] != lane + 1) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k) {
                    if (k != lane && obstacles[i] != k + 1) {
                        dp[lane][i] = min(dp[lane][i], dp[k][i - 1] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // The minimum number of sideway jumps needed at the end point n-1
    return min({ dp[0][n-1], dp[1][n-1], dp[2][n-1] });
}
```

### Explanation

- The code initializes the `dp` array with very large values (`INT_MAX`), except for the starting position.
- It processes each lane at each position, updating the `dp` table by considering both direct forward moves and possible side jumps while avoiding obstacles.
- Finally, it returns the minimum number of sideway jumps required to reach the last position across all lanes.
