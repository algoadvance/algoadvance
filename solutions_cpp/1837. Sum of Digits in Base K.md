[Leetcode 1837. Sum of Digits in Base K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1837)
Certainly. Let's break this down into several sections to make sure we solve the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n` (in base 10) and an integer `k`, return the sum of the digits of `n` after converting `n` from base 10 to base `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Numbers:**
   - What are the limits for the integer `n`? 
   - What are the limits for base `k`?

2. **Negative Numbers:**
   - Is `n` guaranteed to be non-negative?

3. **Expected Output:**
   - Should the result always be an integer?
   
The problem is quite straightforward and typical constraints for such problems usually are:
- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\)
- \(2 \leq k \leq 10\)

But these need confirming from specific problem constraints.

### Example

```
Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: 34 in base 6 is 54, and 5 + 4 is 9.
```

### Strategy

1. **Convert `n` to base `k`:** 
   - Use modulo and division to convert the number from base 10 to base `k`.

2. **Sum the Digits:**
   - Sum the digits of the resulting number from the above conversion.

### Code

Here is the code to achieve the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int sumOfDigitsInBaseK(int n, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    
    // Convert n to base k and sum the digits
    while (n > 0) {
        sum += n % k;
        n /= k;
    }
    
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    int n = 34, k = 6;
    // Example usage of the function:
    cout << sumOfDigitsInBaseK(n, k) << endl; // Output should be 9
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion Step:** `O(log_k(n))` which is the number of steps needed to reduce `n` to 0 when dividing by `k`.
- **Summing Digits:** Each step of the division contributes constant time to the sum process.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log_k(n))`. This is efficient for inputs within typical constraints.

### Recap

1. Convert `n` to base `k` using modulo and division.
2. Sum the digits obtained from this conversion.
3. The algorithm is efficient with a logarithmic time complexity relative to the size of `n` with respect to base `k`.
