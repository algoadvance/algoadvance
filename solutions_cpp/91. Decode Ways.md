[Leetcode 91. Decode Ways](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l91)
## Problem Statement

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (some results may be invalid).

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "0"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no character that is mapped to a number starting with '0'. Hence, no valid decode ways.
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The string `s` will only contain digits and has a length between `1` and `100`.
2. **Validity of the Input:**
   - Can `s` contain invalid characters? 
     - No, `s` will only contain digits.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` will represent the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0] = 1` (An empty string has one way to be decoded, which is not decoding at all).
   - If `s[0]` is not '0', then `dp[1] = 1`; otherwise, `dp[1] = 0`.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each character at position `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is not '0', then `dp[i] += dp[i-1]` (Single character decode).
     - If the substring `s[i-2:i]` (i.e., two characters) is a valid decoding (between "10" to "26"), then `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.
4. **Final Answer**:
   - The final answer will be `dp[n]` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the string once. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the `dp` array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int numDecodings(std::string s) {
        if (s.empty() || s[0] == '0') return 0;

        int n = s.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // Base case: an empty string has one way to be decoded
        dp[1] = s[0] != '0' ? 1 : 0;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            int oneDigit = std::stoi(s.substr(i - 1, 1));
            int twoDigits = std::stoi(s.substr(i - 2, 2));
            
            if (oneDigit >= 1 && oneDigit <= 9) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
            }
            if (twoDigits >= 10 && twoDigits <= 26) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

This code snippet effectively handles the problem requirements by utilizing dynamic programming to count the number of ways to decode the given string.
