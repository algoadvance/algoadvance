[Leetcode 13. Roman to Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l13)
### Problem Statement
The task is to convert a given Roman numeral (represented as a string) to its corresponding integer value. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. Below is a table of these symbols with their values:

```
Symbol       Value
I            1
V            5
X            10
L            50
C            100
D            500
M            1000
```

Roman numerals are usually written from largest to smallest from left to right. However, there are exceptions where a smaller numeral precedes a larger numeral, indicating subtraction. Examples of such combinations include IV (4) and IX (9).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Limitations**: What is the expected length or range of the input string?
2. **Input Validity**: Should we assume the input is always a valid Roman numeral?
3. **Output Type**: Should the function return the integer value as an integer type?

### Strategy
1. **Value Mapping**: Create a map to store Roman numeral characters and their corresponding integer values.
2. **Iterate and Compare**: Traverse the string and for each character, compare it to the next character. If the current character is smaller than the next character, subtract its value from the total; otherwise, add its value to the total.
3. **Final Result**: Return the computed total after processing all characters.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int romanToInt(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> roman = {
        {'I', 1},
        {'V', 5},
        {'X', 10},
        {'L', 50},
        {'C', 100},
        {'D', 500},
        {'M', 1000}
    };

    int total = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (i < s.length() - 1 && roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i + 1]]) {
            total -= roman[s[i]];
        } else {
            total += roman[s[i]];
        }
    }

    return total;
}

// Test function
int main() {
    string roman = "MCMXCIV"; // 1994
    cout << "Integer value of Roman numeral " << roman << " is " << romanToInt(roman) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is checked once.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Create a map for Roman numeral values.
2. **Traversal**:
    - Loop through the string.
    - Compare each character with the next one to decide whether to add or subtract its value.
3. **Calculation**:
    - If the current character is less than the next, subtract its value.
    - Otherwise, add its value.
4. **Output the Result**: Return the accumulated total.

This method ensures the Roman numeral string is efficiently converted to the integer value correctly based on Roman numeral rules.
