[Leetcode 968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l968)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- Node values are between `0` and `1000`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the tree be empty?
   **A:** No, the problem states you are given the root of a binary tree, implying at least one node.
   
2. **Q:** Can a node have both left and right children?
   **A:** Yes, it can have either, both, or none.

3. **Q:** Is the tree structure dynamic (can it change), or do we just need to consider a static tree?
   **A:** The tree is static for this problem.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using a bottom-up approach with Depth-First Search (DFS). The idea is to use a dynamic programming approach where we determine the state of the nodes based on their children's state.

### States:
1. **State -1**: The node has no camera and is not monitored.
2. **State 0**: The node has no camera but is monitored by one of its children.
3. **State 1**: The node has a camera.

### Steps:
1. Perform a DFS traversal starting from the root.
2. At each node, decide the state based on its children.
3. Apply the conditions:
    - If either of the child nodes is in state -1, the current node must have a camera.
    - If either of the child nodes is in state 1, the current node is monitored.
    - If both children are in state 0, the current node is not monitored.

4. Track the number of cameras used.

## Code

```c++
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) {
        int cameras = 0;
        // Call to dfs should return 0 since root must be covered
        if (dfs(root, cameras) == -1) {
            cameras++;
        }
        return cameras;
    }
    
private:
    // DFS function to return the state of a node
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int &cameras) {
        if (!node) return 0; // null nodes are considered covered
        
        int left = dfs(node->left, cameras);
        int right = dfs(node->right, cameras);
        
        // If either child is not covered, place a camera at the current node.
        if (left == -1 || right == -1) {
            cameras++;
            return 1; // Current node has a camera
        }
        
        // If either child has a camera, the current node is covered.
        if (left == 1 || right == 1) {
            return 0; // Current node is covered but has no camera
        }
        
        // If both children are covered but have no cameras, current node is not covered
        return -1; // Current node is not covered
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. We traverse each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack during DFS, which in the worst-case is the height of the tree.

With this approach, we ensure that the tree is monitored with the minimum number of cameras possible.
