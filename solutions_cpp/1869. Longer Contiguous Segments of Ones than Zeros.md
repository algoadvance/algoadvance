[Leetcode 1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1869)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, return `true` if the longest contiguous segment of ones is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of zeros in the string, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the binary string `s`?
   - Are there any non-binary characters allowed in the string?

2. **Output Expectations:**
   - Should the function return only a boolean value?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the output if the string is empty?
   - What should be the output if both longest segments of ones and zeros are equal?

## Code

Based on the problem statement, let's implement the solution in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool checkZeroOnes(string s) {
    int maxOnes = 0, maxZeros = 0;
    int currentOnes = 0, currentZeros = 0;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '1') {
            currentOnes++;
            currentZeros = 0;
        } else {
            currentZeros++;
            currentOnes = 0;
        }
        
        if (currentOnes > maxOnes) {
            maxOnes = currentOnes;
        }
        if (currentZeros > maxZeros) {
            maxZeros = currentZeros;
        }
    }
    
    return maxOnes > maxZeros;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    cout << checkZeroOnes("1101") << endl;  // Output: true
    cout << checkZeroOnes("111000") << endl;  // Output: false
    cout << checkZeroOnes("110100010") << endl;  // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters:**
   - `maxOnes` and `maxZeros` to keep track of the maximum length of contiguous segments of '1's and '0's respectively.
   - `currentOnes` and `currentZeros` to count the current segment lengths of '1's and '0's respectively.

2. **Iterate through the String:**
   - If the character is '1', increment `currentOnes` and reset `currentZeros` to 0.
   - If the character is '0', increment `currentZeros` and reset `currentOnes` to 0.
   - Update `maxOnes` and `maxZeros` whenever `currentOnes` or `currentZeros` exceed the recorded maximums.

3. **Comparison:**
   - After processing the string, compare `maxOnes` and `maxZeros` to determine the result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string:
- We only make a single pass through the string to compute the longest contiguous segments of ones and zeros.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using a fixed amount of extra space for integer counters.
