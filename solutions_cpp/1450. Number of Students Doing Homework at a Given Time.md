[Leetcode 1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1450)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime` and an integer `queryTime`.

The `i-th` student started doing their homework at the time `startTime[i]` and finished it at time `endTime[i]`.

Return the number of students doing their homework at the `queryTime`. More formally, return the number of students where `queryTime` lays in the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]` inclusive.

### Example:
1. **Example 1:**
    - Input: 
        - `startTime = [1,2,3]`
        - `endTime = [3,2,7]`
        - `queryTime = 4`
    - Output: `1`
    - Explanation: Only the third student was doing their homework at the time `4`.

2. **Example 2:**
    - Input: 
        - `startTime = [4]`
        - `endTime = [4]`
        - `queryTime = 4`
    - Output: `1`
    - Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the time `4`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Inputs:**
    - What are the constraints on the size of the arrays and the values within them?
    - **Constraints:**
        - `startTime.length == endTime.length`
        - `1 <= startTime.length <= 100`
        - `1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000`
        - `1 <= queryTime <= 1000`

2. **Edge Cases:**
    - What if no students are found doing homework at `queryTime`?
        - The function should return `0` if no students are found doing homework at `queryTime`.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of students doing homework at `queryTime`.

2. **Iteration:**
    - Iterate over the students (i.e., iterate over the arrays).
    - For each student, check if `queryTime` lies within the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.
    - If it does, increment the counter.

3. **Return the Counter:**
    - After iterating through all students, return the counter.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

int busyStudent(std::vector<int>& startTime, std::vector<int>& endTime, int queryTime) {
    int count = 0;
    int n = startTime.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (startTime[i] <= queryTime && queryTime <= endTime[i]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialize `count` to 0:** This will keep track of the number of students working at `queryTime`.
- **Loop through each student's start and end times:**
    - For each student `i`, check if `startTime[i]` is less than or equal to `queryTime` and `endTime[i]` is greater than or equal to `queryTime`.
    - If both these conditions are true, the student is doing homework during the `queryTime`, so increment the `count`.
- **Return `count`:** After checking all students, return the final count.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `startTime` or `endTime` array.
- This linear time complexity is efficient given the constraint that `startTime.length` can be at most 100.
