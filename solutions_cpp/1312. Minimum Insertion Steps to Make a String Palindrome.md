[Leetcode 1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1312)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`. In one step, you can insert any character at any position of the string. Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the length of the input string `s`? Is it always non-empty?
   - Can `s` contain all types of characters (including special characters)?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Do we only need the number of insertion steps, or should we also provide the resulting string?

3. **Examples**:
   - Example 1: 
     - Input: `s = "zzazz"`
     - Output: `0`
     - Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already a palindrome, so no insertions are needed.
   - Example 2:
     - Input: `s = "mbadm"`
     - Output: `2`
     - Explanation: Insert two characters to form the palindrome "madam".

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The main idea is that if we can find the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in the given string, the rest of the characters will need to be inserted to make the whole string a palindrome.

So, the minimum number of insertions required will be equal to the length of the string `s` minus the length of the LPS.

**Steps**:
1. Calculate the length of the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) using dynamic programming.
2. Subtract the length of the LPS from the length of the string to get the minimum number of insertions required.

**Dynamic Programming Approach**:
- Define a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
- If `s[i]` is equal to `s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
- Initialize the DP array such that every single character is a palindrome of length 1, so `dp[i][i] = 1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minInsertions(std::string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) { // Length of the current substring
            for (int i = 0; i < n - len + 1; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Length of the longest palindromic subsequence
        int lps = dp[0][n-1];

        // Minimum insertion steps to make the string a palindrome
        return n - lps;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through the DP table twice: once for the length of the substring and once for the starting index.

The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) due to the 2D DP array used for storing intermediate results.
