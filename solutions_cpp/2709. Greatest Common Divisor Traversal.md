[Leetcode 2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2709)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, and you are to determine if it is possible to traverse the array from index `0` to index `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`) by following certain rules. The traversal can move to any subsequent index `j` if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is greater than `1`.

Your task is to implement a function to determine if such a traversal is possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the traversal have to visit every element, or just find a possible path from `nums[0]` to `nums[n-1]`?
   - **Answer:** The traversal just needs to find a path from `nums[0]` to `nums[n-1]`.
2. Can the same element be revisited during the traversal?
   - **Answer:** Yes, elements can be revisited.
3. What is the expected range of `n` and the values within the `nums` array?
   - **Answer:** `n` can be large; the values within `nums` are generally positive integers.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:** Treat the array as a graph where each index is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes `i` and `j` if `GCD(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Utilize BFS from index `0` to determine if there is a path to index `n-1`.

### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <numeric>  // for std::gcd
#include <iostream>

bool gcdTraversal(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 1) return true;  // Only one element, already at the destination

    // Use BFS to find the path
    std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    std::queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);
    visited[0] = true;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i] && std::gcd(nums[current], nums[i]) > 1) {
                if (i == n-1) return true;
                q.push(i);
                visited[i] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 4, 9, 16};
    if (gcdTraversal(nums)) {
        std::cout << "Traversal possible\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Traversal not possible\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction:** \(O(n^2 \log(\min(a,b)))\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are values in `nums`. This is because the GCD computation between any two numbers takes \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\).
- **BFS Traversal:** \(O(n)\) since in the worst case scenario, each node is visited once.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2 \log(\text{max element in nums})))\)

This combined time complexity is efficient for moderate values of `n` and typical values within `nums`.
