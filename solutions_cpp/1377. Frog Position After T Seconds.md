[Leetcode 1377. Frog Position After T Seconds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1377)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`. A frog starts jumping from vertex `1`. Each second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another unvisited vertex. However, if the frog is at vertex `i` with no unvisited vertices, it remains at vertex `i`. The tree is represented as a list of edges.

You are also given an integer `t` and a target vertex `target`. Return the probability that the frog is at vertex `target` after exactly `t` seconds.

The edges are given in a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n`
- `1 <= t <= 50`
- `1 <= target <= n`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Tree Properties:** Every tree is a fully connected acyclic graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. Since every edge is bidirectional, connecting exactly two vertices.
2. **Initial Position:** The frog always starts at vertex `1`.
3. **Vertex Visitations:** The frog will only jump to an adjacent unvisited vertex or stay put if no unvisited vertices are available.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Perform a BFS to simulate the frog's jumps and track probabilities.
3. **Keep Track of States:** Use a queue to store current vertex, current time, and current probability.
4. **Handling Probability:** Update probabilities based on the number of unvisited adjacent vertices.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

double frogPosition(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int t, int target) {
    // Create adjacency list for the graph
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    // BFS to simulate the frog's jumps and probabilities
    queue<tuple<int, int, double>> q;  // (current node, current time, current probability)
    q.push({1, 0, 1.0});
    
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    visited[1] = true;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, time, prob] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // If the target node is reached at time t
        if (current == target) {
            if (time == t || (graph[current].size() == 1 && current != 1)) {
                return prob;
            }
            // If time is less than t and there are unvisited nodes, the frog can move
            if (time < t && graph[current].size() > 1) {
                return 0.0;
            }
        }
        
        // No more time to continue
        if (time == t) {
            continue;
        }
        
        int unvisited_count = 0;
        for (int neighbor : graph[current]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                unvisited_count++;
            }
        }
        
        for (int neighbor : graph[current]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                q.push({neighbor, time + 1, prob / unvisited_count});
            }
        }
    }
    
    return 0.0;
}

int main() {
    int n = 7;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 7}, {2, 4}, {2, 6}, {3, 5}};
    int t = 2;
    int target = 4;

    cout << frogPosition(n, edges, t, target) << endl;  // Output should be 0.16666666666666666

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the Adjacency List:** O(n)
- **BFS Traversal:** O(n)

The overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
