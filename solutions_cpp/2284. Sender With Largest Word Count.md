[Leetcode 2284. Sender With Largest Word Count](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2284)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `messages` and an array of strings `senders`, where `messages[i]` is a message sent by `senders[i]`.

A "word" is any sequence of non-space characters.

Return the sender with the largest number of words in total. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically larger sender.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of the `messages` and `senders` arrays?
   - The length of both arrays is the same and can be up to `10^4`.
   
2. What is the limitation on the length of each message?
   - Each message can be up to 100 characters long.

3. Are there any limitations on the characters within the messages and sender names?
   - Messages consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
   - Sender names consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters only.

4. Can we assume that the arrays are non-empty and that every element in `senders` corresponds to an element in `messages`?
   - Yes, both arrays are of the same non-zero length.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

std::string largestWordCount(std::vector<std::string>& messages, std::vector<std::string>& senders) {
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> wordCount;
    int n = messages.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::string message = messages[i];
        std::string sender = senders[i];
        
        // Count the number of words in the message
        std::istringstream stream(message);
        std::string word;
        int count = 0;
        while (stream >> word) {
            count++;
        }
        
        // Update the word count for the sender
        wordCount[sender] += count;
    }

    // Find the sender with the largest word count
    std::string largestSender;
    int maxCount = 0;
    
    for (const auto& entry : wordCount) {
        if (entry.second > maxCount || (entry.second == maxCount && entry.first > largestSender)) {
            largestSender = entry.first;
            maxCount = entry.second;
        }
    }

    return largestSender;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> messages = {"Hello world", "Hi", "Amazing Leetcode"};
    std::vector<std::string> senders = {"Alice", "Bob", "Alice"};
    std::cout << largestWordCount(messages, senders) << std::endl; // Output: Alice

    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Use an `unordered_map` to keep track of the total word count per sender.

2. **Populate the Map**: Iterate through each message and its corresponding sender. Count the number of words using an `istringstream`. Update the word count for each sender in the `unordered_map`.

3. **Find the Result**: Traverse the `unordered_map` to find the sender with the largest word count. In case of a tie (same word count), the lexicographically larger sender name is selected.

### Time Complexity

- **Counting words**: For each message, counting words takes `O(m)` where `m` is the maximum length of the message.
- **Updating the map**: This operation is `O(1)` on average for each message.
- **Total word counting and map population**: `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of messages and `m` is the average length of the message.
- **Finding the max sender**: Takes `O(s)` where `s` is the number of unique senders.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n * m + s)` which simplifies to `O(n * m)` given the constraints `n` can be up to `10^4` and `m` up to 100.
