[Leetcode 2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2382)
## Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` and a sequence of queries where each query removes an element from `nums`. After each removal, you need to find the maximum segment sum in the array. A segment is defined as a contiguous subarray, and its sum is the sum of its elements.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   - What is the range of the values within `nums`?
   - How many queries will there be?

2. **Query Details:**
   - How are the indices in the queries represented? (1-based or 0-based)
   - Are the queries guaranteed to be in a valid format (i.e., all indices are within the bounds of the array and each index appears exactly once)?

These clarifications ensure that edge cases are well-handled and the solution is robust.

## Strategy:
1. **Initial Segmentation:**
   - Treat the entire array as one large segment initially.
   
2. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a segment tree or a data structure like `set` to efficiently handle and track the remaining segments and their sums, which allows for efficient max queries after each removal.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, update the segments structure by splitting the current segment into two new segments at the removed index.
   - Track and update the maximum segment sum after each removal.
   
4. **Efficient Updates:**
   - Efficiently update segments and their sums using appropriate data structures (e.g., `set`, `map`, or segment trees).

## Code:
Below is an implementation using a set for efficient tracking of segments and their sums:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<long long> maximumSegmentSum(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& removeQueries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Initial segment and its sum
        set<pair<long long, pair<int, int>>> segments;
        vector<long long> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        segments.insert({prefixSum[n], {0, n - 1}});
        
        vector<long long> result(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int idx = removeQueries[i];
            auto it = --segments.upper_bound({0, {idx, INT_MAX}});
            
            long long sum = it->first;
            int l = it->second.first;
            int r = it->second.second;
            
            segments.erase(it);
            
            if (l <= idx - 1) {
                segments.insert({prefixSum[idx] - prefixSum[l], {l, idx - 1}});
            }
            if (idx + 1 <= r) {
                segments.insert({prefixSum[r + 1] - prefixSum[idx + 1], {idx + 1, r}});
            }
            
            if (!segments.empty()) {
                result[i] = segments.rbegin()->first;
            } else {
                result[i] = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Initial setup (prefix sums calculation):** O(n)
- **Processing each query:**
  - Finding the segment containing the index to remove: O(log n)
  - Removing and inserting segments: O(log n) for each insertion and deletion
- **Total:** O(n log n), where n is the length of the `nums` array.

This approach leverages efficient query handling through a balanced data structure (`set`) to keep track of segment sums and provides the required maximum segment sum after each removal efficiently.
