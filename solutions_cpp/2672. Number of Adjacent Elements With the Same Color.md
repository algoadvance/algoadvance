[Leetcode 2672. Number of Adjacent Elements With the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2672)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `colors` of length `n` where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `i-th` element.

Return the number of indices `i` in the array for which `colors[i] == colors[i + 1]` and are adjacent.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
    - What is the range of `n`, the length of the `colors` array?
    - What is the range of values for the elements in `colors`?
  
2. **Input Examples**:
    - If `colors = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, the output should be `3` since index `2`, `3`, and `4` have the same adjacent colors.
    - If `colors = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the number of such indices would be `4`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
    - Start with a counter initialized to `0`.

2. **Traverse the Array**:
    - Loop through the array from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive).
      - Check if the current element `colors[i]` is the same as the next element `colors[i + 1]`.
      - If they are the same, increment the counter.

3. **Return Result**:
    - After traversing the array, return the counter which holds the number of adjacent elements with the same color.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countAdjacentElementsWithSameColor(vector<int>& colors) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < colors.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if (colors[i] == colors[i + 1]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `colors` array.
  - We traverse the array once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by iterating through the `colors` array and counting the adjacent elements with the same color.
