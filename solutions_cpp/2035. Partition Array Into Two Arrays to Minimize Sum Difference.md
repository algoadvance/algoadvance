[Leetcode 2035. Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2035)
# Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, partition it into two arrays `A` and `B` to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the arrays `A` and `B`. Formally, find two arrays `A` and `B` such that:

- Each element of the input array `nums` must be in exactly one of the two arrays `A` or `B`.
- The absolute difference between the sum of `A` and the sum of `B` is as minimized as possible.

Return the minimum possible absolute difference.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of input values?**
   - `nums` will contain integers and the length of `nums` is between `1` and `30`.

2. **Is there any constraint on the elements of the array `nums`?**
   - There are no constraints beyond that it contains integers.

### Strategy
Given the constraints (length of `nums` is small), we can use a strategy involving combinatorial search. This can be done efficiently using a meet-in-the-middle approach:

1. **Divide** the given array into two halves.
2. **Enumerate** all possible sums of subsets for both halves.
3. **Search** effectively for the best pair of subset sums that minimizes the absolute difference.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int half = n / 2;
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        // This sum we need to approach is half of total sum
        int target = totalSum / 2;

        // Get subset sums for each half
        std::set<int> leftSums = getSubsetSums(nums, 0, half);
        std::set<int> rightSums = getSubsetSums(nums, half, n);

        // Find minimal absolute difference
        int minDifference = std::abs(totalSum - 2 * *leftSums.begin());
        for (int sum1 : leftSums) {
            auto it = rightSums.lower_bound(target - sum1);
            if (it != rightSums.end()) {
                minDifference = std::min(minDifference, std::abs(totalSum - 2 * (sum1 + *it)));
            }
            if (it != rightSums.begin()) {
                --it;
                minDifference = std::min(minDifference, std::abs(totalSum - 2 * (sum1 + *it)));
            }
        }
        return minDifference;
    }

private:
    std::set<int> getSubsetSums(const std::vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        std::set<int> sums = {0};
        for (int i = start; i < end; ++i) {
            std::vector<int> newSums;
            for (int sum : sums) {
                newSums.push_back(sum + nums[i]);
            }
            for (int sum : newSums) {
                sums.insert(sum);
            }
        }
        return sums;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 9, 7, 3};
    Solution sol;
    int minDiff = sol.minimumDifference(nums);
    std::cout << "The minimum possible absolute difference is: " << minDiff << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
Each half of the array results in subsets, and the number of subsets for half of size `n/2` is `2^(n/2)`. Hence,

- Generating sums for left half: `O(2^(n/2))`
- Generating sums for right half: `O(2^(n/2))`
- Searching for the best pair: `O(2^(n/2) log(2^(n/2))) = O(2^(n/2) * (n/2))`

Thus, the time complexity is effectively `O(2^(n/2) * n)`, making this approach feasible for n up to about 30.
