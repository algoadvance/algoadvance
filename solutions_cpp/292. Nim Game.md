[Leetcode 292. Nim Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l292)
### Problem Statement

You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:

- Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
- You and your friend will alternately take turns, and you go first.
- On each turn, a player may remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
- The one who removes the last stone will be the winner.

Given `n`, the total number of stones, determine whether you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally. Return `true` if you can win the game, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Can `n` be zero or negative, or should `n` always be a positive integer?
     - For this problem, it's assumed that `n` is a positive integer as specified by the problem constraints in competitive programming platforms.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players always play optimally. Do you need to account for any sub-optimal moves?
     - No, both players will always make the best possible moves.

### Strategy

The key insight for solving this problem is recognizing the pattern of winning and losing positions:

- If `n = 1`, `2`, or `3`, you can take all stones and win.
- If `n = 4`, no matter how many stones you take (1, 2, or 3), your friend will always be able to take the remaining stones and win. Therefore, `n = 4` is a losing position.
- If `n = 5`, `6`, or `7`, you can take exactly `1`, `2`, or `3` stones respectively, leaving your friend with `n = 4`, a losing position.
- If `n = 8`, no matter how many stones you take (1, 2, or 3), you will always leave your friend with a position where `n = 5`, `6`, or `7`, ensuring they can leave you `n = 4`.

Therefore, we observe that if `n % 4 == 0`, you will lose; otherwise, you will win.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canWinNim(int n) {
        return n % 4 != 0;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` since the operation of taking the modulus and comparing it to a constant involves a constant amount of work, regardless of the input size.
