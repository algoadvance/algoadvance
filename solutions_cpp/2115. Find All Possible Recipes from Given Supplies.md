[Leetcode 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2115)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2115: "Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies"

You have information about `n` different recipes. You are given a string array `recipes` and a 2D string array `ingredients`. The `i-th` recipe has the name `recipes[i]`, and you can create it if you have all the ingredients from `ingredients[i]` in your `supplies`. You are also given a string array `supplies` containing all the ingredients you initially have, and you need to return a list of all the recipes you can create.

Each recipe string and ingredient string is composed only of lowercase English letters. Each ingredient's and recipe's length is in the range [1, 10^5], and there are at most `1000` recipes.

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
recipes = ["bread", "sandwich"]
ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"], ["bread", "meat"]]
supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "meat"]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
["bread", "sandwich"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the ingredient list of one recipe include another recipe as an ingredient?
   - Yes. This creates a dependency between recipes.
2. Are there any cycles in the dependencies? 
   - No, the problem guarantees no cyclic dependencies.

## Strategy
This problem can be viewed as a graph-based problem where each recipe and its ingredients form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We need to check if we can perform a topological sort on these graphs to find the order of recipes we can make.

### Steps:
1. Create an adjacency list from each recipe to its required ingredients.
2. Use a set to keep track of the supplies we already have.
3. Track the in-degree (number of dependencies) of each recipe.
4. Use a queue to perform a BFS-like traversal:
   - Initialize the queue with all recipes that have in-degree zero.
   - Process entries in the queue and reduce the in-degree of dependant recipes.
   - If the in-degree of a recipe becomes zero, add it to the queue and to the result list.
5. Continue until the queue is empty.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

vector<string> findAllRecipes(vector<string>& recipes, vector<vector<string>>& ingredients, vector<string>& supplies) {
    unordered_set<string> supplySet(supplies.begin(), supplies.end());
    unordered_map<string, int> inDegree;
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> adjList;
    
    for (const auto& recipe : recipes) {
        inDegree[recipe] = 0;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < recipes.size(); ++i) {
        for (const auto& ingredient : ingredients[i]) {
            if (supplySet.find(ingredient) == supplySet.end()) { 
                adjList[ingredient].push_back(recipes[i]);
                ++inDegree[recipes[i]];
            }
        }
    }

    queue<string> q;
    for (const auto& recipe : recipes) {
        if (inDegree[recipe] == 0) {
            q.push(recipe);
        }
    }

    vector<string> result;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        string recipe = q.front();
        q.pop();
        result.push_back(recipe);

        for (const auto& nextRecipe : adjList[recipe]) {
            --inDegree[nextRecipe];
            if (inDegree[nextRecipe] == 0) {
                q.push(nextRecipe);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> recipes = {"bread", "sandwich"};
    vector<vector<string>> ingredients = \{\{"yeast", "flour"}, {"bread", "meat"}};
    vector<string> supplies = {"yeast", "flour", "meat"};
    
    vector<string> result = findAllRecipes(recipes, ingredients, supplies);
    
    for (const auto& recipe : result) {
        cout << recipe << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Building the graph (in-degree and adjacency list): `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of recipes and `E` is the total number of ingredients.
- BFS to find the topological sort: `O(V + E)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(V + E)`. Given the constraints, this solution is efficient.
