[Leetcode 3076. Shortest Uncommon Substring in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3076)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `arr[]`, the task is to find the shortest string that is **not** a substring of any string present in the array.

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
Output: "d"

Input: arr = ["abc", "def", "ghij"]
Output: "a"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the input array will have at least one string.
   
2. **Are the strings in the array non-empty?**
   - Yes, it's safe to assume that all strings in the input array are non-empty.
   
3. **Is there any limit to the length of strings in the array?**
   - Typically, we would assume a reasonable constraint, let's say up to 1000 characters per string unless otherwise specified.

4. **Do the inputs contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the strings contain only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. **Generate Possible Substrings:** We will start with a set of substrings of length 1 (all lowercase letters a to z). If none of these is uncommon, we proceed to length 2, and so on.
2. **Check Uniqueness:** For each generated substring, check if it is present in any of the given strings.
3. **Return the Result:** The first substring that is not found in any of the input strings is the answer.

To make the checking efficient, we use a hash table (set) to store all substrings of all lengths from the input array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string findShortestUncommonSubstring(const vector<string>& arr) {
    unordered_set<string> substrings;
    
    // Add all substrings of all lengths to the set.
    for (const string& s : arr) {
        int n = s.length();
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
                substrings.insert(s.substr(i, len));
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Start with length 1, then length 2, and so on.
    int length = 1;
    while (true) {
        // Generate all substrings of the current length.
        vector<string> candidates;
        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
            candidates.push_back(string(1, c));
        }
        
        while (--length > 0) {
            vector<string> next_candidates;
            for (const string& candidate : candidates) {
                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                    next_candidates.push_back(candidate + c);
                }
            }
            candidates = next_candidates;
        }
        
        // Check each candidate
        for (const string& candidate : candidates) {
            if (substrings.find(candidate) == substrings.end()) {
                return candidate;
            }
        }
        
        ++length;
    }
    
    return ""; // this line is unreachable
}

int main() {
    vector<string> arr = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
    cout << "Output: " << findShortestUncommonSubstring(arr) << endl;

    arr = {"abc", "def", "ghij"};
    cout << "Output: " << findShortestUncommonSubstring(arr) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

**1. Building the Substring Set:**
   - For each string of length `n`, there are roughly `n*(n+1)/2` substrings. For `k` strings, this becomes `O(k*n^2)`.

**2. Generating Candidate Substrings:**
   - For substrings of length 1, there are 26 candidates.
   - For substrings of length 2, there are 26^2 candidates.
   - ...
   - For substrings of length `m`, there are `26^m` candidates.

**3. Checking Each Candidate:**
   - Each check involves looking up the substring in the set, which is `O(1)` on average.

Combining these factors, the overall time complexity can be considered exponential in the shortest uncommon substring length but polynomial in the input size for reasonable constraints.
