[Leetcode 2517. Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2517)
## Problem Statement
Given two arrays `price` and `tastiness`, both of size `n`, where `price[i]` indicates the price of the `i-th` candy and `tastiness[i]` indicates the tastiness of the `i-th` candy. You have a budget `k`, and you're required to purchase exactly `m` candies such that the sum of their prices is less than or equal to `k`. Your goal is to maximize the total tastiness of the selected candies.

Return the maximum total tastiness that can be achieved under the given constraints.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a limit to the size of the arrays 'price' and 'tastiness'?**
   - The size could be up to `10^3` based on typical constraints in similar problems.

2. **What should we return if it's not possible to purchase exactly `m` candies within the budget `k`?**
   - Return `0` if it's not possible to meet the constraints.

3. **Are the prices and tastiness values always positive?**
   - Yes, typically in such problems both arrays contain positive values.

4. **Is it guaranteed that `m <= n`?**
   - Yes, otherwise, it's impossible to purchase more candies than available.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to the "0/1 Knapsack" problem. Here's an overview of the steps:

1. **Initialization:** Create a `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum tastiness that can be achieved with a budget `j` considering the first `i` candies.

2. **Iteration:** Loop through each candy and update the `dp` array:
   - If a candy `i` is picked, update the DP state to include this candy if the budget allows.
   - If a candy `i` is not picked, carry forward the previous state.

3. **Result Calculation:** The value at `dp[n][k]` will represent the maximum tastiness that can be achieved under the given constraints.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxTastiness(vector<int>& price, vector<int>& tastiness, int m, int k) {
    int n = price.size();
    
    // DP array where dp[i][j] gives the max tastiness using the first i items with budget j
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    
    // Iterate over each candy
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int currentPrice = price[i - 1];
        int currentTastiness = tastiness[i - 1];
        
        // Iterate over each budget from high to low to avoid overwriting results
        for (int budget = k; budget >= currentPrice; --budget) {
            dp[i][budget] = max(dp[i][budget], dp[i - 1][budget - currentPrice] + currentTastiness);
        }
        
        // Carry forward the results for budget < currentPrice
        for (int budget = currentPrice - 1; budget >= 0; --budget) {
            dp[i][budget] = max(dp[i][budget], dp[i - 1][budget]);
        }
    }
    
    int maxTastiness = 0;
    // Check all possible baskets with exactly m items
    for (int budget = 0; budget <= k; ++budget) {
        maxTastiness = max(maxTastiness, dp[n][budget]);
    }
    
    return (maxTastiness == 0) ? 0 : maxTastiness;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times k)\), since we have nested loops iterating through `n` candies and `k` budget values.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n \times k)\) for the DP table.

This approach efficiently finds the solution by leveraging dynamic programming, ensuring that we stay within the bounds of typical problem constraints.
