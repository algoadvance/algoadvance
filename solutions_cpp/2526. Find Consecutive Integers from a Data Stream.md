[Leetcode 2526. Find Consecutive Integers from a Data Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2526)
## Problem Statement

You are given a stream of integers (i.e., a continuously growing sequence of data). You need to implement a class that can determine if there exists a group of `k` consecutive integers within the data stream after each new integer is added to the stream.

The requirement is to implement the `DataStream` class:

1. `DataStream(int value, int k)`: Constructor that initializes the object with a required `value` and a target count `k`. Initially, the object should be waiting for data in the stream.

2. `bool consec(int num)`: Method that takes an integer `num` and updates the internal stream of data with this new integer. It should return `true` if there exists a group of `k` consecutive integers in the stream including the newly added integer. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of integers we can expect in the stream? (Ordinary range of integer values?)
    - Is the stream guaranteed to be non-negative integers only?
    
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if the stream has fewer than `k` elements?
    - Will the stream have duplicates, and how should they be treated?

3. **Performance Requirements**:
    - Is there a limit to the size of the stream which can be assumed for practical implementation?

Based on these details, I'll offer a solution.

## Strategy

We need to store the incoming integers and check each time if there are `k` consecutive integers. 

### Steps:
1. Use a vector to store incoming integers.
2. Each time a new number is added, append it to the vector.
3. Check the most recent `k` integers to see if they form a sequence of `k` consecutive integers.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the `DataStream` class in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class DataStream {
private:
    std::vector<int> stream;
    int k;
    
public:
    DataStream(int value, int k) : k(k) {
        // Start the stream with the first element if necessary.
    }
    
    bool consec(int num) {
        stream.push_back(num);
        int n = stream.size();
        
        if (n >= k) {
            std::vector<int> last_k_elements(stream.end() - k, stream.end());
            std::sort(last_k_elements.begin(), last_k_elements.end());
            
            for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
                if (last_k_elements[i] != last_k_elements[i - 1] + 1) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Insertion**: Each insertion requires appending to a vector, which is O(1).
2. **Consec**:
    - Sorting last `k` elements has a time complexity of O(k log k).
    - Checking for consecutive elements has a linear time complexity O(k).

So for each call to `consec`, the overall time complexity is O(k log k).

This approach should work for a moderate value of `k` and supports a growing stream size. If `k` is large, further optimizations like using a more efficient data structure or smarter checking logic may be beneficial.
