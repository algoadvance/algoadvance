[Leetcode 2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2389)
## Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers `nums` and an array of integers `queries`. For each query in `queries`, we need to determine the length of the longest subsequence in `nums` such that the sum of the elements in the subsequence is less than or equal to the query value. 

The function signature is:
```cpp
vector<int> answerQueries(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& queries);
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Subsequences Definition:** Are these subsequences required to be contiguous?
   - No, any element can be included as long as the total sum is within the query limit.

2. **Range Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and the values within `nums` and `queries`?
   - Typically, LeetCode problems provide constraints. For this problem, letâ€™s assume:
     - `1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 1000`
     - `1 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 10^6`

3. **Output:** What should the function return?
   - The function should return a vector of integers where each integer corresponds to the length of the longest subsequence for each query.

## Strategy

1. **Sort `nums`:** Sorting the array will help us consider the smallest elements first, which allows us to maximize the number of elements included in the subsequence without exceeding the query sum.
2. **Cumulative Sum:** Calculate the cumulative sum of the sorted `nums` to easily determine how many elements can be included without exceeding each query value in `queries`.
3. **Binary Search:** For each query, use binary search on the cumulative sum array to efficiently determine the maximum number of elements that can be included.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For sort and lower_bound
using namespace std;

vector<int> answerQueries(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& queries) {
    // Sort the nums array to consider smallest elements first
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Compute the prefix sums of the sorted nums array
    vector<int> prefixSums(nums.size(), 0);
    prefixSums[0] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i-1] + nums[i];
    }

    // Result vector to store the answer for each query
    vector<int> result(queries.size(), 0);

    // Process each query
    for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
        int query = queries[i];
        
        // Use binary search to find the maximum index where prefixSum is <= query
        auto it = upper_bound(prefixSums.begin(), prefixSums.end(), query);
        
        // Distance from the prefixSums beginning to the position found is the length
        result[i] = distance(prefixSums.begin(), it);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** Sorting the `nums` array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** This takes \(O(n)\).
3. **Binary Search for Each Query:** Each query is processed in \(O(\log n)\) due to the binary search on the cumulative sums.
4. **Total Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + q \log n)\), where \(q\) is the length of `queries`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest subsequence for each query, balancing both time complexity and clarity.
