[Leetcode 1033. Moving Stones Until Consecutive](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1033)
## Problem Statement

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that represent the positions of three stones on a number line. Remove and discard any moves that do not align the stones incrementally; all moves should act to place one of the stones closer. The objective is to make the stones consecutive by moving them according to the rules.

You need to return an array `answer` of length 2 where `answer[0]` is the minimum number of moves and `answer[1]` is the maximum number of moves needed to make the stones consecutive.

### Example:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 5
Output: [1, 2]

Explanation:
In the middle, we can move 2 to 3: [1,3,5]
Then you can move 5 to 4: [1,3,4]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` be distinct?
   - Yes, the three integers are always distinct.
   
2. Is the input always valid, i.e., can `a`, `b`, and `c` be passed in any order?
   - It’s expected that `a`, `b`, and `c` can be in any order, so we have to sort them first.

3. What are the constraints for the input values?
   - The values are within a typical range for integer inputs, though we don't have exact constraints from LeetCode here.

## Strategy

1. First, sort the three integers so that `a`, `b`, `c` become `positions[0]`, `positions[1]`, and `positions[2]` respectively.
2. Calculate the gaps between the stones:
   - `gap1 = positions[1] - positions[0]`
   - `gap2 = positions[2] - positions[1]`
3. Determine the minimum and maximum moves:
   - **Minimum Moves**:
     - If either `gap1` is `1` or `2` or `gap2` is `1` or `2`, the minimum moves could be `1` (if the gaps are small).
     - If both gaps are large (greater than `2`), the minimum moves would be `2`.
   - **Maximum Moves**:
     - This would be calculated as `(gap1 - 1) + (gap2 - 1)`, which are the total moves needed to fill the gaps completely.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> numMovesStones(int a, int b, int c) {
    std::vector<int> positions = {a, b, c};
    std::sort(positions.begin(), positions.end());
    
    int gap1 = positions[1] - positions[0];
    int gap2 = positions[2] - positions[1];
    
    int minimum_moves;
    if (gap1 <= 1 && gap2 <= 1) {
        minimum_moves = 0; // Stones are already consecutive
    } else if (gap1 <= 2 || gap2 <= 2) {
        minimum_moves = 1; // Only one move needed to fill the gap if any gap ≤ 2
    } else {
        minimum_moves = 2; // Two moves needed to ultimately fill large gaps
    }
    
    int maximum_moves = gap1 - 1 + gap2 - 1; // Fill all gaps completely

    return {minimum_moves, maximum_moves};
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)`:
- Sorting three elements takes constant time: `O(3 log 3) = O(1)`.
- Calculating the gaps and moves involves basic arithmetic operations.

Thus, the total time complexity remains constant: `O(1)`.
