[Leetcode 2556. Disconnect Path in a Binary Matrix by at Most One Flip](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2556)
### Problem Statement

**2556. Disconnect Path in a Binary Matrix by at Most One Flip**

You are given a binary matrix `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `start` and `end` which represent the start and end positions in the grid. Your task is to find if it's possible to disconnect the path from the start position to the end position by flipping at most one `1` to `0` in the given matrix. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the layout of the grid?
   - The grid is an `m x n` binary matrix where `0` represents an empty cell and `1` represents a wall.

2. What are the start and end in terms of coordinates?
   - The start and end are given as (row_start, col_start) and (row_end, col_end).

3. What constitutes a valid path?
   - A valid path only moves through `0`s in the grid and can move up, down, left, or right (4 directions).

4. Can we flip multiple `1`s to `0`s?
   - No, we can flip at most one `1` to `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Connectivity Check**: 
   - Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search) to check if there is an existing path from the start to the end in the original grid.
   
2. **Iterate Over Walls**:
   - For every `1` in the grid, pretend to flip it to `0` one by one and check the connectivity from the start to end again using BFS/DFS.
   
3. **Decision Making**:
   - If any such flip results in disconnection, return `true`.
   - If no valid flip can disconnect the path, return `false`.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

bool isConnected(vector<vector<int>>& grid, pair<int, int> start, pair<int, int> end) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    q.push(start);
    visited[start.first][start.second] = true;

    int dirs[4][2] = \{\{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [r, c] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (r == end.first && c == end.second) {
            return true;
        }
        
        for (auto& dir : dirs) {
            int nr = r + dir[0];
            int nc = c + dir[1];
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n && grid[nr][nc] == 0 && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                visited[nr][nc] = true;
                q.push({nr, nc});
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}

bool disconnectPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid, pair<int, int> start, pair<int, int> end) {
    if (!isConnected(grid, start, end)) {
        return true; // Already disconnected
    }

    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                grid[i][j] = 0; // flip 1 to 0
                if (!isConnected(grid, start, end)) {
                    return true;
                }
                grid[i][j] = 1; // revert the flip
            }
        }
    }

    return false; // No flip disconnected the path
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Initial connectivity check: O(m * n)
- Each cell flipping check: O(m * n) for each of up to m * n cells
- Overall time complexity: O((m * n) * (m * n)) in the worst case, or O((m * n)^2) 

### Explanation
- Start by checking if there's a path from start to end without any changes in the grid.
- For each `1` in the grid, flip it to `0`, and check if the path from start to end is disconnected.
- If any flip results in disconnection return true; if none do, return false.
