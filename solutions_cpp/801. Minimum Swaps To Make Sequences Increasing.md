[Leetcode 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l801)
## Problem Statement

Suppose we have two increasing sequences `A` and `B` of the same length, and we want to make both sequences strictly increasing by swapping some elements in `A` and `B`. Write a function to find the minimum number of swaps required to make both sequences strictly increasing.

Given two arrays `A` and `B` both of the same length `n`, the goal is to make both sequences `strictly increasing` by minimizing the number of swaps. A swap at an index `i` involves swapping `A[i]` with `B[i]`.

### Example

**Input:**
```
A = [1,3,5,4]
B = [1,2,3,7]
```
**Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation:** 
- Swap `A[3]` and `B[3]` to make both arrays strictly increasing with the minimum number of swaps.

### Assumptions:

- Both `A` and `B` will contain integers that can be swapped only within the same index of the arrays.
- The length of `A` and `B` will be between 1 and 1000.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in A and B guaranteed to be initially increasing separately?**
   - Yes, without any swaps, both sequences may already be increasing or may need swaps to become increasing.
   
2. **Can we assume valid input where the elements are within a certain range?**
   - Yes, elements are integers, and we can assume there are no extreme outliers unless specified.

## Strategy

1. Use dynamic programming to track two states:
   - `keep[i]`: Minimum swaps to make sequences `[0...i]` increasing without swapping `A[i]` and `B[i]`.
   - `swap[i]`: Minimum swaps to make sequences `[0...i]` increasing with swapping `A[i]` and `B[i]`.

2. Initialize:
   - `keep[0] = 0` as no swap needed at the start.
   - `swap[0] = 1` as one swap needed to make the first elements in increasing order if swapped.

3. Iterate through the arrays from index 1 to n-1 and update `keep` and `swap` based on conditions needed to maintain the increasing property.

4. Return the minimum value between `keep[n-1]` and `swap[n-1]` as the result.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minSwap(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
    int n = A.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    
    vector<int> keep(n, INT_MAX);
    vector<int> swap(n, INT_MAX);

    keep[0] = 0;
    swap[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (A[i] > A[i-1] && B[i] > B[i-1]) {
            keep[i] = keep[i-1];
            swap[i] = swap[i-1] + 1;
        }
        if (A[i] > B[i-1] && B[i] > A[i-1]) {
            keep[i] = min(keep[i], swap[i-1]);
            swap[i] = min(swap[i], keep[i-1] + 1);
        }
    }

    return min(keep[n-1], swap[n-1]);
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)` because we iterate through the array once, performing constant time operations at each step.

By using dynamic programming and iterating through the arrays only once, this solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
