[Leetcode 1711. Count Good Meals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1711)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `i-th` meal. You can prepare a pair of meals in the following way:

- Choose two different indices `i` and `j` of the array `deliciousness` where `i != j`.
- A good meal is considered if the sum of the deliciousness of the two meals is a power of two.

Return the number of different good meals you can prepare from this array. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `deliciousness` values?**
   The values in the `deliciousness` array can vary widely and need to be considered for performance.

2. **Range of indices?**
   The size of the `deliciousness` array gives an idea of expected performance requirements.

3. **Handling pairs with repeated elements?**
   Ensure that pairs are unique and derived from different indices.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Power of Two Sums:** First, we recognize that the sums must be powers of two. Powers of two that need to be considered can be from $2^0$ to large enough for the given problem constraints.

2. **Use a HashMap to Count Efficiently:** We'll use a hash map (unordered_map) to store the frequency of each meal's deliciousness encountered so far. For every new meal, we check how many previous meals can form a pair with it such that their sum is a power of two.

3. **Iterate through Powers of Two:** For each meal, we iterate through possible power-of-two sums and check how many pairs (from the hash map) can be formed with the current meal.

4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the count can be very large, every addition to the result needs to be taken modulo $10^9 + 7$.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<int>& deliciousness) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        unordered_map<int, int> counter;
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int meal : deliciousness) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= 21; ++i) { // 2^21 is larger than any possible sum within the problem constraints
                int powerOfTwo = 1 << i;
                if (counter.find(powerOfTwo - meal) != counter.end()) {
                    result = (result + counter[powerOfTwo - meal]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            counter[meal]++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n \* log(max_sum)), where `n` is the number of elements in `deliciousness` and `log(max_sum)` represents the log value base 2 of the largest power of two that makes sense within the context of this problem. `log2(2^21)` approximates to 21, making it efficient.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the additional space used by the hash map `counter` to store the frequencies of deliciousness values.

By following this approach, we ensure that the solution remains both time-efficient and space-efficient while correctly counting the number of good meal pairs.
