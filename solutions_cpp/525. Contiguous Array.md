[Leetcode 525. Contiguous Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l525)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the array length?**
   - The length of the array will be in the range [1, 105].
2. **What are the possible values in the array?**
   - The array will contain only binary values (0s and 1s).
3. **Are there any constraints on memory or runtime**
   - Optimize for both time and space complexity as much as possible.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to find the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s. To achieve this, we can use a hashmap to track the first occurrence of each count difference we encounter as we iterate through the array.

Hereâ€™s the detailed approach:

1. **Transform the array:** Treat 0 as -1. This way, the problem reduces to finding a subarray with a sum of zero.
2. **Use a hashmap to store counts:** Use a hashmap to store the first occurrence of each count. This helps in quickly finding the maximum length of a subarray with a sum of zero.
3. **Iterate through the array:** As you iterate through the array, keep a running sum (cumulative sum). Whenever the cumulative sum reaches the same value at different points, it means the subarray between these points has a sum of zero.
4. **Update the maximum length:** If the cumulative sum has been seen before, update the maximum length using the difference between the current index and the stored index from the hashmap.
5. **Edge Case:** Ensure to handle cases where the entire array or a part of it might already have an equal number of 0s and 1s.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count_map;
        count_map[0] = -1; // To handle the case when subarray starts from index 0
        int max_length = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            count += (nums[i] == 1) ? 1 : -1;
            
            if (count_map.find(count) != count_map.end()) {
                max_length = max(max_length, i - count_map[count]);
            } else {
                count_map[count] = i;
            }
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we make a single pass through the array, with constant time operations for each element using the hashmap.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) as we might store up to n entries in the hashmap in the worst case.
