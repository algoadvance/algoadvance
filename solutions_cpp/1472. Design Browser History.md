[Leetcode 1472. Design Browser History](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1472)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to design a system that manages the browsing history for a browser. Specifically, you need to implement a browser history system that allows you to:

1. **Visit a new URL**: Clear forward history when visiting a new page.
2. **Move back in history**: Move backward by a number of steps (if possible).
3. **Move forward in history**: Move forward by a number of steps (if possible).

### Requirements:

Implement a class `BrowserHistory`:

- `BrowserHistory(string homepage)`:
  - Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.

- `void visit(string url)`:
  - Visits a URL from the current page. This clears up all forward history.

- `string back(int steps)`:
  - Move `steps` back in history. Return the current URL after moving back in history `steps` times. If you can only move back `x` steps in history and `x < steps`, you should move back only `x` steps. Return the current URL after moving back in history.

- `string forward(int steps)`:
  - Move `steps` forward in history. Return the current URL after moving forward in history `steps` times. If you can only move forward `x` steps in history and `x < steps`, you should move forward only `x` steps. Return the current URL after moving forward in history.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the number of URLs in history**:
   - Are there any constraints on memory or the number of URLs that can be stored?

2. **Edge cases**:
   - What should happen if we try to move back or forward more steps than possible?
   - Should we initialize the homepage within the constructor, or will it be done separately?

## Strategy

We can manage the browser history using two stacks:
1. `backStack` to manage the pages visited before the current page.
2. `forwardStack` to manage the pages visited after the current page when we move back.

When visiting a new URL:
- Clear the `forwardStack`.
- Push the current page onto the `backStack` and set the current page to the new URL.

When moving backward:
- Move as many steps back as possible and transfer visited pages to `forwardStack`.

When moving forward:
- Move as many steps forward as possible and transfer visited pages to `backStack`.

Let's implement this in C++.

## Code

```cpp
class BrowserHistory {
private:
    std::stack<std::string> backStack;
    std::stack<std::string> forwardStack;
    std::string currentPage;

public:
    BrowserHistory(std::string homepage) {
        currentPage = homepage;
    }

    void visit(std::string url) {
        // Clear the forward history
        while (!forwardStack.empty()) {
            forwardStack.pop();
        }
        // Push current page to the back stack and update current page
        backStack.push(currentPage);
        currentPage = url;
    }

    std::string back(int steps) {
        while (steps > 0 && !backStack.empty()) {
            // Move the current page to the forward stack
            forwardStack.push(currentPage);
            // Move back to the previous page
            currentPage = backStack.top();
            backStack.pop();
            steps--;
        }
        return currentPage;
    }

    std::string forward(int steps) {
        while (steps > 0 && !forwardStack.empty()) {
            // Move the current page to the back stack
            backStack.push(currentPage);
            // Move forward to the next page
            currentPage = forwardStack.top();
            forwardStack.pop();
            steps--;
        }
        return currentPage;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **`visit(string url)`**: O(1), because pushing to a stack and clearing another stack completely are both O(1) operations in terms of what is done during the visit (clear operation is O(1) since it just reassigns resources).
- **`back(int steps)`**: O(k), where k is the number of steps or until the stack is exhausted.
- **`forward(int steps)`**: O(k), where k is the number of steps or until the stack is exhausted.

This design ensures we manage browsing history efficiently with simple stack operations.
