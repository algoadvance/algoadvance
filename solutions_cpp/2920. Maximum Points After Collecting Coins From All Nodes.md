[Leetcode 2920. Maximum Points After Collecting Coins From All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2920)
Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected tree ("Tree" meaning a connected acyclic graph) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Each node has a certain number of coins, represented as an array `coins` where `coins[i]` is the number of coins at node `i`. You also have an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u, v]` represents an undirected edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

Your task is to maximize the total number of coins you can collect by starting at any node and collecting coins from all nodes exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size and Constraints:** What are the potential sizes of `n` and `coins`? This information will help in choosing an appropriate algorithm.
2. **Edge Cases:** Are there any coins' values constraints like negative coins? This helps in designing proper validators and edge condition checks.
3. **Edge Representation:** Are edges zero-based or one-based indexing in `edges` array?

Assuming we have standard constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100,000` (from typical large-scale coding challenges)
- `0 <= coins[i] <= 10^5` representing non-negative coin values
- Zero-based indexing for `edges`.

### Strategy

#### Tree Traversal with Dynamic Programming

The problem boils down to visiting every node once and collecting the coins. Using DFS (Depth First Search), combined with dynamic programming, can help us appropriately traverse the tree and ensure we calculate the maximum number of coins efficiently.

Let's follow this approach:

1. **Build the Tree:** Construct the tree from the given edges.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Use DFS to traverse the tree, starting from any arbitrary node, and ensure that we calculate collected coins optimally.

We'll use DFS to keep track of the collected coins from each subtree, and using dynamic programming, we'll ensure optimal paths are considered.

#### Steps involve:

1. **Graph Construction:** 
   - Adjacency list representation of the tree from the `edges` array.

2. **DFS Implementation:**
   - Start from any node, say node `0`, and traverse the tree.
   - For each node, calculate a maximum collectable coins count for its subtree.
  
#### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> coins;
    vector<vector<int>> tree;
    vector<bool> visited;
    
    int dfs(int node) {
        visited[node] = true;
        int totalCoins = coins[node];
        
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                totalCoins += dfs(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        return totalCoins;
    }
    
    int getMaximumCoins(vector<int>& coins, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = coins.size();
        this->coins = coins;
        tree.assign(n, vector<int>());
        visited.assign(n, false);
        
        // Build the tree
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            tree[u].push_back(v);
            tree[v].push_back(u);
        }
        
        // Perform DFS from node 0
        int maxCoins = dfs(0);
        return maxCoins;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> coins = {3, 7, 2, 1, 8};
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}};
    
    cout << sol.getMaximumCoins(coins, edges) << endl; // Should output the total number of coins
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Tree Construction**:
  - Constructing the adjacency list takes O(n-1) (since edges are `n-1` for `n` nodes).

- **DFS Traversal**:
  - The DFS traversal of the tree involves visiting every node exactly once -> O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Final Notes

Make sure to validate the input size and handle edge cases within the actual implementation based on specific problem constraints provided. The solution above assumes default reasonable constraints for competitive coding scenarios. Adjustments may be required in different problem contexts.
