[Leetcode 1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1276)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers, `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`. The task is to determine the number of jumbo burgers and small burgers you can make. Each jumbo burger requires 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice, whereas each small burger requires 2 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice. The goal is to use all the provided tomato and cheese slices without any waste.

Here is the problem on Leetcode for reference: [1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-burgers-with-no-waste-of-ingredients/)

**Example 1:**

- Input: tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7
- Output: [1, 6]
- Explanation: 1 jumbo burger and 6 small burgers use 16 tomato slices and 7 cheese slices.

**Example 2:**

- Input: tomatoSlices = 17, cheeseSlices = 4
- Output: []
- Explanation: There are no possible ways to use all 17 tomato slices and 4 cheese slices to make burgers.

**Example 3:**

- Input: tomatoSlices = 4, cheeseSlices = 17
- Output: []
- Explanation: Making any burgers requires at least 1 cheese slice, so this is impossible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the given input values guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, both `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` are non-negative integers.

2. **Do we need to return the smallest or unique solution if multiple solutions exist?**
   - The problem specifies that there should be an exact solution with no waste. If such a solution does not exist, return an empty list. 

3. **Is there any constraint on the maximum number of `tomatoSlices` or `cheeseSlices`?**
   - The constraints are not explicitly mentioned in the problem, but we will assume typical bounds for an interview setting.

## Strategy 

To solve the problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let:
- `x` be the number of jumbo burgers.
- `y` be the number of small burgers.

We can set up the following two equations based on the problem requirements:
1. \( 4x + 2y = \text{tomatoSlices} \)
2. \( x + y = \text{cheeseSlices} \)

We need to solve this system of equations to find non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).

Firstly, we solve the second equation for \( y \):
\[ y = \text{cheeseSlices} - x \]

Substitute \( y \) in the first equation:
\[ 4x + 2(\text{cheeseSlices} - x) = \text{tomatoSlices} \]
\[ 4x + 2\text{cheeseSlices} - 2x = \text{tomatoSlices} \]
\[ 2x + 2\text{cheeseSlices} = \text{tomatoSlices} \]
\[ 2x = \text{tomatoSlices} - 2\text{cheeseSlices} \]
\[ x = \frac{\text{tomatoSlices} - 2\text{cheeseSlices}}{2} \]

To summarize, \(x\) is valid if:
- \(\text{tomatoSlices} \geq 2 \times \text{cheeseSlices}\)
- \(\text{tomatoSlices} - 2 \times \text{cheeseSlices}\) is even and non-negative.

If \(x\) is valid, then \(y = \text{cheeseSlices} - x\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> numOfBurgers(int tomatoSlices, int cheeseSlices) {
    int x = tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices;
    
    if(x < 0 || x % 2 != 0) {
        return {};
    }
    
    x /= 2;
    
    int y = cheeseSlices - x;
    
    if (y < 0) {
        return {};
    }
    
    return {x, y};
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> result = numOfBurgers(16, 7);
    // should output [1, 6]
    for (int n : result) {
        cout << n << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because it involves a constant number of arithmetic operations and condition checks. This makes the solution very efficient.
