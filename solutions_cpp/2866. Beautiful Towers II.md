[Leetcode 2866. Beautiful Towers II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2866)
## Problem Statement

You are given a numerical array `heights` representing the heights of towers aligned in a row. Two towers can be beautiful if the difference in their heights is more than one. Your task is to count the number of such pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < heights.length`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the tower heights guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   Yes, the heights are positive integers.

2. **Can the heights array contain duplicates?**
   Yes, the array can contain duplicate heights.

3. **What is the size range of the input array `heights`?**
   The array size can go up to \(10^5\).

## Strategy

We need to count pairs of towers where the difference in heights between the two towers is more than one. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Use a brute-force approach initially to understand the problem and gather insights on how it scales.
2. Optimize the brute-force approach using sorting and binary search.

### Brute-Force Approach

1. Iterate through all pairs of towers `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < j < heights.length`.
2. Count the number of pairs where `|heights[i] - heights[j]| > 1`.

### Optimized Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently counting valid pairs since differences can be checked in a systematic manner.
2. **Use Two Pointers**: After sorting, use a two-pointer technique where for each element, a second pointer searches for elements with height differences greater than one.
3. **Count Valid Pairs**: For each element at index `i`, find the first element at index `j` such that `heights[j] > heights[i] + 1`.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the optimized approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int countBeautifulPairs(std::vector<int>& heights) {
    std::sort(heights.begin(), heights.end());
    int n = heights.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (heights[j] > heights[i] + 1) {
                count += (n - j);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> heights = {3, 6, 2, 7, 1};
    std::cout << "Number of beautiful pairs: " << countBeautifulPairs(heights) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

### Brute-Force Approach

The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), as it checks all possible pairs in the array.

### Optimized Approach

1. **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**: The two-pointer traversal is linear, which is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the optimized approach is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\), assuming in-place sorting, or \(O(n)\) if an additional array is used for sorting.
