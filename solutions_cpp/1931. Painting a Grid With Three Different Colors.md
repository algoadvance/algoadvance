[Leetcode 1931. Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1931)
### Problem Statement

Suppose you are given a grid with dimensions `m x n`, and you are required to paint each cell in one of three different colors. However, no two adjacent cells (where adjacency is defined as sharing a common edge) can be painted the same color. The task is to determine the number of ways to paint the grid with these constraints. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the dimensions of the grid (`m` and `n`)?**
   - This is generally part of the input, so the values would be given at runtime.
   
2. **What should be considered adjacent cells?**
   - Cells that share a common edge (i.e., vertically or horizontally adjacent cells).

3. **What constitutes a valid color assignment?**
   - No two adjacent cells can share the same color.

### Strategy

This is a classic dynamic programming problem combined with combinatorial constraints. Given the conditions and large potential values for `m` and `n` (as \( m, n \leq 5 \)), we can utilize a state-based approach to effectively manage and compute the number of ways to color the grid.

#### Steps:

1. **Identify States**: Each unique row coloring can be treated as a state.
2. **Precompute Valid States**: Generate all possible row colorings and determine their validity.
3. **Transition Between States**: Determine how one valid row can transition to another.
4. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Construct a DP table to track the number of valid ways to paint up to each row for each state.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int colorTheGrid(int m, int n) {
        int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<string> states;
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> transitions;

        // Generate valid states and their transitions
        generateStates(states, m);
        generateTransitions(states, transitions);

        // DP table to keep track of coloring ways
        vector<long long> dp(states.size(), 1);
        vector<long long> new_dp(states.size(), 0);

        // DP transitions for each column
        for (int col = 1; col < n; ++col) {
            fill(new_dp.begin(), new_dp.end(), 0);
            for (int i = 0; i < states.size(); ++i) {
                for (int j : transitions[i]) {
                    new_dp[j] = (new_dp[j] + dp[i]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            dp.swap(new_dp);
        }

        // Sum up the total valid colorings
        long long res = 0;
        for (long long num : dp) {
            res = (res + num) % MOD;
        }
        return res;
    }

private:
    void generateStates(vector<string>& states, int m) {
        string colors = "RGB";
        string current(m, ' ');
        generateStatesRecursive(states, current, colors, 0, m);
    }

    void generateStatesRecursive(vector<string>& states, string& current, const string& colors, int pos, int m) {
        if (pos == m) {
            states.push_back(current);
            return;
        }

        for (char color : colors) {
            if (pos > 0 && color == current[pos - 1]) continue;
            current[pos] = color;
            generateStatesRecursive(states, current, colors, pos + 1, m);
        }
    }

    void generateTransitions(const vector<string>& states, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& transitions) {
        int size = states.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                if (isValidTransition(states[i], states[j])) {
                    transitions[i].push_back(j);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    bool isValidTransition(const string& state1, const string& state2) {
        int m = state1.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (state1[i] == state2[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **State Generation**: There are \(3^m\) possible states (rows colored in different ways).
2. **Transition Generation**: Testing all pairs of states yields a complexity of \(O(3^m \cdot 3^m)\).
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Iterating over grid cells accumulates the complexity to \(O(n \cdot 3^m \cdot 3^m)\).

Given \(m \leq 5\) and \(n \leq 5\):

- The number of possible states `3^m` is manageable.
- Overall, performance should be efficient given the constraints.
