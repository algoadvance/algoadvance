[Leetcode 2670. Find the Distinct Difference Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2670)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`. The distinct difference array of `nums` is an integer array `diff` of length `n` such that `diff[i]` is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix `nums[i+1:]` minus the number of distinct elements in the prefix `nums[0:i+1]`.

Return the distinct difference array of `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
Explanation: For index i = 0:
- The prefix is [1] and the suffix is [2,3,4,5].
- The count of distinct elements in the prefix is 1 and in the suffix is 4.
Thus, diff[0] = 4 - 1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]
Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the length of the array `nums` be zero?
   - No, the array `nums` will have at least one element.

2. Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?
   - No specific constraints were given, so we assume typical constraints for an integer array.

3. Should we return the result in a new array or modify the given array?
   - We should return the result in a new array.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We will use sets to store distinct elements for prefixes and suffixes.
   
2. **Prefix Calculation:**
   - Use a set to maintain and count distinct elements as we iterate through the prefix of the array.

3. **Suffix Calculation:**
   - Use another set to precompute distinct element counts for all suffixes starting from each index.

4. **Compute the Result:**
   - Iterate through the array and use the precomputed prefix and suffix distinct counts to fill the result array `diff`.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> distinctDifferenceArray(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> diff(n);

    // Using unordered_set to track distinct elements
    std::unordered_set<int> prefixSet, suffixSet;
    std::vector<int> suffixDistinctCount(n, 0);

    // Building distinct count for suffixes
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        suffixSet.insert(nums[i]);
        suffixDistinctCount[i] = suffixSet.size();
    }

    // Calculating the distinct difference array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSet.insert(nums[i]);
        int prefixCount = prefixSet.size();
        int suffixCount = (i + 1 < n) ? suffixDistinctCount[i + 1] : 0;
        diff[i] = suffixCount - prefixCount;
    }

    return diff;
}

// For testing
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> result1 = distinctDifferenceArray(nums1);
    for (int val : result1) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::vector<int> nums2 = {3, 2, 3, 4, 2};
    std::vector<int> result2 = distinctDifferenceArray(nums2);
    for (int val : result2) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Suffix Distinct Count Calculation:** This involves iterating through the array once, which is \(O(n)\).
- **Distinct Difference Array Calculation:** Another iteration through the array with operations inside each loop being \(O(1)\) on average due to the use of a hash set, which remains \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\).
