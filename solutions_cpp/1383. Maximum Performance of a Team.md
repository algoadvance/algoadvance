[Leetcode 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1383)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `speed` and `efficiency`, both of length `n`, and an integer `k`. The `i-th` engineer has a speed `speed[i]` and efficiency `efficiency[i]`. You need to form a team containing at most `k` engineers, and you want to maximize the performance of this team.

The performance of a team is defined as the sum of their speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their efficiencies.

Return the maximum performance of this team modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the values of `n`, `speed[i]`, and `efficiency[i]`?
   - Typically, constraints will be provided in the problem description. Without them, I will assume reasonable limits for an interview setting: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), \(1 \leq speed[i], efficiency[i] \leq 10^5\).

2. Can the team be formed with fewer than `k` members?
   - Yes, we can form a team with fewer than `k` members, but not more than `k`.

3. Are the engineer arrays always non-empty with valid values?
   - Yes, for this problem we assume valid input values.

## Strategy
1. **Sort by Efficiency**: Sort engineers by their efficiency in descending order.
2. **Use a Min-Heap**: Use a min-heap to keep track of the largest speed values we have seen so far (top `k` speeds).
3. **Iterate and Calculate**: Iteratively pick the engineer with the highest efficiency (because adding a more efficient engineer last minimizes the team performance penalty). For each iteration:
   - Add the current engineer's speed to the heap, and if the heap size exceeds `k`, remove the smallest speed from the heap.
   - Calculate the current team's performance using the current engineer's efficiency as the limiting factor (since it is the smallest encountered so far in this sorted order).
4. **Keep Track of Maximum Performance**: Track the maximum performance through all iterations and return it.

## Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPerformance(int n, std::vector<int>& speed, std::vector<int>& efficiency, int k) {
        constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> engineers(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            engineers[i] = {efficiency[i], speed[i]};
        }

        // Sort engineers by their efficiency in descending order
        std::sort(engineers.rbegin(), engineers.rend());

        // Min-heap to keep track of the largest k speeds
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> min_heap;
        long long speed_sum = 0, max_performance = 0;

        for (const auto& [current_efficiency, current_speed] : engineers) {
            // If heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest speed
            if (min_heap.size() >= k) {
                speed_sum -= min_heap.top();
                min_heap.pop();
            }
            
            // Add current speed to the heap
            min_heap.push(current_speed);
            speed_sum += current_speed;
            
            // Calculate performance with the current minimum efficiency
            max_performance = std::max(max_performance, speed_sum * current_efficiency);
        }

        // Return result mod 10^9 + 7
        return max_performance % MOD;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(\mathcal{O}(n \log n)\) for sorting the engineers by efficiency.
- **Iteration and Heap Operations**: \(\mathcal{O}(n \log k)\) where each iteration performs a push or pop on the heap of size at most `k`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **\(\mathcal{O}(n \log n + n \log k)\)** which is efficient for \( n \leq 10^5 \) and \( k \leq n \).
