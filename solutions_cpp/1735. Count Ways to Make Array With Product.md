[Leetcode 1735. Count Ways to Make Array With Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1735)
## Problem Statement

This problem is from LeetCode, but since the problem statement isn't fully detailed, I'll restate it here with a probable understanding based on typical problem structures:

You are given an array of queries where each query is a pair of integers \( (n, k) \). For each query, you have to find the number of ways to construct an array of length \( n \) such that the product of the elements is exactly \( k \). The function should be efficient in terms of both time and space, considering the constraints of the problem.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n` and `k`:**
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `n`?
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `k`?

2. **Element Range:**
   - Are the elements of the array constrained to specific ranges, such as positive integers only?

3. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return the results for each query in a list or specific data structure?

### Assumptions (based on typical constraints)

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Strategy

### Prime Factorization:
1. **Prime Factorization:** Factorize `k` into its prime factors.
2. **Combinatorial Counting:** Use combinatorial methods to count the ways to distribute these prime factors among the `n` positions in the array.
3. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since the result can be large, use a modulus \( 10^9 + 7 \) for the answer.

### Key Steps:
1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverse Factorials:** This helps in quickly computing combinations.
2. **Dynamic Programming/Combinatorial Logic:** Count the number of ways to distribute prime factors.

## Code Implementation

### Helper Functions for Factorials and Inverses

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_map>

const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;

std::vector<long long> factorials, inverse_factorials;

long long mod_pow(long long a, long long b, int mod) {
    long long res = 1;
    while (b > 0) {
        if (b & 1) res = res * a % mod;
        a = a * a % mod;
        b >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}

void precompute_factorials(int max_n, int mod) {
    factorials.resize(max_n + 1);
    inverse_factorials.resize(max_n + 1);
    
    factorials[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= max_n; i++) {
        factorials[i] = factorials[i-1] * i % mod;
    }
    
    inverse_factorials[max_n] = mod_pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod);
    for (int i = max_n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        inverse_factorials[i] = inverse_factorials[i + 1] * (i + 1) % mod;
    }
}

long long comb(int n, int k, int mod) {
    if (k > n || k < 0) return 0;
    return factorials[n] * inverse_factorials[k] % mod * inverse_factorials[n - k] % mod;
}

std::unordered_map<int, int> prime_factorize(int k) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> prime_factors;
    for (int i = 2; i <= std::sqrt(k); i++) {
        while (k % i == 0) {
            prime_factors[i]++;
            k /= i;
        }
    }
    if (k > 1) {
        prime_factors[k]++;
    }
    return prime_factors;
}

std::vector<int> waysToFillArray(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
    int max_n = 0;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        max_n = std::max(max_n, query[0]);
    }
    precompute_factorials(max_n, MOD);
    
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int n = query[0];
        int k = query[1];
        auto prime_factors = prime_factorize(k);
        long long ways = 1;
        for (const auto& p : prime_factors) {
            ways = ways * comb(n + p.second - 1, p.second, MOD) % MOD;
        }
        result.push_back(static_cast<int>(ways));
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prime Factorization:** \( O(\sqrt{k}) \) for each `k`.
- **Precomputation:**
  - Factorials and Inverse Factorials: \( O(n \log MOD) \)
- **Combinations Calculation** for each query: Relies on precomputed factorials, thus \( O(1) \) for each combination.
- **Total Time Complexity:** Handling each query depends primarily on prime factorization \( O(\sqrt{k}) \). Precomputation is \( O(n \log MOD) \).

### Space Complexity

- Storing factorials and inverse factorials up to `n`: \( O(n) \)
- Overall space complexity: \( O(n) \)

This strategy ensures that even for large inputs, the function performs efficiently by leveraging precomputation and modular arithmetic.
