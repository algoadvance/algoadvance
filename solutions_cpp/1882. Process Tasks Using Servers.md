[Leetcode 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1882)
## Problem Statement

You have a number of servers that are running tasks. You are given two integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of length `n` and `m` respectively, and an integer `k` which represents the number of servers.

- The `servers[i]` represent the weight of the `i-th` server.
- The `tasks[j]` represent the time each task takes to complete.
- Initially, all servers are free.

Tasks should be assigned to the free server with the smallest weight. If there is a tie, the server with the smallest index is assigned the task. If all servers are occupied, the task will wait until any server gets free.

Your goal is to determine the server that will handle each task in the order of the tasks. Return an array `result` of length `m` where `result[j]` is the index of the server that the `j-th` task will be assigned to.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the servers handle multiple tasks simultaneously?
   - **A:** No, each server can handle only one task at a time.
   
2. **Q:** How are the tasks and servers represented in the input?
   - **A:** `servers[i]` indicates the weight of the `i-th` server, and `tasks[j]` indicates the time taken to complete the `j-th` task.
   
3. **Q:** Should the result array indices match the task indices identically?
   - **A:** Yes, the `result` array indicating which server handles which task should be in the same order as the `tasks` array.

4. **Q:** What should we do if multiple servers become available at the same time?
   - **A:** Choose the server with the smallest weight and if there is a tie, choose the server with the smallest index.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Min-Heaps:**
   - Use a min-heap to manage free servers efficiently. Store servers as pairs `(weight, index)` to prioritize by weight first and then by index.
   - Use another min-heap to track the busy servers, storing pairs `(release_time, index)`.

2. **Assign Tasks to Servers:**
   - Iterate over each task. For each task:
     - Check if the current time is less than the earliest release time in the busy servers heap. If true, assign the task to a free server directly.
     - If no servers are free, wait until at least one server becomes free by updating the current time according to the earliest release time from the busy servers heap.
     - Once a server is free, assign the task to the server and update its release time, then push it back to the busy servers heap.
   
3. **Return Result:**
   - Maintain a result list where each position will denote the index of the server handling that task.

## Time Complexity

- Pushing and popping from heaps takes `O(log k)` time.
- Iterating tasks take `O(m)` time in total.
- The overall time complexity would be `O(m log k)`, where `m` is the number of tasks and `k` is the number of servers.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct Server {
    int weight;
    int index;
    bool operator<(const Server& other) const {
        return weight > other.weight || (weight == other.weight && index > other.index);
    }
};

struct Task {
    int end_time;
    int index;
    bool operator<(const Task& other) const {
        return end_time > other.end_time || (end_time == other.end_time && index > other.index);
    }
};

vector<int> assignTasks(vector<int>& servers, vector<int>& tasks) {
    priority_queue<Server> free_servers;
    priority_queue<Task> busy_servers;
    vector<int> result(tasks.size());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < servers.size(); ++i) {
        free_servers.push(Server{servers[i], i});
    }
    
    int time = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < tasks.size(); ++i) {
        time = max(time, i);
        while (!busy_servers.empty() && busy_servers.top().end_time <= time) {
            auto server = busy_servers.top();
            busy_servers.pop();
            free_servers.push(Server{servers[server.index], server.index});
        }
        
        if (free_servers.empty()) {
            time = busy_servers.top().end_time;
            while (!busy_servers.empty() && busy_servers.top().end_time <= time) {
                auto server = busy_servers.top();
                busy_servers.pop();
                free_servers.push(Server{servers[server.index], server.index});
            }
        }
        
        auto server = free_servers.top();
        free_servers.pop();
        result[i] = server.index;
        busy_servers.push(Task{time + tasks[i], server.index});
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This code assigns tasks to the servers according to the given specifications and ensures that tasks are processed as efficiently as possible, following the rules defined in the problem statement.
