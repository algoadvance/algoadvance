[Leetcode 2547. Minimum Cost to Split an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2547)
### Problem Statement

We are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to determine the minimum cost to split the array into any number of non-empty subarrays such that their total cost is minimized.

The cost to split an array into subarrays is defined as the sum of:
1. The square of the number of unique integers in the subarray.
2. The integer `k` which is added for each subarray.

For example, if we split the array `[1,2,1]` with `k=3`, and suppose we split it as `[1,2], [1]` then the cost would be:
- For subarray `[1,2]`: Number of unique integers = 2, so cost = 2² + k = 4 + 3 = 7.
- For subarray `[1]`: Number of unique integers = 1, so cost = 1² + k = 1 + 3 = 4.
- Total cost = 7 + 4 = 11.

The task is to compute the minimal possible cost for splitting the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements of the array `nums` be negative, or are they always non-negative integers?
2. What is the range of the length of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?
3. Should we consider the cost of splitting the array at every possible index, or is there a specific pattern we should look for?
4. Are there any constraints on the size of `nums` that we have to consider for potential optimization?

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0; 
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            unordered_map<int, int> freq;
            int uniqueCount = 0;
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (++freq[nums[j]] == 1) {
                    ++uniqueCount;
                } else if (freq[nums[j]] == 2) {
                    --uniqueCount;
                }
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + uniqueCount * uniqueCount + k);
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1};
    int k = 3;
    cout << "Minimum Cost: " << solution.minCost(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to split the first `i` elements of the array.
2. **Nested Loops for Subarrays**: For each position `i`, we consider all possible subarrays ending at `i`. This is achieved using a nested loop, where for each possible starting point `j`, we calculate the cost including the subarray from `j` to `i`.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: We maintain a frequency count of elements in the current subarray to compute the number of unique integers efficiently.
4. **Cost Calculation**: For each subarray `[j:i-1]`, we compute the cost with the formula discussed, add to the cost of `dp[j]`, and update `dp[i]`.

### Time Complexity

- The solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because for each position `i` from `1` to `n`, we loop through all possible starting points `j` from `i-1` to `0`.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the DP array used to store the minimum cost for each position in the input array.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible splits efficiently while always keeping track of the minimum cost for each subarray configuration.
