[Leetcode 1881. Maximum Value after Insertion](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1881)
### Problem Statement

You are given a very large integer `n` represented as a string and an integer `x`. Your task is to insert `x` somewhere in `n` such that the resulting number is the largest possible value. Return the resulting string after the insertion.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= x <= 9`
- `n` will be a valid integer without leading zeros, but it can be negative.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the result always required to be returned as a string?**
   Yes, the result should be a string as it directly represents a very large number.
   
2. **What if `n` is negative?**
   If `n` is negative, we should insert `x` in such a way that the resulting number is as large in absolute value but still negative (i.e., the "smallest" in terms of numerical value).

3. **Can `n` contain any other characters besides numbers and a possible leading '-'?**
   No, `n` will always be a valid integer representation in the form specified in the problem statement.

### Strategy

1. **Positive n:**
   - Insert `x` in the first position where `x` is greater than the current digit to form the largest possible number.
   
2. **Negative n:**
   - Insert `x` in the first position where `x` is less than the current digit, because making the number smaller in absolute value while preserving the negative sign will result in a "larger" number.
   
3. **Edge Case:**
   - Directly append `x` if no better position is found during the traversal.

We will loop through the digits of `n` and determine the best position to insert `x` according to the strategies described above.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string maxValueAfterInsertion(string n, int x) {
    int len = n.size();
    char xChar = '0' + x;

    // Case when the number is not negative
    if (n[0] != '-') {
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (n[i] < xChar) {
                // Insert `x` before `n[i]`
                return n.substr(0, i) + xChar + n.substr(i);
            }
        }
    } else { // Case when the number is negative
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) { // start from 1 to skip the '-'
            if (n[i] > xChar) {
                // Insert `x` before `n[i]`
                return n.substr(0, i) + xChar + n.substr(i);
            }
        }
    }

    // If no position was found, append `x` to the end
    return n + xChar;
}

int main() {
    string n = "-132";
    int x = 3;
    cout << "Result: " << maxValueAfterInsertion(n, x) << endl; // Output: -1323
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The function primarily involves a single traversal of the string `n`. Thus, the time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of the input string `n`. The operations of string slicing and concatenation are also linear in complexity regarding the length of the segments involved. Given the constraints, this approach will be efficient.
