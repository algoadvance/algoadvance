### Problem Statement

1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations

Given two strings s and t, you want to transform string s into string t using the substring sort operations. The substring sort operation consists of two steps:

1. Select any non-empty substring in `s` that contains only one unique character.
2. Sort the substring (this implies no change since all characters are the same).

Return `true` if you can transform `s` into `t`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the lengths and character constraints of the strings?
   - Both `s` and `t` have the same length, composed of digits from '0' to '9', and are not empty.
   
2. **Character Sets:** Are both strings guaranteed to have the same set of characters?
   - Yes, as they are composed of digits and have the same length.

3. **Ordering Preservation:** Is our main concern to check if the characters in `s` can be rearranged to match `t` while preserving the relative order of certain characters?
   - Yes, while we can sort substrings, we must ensure that the relative positions of necessary characters (as implied by `t`) are achievable.

### Strategy

The core idea of the solution will involve:

1. **Frequency Count Check:** Ensure that `s` and `t` have the same frequency for each character. This is a necessary condition.
2. **Position Check:** For each character in `t`, ensure that all less or equal-valued characters in positions before it in `s` are transformed accordingly to allow for `t`'s relative ordering.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <queue>

bool isTransformable(std::string s, std::string t) {
    std::vector<std::queue<int>> pos(10);

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        pos[s[i] - '0'].push(i);
    }

    for (char c : t) {
        int digit = c - '0';
        if (pos[digit].empty()) {
            return false;
        }

        int idx = pos[digit].front();
        for (int i = 0; i < digit; ++i) {
            if (!pos[i].empty() && pos[i].front() < idx) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        pos[digit].pop();
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "84532";
    std::string t = "34852";
    std::cout << (isTransformable(s, t) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Queue Initialization:** We initialize a vector of queues to keep track of indices for each digit (0-9) in `s`.
2. **Index Tracking:** As we iterate through `t` to construct the string from `s`:
   - We get the first instance of the required digit.
   - We check if there are any smaller digits with indices appearing before this instance of the required digit to prevent correct ordering.
   - If everything is valid, we pop the index from the queue and continue.
   
### Time Complexity

- **Queue Initialization:** Linear time to initialize and populate queues, which is O(n) where n is the length of `s` (and `t`).
- **Transformation Check:** For each character in `t` (of length n), we potentially check â‰¤9 queues, leading to an average O(1) check per character. Thus, the overall time complexity remains O(n).

Thus, the solution is efficient and operates within linear time complexity.
