[Leetcode 3227. Vowels Game in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3227)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters only. Two players play a vowels game as follows:
- Player 1 scores 1 point each time a substring that starts with a vowel and ends with any character is formed.
- Player 2 scores 1 point each time a substring that starts with a consonant and ends with any character is formed.

Calculate the total score for both players and determine who is the winner. If it's a tie, return "Draw".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the vowels and consonants considered in this problem?**
   - **Vowels**: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
   - **Consonants**: All other lowercase alphabets.

2. **What should be the output format?**
   - The output should be the total scores of both players and the winner's name or "Draw".

3. **Are strings always non-empty?**
   - Assume all strings are non-empty for simplicity.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Iterate through the string and identify if the character is a vowel or consonant.
2. Count all possible substrings starting with the current character. For character at position `i`, the number of such substrings would be `len(s) - i` (since substrings can end anywhere from `i` to the end of the string).
3. Maintain two counters for Player 1 and Player 2 scores and add the calculated substrings count to the appropriate player's score.
4. Determine the winner based on the scores.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::pair<int, int> calculateScores(const std::string& s) {
    int player1Score = 0;
    int player2Score = 0;
    int n = s.length();
    
    // Lambda to check if a character is a vowel
    auto isVowel = [](char c) {
        return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
    };
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int scoreContribution = n - i;
        if (isVowel(s[i])) {
            player1Score += scoreContribution;
        } else {
            player2Score += scoreContribution;
        }
    }
    
    return {player1Score, player2Score};
}

std::string determineWinner(int player1Score, int player2Score) {
    if (player1Score > player2Score) {
        return "Player 1 wins";
    } else if (player2Score > player1Score) {
        return "Player 2 wins";
    } else {
        return "Draw";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    
    auto scores = calculateScores(s);
    std::string result = determineWinner(scores.first, scores.second);
    
    std::cout << "Player 1 score: " << scores.first << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Player 2 score: " << scores.second << std::endl;
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm loops through the string once, making the time complexity **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string.
- Space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a constant amount of extra space for score counters.

### Explanation
1. **Player 1 Scores**:
   - For each vowel at position `i`, there are `n - i` substrings that start with this vowel.
2. **Player 2 Scores**:
   - For each consonant at position `i`, there are `n - i` substrings that start with this consonant.
3. **Determine the Winner**:
   - Compare the total scores of Player 1 and Player 2 to determine the outcome. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

This approach ensures that we efficiently tally the scores and determine the result according to the problem requirements.
