[Leetcode 1357. Apply Discount Every n Orders](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1357)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem: **1357. Apply Discount Every n Orders**

There is a shop with a discount system. The shop follows a discount rule: for every group of `n` customers that place an order, they will be offered a discount. When a customer makes an order, the amount he needs to pay will be calculated by summing the costs of each product in the customer's order list. If this is the n-th customer, the shop will give them a discount on the payment. The discount is given as a percentage off the total price.

You need to implement the `Cashier` class:

- **`Cashier(int n, int discount, vector<int>& products, vector<int>& prices)`**: Initializes the object with `n` as the number of customers that must order before a discount is applied, `discount` as the percentage discount, `products` as a list of product IDs, and `prices` as a list of corresponding product prices.

- **`double getBill(vector<int>& product, vector<int>& amount)`**: Returns the total cost after applying the discount (if applicable) for the given `product` and `amount` (quantity of each product) lists.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the discount applied to every `n`th customer or to every order when the cumulative orders reach `n`?**
   - The discount is applied to every `n`th customer.

2. **What is the range of the percentage discount value?**
   - The discount is given as a whole number percentage (e.g., 20 for 20%).

3. **Can the product list contain duplicates?**
   - No, each product ID is unique.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the frequency with which the discount is to be applied (`n`) and the discount percentage.
   - Use a hash map to store product prices for quick lookup.

2. **Billing Calculation**:
   - Fetch product prices and quantities.
   - Sum the total amount for the given products.
   - If the current customer should receive a discount, apply the discount to the total sum.
   - Increment the customer counter and reset it after every `n` customers.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle scenarios where the product IDs and their quantities might be empty (though this situation might not be typical for this problem).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Cashier {
private:
    int n, discount, currentCustomer;
    unordered_map<int, int> productPrices;

public:
    Cashier(int n, int discount, vector<int>& products, vector<int>& prices) {
        this->n = n;
        this->discount = discount;
        this->currentCustomer = 0;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < products.size(); ++i) {
            productPrices[products[i]] = prices[i];
        }
    }

    double getBill(vector<int>& product, vector<int>& amount) {
        double totalBill = 0.0;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < product.size(); ++i) {
            totalBill += productPrices[product[i]] * amount[i];
        }

        currentCustomer++;
        // Apply discount if this is the nth customer
        if (currentCustomer == n) {
            totalBill -= (totalBill * discount) / 100.0;
            currentCustomer = 0; // Reset count after every nth customer
        }

        return totalBill;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**:
  - `O(P)`, where `P` is the number of products since we create a hash map with `P` entries.
  
- **Bill Calculation**:
  - `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of different products in the current order. This involves summing up the bill based on quantities and potentially applying a discount.

This solution is efficient, as the use of a hash map allows for constant-time price lookups, making the bill calculation linear with respect to the size of the order.
