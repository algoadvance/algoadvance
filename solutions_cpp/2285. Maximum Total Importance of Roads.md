[Leetcode 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2285)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of cities, and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a[i], b[i]]` represents a bidirectional road connecting cities `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

The importance of a city is defined by some integer value. The total importance of a road connecting cities `a[i]` and `b[i]` is defined as the sum of the importance of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. 

You need to assign importance values to each city and maximize the total importance of all roads.

Return the maximum total importance of all roads.

### Strategy

To maximize the total importance of all roads:
1. Count the degree (number of roads connected) for each city.
2. Assign importance values based on these degrees such that cities with higher degrees get higher importance.
3. Sum up the total importance based on this assignment.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the importance values integers?
   - Yes.
2. Is there any specific range for the importance values?
   - No, but they should be assigned such that no two cities initially hold the same value unless necessary.
3. Can the input contain self-loops? 
   - No, `roads[i][0] != roads[i][1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumImportance(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        // Step 1: Count the degree of each city
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);
        for (const auto& road : roads) {
            degree[road[0]]++;
            degree[road[1]]++;
        }

        // Step 2: Sort cities by degree in descending order
        vector<int> cities(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cities[i] = i;
        }
        sort(cities.begin(), cities.end(), [&degree](int a, int b) {
            return degree[a] > degree[b];
        });

        // Step 3: Assign importance values
        vector<int> importance(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            importance[cities[i]] = n - i;
        }

        // Step 4: Calculate total importance
        long long total_importance = 0;
        for (const auto& road : roads) {
            total_importance += importance[road[0]] + importance[road[1]];
        }

        return total_importance;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. Counting the degree of each city takes `O(m)` time, where `m` is the number of roads (since each road affects two cities).
2. Sorting the cities based on their degree takes `O(n log n)` time.
3. Assigning the importance values takes `O(n)` time.
4. Summing up the total importance of all roads takes `O(m)` time.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n + m)`.

### Explanation

1. **Degree Counting**: We first count how many roads are connected to each city.
2. **Sorting**: We sort the cities by their degree in decreasing order. This ensures that cities with more connections get higher importance.
3. **Assignment**: We assign the highest available importance value to the city with the highest degree.
4. **Total Importance**: Finally, we compute the total importance by summing the importance values of both cities for each road.
