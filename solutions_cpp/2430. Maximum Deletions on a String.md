[Leetcode 2430. Maximum Deletions on a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2430)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. You can perform two types of operations on the string:

1. Delete one character from `s`.
2. Delete two equal consecutive characters from `s`.

Your goal is to return the minimum number of deletions required to make the string empty.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "abcbd"
Output: 4
Explanation: First delete "bc", then delete "bd", then delete "a", then delete "b".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length limit of the string `s`?**
   - There is no explicit constraint given, but typically LeetCode problems can go up to length 1000 or more.
   
2. **Can the string `s` be empty initially?**
   - The problem does not explicitly forbid this, so we assume it could be empty. An empty string will trivially have 0 operations needed.

3. **What should we return if the string is already empty?**
   - We should return 0, as no deletions are required.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a dynamic programming (DP) approach. 

### Dynamic Programming State Definition

- Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum number of deletions to make the string `s[0:i+1]` empty (considering the string from beginning to the current position).

### Recurrence Relation

- We have two options for each character:
  - Delete the current character, thus `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1`.
  - If `s[i] == s[i-1]`, we can delete these two characters which means `dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 1`.

### Base Cases

- `dp[0]` should be 1 because it takes one deletion to remove a single character.
- For `dp[1]`, if `s[0] == s[1]`, then `dp[1] = 1` (delete the pair), otherwise `dp[1] = 2` (delete each separately).

### Code Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int minDeletions(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    vector<int> dp(n);

    dp[0] = 1;
    if (n > 1) {
        dp[1] = (s[0] == s[1]) ? 1 : 2;
    }

    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1; // delete current character
        if (s[i] == s[i-1]) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-2] + 1); // delete pair of characters
        }
    }

    return dp[n-1];
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcbd";
    cout << "Minimum deletions: " << minDeletions(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this dynamic programming solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the string once and making constant-time operations at each step.
  
### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is also O(n) for the `dp` array.

This DP approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum number of deletions needed to empty the string while properly handling both deletion rules given in the problem statement.
