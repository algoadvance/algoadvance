[Leetcode 149. Max Points on a Line](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l149)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of `n` (number of points)?
   - Assume `n` can be between 1 and 300.
   
2. **Coordinate Values**: What are the possible ranges for the coordinates of the points?
   - Assume the coordinates are integer values within the range of -10,000 to 10,000.
   
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - Only one point?
   - All points with the same coordinates?
   - Vertically and horizontally aligned points?

These questions help clarify the constraints and implement a more robust solution. 

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a brute-force approach might not be efficient due to the potential maximum value of `n` being 300, leading to a quadratic-time solution. Hereâ€™s a more efficient approach:

1. **Slope Calculation**:
   - For each point, compute the slope between the current point and every other point. 
   - Use a hash map (or unordered_map in C++) to count the number of points for each unique slope value that is calculated.
   - The key aspect here is to normalize the slope to avoid issues with precision and representation. For example, two points `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)` have the same slope with `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`.

2. **Vertical and Horizontal Lines**:
   - Handle vertical lines (infinite slope) and horizontal lines separately since they can be special cases where the difference in `x` or `y` coordinates is zero.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to normalize the slope representation.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct Point {
    int x, y;
    Point() : x(0), y(0) {}
    Point(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
};

int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

int maxPoints(vector<Point>& points) {
    if (points.size() <= 1) return points.size();
    int max_points = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i) {
        unordered_map<string, int> slopes;
        int local_max = 0, overlap = 0, vertical = 0;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); ++j) {
            int dx = points[j].x - points[i].x;
            int dy = points[j].y - points[i].y;
            if (dx == 0 && dy == 0) {
                ++overlap;
                continue;
            }
            if (dx == 0) {
                ++vertical;
            } else {
                int g = gcd(dx, dy);
                dx /= g;
                dy /= g;
                if (dy < 0) {
                    dx = -dx;
                    dy = -dy;
                } else if (dy == 0 && dx < 0) {
                    dx = -dx;
                }
                string slope = to_string(dx) + '/' + to_string(dy);
                ++slopes[slope];
                local_max = max(local_max, slopes[slope]);
            }
        }
        local_max = max(local_max, vertical);
        max_points = max(max_points, local_max + overlap + 1);
    }
    return max_points;
}

int main() {
    vector<Point> points = {{1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3, 3}};
    cout << maxPoints(points) << endl; // Output should be 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution involves iterating through each pair of points, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\):
- **Outer loop**: \(O(n)\)
- **Inner loop**: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the number of points.

This solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and edge cases, ensuring correct and optimized performance.
