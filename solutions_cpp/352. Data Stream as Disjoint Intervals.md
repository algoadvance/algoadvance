[Leetcode 352. Data Stream as Disjoint Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l352)
## Problem Statement

Given a data stream input, we need to design a data structure that efficiently performs the following operations:

1. Adds a number from the stream to the data structure.
2. Returns the disjoint intervals that cover all the numbers so far added.

To solve this problem, the data structure should be able to merge new numbers into existing intervals efficiently.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: [1, 3, 7, 2, 6]
Output: [[1, 3], [6, 7]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

- **Q1:** Can the input numbers appear in any order?
  - **A1:** Yes, numbers can appear in any order.
  
- **Q2:** Should the intervals be returned in sorted order?
  - **A2:** Yes, intervals should be returned in sorted order.
  
- **Q3:** Can the stream contain duplicate numbers?
  - **A3:** Assume that there are no duplicates in the stream for simplicity.
  
- **Q4:** Will the input be large enough to worry about the efficiency of the solution?
  - **A4:** Yes, we are required to design an efficient solution considering the potential size of the input.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - A balanced binary search tree (BST) will be effective to maintain the sorted property and support efficient insertion and merging.
   - `std::map` in C++ can be considered a good choice since it's implemented as a self-balancing BST (usually a Red-Black tree).

2. **Operations**:
   - **Add a number**: When a new number is added, check adjacent intervals to see if they should be merged with this number.
   - **Get Intervals**: Iterate over the intervals stored in the map and return them in a sorted order.

3. **Steps**:
   - For insertion, check if the new number can be merged with existing intervals.
   - When merging, make sure adjacent intervals combine properly to form a single interval if necessary.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <iostream>

class SummaryRanges {
private:
    std::map<int, int> intervals;
    
public:
    SummaryRanges() {}
    
    void addNum(int val) {
        if (intervals.count(val)) return;
        
        // Find the right position for the new interval
        auto it = intervals.lower_bound(val);
        
        int start = val, end = val;
        
        if (it != intervals.begin()) {
            auto prev = std::prev(it);
            if (prev->second >= val - 1) {
                start = prev->first;
                end = std::max(prev->second, end);
                intervals.erase(prev);
            }
        }
        
        if (it != intervals.end() && it->first == val + 1) {
            end = it->second;
            intervals.erase(it);
        }
        
        intervals[start] = end;
    }
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> getIntervals() {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        for (const auto& pair : intervals) {
            result.push_back({pair.first, pair.second});
        }
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    SummaryRanges obj;
    obj.addNum(1);
    obj.addNum(3);
    obj.addNum(7);
    obj.addNum(2);
    obj.addNum(6);
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> intervals = obj.getIntervals();
    for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
        std::cout << "[" << interval[0] << ", " << interval[1] << "] ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Add Operation (`addNum`)**: Each insertion and potential merge operation can be performed in \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals currently stored.
- **Get Intervals (`getIntervals`)**: Generating the list of intervals can be done in \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals.

This ensures that both operations are efficient for a large number of inputs.
