[Leetcode 1192. Critical Connections in a Network](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1192)
### Problem Statement
You are given an undirected connected network consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array of `connections` where `connections[i] = [u_i, v_i]` represents a connection between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. 

Critical connections are connections that, if removed, will make some node unable to reach some other node.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the number of nodes `n` and the number of connections?
   **A:** Typically, `1 <= n <= 10,000` and `connections.length == n - 1`.

2. **Q:** Are the node labels guaranteed to be unique and within the range `[0, n-1]`?
   **A:** Yes.

3. **Q:** Is there exactly one connection between each pair of nodes in the input?
   **A:** Yes.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will employ a Depth-First Search (DFS) based algorithm, specifically Tarjan's algorithm for finding Bridges in an undirected graph. A bridge in a graph is an edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components.

1. **Tarjan's Algorithm**:
   - Use DFS to traverse the graph.
   - Maintain discovery times of visited vertices.
   - Use a low-link value which helps in detecting bridges.
   - If the lowest point that a node can reach (low value) is greater than the discovery time of an ancestor node, then this edge is a bridge.

### Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the solution using Tarjan's algorithm:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    vector<vector<int>> graph;  // adjacency list for the graph
    vector<int> discovery, low;  // discovery time and low value for each node
    vector<vector<int>> bridges;  // to store the result
    int time = 0;  // global timer for discovery time

    void dfs(int node, int parent) {
        discovery[node] = low[node] = ++time;  // initialize discovery time and low value
        for (const int& neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;  // skip the edge back to parent
            if (!discovery[neighbor]) {  // neighbor not yet visited
                dfs(neighbor, node);
                low[node] = min(low[node], low[neighbor]);  // update low value
                if (low[neighbor] > discovery[node]) {
                    bridges.push_back({node, neighbor});  // found a bridge
                }
            } else {
                low[node] = min(low[node], discovery[neighbor]);  // update low value if neighbor already discovered
            }
        }
    }

public:
    vector<vector<int>> criticalConnections(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
        graph.resize(n);  // resize the graph to have n nodes
        discovery.resize(n, 0);  // initialize discovery times to 0
        low.resize(n, 0);  // initialize low values to 0
        
        // Build the graph
        for (const auto& conn : connections) {
            graph[conn[0]].push_back(conn[1]);
            graph[conn[1]].push_back(conn[0]);
        }
        
        // Start DFS from node 0 (assuming node 0 exists in the graph)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!discovery[i]) {
                dfs(i, -1);
            }
        }
        
        return bridges;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges (connections). This is due to the depth-first search traversal of the entire graph and the linear work done per node/edge. 

This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of `n` up to `10,000` nodes.
