[Leetcode 942. DI String Match](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l942)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that contains only the characters `'I'` (for "increase") and `'D'` (for "decrease"). Let `n` be the length of the string `s`. The goal is to construct an array `perm` of length `n + 1` where:

- The array `perm` contains all integers from `0` to `n`.
- For every `i` from `0` to `n - 1`:
  - If `s[i]` is `'I'`, then `perm[i] < perm[i + 1]`.
  - If `s[i]` is `'D'`, then `perm[i] > perm[i + 1]`.

You need to return one such array `perm`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "IDID"
Output: [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should we return if the input string does not contain any characters or is empty?
   - Even if the string `s` is empty, we should return a single-element array `[0]`.

2. Do we need to validate the input string to ensure it contains only 'I' and 'D' characters?
   - For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the input string `s` is always valid and contains only 'I' and 'D'.

3. Is the solution expected to work in-place or can we use additional memory?
   - We are allowed to use additional memory to achieve the desired solution.

## Strategy

### Approach

1. **Two-pointer approach:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `low` starting at 0 and `high` starting at `n`.
   - Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 'I', add `low` to the result array and increment `low`.
   - If the character is 'D', add `high` to the result array and decrement `high`.
   - Finally, add the remaining value of `low` (or `high`, since they would be equal at this point) to the result array.

### Time Complexity
   - The solution will have a time complexity of O(n) since we are traversing the string `s` once, performing O(1) operations in each iteration.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> diStringMatch(const std::string& s) {
    int n = s.length();
    std::vector<int> perm(n + 1);
    int low = 0, high = n;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == 'I') {
            perm[i] = low++;
        } else {
            perm[i] = high--;
        }
    }
    perm[n] = low; // low and high should be the same at this point
    
    return perm;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. We initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`.
2. We use a loop to iterate over each character in the string `s`.
3. Depending on whether the character is 'I' or 'D', we append `low` or `high` to the `perm` array and update the pointers.
4. Finally, we append the remaining number to the last position of `perm`.

This gives us the required permutation array that satisfies the conditions for 'I' and 'D'.
