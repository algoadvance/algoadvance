[Leetcode 2188. Minimum Time to Finish the Race](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2188)
### Problem Statement

You are given a series of laps in a race, and for each lap, you have multiple cars to choose from with their respective times. Each car has a time penalty that is added to every lap it completes. You need to find the minimum time to finish the race.

Formally, you are given:
- An integer array `cars` where `cars[i]` is the initial time taken by the i-th car to complete one lap.
- A 2D integer array `time_penalty` where `time_penalty[i][j]` represents the additional time penalty for the i-th car on the j-th lap, where `j` is in the range from 1 to the number of laps minus one.

Given `n` laps, find the minimum time required to finish the race using the cars optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of `cars` and `time_penalty` the same?**
   - Yes, the length of `cars` is the same as the number of rows in `time_penalty`.

2. **Is the number of laps fixed or dynamic?**
   - The number of laps, `n`, will be provided as an input.

3. **Can I assume there will always be at least one car and one lap?**
   - Yes, you can assume that there will always be at least one car and one lap.

4. **Should the penalty be applied every lap or just starting from the second lap?**
   - The penalty should be applied starting from the second lap.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to use Dynamic Programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum time to complete `j` laps using the `i-th` car. 

1. **Define the DP State:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum time required to complete `j` laps ending with the `i-th` car.

2. **Transition:**
   - For each car `k` and lap `j`, update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum time considering the previous laps and the current lap time with the penalty.
   - `dp[i][j]` = min(`dp[i][j]`, `dp[k][j-1]` + `cars[i]` + `time_penalty[i][j-1]`).

3. **Initialization:**
   - For the first lap, `dp[i][1] = cars[i]` because no penalty applies on the first lap.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The result will be the minimum value in `dp[i][n]` for all `i` cars.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minTimeToFinishRace(vector<int>& cars, vector<vector<int>>& time_penalty, int n) {
    int m = cars.size();
    // dp[i][j] represents the minimum time to complete j laps using the i-th car last
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n + 1, INT_MAX));

    // Initialize the first lap
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        dp[i][1] = cars[i];
    }

    // Fill in the dp table
    for (int lap = 2; lap <= n; ++lap) {
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int k = 0; k < m; ++k) {
                if (dp[k][lap - 1] != INT_MAX) {
                    dp[i][lap] = min(dp[i][lap], dp[k][lap - 1] + cars[i] + time_penalty[i][lap - 2]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum time to complete n laps
    int min_time = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        min_time = min(min_time, dp[i][n]);
    }

    return min_time;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(m) where `m` is the number of cars.
- **DP Fill**: O(n * m^2) where `n` is the number of laps, and `m` is the number of cars.
- **Result Extraction**: O(m).

The overall time complexity is O(n * m^2). This approach ensures that we systematically explore and track the minimum time for each combination of cars and laps.
