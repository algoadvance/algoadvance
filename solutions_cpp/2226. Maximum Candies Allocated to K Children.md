[Leetcode 2226. Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2226)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `candies` where each element represents the quantity of candies in a pile, and an integer `k` representing the number of children, distribute the candies such that each child gets the maximum number of candies possible while still maintaining fairness. You need to determine the maximum number of candies each child can get. If it's impossible for every child to get at least one candy, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be fewer piles of candies than children (k > the number of elements in `candies`)?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Should each child get an equal number of candies, or can some children get more than others?**
   - Each child should get an equal amount of candies.

3. **Is the array `candies` always non-empty and are the values always positive?**
   - Assume `candies` is always non-empty and contains positive integers.

### Strategy
1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - We are looking for the maximum number of candies each child can get, which suggests a binary search due to its logarithmic efficiency in checking a range of possibilities.
   
2. **Binary Search Boundaries:**
   - The lower limit (`low`) would be `1` (each child must get at least one candy).
   - The upper limit (`high`) would be the maximum number of candies in a single pile since no child can get more than that.

3. **Mid Calculation and Distribution Check:**
   - For each middle value (`mid`), check if it is possible to give at least `mid` candies to each child.
   - Calculate how many children can be satisfied with `mid` candies by summing up `candies[i] // mid` for all piles `i`.

4. **Adjust Search Range:**
   - If it's possible to satisfy all `k` children with `mid` candies each (i.e., the total count is greater than or equal to `k`), search the upper half (`low = mid + 1`).
   - Otherwise, search the lower half (`high = mid - 1`).

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumCandies(vector<int>& candies, int k) {
        long long low = 1, high = *max_element(candies.begin(), candies.end());
        
        auto canDistribute = [&](long long mid) {
            long long count = 0;
            for (long long candy : candies) {
                count += candy / mid;
            }
            return count >= k;
        };
        
        int result = 0;
        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canDistribute(mid)) {
                result = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Complexity:** O(log(max_element) * n)
  - `log(max_element)` is for the binary search on the range of maximum candies per child.
  - `n` is for the summation check in each iteration.

So, the time complexity is primarily determined by the binary search and the array traversal in each check, making it efficient given typical constraints.
