[Leetcode 2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2651)
## Problem Statement

You are given a scheduled arrival time of a train in 24-hour format (0-23). The train can be delayed by a certain amount of hours. Write a function that returns the delayed arrival time in the same 24-hour format.

**Example:**
- Input: `arrivalTime = 22, delayedTime = 5`
- Output: `3`

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= arrivalTime < 24`
- `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the delayed time always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, as per the problem constraints.
  
2. **What is the range of the arrival time?**
   - Arrival time is always between 0 and 23 (inclusive).

3. **Should we account for wrap-around beyond midnight?**
   - Yes, the 24-hour format should wrap around if the delayed time exceeds 24 hours.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the new arrival time after the delay in a 24-hour format. We can achieve this by adding the delayed hours to the scheduled arrival time and taking the result modulo 24. This handles the wrap-around for times greater than or equal to 24 hours.

**Steps:**
1. Calculate the sum of `arrivalTime` and `delayedTime`.
2. Take this sum modulo 24.
3. Return the result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(1), as the operations required (addition and modulo) take constant time.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int findDelayedArrivalTime(int arrivalTime, int delayedTime) {
    return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
}

int main() {
    int arrivalTime = 22;
    int delayedTime = 5;
    
    std::cout << "Delayed arrival time: " << findDelayedArrivalTime(arrivalTime, delayedTime) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines the function `findDelayedArrivalTime` that computes the new arrival time considering the delay and handles the 24-hour wrap-around using the modulo operator. The `main` function demonstrates how to use this function with an example input and prints the result.
