[Leetcode 1048. Longest String Chain](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1048)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of words, each word consists of English lowercase letters. Let's say `word1` is a predecessor of `word2` if and only if we can add exactly one letter anywhere in `word1` to make it equal to `word2`. For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac". 

A word chain is a sequence of words [word_1, word_2, ..., word_k] with `k >= 1`, where `word1` is a predecessor of `word2`, `word2` is a predecessor of `word3`, and so on. 

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

### Example:
```
Input: ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest word chain is "a","ba","bda","bdca".
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can words in the list be repeated?**
   - No, each word in the list is unique.

2. **What is the length constraint for each word in the list?**
   - Each word's length will be at least 1 and at most 16.

3. **What is the maximum number of words in the list?**
   - The maximum number of words the list can have is 1000.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will:
1. **Sort** the list of words based on their lengths. This is because a shorter word might be a predecessor of a longer word.
2. **Use Dynamic Programming (DP)** to keep track of the longest chain ending with each word.
   - We will maintain a dictionary `dp` where `dp[word]` represents the length of the longest chain ending with `word`.
3. For each word, we will try to remove each character (creating a predecessor candidate) and see if that predecessor is in our `dp` dictionary. If it is, we update our current word's chain length.
4. As we populate the `dp` dictionary, we will keep track of the maximum chain length encountered.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        // Sort words by their lengths
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](const string &a, const string &b) {
            return a.size() < b.size();
        });
        
        // DP dictionary to store the longest chain length ending with each word
        unordered_map<string, int> dp;
        
        int longestChain = 0;
        
        // Process each word
        for (string word : words) {
            int currentLength = 1;
            
            // Create predecessor by removing each character
            for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); ++i) {
                string predecessor = word.substr(0, i) + word.substr(i + 1);
                
                if (dp.find(predecessor) != dp.end()) {
                    currentLength = max(currentLength, dp[predecessor] + 1);
                }
            }
            
            // Update the DP dictionary
            dp[word] = currentLength;
            
            // Update the maximum length of any chain found so far
            longestChain = max(longestChain, currentLength);
        }
        
        return longestChain;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting of words**: `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of words.
- **DP table population**: For each word, we generate up to `O(L)` predecessor candidates (where `L` is the maximum length of the word). Searching and updating the dictionary take constant time on average using a hash map. Thus, populating the DP dictionary takes `O(N * L)`.

Overall, the time complexity is:
\[ O(N \log N + N * L) \]
In our case, where \( L \) is at most 16, this is efficient.
