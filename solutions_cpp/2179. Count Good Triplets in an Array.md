[Leetcode 2179. Count Good Triplets in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2179)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `a` and `b`. A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is considered good if the following conditions are met:
- `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`
- `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
- `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
- `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

Return the number of good triplets.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for `arr`? 
   - There are no specified limits in the problem statement, but we should assume they are reasonable integers for typical competitive programming constraints (e.g., \([-10^6, 10^6]\)).
   
2. What is the length of the array `arr`?
   - No specific constraints given, but likely within typical limits like up to 1000 or 10,000 elements.

3. Are there any constraints on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`?
   - No specific constraints in the problem are indicated, but we assume they fit within typical integer values.

### Strategy

To find the number of good triplets, we can use a nested loop approach because we need to check all possible triplets in the array:

1. Use three nested loops to iterate through each possible triplet (i, j, k) where `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`.
2. Check the conditions for the triplet being "good":
   - `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
   - `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
   - `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`
3. If the triplet satisfies all conditions, increment the count.
4. Return the count after evaluating all triplets.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath> // For abs

class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodTriplets(std::vector<int>& arr, int a, int b, int c) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                if (abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a) {
                    for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                        if (abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b && abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c) {
                            ++count;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The provided solution uses a triple nested loop approach:

- The first loop runs `n-2` times.
- The second loop runs up to `n-1`, but depends on the outer loop (so average iterations reduce).
- The third loop runs up to `n` and depends on both the outer loops.

The overall time complexity can be described as `O(n^3)` where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.

This might not be efficient for very large arrays, but without specific constraints, this approach is clear and straightforward in checking all triplets and ensuring correctness. For very large inputs, you might want to explore optimized techniques or data structures.
