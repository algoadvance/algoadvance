[Leetcode 1345. Jump Game IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1345)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. In one step, you can jump from index `i` to index:

- `i + 1` (if `i + 1` is within bounds)
- `i - 1` (if `i - 1` is within bounds)
- `j` (such that `arr[i] == arr[j]` and `i != j`)

Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: Any constraints on the size of the array or the values of the elements?
   - Assume `1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4` and `-10^8 <= arr[i] <= 10^8`.
   
2. **Output**: Is there always a solution or do we need to handle cases where it's impossible to reach the end?
   - Per the problem, it will always be possible to reach the last index.

3. **Duplicate Elements**: There can be multiple positions with the same value in the array, and we can jump between any of those positions.
   - Yes, you can jump to any index `j` where `arr[i] == arr[j]`.

## Strategy

This problem can be efficiently solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a queue to keep track of indexes to explore, starting with index 0.
   - Maintain a `visited` array or set to avoid re-processing the same index.
   - Use a dictionary to map the indices for each value in `arr` for quick access.

2. **BFS Execution**:
   - For each index, consider all valid moves: `i + 1`, `i - 1`, and all `j` such that `arr[i] == arr[j]`.
   - Check if the target index is within bounds and not visited before.
   - Continue exploring until reaching the last index of the array.

3. **Early Termination**:
   - If we reach the last index during our BFS, return the step count immediately.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minJumps(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        
        // Edge case: if array length is 1, no jump is needed.
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        // Map each value to all its positions in the array
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> valueIndices; 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            valueIndices[arr[i]].push_back(i);
        }
        
        // BFS setup
        queue<int> q; // To perform BFS, storing indices
        vector<bool> visited(n, false); // To mark visited indices
        q.push(0);
        visited[0] = true;
        int steps = 0;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size(); // Number of elements at the current level
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                int currentIndex = q.front(); q.pop();
                
                // Check if we've reached the last index
                if (currentIndex == n - 1) {
                    return steps;
                }
                
                // Try jumping to currentIndex + 1
                if (currentIndex + 1 < n && !visited[currentIndex + 1]) {
                    visited[currentIndex + 1] = true;
                    q.push(currentIndex + 1);
                }
                
                // Try jumping to currentIndex - 1
                if (currentIndex - 1 >= 0 && !visited[currentIndex - 1]) {
                    visited[currentIndex - 1] = true;
                    q.push(currentIndex - 1);
                }
                
                // Try jumping to all other indices with the same value
                for (int nextIndex : valueIndices[arr[currentIndex]]) {
                    if (nextIndex != currentIndex && !visited[nextIndex]) {
                        visited[nextIndex] = true;
                        q.push(nextIndex);
                    }
                }
                
                // Clear the entries to prevent redundant processing
                valueIndices[arr[currentIndex]].clear();
            }
            ++steps;
        }
        
        // If we could not reach the end (shouldn't happen per problem constraints)
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the array. Each index is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`, for the queue, visited array, and the value-index mapping.

This approach ensures an optimal solution by leveraging BFS for shortest path in an unweighted graph representation of the problem.
