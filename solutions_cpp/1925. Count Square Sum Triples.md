[Leetcode 1925. Count Square Sum Triples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1925)
## Problem Statement
1925. **Count Square Sum Triples**

Given an integer `n`, return the number of **square sum triples** such that `1 <= a, b, c <= n` and `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

A **square sum triple** `(a,b,c)` is a set of three positive integers that satisfy the above condition.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`? (Typically, knowing the constraints can help in optimizing the solution if required.)
   - Are `a`, `b`, and `c` distinct?

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a single integer representing the number of square sum triples.

Let's assume `n` can be moderately large based on typical problem constraints (e.g., `1 ≤ n ≤ 250` according to Leetcode standard constraints). Moreover, `a`, `b`, and `c` are distinct positive integers constrained by the range `[1, n]`.

## Strategy
1. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**
   - We need to consider all possible triples `(a, b, c)` where `1 <= a, b, c <= n`.
   - Check if `a^2 + b^2 == c^2`.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - Use nested loops to generate all possible values of `a` and `b`.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, compute `c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`.
   - Check if `c` is an integer and within the range `[1, n]`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach would be `O(n^2 * sqrt(n))` because for each pair `(a, b)`, computing `sqrt` and checking the conditions will take constant time.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>   // for sqrt
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSquareSumTriples(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; ++a) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= n; ++b) {
                int cSquared = a * a + b * b;
                int c = sqrt(cSquared);
                if (c <= n && c * c == cSquared) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 10; // Example input
    int result = solution.countSquareSumTriples(n);
    cout << "Number of square sum triples: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity Analysis
- **Outer loop (a)**: Runs `n` times.
- **Inner loop (b)**: Runs `n` times for each value of `a`, hence `n * n` in total.
- **Square root computation**: Runs in constant time, `O(1)`.
- **Validation of `c`**: Constant time, `O(1)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * sqrt(n))` due to the computational cost and validation within the nested loops.

This solution explores all combinations and checks the conditions efficiently within polynomial time complexity constraints.
