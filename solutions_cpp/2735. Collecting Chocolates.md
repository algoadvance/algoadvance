[Leetcode 2735. Collecting Chocolates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2735)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers `chocolates` where each integer represents the quantity of chocolates at each position in a line. You are also given an integer `limit` which represents the maximum number of chocolates that can be collected in one trip. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trips needed to collect all the chocolates from the line if you can collect chocolates from any position. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the value of chocolates at any position be zero?
2. Are there any constraints on the values of chocolates or the length of the list?
3. Is it required to collect chocolates in a contiguous manner or can we skip positions?

For the sake of the solution, letâ€™s assume:
1. Yes, chocolates at any position can be zero.
2. No specific constraints given on the values or the length.
3. We can collect chocolates in a non-contiguous manner.

## Strategy

1. First, sort the list of chocolates in descending order so that the largest quantities are considered first.
2. Initialize a counter for trips.
3. Traverse the list and keep a summation of chocolates until it exceeds the `limit`.
4. Once the sum exceeds `limit`, increase the trip counter and reset the summation.
5. Continue until all chocolates are collected.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minTripsToCollectChocolates(std::vector<int>& chocolates, int limit) {
    std::sort(chocolates.rbegin(), chocolates.rend());
    int trips = 0;
    int currentSum = 0;
    
    for (int choco : chocolates) {
        if (currentSum + choco > limit) {
            trips++;
            currentSum = 0;
        }
        currentSum += choco;
    }
    
    // If there's any remaining chocolates to be collected after the loop
    if (currentSum > 0) {
        trips++;
    }
    
    return trips;
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     std::vector<int> chocolates = {2, 3, 7, 5, 1};
//     int limit = 8;
//     std::cout << minTripsToCollectChocolates(chocolates, limit); // Output: 3
// }
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the chocolates array:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the chocolates list.
- **Traversing through the chocolates array to count trips:** `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)**.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(1)** excluding the input space, as the sorting is done in-place and only a few extra variables are used for computation.
