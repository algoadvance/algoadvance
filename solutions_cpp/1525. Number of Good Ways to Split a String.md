[Leetcode 1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1525)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. A split is called good if you can split `s` into two non-empty substrings `s1` and `s2` such that the number of distinct letters in `s1` and `s2` are the same.

Return the number of good splits you can make in `s`.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "aacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 good ways to split 
"aacaba" at indices 2 and 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume the string consists only of lowercase English letters?
   - Yes.
2. Is there an upper bound on the length of the string?
   - The usual constraints from LeetCode apply. Assume the length of `s` is between `1` and `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Count Array**: Create two arrays to keep track of the number of distinct characters up to each position from the left and from the right.
   - `leftDist[n]`: Number of distinct characters from `s[0]` to `s[i]`.
   - `rightDist[n]`: Number of distinct characters from `s[i+1]` to `s[n-1]`.
   
2. **Fill Arrays:**
   - Traverse the string from left to right to fill the `leftDist` array.
   - Traverse the string from right to left to fill the `rightDist` array.

3. **Count Good Splits:**
   - Compare `leftDist[i]` and `rightDist[i+1]` for all valid `i` to count good splits.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

int numSplits(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<int> leftDist(n), rightDist(n);
    std::unordered_set<char> leftSet, rightSet;
    
    // Build the leftDist array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        leftSet.insert(s[i]);
        leftDist[i] = leftSet.size();
    }
    
    // Build the rightDist array
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        rightSet.insert(s[i]);
        rightDist[i] = rightSet.size();
    }
    
    // Count good splits
    int goodSplits = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (leftDist[i] == rightDist[i + 1]) {
            ++goodSplits;
        }
    }
    
    return goodSplits;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "aacaba";
    std::cout << "Number of good splits: " << numSplits(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Computing `leftDist` and `rightDist` Arrays:** O(n) each because we traverse the string with a single loop and use constant-time operations for set insertion and size check.
- **Counting Good Splits:** O(n) since we check the condition in a single pass through the string.

Overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for large inputs up to `10^5` characters.

### Space Complexity

- **Space for Arrays:** O(n) for `leftDist` and `rightDist`.
- **Space for Sets:** At most, the space for 26 characters in each set, which is O(1).

Overall space complexity is O(n).

This approach ensures efficiency both in terms of time and space.
