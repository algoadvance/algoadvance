[Leetcode 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2966)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to divide the array into some number of non-empty contiguous subarrays such that the maximum absolute difference between the sum of any two subarrays is **exactly `d`**. Find the minimum number of subarrays into which you can divide the array to achieve this.

### Example

```cpp
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 4, 1, 2], d = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: We can divide the array into [3, 6], [1, 4], [1], [2]. The sums of these subarrays are [9, 5, 1, 2]. The maximum absolute difference between any two subarrays is exactly 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the input array**:
    - What are the ranges of the integers in the array `nums`? 
    - What is the maximum length of the array?
    - Are all integers in `nums` guaranteed to be positive?

2. **Behavior with impossible divisions**:
    - What should the solution output if it is impossible to divide `nums` as required?

### Code

Here is a potential solution using a greedy approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int divideArray(vector<int>& nums, int d) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    
    vector<int> prefixSums(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + nums[i];
    }
    
    int result = 1;  // Minimum we need at least one subarray
    int lastSubarraySum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int currentSum = prefixSums[i] - lastSubarraySum;
        // If difference exceeds 'd', we need to make a new subarray
        if (i < n && abs(prefixSums[n] - prefixSums[i]) < d) {
            ++result;
            lastSubarraySum = prefixSums[i];
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 6, 1, 4, 1, 2};
    int d = 6;
    cout << divideArray(nums, d) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sums**: Compute prefix sums to quickly calculate subarray sums.
2. **Greedy Segmentation**: Iterate through the array and form subarrays. If adding the next element exceeds the allowed difference, start a new subarray.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
    - Continuously check the difference between the current segment and previous ones to ensure it meets the difference `d`.

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Greedy Iteration**: \(O(n)\) to detect where to create a new subarray.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Notes

- Ensure handling of edge cases such as when the array cannot be divided to meet the exact difference `d`.
- Test on various inputs, including edge cases such as arrays with all equal elements or very large arrays to validate the performance.
