[Leetcode 363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l363)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix `matrix` and an integer `k`, return the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values `m` and `n` can take?
   - Are the values in the matrix positive, negative, or both?

2. **Complexity Constraints:**
   - Is there an expected time complexity for the solution?
   - Are there any restrictions on space complexity?

In response to these clarifying questions, let's assume:
- `m` and `n` are both between 1 and 100.
- Elements in the matrix can be both positive and negative integers.

### Strategy

This problem is a combination of submatrix sum and maximum subarray sum constraints. The strategy involves:

1. **Prefix Sum and Cumulative Sum Arrays:** Use prefix sums to compute the sum of any rectangle submatrix efficiently.
2. **Reducing to 1D Sum Problem:** Sum elements between two rows to reduce the problem to a one-dimensional array problem.
3. **Maximum Subarray Sum No More Than K:** Utilize a sorted set and binary search to find the maximum subarray sum that does not exceed `k`.

### Algorithm
1. Iterate over all pairs of rows.
2. For each pair of rows, calculate the sum of elements between these rows for every column and store them in an array.
3. Use a sorted set to keep track of all cumulative sums encountered so far and use binary search to find the maximum possible subarray sum for the current rectangle configuration.

Here's how that might be implemented:

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumSubmatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = (m == 0) ? 0 : matrix[0].size();
        int maxSum = INT_MIN;

        for (int left = 0; left < n; ++left) {
            vector<int> rowSum(m, 0);
            for (int right = left; right < n; ++right) {
                for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                    rowSum[i] += matrix[i][right];
                }

                set<int> cumSet;
                cumSet.insert(0);
                int cumSum = 0;
                
                for (int sum : rowSum) {
                    cumSum += sum;
                    auto it = cumSet.lower_bound(cumSum - k);
                    if (it != cumSet.end()) {
                        maxSum = max(maxSum, cumSum - *it);
                    }
                    cumSet.insert(cumSum);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The outer loop iterates over all pairs of columns: \(O(n^2)\).
- For each pair of columns, we calculate prefix sums and determine the maximum subarray sum: \(O(m \log m)\).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n^2 \cdot m \log m)\). Given the constraints \(m, n \leq 100\), this complexity should be feasible.

**Space Complexity:** \(O(m)\) for the `rowSum` array and the cumulative sum set, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
