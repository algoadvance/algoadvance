[Leetcode 2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2616)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer p. You need to find and minimize the maximum difference between pairs in the array after performing the following operation exactly p times.

In one operation, you can select an integer from nums and remove it. You cannot select the same integer more than once. The goal is to minimize the maximum difference between any two integers in the resulting array.

Output the minimized maximum difference.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values in the `nums` array and the value of `p`?
2. Can `p` be zero?
3. How should we handle the case where `p` is larger than the array size?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach along with a greedy strategy:

1. **Binary Search Setup**: We will perform binary search on the range of possible maximum differences of pairs.
2. **Feasibility Check**: For each mid value in the binary search, we will check if it's possible to reduce the array such that the maximum difference of pairs is at most `mid` after exactly `p` removal operations.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: To perform the feasibility check, we will use a two-pointer technique to evaluate the possible pairs in the array.
4. **Result**: The answer to our problem will be the minimum possible value of the maximum difference found during our binary search.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

bool canMinimizeWithMaxDifference(const std::vector<int>& nums, int p, int maxDifference) {
    int count = 0;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] <= maxDifference) {
            ++count;
            ++i; // We skip the next element because we are pairing i and i-1
        }
        if (count >= p) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

int minimizeMaxDifference(std::vector<int>& nums, int p) {
    if (p == 0) return 0;

    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int left = 0;
    int right = nums.back() - nums.front();
    int result = right;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (int)((right - left) / 2);
        if (canMinimizeWithMaxDifference(nums, p, mid)) {
            result = mid;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array to facilitate the two-pointer technique.
2. **Binary Search**: Perform binary search over the possible range of maximum differences.
3. **Feasibility Check**: Use a helper function `canMinimizeWithMaxDifference` to check for each mid value if it's possible to achieve the maximum difference after removing `p` elements.
4. **Result Update**: Adjust the search range based on whether we can minimize the maximum difference with mid or not.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Binary Search**: We do binary search in a range that can at most be \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where each step involves checking each possible pair with the two-pointer technique, resulting in \(O(n)\) per step.
- **Overall**: \(O(n \log n) + O(n \log D)\) where \(D\) is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. Simplified to \(O(n \log n)\) since sorting dominates.
