[Leetcode 1402. Reducing Dishes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1402)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `satisfaction` where `satisfaction[i]` is the satisfaction level of the ith dish. You can prepare the dishes in any order and serve them one by one. You want to maximize the sum of the Like-time coefficient, which is defined as the sum of `time[i] * satisfaction[i]` for all dishes, where `time[i]` is the time in the order in which you served the dish (1-indexed).

You can decide to discard some dishes to get a higher maximum Like-time coefficient.

Return the maximum sum of Like-time coefficient that you can achieve.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-7]
Output: 14
Explanation: After discarding the dishes with satisfaction level -1, -8, and -7,
the remaining dishes, with satisfaction level 0 and 5, are served in the order of
their satisfaction level, which gives the maximum Like-time coefficient: 
0 * 1 + 5 * 2 = 0 + 10 = 10.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `satisfaction` array be empty? 
   - For the purpose of this problem, we assume it is non-empty based on the constraints.
2. How large can the satisfaction levels be?
   - The satisfaction levels can be within the range of `[-10^3, 10^3]`.
3. Will the number of elements in the `satisfaction` array be large?
   - The number of elements will be within the range `[1, 500]`.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** When considering which dishes to prepare, sorting the dishes can help us evaluate the most beneficial ways to include/reserve dishes.
2. **Greedy Approach:** Iterate from the back of the sorted array, adding satisfaction levels and recalculating the Like-time coefficient. If adding a dish decreases the total, we stop.
3. **Calculate Like-time Coefficient:**
   - Traverse from the end towards the start of the sorted array.
   - Maintain cumulative satisfaction, accumulated result and update these as long as the total is increasing.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfaction(std::vector<int>& satisfaction) {
        std::sort(satisfaction.begin(), satisfaction.end());

        int currentSum = 0;
        int totalSum = 0;
        int maxSum = 0;

        for (int i = satisfaction.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            currentSum += satisfaction[i];
            totalSum += currentSum;
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, totalSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```
### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the `satisfaction` array.
- **Iteration:** `O(n)` for iterating through the sorted array to calculate the maximum Like-time coefficient.
- **Total:** The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step being the dominant factor.

This approach efficiently determines the dishes to maximize the Like-time coefficient by utilizing sorting and a greedy strategy from the highest to lowest satisfaction values.
