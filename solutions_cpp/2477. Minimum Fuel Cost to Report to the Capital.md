[Leetcode 2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2477)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `roads` that contains `n - 1` tuples: each tuple `(a, b)` represents a bidirectional road that connects nodes `a` and `b`. 

Youâ€™re also given an integer `seats` that indicates the maximum number of people that can be in a car at once. The goal is to calculate the minimum fuel cost to have all the nodes report to the capital (node `0`), assuming that each node other than the capital needs to send exactly one representative to node `0`. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the fuel cost directly proportional to the distance traveled or the number of roads taken?**
   - Assume the fuel cost is simply the number of roads traveled given that all edges have an equal weight.
2. **Is it possible to have more people moving together if their total number does not exceed the `seats` capacity in a car?**
   - Yes, multiple representatives can share the same car if the total number does not exceed the `seats` capacity.
3. **Is the tree strictly connected, and will it always have no cycles?**
   - Yes, the nature of the problem guarantees no cycles and the tree is connected.

### Strategy
The core idea is to traverse the tree, calculate the number of representatives required for each subtree, and aggregate the fuel cost. A Depth-First Search (DFS) approach suits this problem well:

1. **DFS Traversal:** Start from node `0`, the capital, and perform a DFS traversal.
2. **Track Representatives:** For each visited node, count the representatives that need to be sent to the capital.
3. **Car capacity utilization:** Use the `seats` parameter to determine how many trips are necessary for each subtree aggregation.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumFuelCost(vector<vector<int>>& roads, int seats) {
        int n = roads.size() + 1;  // Total number of nodes
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        
        // Build the graph
        for (const auto& road : roads) {
            graph[road[0]].push_back(road[1]);
            graph[road[1]].push_back(road[0]);
        }
        
        // Function to count representatives and compute fuel cost
        function<long long(int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int parent) {
            long long representatives = 1;
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (neighbor != parent) {
                    representatives += dfs(neighbor, node);
                }
            }
            // Every `seats` number of representatives requires one trip to the capital
            if (node != 0) {  // We don't count the root itself
                cost += (representatives + seats - 1) / seats;
            }
            return representatives;
        };
        
        // Initialize cost and start DFS from the capital (node 0)
        long long cost = 0;
        dfs(0, -1);
        return cost;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Construction:** An adjacency list is constructed to represent the tree.
2. **DFS Function:**
   - **Base Case:** Each node initially counts itself as a representative.
   - **Recurrence:** Recurse through all unvisited neighbors to accumulate representatives.
   - **Cost Calculation:** For each node (except the capital), calculate trips needed to transport its subtree representatives to the capital.
3. **Avoid Cycles:** The `parent` parameter ensures that the function does not revisit the node from which it came.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes. Each node and edge is visited exactly once in the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the storage required for the adjacency list and the call stack in the worst-case scenario.

This effectively calculates the minimum fuel cost needed for all nodes to report to the capital, utilizing the seats constraint efficiently.
