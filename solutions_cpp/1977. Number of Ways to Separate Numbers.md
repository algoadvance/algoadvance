[Leetcode 1977. Number of Ways to Separate Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1977)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` containing digits from `1` to `9` inclusive. You want to separate the string into a sequence of one or more numbers such that:

1. Each number is greater than or equal to any previous number in the sequence.
2. The number of ways to do so can be large, so return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Write a function that computes the number of ways to achieve the required separation.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "327"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 ways to separate the string into a sequence that satisfies the conditions.
- "3", "2", "7"
- "3", "27"
- "32", "7"
- "327"
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any invalid characters in the string?
   - No, the string only contains digits '1'-'9'.
   
2. Should we handle potential leading zeros or inputs starting with '0'?
   - No, the string starts from '1' to '9'.

3. What's the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Typically, the constraints will be such that dynamic programming can be viable (length up to 3500).

## Strategy

We need to find the number of ways to split the string `s` such that each segment forms a number that is not smaller than any previous segment. 

We can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to split substring `s[0:i]`.
2. Iterate through each position in the string. For each possible split point, check if the current segment is greater than or equal to the previous one.
3. Use a table `dp` to store intermediate results to avoid recomputation.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` means the number of ways to segment `s[0:i]`.
2. Use a loop to iterate through possible split points, comparing segments to ensure non-decreasing order.
3. Adjust for modulo \(10^9 + 7\) computations to handle large numbers.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    static const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

    int numberOfCombinations(std::string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> prefixSum(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] != '0') dp[i][i] = 1;
            prefixSum[i][i] = dp[i][i];
            if (i > 0) prefixSum[i][i] += prefixSum[i-1][i-1];
            
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (s[i] != '0') {
                    for (int k = i; k < j; ++k) {
                        if (std::stoi(s.substr(i, k - i + 1)) <= std::stoi(s.substr(i, j - i + 1))) {
                            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + prefixSum[k][i + k - i]) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }
                prefixSum[j][i] = (prefixSum[j-1][i] + dp[i][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result = (result + dp[0][i]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::string s = "327";
    std::cout << solution.numberOfCombinations(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Constructing the `dp` and prefix sum arrays requires \(O(n^3)\) because for each pair of indices \(i, j\), we are performing an additional nested loop. However, with better optimization, this can be reduced.
- The above implementation can be further optimized but illustrates the basic approach well.

In general, expect \(O(n^2)\) time complexity for optimized solutions.
