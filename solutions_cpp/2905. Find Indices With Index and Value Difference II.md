[Leetcode 2905. Find Indices With Index and Value Difference II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2905)
## Problem Statement

This problem is listed as LeetCode problem 2905, "Find Indices With Index and Value Difference II".

Given an array of integers `nums` and two integers `indexDiff` and `valueDiff`, find all pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that:

1. `i != j`
2. `|i - j| <= indexDiff`
3. `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= valueDiff`

You need to return the pairs of indices that satisfy the above conditions as an array of pairs `[i, j]`.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if there are no such pairs?**
   - Return an empty array.
   
2. **Can the given `nums` array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums`, and the values of `indexDiff`, `valueDiff`, and the elements in `nums`?**
   - The size of `nums` can be up to `10^5`.
   - The values in `nums` as well as `indexDiff`, and `valueDiff` are within the range of [-10^7, 10^7].

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate through all pairs `(i, j)` and check if they meet the conditions. 
   - This approach has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` which is not efficient for large inputs.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Utilize a sliding window with a `sorted list` (or use a data structure like `std::map` in C++) to keep track of indices that are within `indexDiff` distance.
   - As we iterate through the `nums` array, for each `i`, we check the `sorted list` to find indices `j` such that `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= valueDiff`.
   - We maintain the indices we have seen within the last `indexDiff` distances in a balanced tree map (C++ `std::map`).
   - This offers a time complexity closer to `O(n log n)` due to maintaining and querying the balanced tree map.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <utility>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

vector<pair<int, int>> findPairs(vector<int> &nums, int indexDiff, int valueDiff) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> result;
    map<int, int> window; // key: nums[j], value: index j

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // Remove elements that are out of the indexDiff range
        if (i > indexDiff) {
            window.erase(nums[i - indexDiff - 1]);
        }

        // Check current `nums[i]` against all elements in the `window`
        auto it = window.lower_bound(nums[i] - valueDiff);
        while (it != window.end() && it->first <= nums[i] + valueDiff) {
            // Here, it->first is nums[j], and it->second is index j
            if (abs(it->second - i) <= indexDiff) {
                result.push_back({it->second, i});
            }
            ++it;
        }

        // Add current element into the window
        window[nums[i]] = i;
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insertions and deletions into the map** take `O(log n)` time.
- **Lookup operations** for the value ranges also take `O(log n)` time.
- **Total Complexity**: Each of the `n` elements is processed with `O(log n)` complexity, hence the total time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
