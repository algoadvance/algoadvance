[Leetcode 2155. All Divisions With the Highest Score of a Binary Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2155)
## Problem Statement
Let's denote \( arr \) the array of integers of length \( n \). The *division* of the array \( arr \) into two non-empty parts is defined to be the process splitting arr into two parts:

- \( leftPart = arr[0] \) to \( arr[i-1] \) and
- \( rightPart = arr[i] \) to \( arr[n-1] \)

where \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). The score of a division is computed as the sum of elements in the leftPart plus the sum of elements in the rightPart.

Given an array of integers arr, your task is to determine all indices \( i \) (1-based indexing) where the division of \( arr \) yields a division score equal to the maximum score. Return those indices as a list. If multiple indices have the same maximum score, return them in ascending order.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: 
Scores: 
For i = 1: sum([1]) + sum([2,3]) = 1 + 5 = 6
For i = 2: sum([1,2]) + sum([3]) = 3 + 3 = 6 
Both indices give the maximum score.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [1, 3, 1]
Output: [2, 3]
Explanation: 
Scores: 
For i = 1: sum([1]) + sum([3,1]) = 1 + 4 = 5
For i = 2: sum([1,3]) + sum([1]) = 4 + 1 = 5 
For i = 3: sum([1,3,1]) = 5
Indices 2 and 3 give the maximum score.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Bound on the size of array `arr`?**
   (Assume \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \))
2. **Bound on the elements of `arr`?**
   (Assume \( -10^4 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^4 \))

## Strategy
1. **Calculate Total Sum**: First, calculate the total sum of the original array (`totalSum`).
2. **Calculate Prefix Sums**: Track prefix sums incrementally while iterating through the array.
3. **Compute Scores**:
    - For each possible split from 1 to n-1, evaluate `leftSum` and `rightSum` and compute the score.
4. **Track Maximum Score**: Track the maximum score encountered and the corresponding indices that achieve it.
5. **Return Results**: Return the indices (1-based) that achieve the maximum score.

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Calculating the `totalSum` and evaluating each division only requires traversing the array a few times, making it linear in complexity.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for accumulate

std::vector<int> maxScoreIndices(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    // Compute total sum of the array
    int totalSum = std::accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);
    
    int leftSum = 0;
    int maxScore = INT_MIN;
    std::vector<int> result;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        // leftSum includes arr[0] to arr[i-1]
        leftSum += arr[i-1];
        // rightSum includes arr[i] to arr[n-1] which is totalSum minus leftSum
        int rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;
        
        int score = leftSum + rightSum; 
    
        if (score > maxScore) {
            maxScore = score;
            result.clear();
            result.push_back(i);
        } else if (score == maxScore) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```
The code above should work as expected to find all indices that yield the highest division score.
