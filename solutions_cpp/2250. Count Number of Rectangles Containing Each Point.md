[Leetcode 2250. Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2250)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `rectangles` and `points`, where `rectangles[i] = [li, wi]` indicates that the ith rectangle is a rectangle whose length is `li` and width is `wi`. You are also given an array `points` where `points[j] = [xj, yj]` indicates a point with coordinates `(xj, yj)`.

Return an array `result`, where `result[j]` is the number of rectangles that contain the jth point. The point `(xj, yj)` is said to be contained in a rectangle with length `li` and width `wi` if `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <= yj <= wi`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the length and width of the rectangles and the coordinates of the points be negative?
   - No, as given in the constraints, all lengths and widths are non-negative.
   
2. What is the maximum size for `rectangles` and `points` arrays?
   - The lengths of the arrays `rectangles` and `points` can go up to 100,000.

3. Can multiple rectangles have identical dimensions?
   - Yes, multiple rectangles can have the same dimensions.

4. Are `rectangles` and `points` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, both arrays will contain at least one rectangle and one point.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Rectangles by Width**: We will sort the rectangles array based on their widths. This way, for a point `(xj, yj)`, we can find all rectangles whose widths are greater than or equal to `yj` efficiently.

2. **Utilize Binary Search**: For each point, use binary search to find the first rectangle in the sorted list that has a width that can contain the point (`width >= yj`).

3. **Filter Rectangles by Length**: Once we have identified the subset of rectangles that can contain the point in terms of width, we filter this subset further by checking whether the rectangle's length can accommodate the point (`length >= xj`).

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int binarySearchWidth(const vector<pair<int, int>>& rects, int width) {
    int left = 0, right = rects.size() - 1;
    while(left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if(rects[mid].second >= width) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
}

vector<int> countRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles, vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> rects;
    for(const auto& rect : rectangles) {
        rects.emplace_back(rect[0], rect[1]);
    }
    
    // Sort rectangles by width, then by length
    sort(rects.begin(), rects.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.second < b.second;
    });
    
    vector<int> result;
    for(const auto& point : points) {
        int x = point[0];
        int y = point[1];
        
        // Find the first rectangle that has sufficient width
        int idx = binarySearchWidth(rects, y);
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count rectangles where length is sufficient
        for(int i = idx; i < rects.size(); ++i) {
            if(rects[i].first >= x) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Rectangles**: The `sort` operation takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of rectangles.
2. **Binary Search for Each Point**: For each point, binary search takes \(O(\log n)\).
3. **Counting After Filter**: After finding the starting index, counting involves potentially all remaining rectangles, which might take \(O(n)\) in the worst case.

Overall, if we denote \(n\) as the number of rectangles and \(m\) as the number of points, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \cdot (n + \log n))\). In practice, it will likely be more efficient due to the filtering through binary search which drastically reduces the number of comparisons in most cases.
