[Leetcode 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2487)
### Problem Statement
The problem requires us to remove nodes from a singly linked list. Specifically, each node in the linked list has an integer value and the task is to remove some nodes such that the final list contains only nodes for which no bigger nodes exist to their right. 

Given the head of a linked list, return the head of the modified list.
  
### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size and Constraints:** What are the typical lengths of the linked list, and what range of integer values can the nodes contain?
2. **Duplicates:** How should we handle duplicate values? 
3. **Edge Cases:** How should we handle cases where the linked list is empty or consists of only one node?

### Strategy
1. **Traversal Approach:** We can traverse the linked list from the end to the start. This way, we maintain a reference to the largest node seen so far (from the right) and remove nodes during the traversal if their values are smaller than this largest value.
2. **Reverse Traversal with Auxiliary Stack:** One way to perform the reverse traversal is by using an auxiliary stack to hold node values as we traverse from the start. Then, we process nodes from the stack which simulates the reverse traversal.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. Traverse the list and push all the values to a stack.
2. Pop elements from the stack and determine the largest element encountered so far.
3. Rebuild the list by skipping nodes whose values do not meet the criteria.

### Code
Here is a C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

ListNode* removeNodes(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head) return nullptr;

    // Stack to store nodes
    std::stack<ListNode*> nodeStack;
    ListNode* ptr = head;

    // Push all nodes into the stack
    while (ptr) {
        nodeStack.push(ptr);
        ptr = ptr->next;
    }

    ListNode* newHead = nullptr;
    ListNode* prev = nullptr;

    // Maintaining the reference to largest value seen so far as we pop nodes
    int maxVal = INT_MIN;

    while (!nodeStack.empty()) {
        ListNode* curr = nodeStack.top();
        nodeStack.pop();

        // Only keep nodes that are greater or equal to maxVal
        if (curr->val >= maxVal) {
            maxVal = curr->val;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;

            // Update new head to the current node
            if (!newHead) {
                newHead = curr;
            }
        }
    }

    return newHead;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    ListNode* l1 = new ListNode(5);
    l1->next = new ListNode(3);
    l1->next->next = new ListNode(4);
    l1->next->next->next = new ListNode(2);
    l1->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(1);
    
    ListNode* result = removeNodes(l1);
    
    // Print the resulting list
    while (result) {
        std::cout << result->val << " ";
        result = result->next;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Traversal:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the linked list (to initially push all elements into the stack).
2. **Stack Operations:** O(N) to pop elements from the stack and construct the final list.

Overall, the algorithm operates in O(N) time complexity. The space complexity is O(N) for the auxiliary stack.

By following this approach, we ensure that we only keep nodes that satisfy the specified criteria efficiently.
