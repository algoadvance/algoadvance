[Leetcode 1451. Rearrange Words in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1451)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1451: **Rearrange Words in a Sentence**

Given a sentence formed by words separated by spaces. The sentence will use lowercase English letters only. Rearrange the words in a sentence where the words are sorted lexicographically by their lengths. If two words have the same length, they should remain in the order they were originally in the sentence.

Return the new sentence in lowercase.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Will the input be non-empty and only contain lowercase English letters and spaces?
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
   
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the resulting sentence be in lowercase even if the input sentence contains uppercase characters?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How to handle multiple spaces between words?
   - Single word input?

Assuming the constraints are typical for common coding problems; let's proceed.

### Strategy

1. **Parse Input:** Split the input sentence by spaces to get a list of words.
2. **Sort Words:** Sort the list of words based on their length and preserve order for words of the same length.
3. **Reconstruct Output:** Join the sorted list of words back into a single string.
4. **Return Result:** Ensure the output is in lowercase, as per problem requirements.

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the Sentence:** O(n) where n is the number of characters in the sentence.
- **Sorting the Words:** O(m log m) where m is the number of words.
- **Joining Words:** O(n) where n is the number of characters in the final sorted list.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(m log m).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

string arrangeWords(string sentence) {
    // Convert the first character to lowercase
    sentence[0] = tolower(sentence[0]);
    
    // Split the sentence into words
    stringstream ss(sentence);
    string word;
    vector<pair<string, int>> words;
    int index = 0;

    while (ss >> word) {
        words.push_back({word, index});
        index++;
    }

    // Custom sort words: based on length, and if equal, by their original order
    sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](const pair<string, int>& a, const pair<string, int>& b) {
        if (a.first.length() == b.first.length())
            return a.second < b.second;
        return a.first.length() < b.first.length();
    });

    // Reconstruct the sentence
    string result;
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        if (i > 0)
            result += " ";
        result += words[i].first;
    }
    
    // Capitalize the first character of the result
    result[0] = toupper(result[0]);
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string sentence = "Keep the blue flag flying high";
    cout << arrangeWords(sentence) << endl;  // Output: "The blue keep flag flying high"
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Lowercase Conversion:** Convert the first character of the input sentence to lowercase to handle any uppercase in the start.
2. **Splitting Words:** Use `stringstream` to split the sentence into words.
3. **Pairing Words with Indexes:** Maintain original index with word pairs to preserve order for words of the same length.
4. **Custom Sorting:** Sort words based on their length and index for stable ordering.
5. **Reconstruct Sentence:** Join the sorted words and handle the final capitalization of the first letter.

This solution ensures words are lexicographically sorted by length while preserving relative order for same length, meeting the requirements of the problem.
