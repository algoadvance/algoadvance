[Leetcode 2488. Count Subarrays With Median K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2488)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `k`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array. We call a subarray "good" if there is an element whose value is equal to `k` and the median of the subarray is also equal to `k`.

The median of a subarray is defined as:
- If the subarray has an odd length, the median is the middle element after sorting the elements.
- If the subarray has an even length, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements after sorting the elements.

You need to determine the number of good subarrays in the given array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - Typically, such problems would involve constraints like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^5`.
   
2. **Will `k` always be an element in `nums`?**
   - It is usually assumed `k` is part of the array since the subarray must contain `k`. However, we will not constrain our solution to this unless specified.

3. **How should we handle edge cases with single-element subarrays and duplicates?**
   - Single-element subarrays are straightforward as long as they contain `k`. For duplicates, they should be processed based on the problem's definition of the median.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider:
- **Step 1:** Identify subarrays that contain the element `k`.
- **Step 2:** For each found subarray containing `k`, determine if `k` is the median.

#### Better Approach
1. **Prefix Sums using a Balance Concept:**
   - Translate elements relative to `k` into +1 or -1, and use prefix sums to maintain balance. This approach lets us efficiently track subarrays where the median condition is potentially met.

#### Steps:
1. Traverse `nums` to mark elements as +1 (greater than or equal to `k`) or -1 (less than `k`).
2. Use prefix sums to detect the good subarrays efficiently.

### Code
Here is the C++ solution following the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int balance = 0;
    unordered_map<int, int> balanceCounts;
    balanceCounts[0] = 1;
    
    int result = 0;
    bool foundK = false;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == k) foundK = true;
        balance += (num > k) ? 1 : (num < k) ? -1 : 0;

        if (foundK) {
            result += balanceCounts[balance];
            result += balanceCounts[balance - 1];
        } else {
            balanceCounts[balance]++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 2, 1, 4, 5};
    int k = 4;
    cout << countSubarrays(nums, k) << endl; // Output expected: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the hashmap storing prefix balances.

The code uses efficient prefix sum techniques to count the valid subarrays, ensuring it remains performant even for larger input sizes.
