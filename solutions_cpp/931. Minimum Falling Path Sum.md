[Leetcode 931. Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l931)
Sure, let's tackle the LeetCode problem 931: "Minimum Falling Path Sum".

### Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` array of integers `matrix`, return the minimum sum of any falling path through `matrix`.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is either the same as the previous column or adjacent to it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What are the possible values for `n`? Are there any constraints on the values inside the matrix?
2. **Matrix properties**: Can the matrix contain negative numbers or zeros? 
3. **Output properties**: Should the function return the minimum sum as an integer?

### Assumptions
- `n` is in the range of `[1, 100]`.
- Values in `matrix` range from `-100` to `100`, inclusive.
- The function needs to return the minimum sum of a falling path.

### Strategy
We can use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Create a DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum of the falling path reaching element `(i, j)`.
2. **Base Case**: The first row of `dp` is the same as the first row of `matrix` because there are no previous rows.
3. **DP Transition**: For each element `(i, j)` in the matrix from the second row to the last row, calculate the minimum sum of falling paths coming from possible previous positions `(i-1, j-1)`, `(i-1, j)`, and `(i-1, j+1)`.
4. **Result**: The answer will be the minimum value in the last row of the DP array.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of rows (or columns, since the matrix is square). This is because we iterate through each element of the matrix once.

### C++ Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // DP table, initialized with the first row of the matrix
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp = matrix;

        // DP transition
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int minPrevious = dp[i-1][j];
                if (j > 0) {
                    minPrevious = std::min(minPrevious, dp[i-1][j-1]);
                }
                if (j < n - 1) {
                    minPrevious = std::min(minPrevious, dp[i-1][j+1]);
                }
                dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + minPrevious;
            }
        }

        // The result is the minimum value in the last row of dp
        int result = *std::min_element(dp[n-1].begin(), dp[n-1].end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing the DP table `dp` with the values from the input `matrix`.
- **DP Transition**: For every element `matrix[i][j]` not in the first row, we update `dp[i][j]` considering the possible previous positions.
- **Result Calculation**: After filling up the DP table, the minimum value in the last row of `dp` will be our result as it represents the minimal falling path sum.

This approach ensures that we are considering all possible falling paths efficiently within the given constraints.
