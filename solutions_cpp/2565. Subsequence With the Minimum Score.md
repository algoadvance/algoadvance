[Leetcode 2565. Subsequence With the Minimum Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2565)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. You need to find a subsequence of string `s` such that the difference between the length of this subsequence and the length of string `t` is minimized. The difference is defined as `len(t) - len(subsequence of s)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Subsequence Definition:** 
   - A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements might be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements.
  
2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score is calculated as `len(t) - len(subsequence of s)`. 

3. **Constraints on Inputs:**
   - What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `t`?
   - Are `s` and `t` composed of lowercase English letters only?

For the sake of this example, we will assume reasonable constraints:
- The lengths of `s` and `t` are within `1` to `1000`.
- Both `s` and `t` contain only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the task:** 
   - We need the length of the longest subsequence of `s` that is also a subsequence in `t`. The result or score will be the difference between the length of `t` and this longest subsequence length in `s`.

2. **Approach:** 
   - **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Using dynamic programming to compute the length of the LCS between `s` and `t`.

3. **Steps:**
   - Create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of LCS of the substrings `s[0..i-1]` and `t[0..j-1]`.
   - Fill the DP table using the relation:
     - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
     - Else, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
   - The required subsequence length will be `dp[len(s)][len(t)]`.
   - Finally, the score will be `len(t) - dp[len(s)][len(t)]`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above approach is `O(n * m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of strings `s` and `t` respectively. This is efficient given the constraints assumed (lengths up to 1000).

### Code

Hereâ€™s the C++ code following the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int subsequenceWithMinimumScore(std::string s, std::string t) {
    int n = s.size();
    int m = t.size();
    
    // Create a 2D DP array
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(m + 1, 0));
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
            if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Length of LCS
    int lengthLCS = dp[n][m];
    
    // Score is len(t) - len(LCS)
    return m - lengthLCS;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abcde";
    std::string t = "ace";
    
    int result = subsequenceWithMinimumScore(s, t);
    std::cout << "The minimum score is: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **DP Array Initialization:** Initialize the DP array of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` with zeros.
2. **DP Table Filling:** Use nested loops to fill up the table based on the relationship mentioned. If characters match, the current cell value is derived from the diagonal previous cell incremented by one. If not, it is the maximum of left or top cell value.
3. **Score Calculation:** The final length of the LCS is found at `dp[n][m]`. The score is then calculated as the difference between the lengths of `t` and the LCS.

By following the above plan, we can effectively solve the problem.
