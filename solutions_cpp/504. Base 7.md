[Leetcode 504. Base 7](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l504)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer, return its base 7 string representation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Integer:** What is the range of the input integer?
   - The typical integer range in C++ can be from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`.
2. **Output:** Should negative numbers be handled, and if so, should the result string include a negative sign?
   - Yes, handle negative numbers by including a negative sign in the resulting string.

### Strategy
1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the input integer is `0`, return `"0"` directly.
   
2. **Negative Number Handling:**
   - If the input integer is negative, record this information and make the number positive for easier conversion.

3. **Conversion Process:**
   - Use a loop to continuously divide the number by `7` and record the remainder.
   - Append remainders in reverse order to get the correct base 7 representation.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - If the original number was negative, add a negative sign to the resulting string.
   - Return the constructed string.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string convertToBase7(int num) {
    if (num == 0) return "0";
    
    bool isNegative = num < 0;
    num = std::abs(num);
    
    std::string result;
    while (num > 0) {
        result = std::to_string(num % 7) + result;
        num /= 7;
    }
    
    if (isNegative) {
        result = "-" + result;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    std::cout << convertToBase7(100) << std::endl;  // Output "202"
    std::cout << convertToBase7(-7) << std::endl;   // Output "-10"
    std::cout << convertToBase7(0) << std::endl;    // Output "0"
    std::cout << convertToBase7(49) << std::endl;   // Output "100"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(log₇(n))` where `n` is the input number. This is due to the fact that we are dividing the number by `7` repeatedly, thus the number of iterations will be proportional to the logarithm of the number in base `7`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(log₇(n))` to store the resulting string.
