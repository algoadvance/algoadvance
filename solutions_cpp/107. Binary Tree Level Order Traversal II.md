[Leetcode 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l107)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be returned if the tree is empty?
   **A:** Return an empty list.
2. **Q:** Are the node values unique?
   **A:** Yes, for simplicity, assume all node values are unique.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we will perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree, but instead of constructing the result in a top-down manner, we'll build it from the bottom up.

**Steps:**
1. **Check if the tree is empty:** If the root is `nullptr`, return an empty list.
2. **Use a queue for the level-order traversal:** Initialize a queue to store nodes at the current level.
3. **Traverse each level:**
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level.
   - For each node, add its value to the current level’s list and enqueue its non-null children.
   - Prepend the current level’s list to the result list.
4. **Return the result:** Once all levels are processed, the result list will be bottom-up.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm> // for reverse

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrderBottom(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (root == nullptr) return result;
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            vector<int> currentLevel;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = q.front();
                q.pop();
                currentLevel.push_back(currentNode->val);
                
                if (currentNode->left != nullptr)  q.push(currentNode->left);
                if (currentNode->right != nullptr) q.push(currentNode->right);
            }
            result.push_back(currentLevel);
        }
        
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};

// Helper function to print the result
void printResult(const vector<vector<int>>& result) {
    for (const auto& level : result) {
        for (int val : level) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree: 3
    //                            /   \
    //                           9     20
    //                                /  \
    //                               15   7
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->right = new TreeNode(20);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(15);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> result = sol.levelOrderBottom(root);
    printResult(result);
    
    // Clean up the tree (not necessary in production code)
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree:
- Each node is enqueued and dequeued exactly once, resulting in linear time complexity for the traversal.
- Reversing the result list at the end takes **O(L)** time, where `L` is the number of levels. Since `L` <= `n`, this step is also **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(n)** as well:
- The queue can hold at most one level of the tree at a time, which in the worst case is **O(n/2)** = **O(n)**.
- The result list will store each node's value once, also requiring **O(n)** space.
