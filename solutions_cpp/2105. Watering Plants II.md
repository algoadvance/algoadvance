[Leetcode 2105. Watering Plants II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2105)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `plants` where `plants[i]` is the amount of water needed by the `i-th` plant, two watering cans, and a garden with `n` plants in a row, you are to supply water to the plants following these rules:

1. You have two people, one starting from the beginning of the row and the other starting from the end. Each person has their own watering can, which can be refilled as necessary.
2. Each person's watering can has a capacity of `capacityA` and `capacityB` respectively.
3. Each person waters the plants they encounter while moving inward until both meet or cross paths. When a person cannot fully water the next plant they encounter, they should refill their watering can immediately before watering that plant.

The goal is to determine the total number of times both people combined have to refill their watering cans.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the capacities of the two watering cans necessarily different?
   - No, they can be the same or different.

2. What happens if a plant requires more water than the capacity of the watering cans?
   - The problem assumes each plant requires less water than or equal to the maximum capacity of the respective watering cans.

3. Should we count the initial filling of the watering cans before starting?
   - No, the initial fill is not considered a refill.

## Strategy

1. Initialize `personA` (starting from the beginning) with a capacity of `capacityA` and counter `refillsA` to track refills.
2. Initialize `personB` (starting from the end) with a capacity of `capacityB` and counter `refillsB` to track refills.
3. Use two pointers `i` at the start and `j` at the end of the `plants` array.
4. Move the two pointers inward towards each other, watering plants along the way.
5. Whenever either person cannot water the next plant without a refill, increment their respective refill counter, refill their watering can, and then water the plant.
6. Continue the process until the pointers cross or meet.
7. The total number of refills is the sum of `refillsA` and `refillsB`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int wateringPlantsII(std::vector<int>& plants, int capacityA, int capacityB) {
    int n = plants.size();
    int refillsA = 0, refillsB = 0;
    int waterA = capacityA, waterB = capacityB;
    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    
    while (i <= j) {
        if (i == j) {
            // Both pointers meet at the same plant
            if (waterA >= waterB) {
                if (waterA < plants[i]) {
                    refillsA++;
                    waterA = capacityA;
                }
                waterA -= plants[i];
            } else {
                if (waterB < plants[j]) {
                    refillsB++;
                    waterB = capacityB;
                }
                waterB -= plants[j];
            }
            break;
        }
        if (waterA < plants[i]) {
            refillsA++;
            waterA = capacityA;
        }
        waterA -= plants[i];
        i++;
        
        if (waterB < plants[j]) {
            refillsB++;
            waterB = capacityB;
        }
        waterB -= plants[j];
        j--;
    }
    
    return refillsA + refillsB;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> plants = {2, 4, 5, 1, 2};
    int capacityA = 5;
    int capacityB = 7;
    std::cout << "Total refills: " << wateringPlantsII(plants, capacityA, capacityB) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of plants. This is because each plant is processed exactly once.
