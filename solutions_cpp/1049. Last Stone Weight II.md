[Leetcode 1049. Last Stone Weight II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1049)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of integers `stones` representing the weights of stones, we need to find the smallest possible weight of the remaining stone (or 0 if there are no remaining stones) after we have smashed all the stones together. The smash operation is defined as follows:

- Choose any two stones `x` and `y` where `x <= y`.
- The result of smashing these stones will be a new stone of weight `y - x`.

The goal is to minimize the weight of the last remaining stone (or minimize the weight difference if no stones remain).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints of the problem?**
   - The number of stones `n` can range from 1 to 30.
   - The weight of each stone can be between 1 and 100.

2. **Is it possible to have an empty list of stones?**
   - No, the list will always contain at least one stone.

3. **What should be returned if there is only one stone?**
   - The weight of the single stone should be returned as there's no other stone to smash it with.

## Strategy
This problem can be framed as a variation of the partition problem where we're trying to split the list into two subsets with minimal weight difference. The key idea here is to use dynamic programming to find the most balanced split possible.

We can calculate a target, which is half the sum of all stones, and use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum we can achieve that is less than or equal to this target. The difference between this sum and the total sum represents the minimum possible weight difference.

### Steps:
1. Calculate the total sum of all stones `sum`.
2. Use dynamic programming to determine the closest sum to `sum / 2`.
3. Compute the difference between the total sum and twice the best achievable subset sum using the DP array.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
- Let `dp[i]` be a boolean array where `dp[i]` indicates whether a subset sum `i` can be achieved using the given stones.
- Initialize `dp[0]` to `true` (a sum of 0 is always possible).
- For each stone, update the DP array in a reverse manner to avoid over-counting.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeightII(std::vector<int>& stones) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int stone : stones) sum += stone;
        int target = sum / 2;
        
        std::vector<bool> dp(target + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true;
        
        for (int stone : stones) {
            for (int i = target; i >= stone; --i) {
                dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - stone];
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = target; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                return sum - 2 * i;
            }
        }
        
        return 0; // Should not reach here
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * sum/2)` where `n` is the number of stones and `sum` is the total sum of stones. Given the constraints, this is efficient.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(sum/2)`, which is feasible given the constraints.
