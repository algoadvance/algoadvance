[Leetcode 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1053)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr`. A *previous permutation* of an array of integers is the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than the current one.

For example, the previous permutation of `[3,2,1]` is `[3,1,2]`, the previous permutation of `[1,1,5]` is `[1,1,5]`, and the previous permutation of `[1,9,4,6,7]` is `[1,7,4,6,9]`.

Return the largest previous permutation by making at most one swap (two indices) in `arr`. If it does not exist, return the smallest permutation of `arr`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Size**: What is the range of the size of the array?
   - Typically, array size can range from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **Element Range**: What is the range of the elements in the array?
   - Typically, elements range from \(0\) to \(10^9\).

3. **Duplicates**: Does the array contain duplicates?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the "Largest" Previous Permutation**:
    - Scan from the end of the array to find the first element `arr[i]` that is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This marks the point where the sequence starts to increase in value from right to left.

2. **Find a Swap Position**:
    - Once `i` is identified, look for the largest element to the right of `i` (let's call it `arr[j]` where `j > i`) such that `arr[j] < arr[i]` and swapping them will produce a valid permutation. To get the lexicographically largest permutation, `arr[j]` should be the largest possible value that still satisfies `arr[j] < arr[i]`.

3. **Conduct Swap**:
    - Swap `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.

4. **Result**:
    - If the array is already the smallest permutation (completely sorted in ascending order), simply return it without any changes or perform a swap that potentially produces the next lexicographically smallest permutation.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a C++ solution implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> prevPermOpt1(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int i = n - 2;

    // Step 1: Find the first decreasing element from the end
    while (i >= 0 && arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]) {
        --i;
    }

    // If there's no such element, return the original array (it's already the smallest permutation)
    if (i < 0) return arr;

    // Step 2: Find the rightmost element that is smaller than arr[i]
    int j = n - 1;
    while (arr[j] >= arr[i]) {
        --j;
    }

    // Step 3: To ensure the swap is with the largest possible smaller element, check for duplicates
    while (j > 0 && arr[j] == arr[j - 1]) {
        --j;
    }

    // Step 4: Swap
    std::swap(arr[i], arr[j]);

    return arr;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the array. This is because:
- We perform a linear scan to identify the first decreasing element.
- We perform another linear scan to find the correct element to swap with.
- Therefore, the total complexity is dominated by these linear scans.

This approach ensures that we achieve the problem goals efficiently.
