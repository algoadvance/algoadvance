[Leetcode 1583. Count Unhappy Friends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1583)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of `n` friends, each wearing a unique ID from `0` to `n-1`. You are given a 2D integer array `preferences` where `preferences[i]` is a list of friends sorted in the order of preference by friend `i`. In other words, friend `i` likes friend `preferences[i][0]` most and friend `preferences[i][n-2]` least.

You are also given a 2D integer array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [xI, yI]` indicates that friend `xI` is paired with friend `yI` and friend `yI` is paired with friend `xI`. 

Friend `x` is unhappy with the pair `(x, y)` if there exists a friend `u` who is paired with friend `v` and both of the following conditions are satisfied:
1. `x` prefers `u` over `y`.
2. `u` prefers `x` over `v`.

Return the number of unhappy friends.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can any friend be paired multiple times?
   - No, each friend will be paired exactly once.
2. How will `preferences` be given? Will `preferences[i]` always have `n-1` elements?
   - Yes, each `preferences[i]` list contains `n-1` friends in sorted order of preference.
3. Will there be an even number of friends?
   - Yes, `n` will always be even.

### Strategy

1. **Preprocessing Preferences**: 
   - Create a ranking map for each friend to quickly look up how much each friend prefers another.
   
2. **Identify Initial Pairs**: 
   - Convert the `pairs` list to a map for quick access to the partner of any given friend.
   
3. **Check for Unhappy Friends**:
   - Iterate over each friend. For each friend `x`, iterate through `x`'s preference list up to the friend they are paired with.
   - For each friend `u` in this sublist, check if `u` prefers `x` over their current partner using the precomputed rankings.

### Time Complexity
- Building the ranking map: O(n^2)
- Checking pairs for unhappiness: O(n^2) in the worst case.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int unhappyFriends(int n, vector<vector<int>>& preferences, vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
        // Create a ranking map
        vector<vector<int>> ranking(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                ranking[i][preferences[i][j]] = j;
            }
        }
        
        // Create a map for pairs for quick lookup
        unordered_map<int, int> paired_with;
        for (auto& pair : pairs) {
            paired_with[pair[0]] = pair[1];
            paired_with[pair[1]] = pair[0];
        }
        
        int unhappy_count = 0;
        
        // Check each friend for unhappiness
        for (int x = 0; x < n; ++x) {
            int y = paired_with[x];
            for (int i = 0; preferences[x][i] != y; ++i) {
                int u = preferences[x][i];
                int v = paired_with[u];
                if (ranking[u][x] < ranking[u][v]) {
                    unhappy_count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return unhappy_count;
    }
};
```

This solution accurately captures the process of determining the number of unhappy friends based on their preferences and the conditions provided.
