[Leetcode 1328. Break a Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1328)
## Problem Statement

You are given a palindromic string `palindrome` consisting of only lowercase English letters. Your task is to replace **exactly one** character by any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is **not** a palindrome and that it is the **lexicographically smallest** possible string that isn't a palindrome.

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum length of the palindrome string?**
   - The string length is at least 1.

2. **What characters can the string contain?**
   - The string only consists of lowercase English letters (`a` to `z`).

3. **What if the palindrome has only one character?**
   - In this case, it is impossible to change a single character to avoid forming another palindrome, so we return an empty string.

## Strategy

1. **Check for Single Character**:
   - If the length of the palindrome is 1, return an empty string immediately.

2. **Modify the First Half**:
   - Iterate through the first half of the string.
   - Replace the first non-'a' character with 'a' to get the smallest lexicographic string.
   - If all characters in the first half are 'a', change the last character to 'b' to ensure the string is not a palindrome and still lexicographically small.

3. **Check for Original String**:
   - Ensure the new string is not a palindrome by explicitly checking if it is not equal to its reverse.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string breakPalindrome(string palindrome) {
    int n = palindrome.size();
    if (n == 1) {
        return "";
    }
  
    // Change the first non-'a' character to 'a'
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
        if (palindrome[i] != 'a') {
            palindrome[i] = 'a';
            return palindrome;
        }
    }

    // If all characters are 'a', change the last character to 'b'
    palindrome[n - 1] = 'b';
    return palindrome;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n/2), which simplifies to O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through at most half of the string to find the first non-'a' character or decide to change the last character.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are modifying the string in place and are not using any additional space proportional to the input size.

This solution ensures we achieve the goal in an optimal manner while maintaining clear readability and correctness.
