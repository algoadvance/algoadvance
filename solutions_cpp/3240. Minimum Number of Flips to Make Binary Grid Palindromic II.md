[Leetcode 3240. Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3240)
## Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` binary grid `grid`, return the minimum number of **flips** to make the grid **palindromic**. In one flip, you can change any `0` to `1` or vice versa.

A binary grid is palindromic if, when read in row order, the sequence of `0`s and `1`s is the same as the sequence read in reverse row order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - `n` likely varies up to a reasonable number, such as 50x50, but we should verify.
   
2. **For a grid to be palindromic, do we consider only the rows, or do the columns need to be palindromic as well?**
   - Based on the description, we consider the row-by-row view of the grid to be palindromic.

3. **Is there any limitation on performing flips, for example, maximum number of flips allowed?**
   - No, the goal is to minimize the flips.

## Strategy

1. **Symmetry Check:**
   - For every cell `(i, j)` and its corresponding cell `(n-1-i, n-1-j)`, if the values are not equal, one of them needs to be flipped.

2. **Count Minimum Flips:**
   - For each pair `(i, j)` and `(n-1-i, n-1-j)` that are unequal, increase the flip count.

3. **Iterate Only Half of the Grid:**
   - Since flipping one half of the grid correctly will automatically ensure the other half is palindrome, we only need to check half.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int minFlipsToPalindromeGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int n = grid.size();
    int flipCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] != grid[n-1-i][n-1-j]) {
                ++flipCount;
            }
        }
    }

    return flipCount;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {
        {1, 0, 1},
        {0, 1, 0},
        {1, 0, 1}
    };

    cout << "Minimum number of flips: " << minFlipsToPalindromeGrid(grid) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n^2) \) because we potentially iterate over each element in roughly half of the grid's cells, comparing and counting the necessary flips. Since checking each element involves constant-time operations, the complexity remains quadratic with respect to `n`.
