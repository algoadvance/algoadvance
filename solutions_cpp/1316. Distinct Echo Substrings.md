### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1316: Distinct Echo Substrings

Given a string `text`, return the number of distinct non-empty substrings that can be written as the concatenation of some string with itself (i.e. "xx").

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure that we understand the problem correctly, let's consider a few questions:

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the length of the input string?
   - Typically, the length can range from 1 to 1000.

2. **Output Specifications**: What exactly do we return?
   - We should return a single integer, representing the number of distinct "echo" substrings.

3. **Case Sensitivity**: Is the problem case-sensitive?
   - Yes, the problem is case-sensitive. "Aa" is different from "aa".

4. **Examples**:
   - For `text = "abcabcabc"`, the distinct echo substrings are "abcabc", "bcabca", and "cabcab".
   - For `text = "aabbaabb"`, the distinct echo substrings are "aabbaa" and "bbaabb".

### Strategy
1. **Identify Echo Substrings**:
   - An echo substring `xx` can be found by iterating through all possible substrings of `text` and checking if they can be divided into two equal parts with identical characters. 

2. **Using a Set for Uniqueness**:
   - We'll utilize a hash set to collect all distinct echo substrings without duplicates.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Substrings**:
   - For each starting index `i` from 0 to `len(text) - 1`, and each even length `2 * l` where `l` + `l` <= remaining characters, we'll check if `text[i:i+l]` is the same as `text[i+l:i+2*l]`.

### Time Complexity
We'll need to examine each substring of the string, leading to a **O(n^3)** solution, where `n` is the length of the input string. We can optimize this but given usual constraints (up to 1000), it should be manageable.

### Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int distinctEchoSubstrings(const std::string& text) {
    std::unordered_set<std::string> echoSubstrings;
    int n = text.length();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int l = 1; i + 2 * l <= n; ++l) {
            std::string first_half = text.substr(i, l);
            std::string second_half = text.substr(i + l, l);
            
            if (first_half == second_half) {
                echoSubstrings.insert(first_half + second_half);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return echoSubstrings.size();
}

int main() {
    std::string text = "abcabcabc";
    std::cout << "Number of distinct echo substrings: " << distinctEchoSubstrings(text) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code defines a function `distinctEchoSubstrings` that takes a string `text`, finds all unique echo substrings, and returns their count. We then test this with a main function as an example. This approach ensures we identify and count all relevant substrings effectively.
