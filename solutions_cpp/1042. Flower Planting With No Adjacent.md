[Leetcode 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1042)
## Problem Statement

You have `N` gardens, labeled `1` to `N`. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers. Two gardens are considered adjacent if there is a path between them. Given an array `paths` where `paths[i] = [x, y]` denotes a direct path between garden `x` and garden `y`, your task is to plant flowers in each garden such that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flowers. Return any such a choice as an array answer, where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden. The answer should use integers [1, 2, 3, 4] where each number represents a type of flower.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of `N` and the length of `paths`?
2. Can there be multiple paths between two gardens?
3. Is there any constraint that guarantees the problem solution's feasibility?

Assuming typical constraints from LeetCode problems, we will consider an upper bound of N (e.g., 10000 gardens), and we will assume `paths` has unique pairs only, with at most one direct path between two gardens. The problem's nature ensures at least one valid planting configuration.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the gardens and paths as an undirected graph using adjacency lists.
2. **Flower Assignment**: Use a greedy algorithm to assign flowers to each garden. We iterate through each garden, assigning the smallest number that has not been used by any of its adjacent gardens.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<int> gardenNoAdj(int N, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj(N);
    vector<int> flower(N, 0);

    // Construct adjacency list
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
        adj[path[0] - 1].push_back(path[1] - 1);
        adj[path[1] - 1].push_back(path[0] - 1);
    }

    // Assign flowers
    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
        bool used[5] = { false };
        
        // Mark the flower types used by adjacent gardens
        for (int neighbor : adj[i]) {
            used[flower[neighbor]] = true;
        }

        // Assign the smallest unused flower type to garden i
        for (int f = 1; f <= 4; ++f) {
            if (!used[f]) {
                flower[i] = f;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return flower;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges (paths).
- **Flower Assignment**: Each garden has a constant number of neighbors (degree bounded by `N` and 4 flower types). Hence, this can be seen as `O(N)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(N + E)`, which is linear with respect to the number of gardens and paths, making it efficient for the given problem constraints.
