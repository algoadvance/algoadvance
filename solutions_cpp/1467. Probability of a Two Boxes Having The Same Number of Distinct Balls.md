[Leetcode 1467. Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1467)
## Problem Statement
You are given two boxes. There are `2n` balls in `k` distinct colors. The `i-th` color has `balls[i]` balls. You want to divide the balls into the two boxes and your goal is to maximize the probability of having the same number of distinct balls in both boxes. Calculate the probability that two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.

**Example:**
```
Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= balls.length <= 8`
- `1 <= balls[i] <= 6`
- `sum(balls) is even`
- Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value are considered correct.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of the `balls` array? 
    - Up to 8.
2. Is the sum of all `balls[i]` always even?
    - Yes, it is guaranteed to be an even number.
3. Are we allowed to use floating-point arithmetic for probability calculations?
    - Yes, precision up to `10^-5` is acceptable.

## Strategy
1. **Backtracking:** Use a backtracking approach to try all possible distributions of balls into the two boxes.
2. **Combination Validation:** Check in each distribution if both boxes have the same number of distinct balls.
3. **Probability Calculation:** Count the number of successful distributions and the total number of possible distributions, then calculate the probability.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    double getProbability(std::vector<int>& balls) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int b : balls) total += b;

        double totalWays = 0, validWays = 0;
        std::vector<int> box1(balls.size(), 0), box2(balls.size(), 0);

        // Helper function to calculate factorial.
        auto factorial = [](int n) -> double {
            double fact = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
                fact *= i;
            }
            return fact;
        };

        // Helper function to calculate combinations (n choose k).
        auto comb = [&](int n, int k) -> double {
            return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k));
        };

        // Backtracking function
        std::function<void(int, int, int)> backtrack = [&](int i, int cnt1, int cnt2) {
            if (i == balls.size()) {
                if (cnt1 == cnt2) {
                    int d1 = 0, d2 = 0;
                    double ways1 = 1, ways2 = 1;
                    for (int j = 0; j < balls.size(); ++j) {
                        d1 += (box1[j] > 0);
                        d2 += (box2[j] > 0);
                        ways1 *= comb(balls[j], box1[j]);
                        ways2 *= comb(balls[j], box2[j]);
                    }
                    totalWays += ways1 * ways2;
                    if (d1 == d2) {
                        validWays += ways1 * ways2;
                    }
                }
                return;
            }

            for (int j = 0; j <= balls[i]; ++j) {
                box1[i] = j;
                box2[i] = balls[i] - j;
                backtrack(i + 1, cnt1 + j, cnt2 + (balls[i] - j));
            }
        };

        backtrack(0, 0, 0);
        return validWays / totalWays;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> balls = {1, 1};
    std::cout << sol.getProbability(balls) << std::endl;  // Output: 1.00000
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity primarily depends on the number of backtracking calls, which is `O(k^n)` where `k` is the number of ball colors, and `n` is the maximum number of balls (per each color).

Given the constraints (maximum 8 distinct colors and 6 balls per color), this approach is feasible within reasonable limits.
