[Leetcode 2065. Maximum Path Quality of a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2065)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive) and an array of `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `i-th` node. You are also given an array `edges` where `edges[j] = [u, v, time_j]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v` that takes `time_j` units of time to traverse. Lastly, you are given an integer `maxTime` which represents the maximum amount of time you can spend traversing edges.

The graph is connected, meaning that there is a path from any given node to any other node.

Your task is to maximize the sum of node values you collect from nodes visited at most once, starting and ending at node `0` within `maxTime` units of time.

Return the maximum path value you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no valid path fits within the `maxTime`?**
   - If you start at node `0` and return immediately, you already collect the value of node `0`, so there will always be at least this minimal valid path.

2. **Can nodes be visited more than once?**
   - Yes, nodes can be visited more than once, but the value of each node can only be counted the first time it is encountered on that path.

3. **Are there constraints on the values in the `values` array and `edges` length?**
   - We will assume standard constraints with reasonable sizes for competitive programming problems.

4. **Is there any specific graph representation we should use?**
   - Since this is an undirected graph and we should consider possible paths for traversal, we can use an adjacency list.

Let's proceed with solving the problem.

### Strategy

We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking to explore all possible paths. The key points in the strategy include:
1. Keeping track of the total time spent on the path.
2. Ensuring that we don't exceed `maxTime`.
3. Keeping track of nodes visited and summing values accordingly.
4. Backtracking to explore different paths.

### Code

Here's how you could implement this:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathQuality(std::vector<int>& values, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges, int maxTime) {
        int n = values.size();
        std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>> graph;
        
        // Build the graph from edges list
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            int time = edge[2];
            graph[u].emplace_back(v, time);
            graph[v].emplace_back(u, time);
        }
        
        int maxQuality = 0;
        
        std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        // DFS function with backtracking
        std::function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int curTime, int curQuality) {
            if (curTime > maxTime) return;
            
            if (!visited[node]) {
                curQuality += values[node];
                visited[node] = true;
            }
            
            if (node == 0) {
              maxQuality = std::max(maxQuality, curQuality);
            }
            
            for (auto& [neighbor, time] : graph[node]) {
                dfs(neighbor, curTime + time, curQuality);
            }
            
            // Backtrack: remove the node value when we come back
            if (visited[node]) {
                curQuality -= values[node];
                visited[node] = false;
            }
        };
        
        // Start from node 0
        dfs(0, 0, 0);
        
        return maxQuality;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity:
- **DFS Traversal**: Since it explores all possible paths, in the worst case, it traverses each edge and processes each node multiple times.
- **Graph Construction**: \(O(E)\) where \(E\) is the number of edges for graph construction.

Overall, the worst-case complexity is exponential in nature due to the exploration of multiple paths in the graph but can be considered as \( O(2^n) \) where \( n \) is the number of nodes because each node can either be included in a path or not. However, practical performance might be better due to early stopping when the time constraint is violated.
