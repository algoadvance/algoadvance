[Leetcode 1997. First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1997)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed integer array** `nextVisit` of length `n` where `nextVisit[i]` indicates that the next room you will visit after leaving room `i` is room `nextVisit[i]`. 

There are `n` rooms indexed from `0` to `n - 1` and you start your journey from room `0` on day `0`.

You need to find the **first day** that you have been in **all the rooms** at least once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is it guaranteed that you can visit all rooms starting from room `0` and following the `nextVisit` rules?
2. Are there any constraints on `n` or the values in `nextVisit`?

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Function to find the first day when all rooms have been visited
int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(vector<int>& nextVisit) {
    int n = nextVisit.size();
    vector<long long> dp(n, 0);
    long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 1 + (dp[i-1] - dp[nextVisit[i-1]] + MOD) % MOD + 1) % MOD;
    }

    return dp[n-1];
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: 
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the first day by which we've visited room `i` at least once.

2. **Transition**:
   - For `i = 1` to `n-1`, the transition is based on:
     - Moving from room `i-1` to room `i` takes one additional day from `dp[i-1]`.
     - We need to account for the time to revisit room `nextVisit[i-1]`.
     - The total days `dp[i]` is calculated using these criteria modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Result**:
   - The first day we've been to all rooms is stored in `dp[n-1]`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - This is because we iterate over all rooms once and perform constant-time operations within each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - This comes from storing `dp` of length `n`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently track the number of days required to visit all rooms while adhering to the problem constraints.
