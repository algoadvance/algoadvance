[Leetcode 2478. Number of Beautiful Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2478)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits. You want to partition the string into exactly `k` non-empty beautiful substrings. A substring is considered beautiful if:

1. It starts with a prime digit (`2`, `3`, `5`, or `7`).
2. It ends with a non-prime digit (`0`, `1`, `4`, `6`, `8`, or `9`).

Return the number of ways to partition the string such that all `k` substrings are beautiful. Two partitions are different if any substring in one of the partitions is different from the corresponding substring in the other partition.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` and the value of `k`?
2. Are there any invalid cases, such as when `k` is greater than the length of `s`?
3. Should we consider the order of the substrings or just their contents?
4. Can `s` contain leading zeros, and does it affect the beauty of a substring?
5. Is there a limit to the allowed computational complexity for this problem?

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check:** Check if it's even possible to partition the string into `k` substrings considering the length of `s`. If `k` is greater than the length of `s`, return 0.
2. **Prime Digit Set:** Create a set for prime digits (`2, 3, 5, 7`) and non-prime digits (`0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9`).
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Use dynamic programming to keep track of possible partitions. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to partition the substring `s[0:i]` into exactly `j` beautiful substrings.
4. **Transition:** Iterate through the string and for each valid partition, update the DP table.
5. **Check Substrings:** For each potential partition, ensure it adheres to the beautiful property before updating the DP table.

## Code

Here is a possible implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int beautifulPartitions(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        
        if (k > n) return 0;
        
        unordered_set<char> prime_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7'};
        unordered_set<char> non_prime_digits = {'0', '1', '4', '6', '8', '9'};
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1; // 1 way to partition empty string into 0 parts
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                for (int m = 1; m <= i; ++m) {
                    if (prime_digits.count(s[m - 1]) && non_prime_digits.count(s[i - 1])) {
                        dp[i][j] += dp[m - 1][j - 1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^3 * k)` where:
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `k` is the number of partitions.

This is due to the nested loops in the dynamic programming solution. This complexity might be high for large inputs, so additional optimizations or a more efficient algorithm might be necessary for larger constraints.

## Final Notes

To improve the efficiency, consider more sophisticated DP state transitions or pruning unnecessary computations. For example, you could optimize checking for valid substrings by precomputing the validity and reusing results.
