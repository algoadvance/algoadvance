[Leetcode 2434. Using a Robot to Print the Lexicographically Smallest String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2434)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, a robot must print the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing a sequence of operations. The robot can execute two operations:

1. Append the leftmost character of `s` to the result string and remove it from `s`.
2. Move the leftmost character of `s` to a stack.

The robot can repeat these operations until `s` is empty. After `s` is empty, the robot can still pop characters from the stack to add them to the result.

The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by executing these operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`? 

   - Are there any constraints on the characters in the string `s`? (e.g., only lowercase English letters)

2. **Operations:**
   - Can the robot perform the operations in any order multiple times?

3. **Output:**
   - What should be the format of the output? (It appears to be straightforward as a string).

Given that these questions typically tend to be clear from the problem description, let's assume the usual constraints for such problems:

- The length of `s` is between `1` and `10^5`.
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

The strategy involves using a greedy approach with a stack to always append the smallest possible character to the result string:

1. **Track frequencies:** Use an array to track the remaining frequencies of each character in `s`.
2. **Iterate through `s`:** For each character, decide whether to append it directly to the result or to push it onto the stack.
3. **Stack utilization:** Whenever possible, pop characters from the stack to the result if they are the smallest possible options.

This ensures that at each step, we're making the lexicographically smallest choice.

### Code

Below is the implementation of our approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

string robotWithString(string s) {
    vector<int> freq(26, 0);  // Frequency of each character in s
    for (char c : s) {
        freq[c - 'a']++;
    }
    
    stack<char> st;
    string result;
    for (char c : s) {
        st.push(c);
        freq[c - 'a']--;
        
        // While the stack is not empty and the top character of the stack 
        // is smaller than any future character in s, pop from the stack to the result
        while (!st.empty()) {
            // Check if there's no smaller character left than stack top
            bool canPush = true;
            for (int i = 0; i < st.top() - 'a'; ++i) {
                if (freq[i] > 0) {
                    canPush = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (canPush) {
                result.push_back(st.top());
                st.pop();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Append remaining characters in the stack to the result
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result.push_back(st.top());
        st.pop();
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "cbacbcbc";
    cout << robotWithString(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of string `s`. This is because we process each character of the string once:

- Building the frequency array takes O(n).
- Iterating through the string and processing each character also takes O(n).

The stack operations (push and pop) each take O(1) time, resulting in an overall linear time complexity.

This ensures that our solution is efficient and scalable for large inputs.
