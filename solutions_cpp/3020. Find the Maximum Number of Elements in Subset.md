[Leetcode 3020. Find the Maximum Number of Elements in Subset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3020)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `m`. Your task is to find the maximum number of elements you can pick from `nums` such that:

1. The sum of the elements picked is equal to `m`
2. Once you pick an element from `nums`, you cannot pick its index or two adjacent indices.

Return the maximum number of elements you can pick that satisfy the given conditions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Is there a guarantee that the sum `m` can always be formed?
2. **Array Characteristics**: Can `nums` contain negative numbers or zeros, or is it guaranteed to only contain positive integers?
3. **Output Requirement**: If no valid subset is found, should I return 0 or some other value?
4. **Duplicate Values**: Are there any constraints related to duplicate values in `nums`?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to explore all possible subsets of the `nums` array while adhering to the restrictions about sum equal to `m` and not picking adjacent elements. This problem can be approached with a dynamic programming or backtracking strategy:

1. **Backtracking**: Generate all valid subsets of the array that conform to the adjacency rules and compute their sums.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether a sum `j` can be achieved using the first `i` elements and considering the adjacency constraint.

Dynamic Programming can be more efficient and will help avoid redundant calculations seen in brute-force backtracking.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` is true if a sum `j` can be achieved.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array and update the DP array according to the constraints.
3. Track the maximum number of elements used in the process of achieving the target sum `m`.

Here is the implementation in C++:

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Function to find the maximum number of elements that can be picked
 * such that their sum is equal to m and no two elements are adjacent.
 */
int maxElementsWithSumM(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = m; j >= nums[i - 1]; --j) {
            // Skip if we don't take the current element
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j]);
            // if we take the current element, then add 1 and update sum
            if (i > 1 && j >= nums[i - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 2][j - nums[i - 1]] + 1);
            } else if (j >= nums[i - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][m];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 1, 4, 2, 5};
    int m = 8;
    cout << maxElementsWithSumM(nums, m) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## Time Complexity

### Time Complexity
- **Initial DP Table Setup**: O(n * m) where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is the target sum.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n * m)

### Space Complexity
- **Space Used by DP Table**: O(n * m)

This approach offers a balance between efficiency and clarity, ensuring all constraints are observed while maximizing the number of elements summed to `m`.
