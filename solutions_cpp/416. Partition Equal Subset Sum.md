[Leetcode 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l416)
## Problem Statement
Given a non-empty array `nums` containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal.

## Clarifying Questions
Before jumping into the solution, let's consider some clarifying questions that could help understand edge cases and constraints better:

1. Can the array contain zero?
   - No, the array contains only positive integers.

2. What is the range of the length of the array and the values within it?
   - Typical constraints for such problems are:
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
     - `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

3. Is there a specific time complexity requirement?
   - While not specified, an efficient solution is desirable. We'll aim for a pseudo-polynomial time complexity solution using dynamic programming.

## Strategy
To determine if the array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum:

1. **Total Sum Check**:
   - Calculate the total sum of the array elements. If this sum is odd, it's impossible to split it into two equal subsets.

2. **Target Sum for Each Subset**:
   - If the total sum is even, the target sum for each subset will be `total_sum / 2`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We'll use a 1D dynamic programming array (`dp`) where `dp[i]` will be `true` if a subset sum of `i` can be achieved with the elements processed so far.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `true` because a sum of `0` is always possible (with an empty subset).
   - Iterate through each number in the array and update the `dp` array from the end to the start to prevent using the same element multiple times.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canPartition(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int totalSum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        // If the total sum is odd, it can't be divided into two equal subsets
        if (totalSum % 2 != 0) return false;
        
        int target = totalSum / 2;
        std::vector<bool> dp(target + 1, false);
        
        // A subset sum of 0 is always possible with an empty subset
        dp[0] = true;
        
        for (const int& num : nums) {
            // Update dp array from end to start to avoid reusing the same element
            for (int i = target; i >= num; --i) {
                dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - num];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 5, 11, 5};
    bool canPartition = sol.canPartition(nums);
    std::cout << (canPartition ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;  // Output: True
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * target)
  - `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  - `target` is half of the total sum of the array.
  - For each element, we iterate over the target sum in the worst-case scenario.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(target)
  - We use a 1D array of size `target + 1` to store our DP states.

This solution efficiently checks the possibility of partitioning the array into two subsets with equal sums using dynamic programming.
