[Leetcode 973. K Closest Points to Origin](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l973)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., \( \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \)).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the coordinates xi and yi?
   - What is the maximum value of k?
   - Is there a limit on the number of points in the input array?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the points be returned in any specific order?
   - What should be returned if there are fewer than k points in the array?

3. **Special Cases:**
   - What should we do if multiple points are at the same distance from the origin?
   - Are negative coordinates possible?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a min-heap (priority queue) which allows us to efficiently keep track of the k closest points:

1. **Calculate Distances:**
   - Instead of computing the actual Euclidean distance, we can use the squared Euclidean distance to avoid unnecessary floating-point computations. The distance squared for a point \([x, y]\) is \( x^2 + y^2 \).

2. **Use a Min-Heap:**
   - We build a min-heap that keeps the k points with the smallest distances from the origin.

### Algorithm
1. Create a min-heap (priority queue) of size k.
2. Iterate through each point, calculate its squared distance from the origin.
3. Maintain the k points with the smallest distances:
   - If the heap size is less than k, push the point into the heap.
   - Otherwise, compare the current point's distance with the largest distance in the heap and replace if it is smaller.

### Time Complexity
- Building the heap will take \(O(n \log k)\) in the worst case, where n is the number of points and k is the size of the heap.
- This is efficient for small values of k relative to n.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        // Min-Heap to store distances and the corresponding points
        priority_queue<pair<int, vector<int>>> maxHeap;
        
        for (auto& point : points) {
            int x = point[0];
            int y = point[1];
            int dist = x*x + y*y; // Calculate squared distance
            
            if (maxHeap.size() < k) {
                maxHeap.push({dist, point});
            } else if (dist < maxHeap.top().first) {
                maxHeap.pop();
                maxHeap.push({dist, point});
            }
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            result.push_back(maxHeap.top().second);
            maxHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code
- We use a priority queue `maxHeap` to keep track of k points with the smallest distances.
- For each point, we calculate the squared distance from the origin.
- If the heap has less than k elements, we simply add the current point.
- If the heap is full and the current point's distance is smaller than the largest distance in the heap, we replace the largest one.
- Finally, extract elements from the heap into a result list.

This solution efficiently maintains the k closest points, giving the correct result with complexity manageable for typical input sizes.
