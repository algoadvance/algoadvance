[Leetcode 730. Count Different Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l730)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subsequence of a string is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Should the input string `s` be limited to lowercase English letters?
    - Is there a maximum length for the input string `s`?
   
2. **Output**:
    - Confirm that the output should be the count of different non-empty palindromic subsequences modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Once I have the clarified details, I'll outline the strategy and provide the code.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequences(std::string s) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = s.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));

        // Single character subsequences
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }
        
        // DP to count palindromic subsequences
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;

                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    int low = i + 1, high = j - 1;
                    // Find the limits to count unique subsequences
                    while (low <= high && s[low] != s[i]) ++low;
                    while (low <= high && s[high] != s[j]) --high;

                    if (low > high) {
                        dp[i][j] = (2 * dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2) % MOD;
                    } else if (low == high) {
                        dp[i][j] = (2 * dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 1) % MOD;
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = (2 * dp[i + 1][j - 1] - dp[low + 1][high - 1] + MOD) % MOD;
                    }
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i + 1][j - 1] + MOD) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Define `dp[i][j]` as the number of distinct palindromic subsequences within the substring `s[i...j]`.
    - If `s[i] == s[j]`, explore the inner substring `s[i+1...j-1]` for palindromic subsequences while avoiding double-counting.
    - If `s[i] != s[j]`, compute the result from the overlapping subsequences `s[i+1...j]` and `s[i...j-1]`.
    - Employ boundary checks to identify non-overlapping subsequences.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Each single character is a palindrome, hence initialize `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
    - Use nested loops, with `length` ranging from 2 to `n`, and `i` ranging from 0 to `n - length`.
    - For each substring `s[i...j]`, apply the described conditions and update the DP table.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
    - Since the result can be large, take results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) where `n` is the length of the input string `s`, due to the two nested loops filling up the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) for maintaining the DP table.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all different palindromic subsequences using a bottom-up dynamic programming method.
