[Leetcode 2121. Intervals Between Identical Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2121)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` of positive integers. The task is to create an array `res` such that for each `i`, `res[i]` is the sum of the distances between the index `i` and every other index `j` such that `arr[i] == arr[j]`.

In more precise terms, if `arr[i] == arr[j]` for `i != j`, then:

\[ res[i] = \sum \left| i - j \right| \; \text{for all} \; j \; \text{such that} \; arr[i] == arr[j] \]

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding with the implementation, let's clarify a few points:
1. **Are elements within the array guaranteed to be positive integers?** Yes.
2. **What should we do if `arr` contains unique elements?** The result for those indices will be `0`.
3. **Are there any constraints on the size of `arr`?** Typical constraints apply for LeetCode problems (e.g., 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5).

### Strategy

1. **Index Mapping:** First, we need to map each element to all of its indices. This can be done using a `unordered_map` where the key is the element and the value is a vector of indices where that element appears.
2. **Distance Calculation:** For each unique element, we iterate over all its indices, and calculate distances from each index to every other index where the element appears.
3. **Using Prefix Sums:** To optimize the calculation of distances, we can use prefix sums to compute the sum of distances in linear time.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<long long> getDistances(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> indexMap;
    int n = arr.size();
    
    // Step 1: Create a mapping from element to its indices.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        indexMap[arr[i]].push_back(i);
    }
    
    std::vector<long long> res(n, 0);
    
    // Step 2: Calculate distances.
    for (auto& pair : indexMap) {
        std::vector<int>& indices = pair.second;
        int m = indices.size();
        
        if (m == 1) {
            continue; // No need to process unique elements.
        }
        
        std::vector<long long> prefixSum(m, 0);
        std::partial_sum(indices.begin(), indices.end(), prefixSum.begin());
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int idx = indices[i];
            long long leftSum = i > 0 ? prefixSum[i-1] : 0;
            long long rightSum = prefixSum[m-1] - prefixSum[i];
            
            res[idx] = (i * (long long)idx - leftSum) + (rightSum - (m - i - 1) * (long long)idx);
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is primarily determined by the following steps:
1. **Mapping Elements to Indices:** This takes \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of the array.
2. **Calculating Prefix Sums:** For each unique element, we create prefix sums which in the worst case still add up to \(O(n)\).
3. **Computing Distances:** For each unique element, the distance computation based on prefix sums is linear concerning the number of indices for that element, summing again to \(O(n)\) over all elements.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\). This is efficient and suitable for the given problem constraints.
