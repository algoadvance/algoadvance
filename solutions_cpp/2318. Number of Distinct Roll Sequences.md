[Leetcode 2318. Number of Distinct Roll Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2318)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. You need to return the number of distinct sequences of length `n` that can be formed using a six-sided die. The conditions are:

1. Each sequence should be valid based on the following rules:
   - A number cannot be placed consecutively next to the same number.
   - If a `1` is placed before a `2`, `3`, or `4` in the sequence, there must be a `5` or `6` immediately after.
   - If a `5` or `6` is placed before a `1`, `2`, or `3` in the sequence, there must be a `4` immediately after.
  
Given these rules, compute the number of distinct sequences using dynamic programming.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Assume constraints typically range from 1 to 5000 based on the problem size.
   
2. **Is a solution required in O(n) or is O(n^2) acceptable?**
   - Typically, an O(n) solution would be preferred due to the larger constraints but confirming would be helpful.

3. **How should the distinct sequences be computed?**
   - Dynamic programming seems like a feasible approach where we store the number of valid sequences ending in each possible last element to avoid repeated calculations.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 3-dimensional DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents sequence length, `j` the last number of the sequence, and `k` the second last number.
   - Initialize base cases for sequences of length 1.
   - Use nested loops to build up the DP table by adding valid sequences to the end.
   - Respect the constraints for sequence formation outlined in the problem.
   - Sum the sequences of length `n`.

2. **Transitions:**
   - For each possible previous number and current number, ensure the conditions are met before updating the DP array.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

using namespace std;

int distinctSequences(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 6;

    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n+1, vector<vector<int>>(7, vector<int>(7, 0)));

    for (int i = 1; i <= 6; ++i)
        dp[1][i][0] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k <= 6; ++k) {
                if (j == k) continue;
                for (int l = 1; l <= 6; ++l) {
                    if (l == j) continue;
                    if ((j == 1 && (l == 2 || l == 3 || l == 4)) || (j == 2 && (l == 1 || l == 5 || l == 6)) 
                        || (j == 3 && (l == 1 || l == 5 || l == 6)) || (j == 4 && (l == 1 || l == 5 || l == 6)) 
                        || (j == 5 && (l == 1 || l == 2 || l == 3)) || (j == 6 && (l == 1 || l == 2 || l == 3))) {
                        dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i-1][k][l]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int result = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
        for (int k = 0; k <= 6; ++k) {
            result = (result + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3;
    cout << distinctSequences(n) << endl; // Example output
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n * 6 * 6 * 6), which simplifies to O(n) since `6^3` is a constant.
- The space complexity is also O(n * 6 * 6), which is manageable within the typical constraints.

By ensuring that the transitions respect the stated conditions, the DP table is appropriately filled, yielding the correct number of distinct sequences of length `n`.
