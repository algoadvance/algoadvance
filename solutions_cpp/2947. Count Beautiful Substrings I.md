[Leetcode 2947. Count Beautiful Substrings I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2947)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters. A substring is called beautiful if it contains at least one vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). Your task is to count the number of beautiful substrings in the string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - No, the input string `s` will have at least one character.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - Assume reasonable constraints, typical for problems like this, such as up to 10^5.

3. **Are overlapping substrings counted separately?**
   - Yes, each instance of a substring that matches the criterion counts as a separate beautiful substring.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Vowels:**
   - First, we need to identify the positions of the vowels in the string.
   
2. **Counting Beautiful Substrings:**
   - Use the concept of combinatorics where if a vowel exists at index `i`, then:
     - All substrings starting from 0 to `i` and ending at `i` contain that vowel.
     - All substrings starting from `i` to the end of the string also contain that vowel.
   
3. **Efficient Approach:**
   - We can iterate through the string. For each position `i` that contains a vowel:
     - All substrings that start from any position `0` to `i` and end at `i` or later are beautiful.
     - Similarly, substrings starting from `i` for the rest of the string are beautiful.
   - This means we can use the position of each vowel to determine how many substrings are formed and increase our count accordingly.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countBeautifulSubstrings(string s) {
        unordered_set<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
        int n = s.size();
        int beautifulSubstringCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (vowels.count(s[i]) > 0) {
                // If s[i] is a vowel, count the number of beautiful substrings
                // starting from 0 to i and from i to the end of the string.
                beautifulSubstringCount += (i + 1) * (n - i);
            }
        }
        
        return beautifulSubstringCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string str = "leetcode";
    cout << "Number of beautiful substrings: " << solution.countBeautifulSubstrings(str) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Vowel Identification:** To check if a character is a vowel, we use an `unordered_set` to store vowel characters.
- **Iteration:** We iterate through the string. For each character, if it is a vowel, it contributes to multiple substrings being beautiful.
- **Counting Substrings:** For each vowel at position `i`, there are `i + 1` substrings ending at or before `i` and `n - i` substrings starting from or after `i`.
- **Summation:** We sum up these contributions to get the total count of beautiful substrings.
  
### Time Complexity
- **O(N):** The solution iterates through the string once, making it linear in terms of the string's length \(N\). Checking if a character is in the set of vowels is an O(1) operation due to the usage of an `unordered_set`.
