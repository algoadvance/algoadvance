[Leetcode 2028. Find Missing Observations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2028)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `rolls` representing the results of rolling a fair 6-sided dice `n` times, where `rolls[i]` is the result of the `i`th roll. You are also given two integers `mean` and `n` representing the mean value of the rolls. You need to roll the dice `m` more times so that the new mean of all the rolls (including the `m` rolls) equals the given `mean`.

Return an array of length `m` whose elements are the results of the `m` rolls. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints for `n`, `m`, and `mean`?**
    - Constraints help to understand the sizes of variables and if our solution will fit in the time limits.
```
Constraints:
    - `rolls.length == n`
    - `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`
    - `1 <= rolls[i], mean <= 6`
```
2. **Can the computed results be non-integer?**
    - No, because we're dealing with dice rolls which always produce integer results between 1 and 6.
3. **If no valid solution exists, should we return an empty array?**
    - Yes.

## Strategy

The basic strategy for this problem involves:
1. Calculating the total sum we need from all the rolls: `total_sum = (n + m) * mean`
2. Calculating the sum of the current rolls: `current_sum = sum(rolls)`
3. Determining the sum needed from the additional `m` rolls: `required_sum = total_sum - current_sum`
4. Checking feasibility:
   - If `required_sum` is in the range `[m, 6*m]` (since each roll must be an integer between 1 and 6).
5. Distributing the `required_sum` across `m` rolls:
   - Ideally, spread as evenly as possible.
   - A greedy approach can be taken to allocate values between 1 and 6 to ensure the sum meets the required value.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<int> missingRolls(std::vector<int>& rolls, int mean, int m) {
    int n = rolls.size();
    int total_sum = (n + m) * mean;
    int current_sum = std::accumulate(rolls.begin(), rolls.end(), 0);
    int required_sum = total_sum - current_sum;

    // Check if the required sum is in a feasible range.
    if (required_sum < m || required_sum > 6 * m) {
        return {};
    }

    std::vector<int> result(m, 1); // Start with the minimum roll value.
    required_sum -= m; // Adjust because we already allocated 1 to each roll.

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int add_val = std::min(required_sum, 5); // Determine what can be added.
        result[i] += add_val;
        required_sum -= add_val;

        if (required_sum == 0) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> rolls = {3, 2, 4, 3};
    int mean = 4, m = 2;
    std::vector<int> result = missingRolls(rolls, mean, m);
    for (int val : result) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The solution has a time complexity of:
- `O(n)` to calculate the current sum of rolls.
- `O(m)` to distribute the required sum among `m` rolls.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`.

The space complexity is `O(m)` for storing the results of the `m` rolls.
