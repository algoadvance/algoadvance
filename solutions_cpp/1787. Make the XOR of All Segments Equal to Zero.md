[Leetcode 1787. Make the XOR of All Segments Equal to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1787)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` consisting of integers and an integer `k`. You are asked to divide the array into several subarrays (possibly of different lengths) such that the XOR of all the elements in each subarray is 0. You have to minimize the number of subarrays. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array have negative numbers?**
   - Generally, XOR operations consider non-negative numbers, but we should confirm this to be sure.
   
2. **What constraints apply to the length of `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - Knowing the constraints would help in determining the most efficient solution approach.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to utilize dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be the minimum number of subarrays up to the i-th index such that the XOR of all elements in each subarray is 0.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize DP array**: 
   - `dp[0] = 0` because no elements mean no subarrays.
   - For others, initialize large values representing the worst-case scenario.
   
2. **Compute prefix XORs**:
   - Compute the XOR for every subarray starting from the beginning of the array and store them.
   - Use these to determine whether the subarray from start to current index can form a subarray with XOR 0.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each element `i`, check all possible subarrays ending at `i`.
   - If the XOR is 0, update `dp[i]` considering the best possible partitioning at previous points.

4. **Efficiency considerations**:
   - Use a hash map to store the most recent indices of previous XOR results to quickly find valid subarray bounds.

### Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSubarraysWithZeroXOR(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX); // DP array to store the minimum number of subarrays
    dp[0] = 0; // With 0 elements, we need 0 subarrays
    
    unordered_map<int, int> prefixXorIndex;
    prefixXorIndex[0] = 0; // Base case for prefix XOR
    
    int currentXor = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        currentXor ^= nums[i - 1];
        
        if (prefixXorIndex.find(currentXor) != prefixXorIndex.end()) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[prefixXorIndex[currentXor]] + 1);
        }

        prefixXorIndex[currentXor] = i;
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) 
  - The algorithm processes each element a constant number of times.
  - Prefix XOR calculations are efficient using a hash map.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - The space is used to store the `dp` array and the hash map for prefix XOR indices.

This approach ensures an optimal solution with a linear time complexity relative to the size of the input array.
