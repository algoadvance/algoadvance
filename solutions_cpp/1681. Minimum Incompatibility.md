[Leetcode 1681. Minimum Incompatibility](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1681)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The array contains `n` * `k` integers where `n` is the size of each group. Divide the array into `k` groups of size `n` such that the incompatibility of the groups is minimized.

The incompatibility of a group is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum elements in the group. The incompatibility of the array is the sum of the incompatibility of the groups.

Return the minimum possible incompatibility sum of the groups, or -1 if it's not possible to divide the array as described.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,4], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal grouping is [1,2] and [1,4], with incompatibility 1 and 3, respectively. So the sum is 1 + 3 = 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the elements in `nums` be negative, or are they strictly non-negative integers?
2. Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?
3. Will `nums` always have `n * k` elements to ensure groups can be created without leftovers?
4. Is the input guaranteed to be within a certain range for `nums` and `k`?

## Strategy
1. **Distribution Check**: First, check if the distribution of elements allows forming groups of size `n`. If not, return -1 immediately.
2. **Dynamic Programming & Subset Combination**: Use dynamic programming with bitmasking to explore different subsets and calculate incompatibility.
3. **Grouping**: Iterate through possible combinations of groups and calculate the potential incompatibility score, keeping track of the minimum.

For this approach:
- Use Bitmask Dynamic Programming to represent groups and check compatibility.
- Sort the `nums` array to facilitate easier range calculation within groups.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumIncompatibility(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = n / k;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Create a map to store smallest incompatible sum for any bitmask
        unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
            // Count the number of 1s in the mask
            int count = __builtin_popcount(mask);
            
            // if current mask doesn't contain `m` elements, skip
            if (count % m != 0) continue;
            
            // partition is the previous subset sum's value
            int partition = dp[mask & ~(1 << (__builtin_ffs(mask) - 1))];
            
            // Try all subsets with size `m`
            for (int subMask = mask; subMask; subMask = (subMask - 1) & mask) {
                if (__builtin_popcount(subMask) != m) continue;
                
                // Check if valid subset (elements should be distinct)
                bool valid = true;
                unordered_map<int, int> seen;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (subMask & (1 << i)) {
                        if (++seen[nums[i]] > 1) {
                            valid = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                if (!valid) continue;
                
                int minNum = INT_MAX, maxNum = INT_MIN;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (subMask & (1 << i)) {
                        minNum = min(minNum, nums[i]);
                        maxNum = max(maxNum, nums[i]);
                    }
                }
                
                int currPartition = partition + (maxNum - minNum);
                int nextMask = mask ^ subMask;
                if (dp.find(nextMask) == dp.end() || dp[nextMask] > currPartition) {
                    dp[nextMask] = currPartition;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0] == 0 ? -1 : dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O((2^n) * n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is due to the fact that we are using a bitmask to represent subsets and iterating over combinations and submasks. The space complexity is also `O(2^n)` to store the DP values in the hash map.
