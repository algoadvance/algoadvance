[Leetcode 1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1941)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to determine if all characters in the string have the same number of occurrences.

Return `true` if all characters have the same frequency, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string be empty?
   - No, the problem implies the string will have at least one character.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the string?
   - The string can be of length up to \(10^4\) as per typical Leetcode constraints.
3. Are there any special characters or only lowercase English letters?
   - The string consists of only lowercase English letters.
4. Should the solution handle case sensitivity?
   - No, the problem specifies lowercase English letters only.

## Strategy

1. **Count the Frequency**:
   - Use a hashmap (or a fixed-size array for 26 lowercase letters) to track the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Check Frequency Equality**:
   - After counting, we need to check if all values in the frequency map/array are the same.
3. **Return the Result**:
   - If all frequencies are equal, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

bool areOccurrencesEqual(std::string s) {
    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    std::unordered_map<char, int> frequency;
    for (char c : s) {
        frequency[c]++;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Check if all characters have the same frequency
    std::unordered_set<int> uniqueFrequencies;
    for (const auto& pair : frequency) {
        uniqueFrequencies.insert(pair.second);
    }
    
    // If there is exactly one unique frequency, return true
    return uniqueFrequencies.size() == 1;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abacbc";
    if (areOccurrencesEqual(s)) {
        std::cout << "True" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "False" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The solution involves two main steps:
1. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - This step involves iterating through the string once, giving it a time complexity of \(O(n)\).
2. **Checking Frequencies**:
   - This step involves iterating through the map which in the worst case has 26 entries (one for each lowercase letter), giving it a time complexity of \(O(1)\).

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the fixed set of lowercase letters.
