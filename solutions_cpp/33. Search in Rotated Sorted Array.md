[Leetcode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l33)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), and an integer `target`. Suppose that `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

You should search for `target` in `nums` and if you find it, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` be empty?
   - Yes, and if it is empty, the function should return `-1`.
2. Are there any constraints on the array `nums`?
   - Yes, `nums` will contain distinct integers and will be rotated at some pivot.
3. What should be returned if the target is not found?
   - Return `-1`.

## Strategy

We can utilize a modified binary search to achieve the `O(log n)` runtime complexity. The key insight is to determine which part of the array is normally ordered, and then decide whether the `target` lies within that range or in the other part.

1. Set `low` to `0` and `high` to `nums.size() - 1`.
2. While `low` <= `high`:
   1. Calculate `mid` as the middle index of `low` and `high`.
   2. Check if `nums[mid]` equals the `target`. If it does, return `mid`.
   3. Determine which side of the array is normally ordered:
       - If `nums[low]` <= `nums[mid]`, the left side is normally ordered:
          - Check if the target is between `nums[low]` and `nums[mid]`. If it is, narrow the search to the left by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
          - Otherwise, search the right side by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
       - Otherwise, the right side is normally ordered:
          - Check if the target is between `nums[mid]` and `nums[high]`. If it is, narrow the search to the right by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
          - Otherwise, search the left side by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
3. If the loop ends without finding the target, return `-1`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        if (nums.empty()) return -1;

        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }

            if (nums[low] <= nums[mid]) {
                // Left side is normally ordered
                if (nums[low] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                // Right side is normally ordered
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time because each iteration of the while loop narrows the search range by half.
- Space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
