[Leetcode 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l28)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

### Example:
- **Input:** `haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"`
- **Output:** `0`

- **Input:** `haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"`
- **Output:** `-1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity:** Are the comparisons case-sensitive?
   - **Yes**, the comparison of characters should be case-sensitive.
2. **Empty String:** What should be the return value if the `needle` is an empty string?
   - **Conventionally**, if `needle` is an empty string, return `0` because it's always found at the start.
3. **Needle Larger than Haystack:** What should be the return value if `needle` is larger than `haystack`?
   - **Return `-1`**, since the `needle` cannot be found inside a smaller `haystack`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to employ the classic string search algorithm. One of the simplest approaches is to use a sliding window technique to iterate over `haystack`.

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `n` for the length of `haystack`.
   - `m` for the length of `needle`.
2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `needle` is empty, return `0`.
   - If `needle` is longer than `haystack`, return `-1`.
3. **Sliding Window:**
   - Iterate through `haystack` such that the window size is always equal to the length of `needle`.
   - Compare the substring of `haystack` with `needle`.
   - If they match, return the starting index of the window.
4. **Return `-1` if no match is found by the end of iterations.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int strStr(const std::string& haystack, const std::string& needle) {
    int n = haystack.length();
    int m = needle.length();
    
    if (m == 0) {
        return 0; // Needle is an empty string.
    }
    
    if (m > n) {
        return -1; // Needle is larger than haystack.
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; i++) {
        if (haystack.substr(i, m) == needle) {
            return i; // Found the needle at index i.
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // Needle not found in haystack.
}

int main() {
    std::string haystack = "hello";
    std::string needle = "ll";
    std::cout << strStr(haystack, needle) << std::endl; // Output: 2
    
    haystack = "aaaaa";
    needle = "bba";
    std::cout << strStr(haystack, needle) << std::endl; // Output: -1
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n*m), where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`. This is due to the substring comparison at each possible starting point.
  - In the worst case, we can iterate up to `n - m + 1` starting points, and substring comparison at each point takes O(m) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for additional variable storage (not considering the input strings).

This solution works well for small to moderately sized input strings but may not be efficient for very large strings. For large inputs, more advanced string search algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) could be used to improve performance.
