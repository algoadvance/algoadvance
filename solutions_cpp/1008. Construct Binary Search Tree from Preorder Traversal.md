[Leetcode 1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1008)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `preorder`, which represents the preorder traversal of a binary search tree (BST), construct the BST and return its root.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start solving the problem, let's clarify a few points:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can the `preorder` array be empty?
   - What is the maximum length of the `preorder` array?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return just the root node, or is there any specific format for the output?
   
Assuming the following based on typical constraints:
- `preorder` is a valid preorder traversal of a BST.
- The BST should be constructed optimally.

### Strategy

1. **Preorder traversal characteristics**:
   - The first element is always the root of the tree.
   - For the subsequent elements, elements less than the root form the left subtree and elements greater than the root form the right subtree.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Use a stack to construct the tree iteratively.
   - Start by pushing the root node (first element of preorder) to the stack.
   - Iterate over the rest of the elements, and adjust the tree based on whether each element is greater or less than the node at the top of the stack.
   - If the current element is less than the stack's top node, it belongs to the left subtree.
   - If the current element is greater, it belongs to the right subtree of the stack's top node or subsequent potential parents.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation using the iterative approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(std::vector<int>& preorder) {
        if (preorder.empty()) return nullptr;
        
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(preorder[0]);
        std::stack<TreeNode*> nodeStack;
        nodeStack.push(root);
        
        for (size_t i = 1; i < preorder.size(); ++i) {
            TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(preorder[i]);
            TreeNode* temp = nullptr;
            
            // Adjust the stack, to consider the latest parent node for the current value
            while (!nodeStack.empty() && preorder[i] > nodeStack.top()->val) {
                temp = nodeStack.top();
                nodeStack.pop();
            }
            
            // If temp exists, it means preorder[i] is greater and belongs to the right subtree
            if (temp) {
                temp->right = node;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, it should be the left child
                nodeStack.top()->left = node;
            }
            
            nodeStack.push(node);
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the `preorder` array since each element is processed once.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** because of the space needed to store the nodes in the stack in the worst case (when the tree is completely unbalanced).
