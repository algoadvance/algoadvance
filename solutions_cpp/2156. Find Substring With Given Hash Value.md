[Leetcode 2156. Find Substring With Given Hash Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2156)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and two integers, `p` and `m`. You are also given a target hash value `h`.

The hash of a substring `s[l:r]` is computed using the polynomial rolling hash formula:
\[ \text{hash}(s[l:r]) = (s[l] + s[l+1] \cdot p + s[l+2] \cdot p^2 + \ldots + s[r-1] \cdot p^{r-l-1}) \mod m \]

Find and return the first (leftmost) substring of `s` with length `r - l` that produces the given hash value `h`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there any guarantee about the existence of such a substring?**
   - We assume there's always a valid substring, otherwise, an empty string shall be returned.
   
2. **What are the allowed ranges for `p` and `m`, and string `s`?**
   - Typically, \( p \) and \( m \) are large primes, and the string `s` could be of moderate length, up to \( 10^5 \) characters.

3. **Does the string consist of only alphabetic characters?**
   - If not specified, we assume it to be alphanumeric or consist of ASCII characters.

### Strategy
1. **Implementing Polynomial Rolling Hash:**
   - We will calculate the hash for a fixed-size substring (window) starting from the end of the string towards the beginning. 
   - This hashing strategy uses modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and ensure uniqueness.

2. **Rolling Hash Technique:**
   - By precomputing powers of `p` and using previous hash values to compute the current hash in O(1) time, we minimize redundant computations.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - Use a sliding window of fixed size to move from the end of the string towards the left and compute the hash recursively.

### Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

std::string findSubstringWithGivenHash(const std::string& s, int p, int m, int h, int length) {
    int n = s.size();
    if (length > n) {
        return "";
    }
    
    long long currentHash = 0;
    long long power_p = 1;
    
    // Calculate initial hash for the last `length` characters and the power of p
    for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        currentHash = (currentHash + s[n - length + i] * power_p) % m;
        if (i < length - 1) {
            power_p = (power_p * p) % m;
        }
    }
    
    // Check if the initial hash matches the target hash
    if (currentHash == h) {
        return s.substr(n - length, length);
    }
    
    // Slide window from the end towards the start
    for (int i = n - length - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        currentHash = ((currentHash - s[i + length] * power_p % m + m) % m * p % m + s[i]) % m;
        if (currentHash == h) {
            return s.substr(i, length);
        }
    }

    return "";
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "leetcode";
    int p = 31;
    int m = 1000000007;
    int h = 632;
    int length = 4;
    
    std::string result = findSubstringWithGivenHash(s, p, m, h, length);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Precomputation and Initial Hash Calculation:** O(length)
- **Sliding Window and Rehash Calculation:** O(n - length)

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), making it efficient for large strings within practical limits.

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty String:** Return an empty string if `s` is empty.
2. **Length Greater Than `s`:** Verify if length exceeds `s.length()` and handle gracefully.
3. **Negative Hash Values:** Ensure all hash values are non-negative by using modular addition.
