[Leetcode 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1539)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th missing positive number.

### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 1000`
- `arr[i] < arr[j]` for `1 <= i < j <= arr.length`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are there any gaps between consecutive elements of the array?**
   A: Yes, the numbers in the array increase strictly, so there can be gaps.

2. **Q: What is the expected return value if k is out of the bounds of the missing sequence?**
   A: The constraints guarantee that k is always a valid positive integer, so it will be within the bounds of the missing positive numbers.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define a counter `missing_count` to track the number of missing positive numbers found so far.
   - Use a variable `current` to track the current positive integer being checked.
   - Use an index `i` to iterate through the elements of the array.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate from the smallest positive integer 1 upwards.
   - If the current integer is in the array (i.e., `arr[i] == current`), move to the next element in the array by incrementing `i`.
   - If the current integer is not in the array, increment the `missing_count`.
   - When `missing_count` is equal to `k`, the current integer is the k-th missing positive number.

3. **Termination**:
   - Return the current number when the `missing_count` reaches `k`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int findKthPositive(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int missing_count = 0;
    int current = 1;
    int i = 0;
    
    while (true) {
        // If current number is in the array, move to the next element in the array
        if (i < arr.size() && arr[i] == current) {
            i++;
        } else {
            // If current number is missing, increment the missing count
            missing_count++;
            // If missing count reaches k, return the current number
            if (missing_count == k) {
                return current;
            }
        }
        // Move to the next number
        current++;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {2, 3, 4, 7, 11};
    int k1 = 5;
    std::cout << "The 5th missing positive number is: " << findKthPositive(arr1, k1) << std::endl;

    std::vector<int> arr2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k2 = 2;
    std::cout << "The 2nd missing positive number is: " << findKthPositive(arr2, k2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + k)** where `n` is the length of the array. This is because in the worst case, we might need to iterate through all elements of the array and all missing numbers up to `k`. However, due to the constraints provided (1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000), this time complexity is acceptable. 

In practice, the number of required operations will often be considerably less since we quickly skip over existing array elements.
