[Leetcode 419. Battleships in a Board](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l419)
## Problem Statement
You are given an m x n board `board` where each cell is a battleship 'X' or empty '.'. Return the number of the battleships on board.

Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on the board. In other words, they can only be placed in the following shapes:
- Horizontal: `XXX`
- Vertical: 
  ```
  X
  X
  X
  ```

Battleships should not be placed adjacent to each other, meaning no two battleships will share a side.

### Example
1. Input: 
   ```
   board = [
     ["X", ".", ".", "X"],
     [".", ".", ".", "X"],
     [".", ".", ".", "X"]
   ]
   ```
   Output: 2

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed that there will be no invalid input (e.g., 'X's placed adjacently)?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees no two battleships will share a side.
   
2. **Can battleships be placed diagonally?**
   - No, battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically.

3. **What is the maximum size of the board?**
   - The maximum size of the board will be constrained by typical problem constraints (e.g., \( m, n \le 200 \)).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        if (board.empty() || board[0].empty()) return 0;
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'X') {
                    if (i > 0 && board[i-1][j] == 'X') continue;
                    if (j > 0 && board[i][j-1] == 'X') continue;
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Strategy
1. **Traversal:** Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Counting Condition:** Increment the count of battleships only if the current cell is 'X' and it is not a continuation of a battleship from the top or left. This ensures that we only count the first cell in a horizontal or vertical battleship sequence.
3. **Skip Continuations:** Skip counting further cells in the same battleship.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(m \times n) \), where \( m \) is the number of rows and \( n \) is the number of columns. We traverse each cell of the board exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), as we are only using a few additional variables for counting and indexing. No extra space proportional to input size is needed.
