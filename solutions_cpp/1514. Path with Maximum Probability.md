[Leetcode 1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1514)
### Problem Statement

You're given an undirected, weighted graph represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` in the graph. You are also given an array `succProb`, where `succProb[i]` is the success probability of the edge `edges[i]`. 

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to travel from `start` to `end` and return the probability. If there is no path from `start` to `end`, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph characteristics**:
    - Can the input graph have cycles? Yes, it can.
    - Are the node indices always valid (within bounds)? Yes.

2. **Probability values**:
    - Are the probabilities in `succProb` between 0 and 1? Yes.

3. **Node types**:
    - Are there any constraints on the number of nodes? We assume typical constraints for competitive programming, where number of nodes and edges are manageable within reasonable computational limits.

### Strategy

#### Approach

1. **Graph Representation**:
    - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
    
2. **Priority Queue**:
    - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always expand the path with the highest probability first.

3. **Probability Storage**:
    - Use a vector to store the maximum probability to reach each node.

4. **Algorithm**:
    - Use a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the path with the maximum probability.

5. **Heuristics**:
    - Start from the node `start` and use the priority queue to explore nodes in decreasing order of their probabilities.
    - For each node, update the probabilities of its neighbors if a higher probability path is found.

### Time Complexity

- Building the graph: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- Priority Queue operations: O((V + E) * log V), where V is the number of vertices.
- Overall: O(E * log V).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

double maxProbability(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<double>& succProb, int start, int end) {
    // Step 1: Build the graph
    vector<vector<pair<int, double>>> graph(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
        int u = edges[i][0];
        int b = edges[i][1];
        double prob = succProb[i];
        graph[u].emplace_back(b, prob);
        graph[b].emplace_back(u, prob);
    }

    // Step 2: Use max-heap to store the maximum probability to reach each node
    priority_queue<pair<double, int>> pq; // {probability, node}
    pq.emplace(1.0, start);
    
    // Step 3: Maximum probability array
    vector<double> maxProb(n, 0.0);
    maxProb[start] = 1.0;

    // Step 4: Process the graph using Dijkstra-like algorithm
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [currProb, node] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if (node == end) {
            return currProb; // If we reached destination, output the probability
        }
        
        for (auto& [neighbor, edgeProb] : graph[node]) {
            double newProb = currProb * edgeProb;
            if (newProb > maxProb[neighbor]) {
                maxProb[neighbor] = newProb;
                pq.emplace(newProb, neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    return 0.0; // If the end is not reachable, return 0
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Building**:
    - Construct the adjacency list with weights representing probabilities.

2. **Priority Queue**:
    - Use a max-heap to always select the most probable path.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
    - Expand the most probable node, continuously updating the best known probability to reach each neighboring node.

4. **Termination**:
    - Return the probability as soon as the destination node `end` is popped from the heap.
    - If the heap is exhausted without reaching `end`, return `0`.

By following this efficient strategy, we can ensure finding the maximum probability path from `start` to `end` while managing computational resources effectively.
