[Leetcode 1879. Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1879)
### Problem Statement
The problem is defined as follows:

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`, the task is to return the minimum possible sum of `x1 XOR y1 + x2 XOR y2 + ... + xn XOR yn`, where `xi` comes from `nums1` and `yi` comes from `nums2`, and each element in `nums1` is paired with exactly one element in `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` guaranteed to be of the same length, and what is the value range of `n`?**
   - Yes, both arrays are guaranteed to be of the same length, `n`, which can range from 1 to 14.
   
2. **What is the typical range of values within the arrays?**
   - Element values in the arrays can range from 0 to 1000.

3. **Can we expect negative values in the arrays?**
   - No, all given values will be non-negative integers (since they are within the range 0 to 1000).

### Strategy
Given the constraints, a brute-force solution may not be feasible because it would involve computing potential combinations, which would be `n!` in complexity.

Instead, we can use a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach with bitmasking to efficiently compute the answer. Here is how we can approach the problem:

1. **State Representation:**
   - Use `dp[mask]` where `mask` is a bitmask of length `n`.
   - `dp[mask]` represents the minimum XOR sum for using the subset represented by `mask`.

2. **State Transition:**
   - Iterate through all possible states (bitmasks).
   - For each state, calculate the cost of adding a new pair.

3. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0] = 0` (no elements paired, no cost).

4. **DP Transition:**
   - For each `mask`, count the number of bits set (`count`) which tells how many pairs you have formed so far.
   - Iterate over all possible pairs to calculate the minimum XOR sum.

### Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s a C++ implementation using DP and bitmasking:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumXORSum(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        vector<int> dp(1 << n, INT_MAX); // Initialize dp array with large values
        dp[0] = 0; // Base case: no elements paired

        // Iterate over all possible subsets
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
            int x = __builtin_popcount(mask); // Number of elements paired so far, equivalent to row index in nums1

            // Iterate over all possible pairs
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                // Check if j-th element is part of the current subset
                if (!(mask & (1 << j))) {
                    // Calculate new mask with j-th element included
                    int newMask = mask | (1 << j);
                    dp[newMask] = min(dp[newMask], dp[mask] + (nums1[x] ^ nums2[j]));
                }
            }
        }

        // Answer is the minimum XOR sum for all elements paired
        return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Space Complexity:** O(2^n) for the `dp` array.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * 2^n).
  - We process each subset of `nums1` (2^n subsets) and for each subset, we iterate over `n` possible pairs.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum XOR sum while managing constraints with bitwise operations and dynamic programming.
