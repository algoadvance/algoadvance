[Leetcode 3099. Harshad Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3099)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `x`, determine whether it is a Harshad number (also known as a Niven number). A Harshad number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. Implement a function in C++ that returns `true` if the given number `x` is a Harshad number, and `false` otherwise.

Example:
- Input: `18`
- Output: `true`
  - Explanation: `18` is a Harshad number because the sum of its digits is `1 + 8 = 9`, and `18` is divisible by `9`.

- Input: `19`
- Output: `false`
  - Explanation: `19` is not a Harshad number because the sum of its digits is `1 + 9 = 10`, and `19` is not divisible by `10`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input**: Is there a specific range for the input integer `x`?
   - **Assumption**: The integer `x` will be positive and within the typical range for standard integer operations in C++.

2. **Output Format**: Should the function return a boolean value or a string (`"true"` or `"false"`)?
   - **Assumption**: The function should return a boolean value.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Sum of Digits**: Extract each digit of the given integer `x` and compute the sum of its digits.
2. **Check Divisibility**: Check if `x` is divisible by the sum of its digits.
3. **Return Result**: Return `true` if `x` is divisible by the sum of its digits, otherwise return `false`.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool isHarshadNumber(int x) {
    int sumOfDigits = 0;
    int originalNumber = x;
    
    // Calculate sum of digits
    while (x > 0) {
        sumOfDigits += x % 10;
        x /= 10;
    }
    
    // Check if the number is divisible by the sum of its digits
    return (originalNumber % sumOfDigits == 0);
}

int main() {
    int number = 18;
    std::cout << (isHarshadNumber(number) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    number = 19;
    std::cout << (isHarshadNumber(number) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The main computation involves extracting the digits of the number `x`, which takes `O(log10(x))` time because we are repeatedly dividing the number by `10`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.

This code efficiently determines whether a given number is a Harshad number by leveraging basic arithmetic operations and digit extraction.
