[Leetcode 1013. Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1013)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr`, determine if it's possible to partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

### Example
```cpp
Input: arr = [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as follows:
[0, 2, 1], [-6, 6, -7, 9], [1, 2, 0, 1], which gives three parts with equal sums of 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative elements.
2. **What is the allowable range of the array length?**
   - The length of the array could vary significantly. Typical constraints go anywhere from having a few elements up to thousands of elements.
3. **Is there a constraint on the values of the integers within the array?**
   - Typically, values might be constrained to fit within standard integer sizes, but it is safe to check for typical integer constraints, like `-10^4` to `10^4`.

### Strategy
Here is the step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum**: First, we find the total sum of the array. If the total sum is not divisible by 3, it's impossible to partition the array as required.
2. **Set Target Sum for Each Part**: If the total sum is divisible by 3, each part must have a sum equal to `total_sum / 3`.
3. **Iterate and Sum Segments**: Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum. Count the segments where the running sum equals the target partition sum. We need to find exactly 3 such segments.
4. **Check for Valid Partitioning**: Ensure we have found exactly three segments that equal the target partition sum.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::accumulate

bool canThreePartsEqualSum(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int totalSum = std::accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);
    
    // If the total sum is not divisible by 3, it is not possible to partition into 3 parts with equal sum.
    if (totalSum % 3 != 0) return false;
    
    int targetSum = totalSum / 3;
    int currentSum = 0, count = 0;
    
    for (int num : arr) {
        currentSum += num;
        // When sum reaches the target, reset it and increase the count of partitions found
        if (currentSum == targetSum) {
            count++;
            currentSum = 0;
        }
    }
    
    // We need exactly three partitions
    return count >= 3;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We iterate through the array once to calculate the total sum, and again to find the partitions. Both operations are linear with respect to the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use a few extra variables for counting and summing, but the primary storage used is the input array itself with no additional complex data structures.
