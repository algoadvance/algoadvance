[Leetcode 3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3102)
Sure, let's go through the process step-by-step for solving the problem "Minimize Manhattan Distances-out" from LeetCode (problem 3102) using C++.

### Problem Statement

This problem is not directly available on LeetCode's public repository. However, it can be inferred from the title that it's likely about minimizing pairs' Manhattan distances in some form of optimization problem.

Below is an inferred problem statement:

You are given a set of pairs, each represented as points \((x_i, y_i)\) on a 2D grid. The task is to find two subsets of these pairs such that the sum of Manhattan distances between the points in the two subsets is minimized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum number of points?
   - Are the coordinates of the points positive integers, negative, or both?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Do we need to return the minimized distance or just print it?
   - If the subset can be of different sizes, does that affect the solution?

Assuming some inferred inputs and outputs:

### Input:
- An integer \(n\) representing the number of points.
- An array of \(n\) pairs of integers, each representing a point \((x_i, y_i)\).

### Output:
- A single integer representing the minimized Manhattan distance.

### Strategy

To minimize the Manhattan distances, the median of the points could serve as an optimal partitioning line, as Manhattan distances are minimized when points arrayed around medians.

### Steps:
1. Gather all \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) coordinates.
2. Find the median of these coordinates.
3. Compute the total Manhattan distance to this median to find the minimized Manhattan distance.

### Code

Here is a draft of the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to find the median of a vector of integers
int findMedian(vector<int> &arr) {
    // Sort the array
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    // Return the median value
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n % 2 == 0)
        return arr[n / 2 - 1];
    else
        return arr[n / 2];
}

int minimizeManhattanDistance(vector<pair<int, int>> &points) {
    int n = points.size();
    vector<int> xs, ys;

    // Extract x and y coordinates
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        xs.push_back(points[i].first);
        ys.push_back(points[i].second);
    }

    // Find the medians of x and y coordinates
    int medianX = findMedian(xs);
    int medianY = findMedian(ys);

    // Calculate the Manhattan distance to the median points
    int totalDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        totalDistance += abs(points[i].first - medianX) + abs(points[i].second - medianY);
    }

    return totalDistance;
}

// Main Function to test the minimizeManhattanDistance function
int main() {
    vector<pair<int, int>> points = { {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {5, 6} };
    cout << "Minimized Manhattan Distance: " << minimizeManhattanDistance(points) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the sorting step:
- Sorting \(n\) elements takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Extracting medians and calculating the Manhattan distance takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This method should handle typical interview-sized inputs efficiently, but always confirm problem constraints and resource limits.
