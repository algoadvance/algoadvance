[Leetcode 2745. Construct the Longest New String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2745)
### Problem Statement
Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, you need to construct a new string by using exactly `x` 'a' characters, `y` 'b' characters, and `z` 'ab' substrings. The goal is to form the longest possible string under these conditions. The resultant string should not contain "aa" substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can 'a' and 'b' characters be used in any arbitrary order?**
   - No, 'a' and 'b' should be used in such a way to maximize the string length without forming any "aa" substring.

2. **Is there any restriction on how substrings 'ab' can be used?**
   - No, you just need to ensure each 'ab' substring is counted properly.

3. **Are the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   - Yes.

### Strategy
To construct the longest string, we need to ensure the following:
1. Utilize all 'a', 'b', and 'ab' components optimally.
2. Avoid consecutive 'a' characters (`"aa"`).

Since 'ab' substrings solve the problem of avoiding consecutive 'a's, our primary goal should be:
1. Use as many 'ab' substrings as possible.
2. Complement with 'b's and single 'a's in such a way to avoid the "aa" issue.

A typical strategy follows:
1. Use up all possible `ab` substrings.
2. If there are remaining `a`s after using `ab`, distribute them carefully between or after `b`s.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string constructLongestString(int x, int y, int z) {
    string result = "";
    int usedAb = min(z, min(x, y)); // Maximum `ab` substrings we can use
    
    // Add all feasible "ab" substrings
    for(int i = 0; i < usedAb; ++i) {
        result += "ab";
    }
    
    // We used up these many `a` and `b`
    x -= usedAb;
    y -= usedAb;
    z -= usedAb;
    
    // Now distribute remaining `a`s and `b`s carefully
    while (x > 0 || y > 0) {
        if (y > 0) {
            result += 'b';
            y--;
        }
        if (x > 0) {
            result += 'a';
            x--;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5, y = 3, z = 2;
    string result = constructLongestString(x, y, z);
    cout << "The longest constructed string is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(x + y + z)**, as it processes each character once to form the longest string.
- The space complexity remains **O(1)**, not counting the space required for the output string (which is inevitable).

### Explanation
- We start by using as many `ab` substrings as we can, which helps in ensuring no consecutive 'a's.
- After using the `ab` substrings, any remaining `a`s and `b`s are carefully added in alternating fashion to avoid creating "aa" substrings. If 'b' is available, it is added first to ensure any leftover 'a' does not form "aa".
