[Leetcode 295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l295)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to design a data structure that supports the following operations:

1. `addNum(int num)`: Add a number to the data structure.
2. `findMedian()`: Find the median of all elements that have been added.

The median is the middle value in an ordered list. If the size of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** Is there a constraint on the number of elements that can be added?
   - Typically, the problem may involve a very large number of elements.

2. **Data Range:** Are there any constraints on the range of numbers that can be added?
   - Normally, the problem does not specify constraints, implying you should handle a wide range of integers.

3. **Performance Requirements:** What are the performance requirements for each operation?
   - The operations should be optimized. Specifically, the `findMedian` should not be more than O(1) and `addNum` should aim to be O(log n).

## Strategy

To efficiently find the median:
- **Two Heaps Method:** Use two heaps to keep track of the elements.
  - A max-heap for the lower half of the numbers.
  - A min-heap for the upper half of the numbers.
  
  The properties of heaps:
  - Max-Heap: The largest element is at the root.
  - Min-Heap: The smallest element is at the root.

The strategy is:
1. **Balancing Heaps:** Maintain the heaps such that their sizes differ by at most one element.
2. **Insertion:** Depending on the number, add it to one of the heaps and then rebalance if necessary.
3. **Finding Median:** 
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the root of the heap with more elements.
   - If even, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.
  
## Code

```cpp
#include <queue>

class MedianFinder {
public:
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    MedianFinder() {
    }
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        // Add number to max heap
        if (maxHeap.empty() || num <= maxHeap.top()) {
            maxHeap.push(num);
        } else {
            minHeap.push(num);
        }

        // Rebalance heaps if necessary
        if (maxHeap.size() > minHeap.size() + 1) {
            minHeap.push(maxHeap.top());
            maxHeap.pop();
        } else if (minHeap.size() > maxHeap.size()) {
            maxHeap.push(minHeap.top());
            minHeap.pop();
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        if (maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()) {
            return (maxHeap.top() + minHeap.top()) / 2.0;
        }
        return maxHeap.top();
    }
    
private:
    std::priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- `addNum(int num)`: Each insertion operation involves at most two heap operations. Insertion into a heap is O(log n), so this operation is O(log n).
- `findMedian()`: This operation just returns the top elements of the heaps or the average of the top elements, so it is O(1).

Thus, the solution efficiently handles large streams of data while keeping the operations well within acceptable time limits.
