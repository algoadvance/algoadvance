[Leetcode 2055. Plates Between Candles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2055)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of stars `*` and bars `|` (where `*` represents a plate and `|` represents a candle). We also have an array `queries` where each query `queries[i]` is represented by a pair of integers `[left_i, right_i]`. For each query, we need to determine the number of plates between the leftmost and rightmost candles (inclusive) in the substring `s[left_i...right_i]`.

The return result should be an array of integers where each integer corresponds to the answer for the respective query.

### Example
**Input:**
```cpp
s = "**|**|***|", queries = \{\{2, 5}, {5, 9}}
```
**Output:**
```cpp
{2, 3}
```

**Explanation:**
- For the first query (2, 5): The substring is "|**|". The plates between candles are 2.
- For the second query (5, 9): The substring is "|***|". The plates between candles are 3.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the lengths of the string `s` and the number of queries?
   - `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= left_i <= right_i < s.length`

2. Can the inputs be assumed valid and without any edge cases like left_i > right_i?
   - Yes, we can assume input validity as per the problem constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Step 1: Preprocessing**:
   - Compute arrays for quick lookup:
     - `leftCandle[i]`: Nearest candle index to the left of or at `i`.
     - `rightCandle[i]`: Nearest candle index to the right of or at `i`.
     - `plateCount[i]`: Cumulative count of plates up to index `i`.

2. **Step 2: Query Processing**:
   - For each query `[left_i, right_i]`:
     - Find nearest candles using `leftCandle` and `rightCandle`.
     - Calculate the number of plates between these candles using the `plateCount` array.
  
## Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing**: `O(n)`
- **Query Processing**: `O(1)` per query
- **Total**: `O(n + q)` where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `q` is the number of queries.

## Code
Here's the C++ code to implement the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> platesBetweenCandles(string s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> leftCandle(n), rightCandle(n), plateCount(n + 1, 0);

        // Fill leftCandle array
        for (int i = 0, left = -1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '|') left = i;
            leftCandle[i] = left;
        }

        // Fill rightCandle array
        for (int i = n - 1, right = -1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (s[i] == '|') right = i;
            rightCandle[i] = right;
        }

        // Fill plateCount array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            plateCount[i + 1] = plateCount[i] + (s[i] == '*');
        }

        vector<int> result;
        for (const auto& q : queries) {
            int left = rightCandle[q[0]];
            int right = leftCandle[q[1]];
            if (left == -1 || right == -1 || left > right) {
                result.push_back(0);
            } else {
                result.push_back(plateCount[right + 1] - plateCount[left]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

This code ensures efficient processing by using preprocessing arrays to handle each query in constant time.
