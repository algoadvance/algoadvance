[Leetcode 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1523)
## Problem Statement

You are given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

### Example:
1. `Input`: `low = 3`, `high = 7`
   `Output`: `3`
   Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3, 5, 7].

2. `Input`: `low = 8`, `high = 10`
   `Output`: `1`
   Explanation: The odd number between 8 and 10 is [9].

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are `low` and `high` always valid inputs such that `low <= high`?
    - Yes, the input will satisfy the given constraint.
2. Are `low` and `high` inclusive in the range?
    - Yes, they are inclusive.

Assuming no other constraints or conditions are provided. Let's move on to the strategy and code.

## Strategy

To count the number of odd numbers between `low` and `high` inclusive:

1. Calculate the number of odd numbers up to `high`.
2. Calculate the number of odd numbers up to `low - 1`.
3. The difference between these two counts will give the number of odd numbers between `low` and `high` inclusive.

### Steps:
1. We know that every second number is an odd number.
2. For any integer `n`, the count of odd numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive is `(n + 1) // 2`.

#### Formula:
- Odd numbers count up to `high`: `(high + 1) // 2`
- Odd numbers count up to `low - 1`: `low // 2`

Therefore, the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` inclusive:
\[ \text{count\_odds} = \left(\frac{high + 1}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{low}{2}\right) \]

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int countOdds(int low, int high) {
    // Calculate the number of odd numbers up to high and low-1
    int odds_up_to_high = (high + 1) / 2;
    int odds_up_to_low_minus_one = low / 2;
    
    // The difference will give the result
    return odds_up_to_high - odds_up_to_low_minus_one;
}

int main() {
    // Example test cases
    std::cout << countOdds(3, 7) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    std::cout << countOdds(8, 10) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(1)` (constant time) because the computations involved are basic arithmetic operations that take constant time regardless of the input size.
