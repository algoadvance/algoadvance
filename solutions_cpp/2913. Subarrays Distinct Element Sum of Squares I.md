[Leetcode 2913. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2913)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. The **distinct element sum of squares** of a subarray is the sum of squares of its distinct elements. Return the sum of the distinct element sum of squares for all subarrays of length `k` or more in the input array `nums`.

### Example:

For `nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` and `k = 2`, we consider all subarrays of length 2 or more:
1. [1, 2] -> (1^2 + 2^2) = 1 + 4 = 5
2. [1, 2, 1] -> (1^2 + 2^2) = 1 + 4 = 5 (1 is counted once)
3. [2, 1, 2] -> (2^2 + 1^2) = 4 + 1 = 5 (1 is counted once)
4. [1, 2, 3] -> (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14
5. [1, 2, 1, 2] -> (1^2 + 2^2) = 1 + 4 = 5 (1 is counted once)

The total sum would be 5 + 5 + 5 + 14 + 5 = 34.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - What are the constraints on the length of `nums` (n)?
    - Are the elements of `nums` guaranteed to be positive integers?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the result be a single integer representing the sum of the distinct element sum of squares of all subarrays of length `k` or more?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should we return if `k` is larger than the length of `nums`?
    - What if `nums` contains duplicate elements within subarrays? Are we ensuring that only unique elements' squares are considered?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
    - Use a sliding window to navigate through all subarrays of lengths starting from `k` to `n`.
    - Maintain a frequency map to keep track of occurrences of elements within the current window.
    - Use this map to compute the sum of squares of distinct elements efficiently.

2. **Handling Duplicates**:
    - As we move the sliding window, keep an active count of the elements. Adjust the count as elements enter and exit the window. Count the squares only once per unique element.

3. **Summation of Results**:
    - Sum the results of the distinct element sum of squares of all valid subarrays.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysDistinctElementSumOfSquares(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (nums.empty() || k > nums.size()) {
            return 0;
        }

        int n = nums.size();
        int totalSum = 0;

        // Function to calculate the sum of squares of unique elements in the window
        auto calculateSumOfSquares = [](unordered_map<int, int>& freqMap) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (auto& [key, value] : freqMap) {
                if (value > 0)
                    sum += key * key;
            }
            return sum;
        };

        // Sliding window to calculate required sum of squares
        for (int size = k; size <= n; ++size) {
            unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
            int currentSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                freqMap[nums[i]]++;
            }
            currentSum = calculateSumOfSquares(freqMap);
            totalSum += currentSum;

            for (int i = size; i < n; ++i) {
                freqMap[nums[i - size]]--;
                freqMap[nums[i]]++;

                currentSum = calculateSumOfSquares(freqMap);
                totalSum += currentSum;
            }
        }

        return totalSum;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing (initial window setup)**: O(k)
- **Sliding Window Movement**: O((n-k+1) * (n-k) / 2) (in worst case, considering recalculations for each window size)

Thus, the overall time complexity would be approximately O(n^2) for larger dimensions of `n` and small window sizes starting from `k`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently compute the required sum of squares of distinct elements in each valid subarray and sum them up for the result.
