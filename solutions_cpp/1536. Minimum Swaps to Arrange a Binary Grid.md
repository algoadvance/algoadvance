[Leetcode 1536. Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1536)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary grid, where each cell is either `0` or `1`. You can perform any number of swaps between any two rows with each other. A row is considered valid if all the `1`s in that row are to the right of all the `0`s in that row, i.e., a row `[0, ..., 0, 1, 1, ..., 1]`. Your goal is to arrange all the rows to be valid with the minimum number of swaps.

Given the grid `grid`, return the minimum number of swaps needed to arrange the grid so that each row is valid, or return `-1` if it is impossible.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,0]]
Output: 3

Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]]
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions
- **Can the grid have invalid rows which cannot be made valid even by swapping rows?**
  - Yes, in such cases, return `-1`.
- **What size can the grid be?**
  - The grid is `n x n`, and the constraints typically will be around `1 <= n <= 50`.

Let's proceed with the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Find trailing zeros for each row**: Calculate the number of trailing zeros required for each row to be valid.
  
2. **Row Validation**: For each row `i` in the grid, the trailing zeros count should be at least `n-1-i` for it to be valid at that position.

3. **Permutations and Swaps**: If a row does not have enough trailing zeros, find the next row that can be swapped and bring it in place.

4. **Minimize Swaps**: Keep the count of these swaps and ensure to find the minimum number of swaps required; if impossible to achieve configuration, return `-1`.

Let's write the code to achieve this.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        
        int n = grid.size();
        vector<int> trailingZeros(n, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int j = n - 1;
            while (j >= 0 && grid[i][j] == 0) {
                trailingZeros[i]++;
                j--;
            }
        }

        int swaps = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int k = i;
            while (k < n && trailingZeros[k] < n - 1 - i) {
                k++;
            }

            if (k == n) return -1;

            while (k > i) {
                swap(trailingZeros[k], trailingZeros[k - 1]);
                swaps++;
                k--;
            }
        }

        return swaps;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding Trailing Zeros**: O(n^2)
- **Processing Rows and Counting Swaps**: O(n^2) in the worst case (since finding and swapping can take O(n) for each row)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).

This code handles the minimum swaps required logic efficiently and also considers cases where the configuration is impossible.
