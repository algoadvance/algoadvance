[Leetcode 2763. Sum of Imbalance Numbers of All Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2763)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. The imbalance number of a subarray is defined as the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] > nums[j]`. The task is to find the sum of imbalance numbers of all possible subarrays of `nums`.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`
- Output: `3`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array sorted in any particular order?**
   - No, the array `nums` can be in any arbitrary order.

2. **What is the expected input size?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems can be up to `10^4` elements in the array.

3. **What should be the output for an empty array?**
   - Output should be `0` since there are no elements to form subarrays.

4. **Can there be negative numbers in the array?**
   - This is normally not specified, but it is prudent to assume the array can contain any integer values.

5. **Are all elements unique?**
   - This is not specified, so assume that elements can be repeated.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Generate all possible subarrays.
   - For each subarray, compute its imbalance number by comparing all pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j` and counting the pairs where `nums[i] > nums[j]`.
   - Sum the imbalance numbers for all subarrays.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Direct brute force might be infeasible for large arrays due to high time complexity.
   - We can use other strategic approaches to preprocess and efficiently compute imbalance in linear or quadratic time with some clever observations.

### Code (Brute Force)
Let's start with a brute force approach to get a feel for the implementation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int imbalanceNumber(const vector<int>& subarray) {
    int count = 0;
    int n = subarray.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (subarray[i] > subarray[j])
                ++count;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int sumImbalanceNumbers(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int totalImbalance = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            vector<int> subarray(nums.begin() + start, nums.begin() + end + 1);
            totalImbalance += imbalanceNumber(subarray);
        }
    }
    return totalImbalance;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5};
    cout << "Sum of Imbalance Numbers of All Subarrays: " << sumImbalanceNumbers(nums) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The brute force approach has the following time complexity:
1. For generating subarrays, we have \(O(n^2)\) combinations.
2. For each subarray, calculating imbalance number involves another loop, making it \(O(n)\) for subarray size.

Overall time complexity is \(O(n^3)\).

### Conclusion
The brute force method seems straightforward but isn't efficient for larger arrays due to its high time complexity. We would need to consider an optimized approach such as using segment trees, Fenwick trees, or other data structures to reduce this complexity. For the sake of this problem statement, this is a correct albeit inefficient baseline solution.
