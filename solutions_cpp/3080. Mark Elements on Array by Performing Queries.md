[Leetcode 3080. Mark Elements on Array by Performing Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3080)
# Problem Statement

Given an array of integers and a list of queries, where each query contains two integers representing indices of the array, you need to perform the following steps:
1. Mark all elements between these two indices (inclusive) by setting them to `0`.
2. Return the modified array after performing all the queries.

Constraints:
- The length of the array and number of queries can be large.

# Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few things:

1. **Can the indices in the queries be out of order (i.e., `l` might be greater than `r`)?**
    - For simplicity, let's assume the indices will always be in order: `l <= r`.
    
2. **Can the indices be out of the array's bounds?**
    - No, the indices are guaranteed to be within bounds of the array.
    
3. **Are the values in the array or the queries' indices negative?**
    - The values in the array can be any integer, but the indices are always within valid range and non-negative.

# Strategy
We can solve this problem by following these steps:
1. Iterate through each query and set the elements within the specified range to `0`.
2. Return the modified array.

# Code
Here is the code to solve this problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> markElements(std::vector<int>& arr, const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& queries) {
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int start = query.first;
        int end = query.second;
        
        // Mark elements as 0 from start to end (inclusive)
        for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
            arr[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}
```

# Explanation:
1. **Function Signature:**
    - The function takes two arguments: `arr` (a reference to the array of integers) and `queries` (a vector of pairs where each pair represents the range `[l, r]` of indices to mark).
    
2. **Iterate Through Queries:**
    - We iterate through each query and extract the `start` and `end` indices.
    
3. **Mark Elements as 0:**
    - For each query, we iterate from the `start` index to the `end` index and mark each element as `0`.

4. **Return the Modified Array:**
    - Once all queries are processed, we return the modified array.

# Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N + Q * M)` where:
    - `N` is the number of elements in the array.
    - `Q` is the number of queries.
    - `M` is the average length of each range specified by the queries. Since we iterate over the range for each query, this becomes the dominant factor.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` additional space, not including the input and output since we are modifying the array in place.
