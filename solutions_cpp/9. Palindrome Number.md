[Leetcode 9. Palindrome Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l9)
### Problem Statement

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: 121
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

#### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Follow-up**: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Should the solution handle negative numbers?
   **A**: No, negative numbers are not considered palindromes since they include a negative sign.

2. **Q**: What about single-digit numbers?
   **A**: Single-digit numbers are always palindromes.

### Strategy

1. Check if the input number is negative. If it is, return `false` immediately.
2. Reverse the second half of the number and compare it to the first half to determine if the number is a palindrome:
   - Initialize `reversedNumber` to 0.
   - Continue to extract digits from the end of the number and append to `reversedNumber` until `originalNumber` is less than or equal to `reversedNumber`.
3. Finally, compare the partially reversed number with the remaining number.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool isPalindrome(int x) {
    // Early exit for negative numbers and multiples of 10 (except zero)
    if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {
        return false;
    }
    
    int reversedNumber = 0;
    while (x > reversedNumber) {
        reversedNumber = reversedNumber * 10 + x % 10;
        x /= 10;
    }
    
    // Handles both even and odd length numbers
    return x == reversedNumber || x == reversedNumber / 10;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "121 is palindrome: " << isPalindrome(121) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "-121 is palindrome: " << isPalindrome(-121) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "10 is palindrome: " << isPalindrome(10) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "123321 is palindrome: " << isPalindrome(123321) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log10(n)) because we are dividing the input number by 10 in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that we solve the problem without converting the integer to a string and is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
