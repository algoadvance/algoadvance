[Leetcode 1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1960)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to select two non-overlapping palindromic substrings (i.e., they do not share any character in common) such that the product of their lengths is maximized. Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-overlapping palindromic substrings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the length of `s`?**
   - The string length can be up to 10^5.
   
2. **What constitutes a palindromic substring?**
   - A substring is palindromic if it reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g., "aba" and "racecar".

3. **Can the entire string `s` be treated as a potential palindrome?**
   - Yes, if `s` itself is a palindrome, it can be considered.

4. **Are there any other constraints or edge cases to consider?**
   - The two palindromic substrings should not overlap.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Palindromic Substrings**:
   - Use dynamic programming to identify and store all palindromic substrings in `s`.

2. **Calculate Maximum Lengths**:
   - Compute the maximum length of palindromes ending at each index from the left.
   - Compute the maximum length of palindromes starting at each index from the right.

3. **Maximize Product**:
   - Iterate through all possible splits of the string (from 1 to n-1), and at each split, calculate the product of the maximum palindromic substring lengths on either side.

### Time Complexity
- **Finding Palindromes**: O(n^2) using dynamic programming.
- **Computing Maximum Lengths**: O(n) for both left and right maximum lengths.
- **Calculating Maximum Product**: O(n).

Overall complexity is O(n^2), which is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        
        // Dynamic programming to record palindromic substring
        vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
            dp[i][i] = true;

        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (len == 2) 
                    dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j]);
                else 
                    dp[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j] && dp[i+1][j-1]);
            }
        }
        
        // Max palindrome length ending at each position from left
        vector<int> leftMax(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
                if (dp[j][i]) {
                    leftMax[i] = max(leftMax[i], i - j + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Max palindrome length starting at each position from right
        vector<int> rightMax(n, 0);
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                if (dp[i][j]) {
                    rightMax[i] = max(rightMax[i], j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Fill left max array with cumulative max values
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            leftMax[i] = max(leftMax[i], leftMax[i-1]);
        }
        
        // Fill right max array with cumulative max values
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            rightMax[i] = max(rightMax[i], rightMax[i+1]);
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum product
        int maxProduct = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            maxProduct = max(maxProduct, leftMax[i] * rightMax[i + 1]);
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "ababa";
    cout << "Max Product: " << solution.maxProduct(s) << endl;  // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```
