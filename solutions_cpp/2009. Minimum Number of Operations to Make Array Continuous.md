[Leetcode 2009. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2009)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, in one operation, you can choose an element of `nums` and change it to any value. Return the minimum number of operations required to make `nums` continuous.

An array `nums` is considered continuous if every value `nums[i]` is such that:
- For any `nums[i] < nums[j]` where `i < j`, the difference between `nums[j]` and `nums[i]` is exactly `1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size and elements of `nums`?**
   - Typically, LeetCode problems will specify this. If it’s not provided, assume reasonable limits like up to \(10^5\) elements with values in the range of \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Are duplicates allowed in `nums`?**
   - In this problem, duplicates can be in the input array although they won’t exist in the final continuous array because every element must be a unique increasing integer sequence.

3. **Can the array be empty or consist of a single element?**
   - Usually, this type of problem assumes a non-empty array. If the array has one element, it is already continuous.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we should:
1. **Sort the array and remove duplicates:** This prepares the array for finding the longest continuous subsequence within a sliding window framework.
2. **Sliding window technique:** Use a sliding window to find the largest subsequence where the numbers differ by at most the range length.
3. Calculate the minimum operations as the difference between the original length of the array and the length of the largest found subsequence.

### Code

Here is the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Remove duplicates
        unordered_set<int> num_set(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        vector<int> unique_nums(num_set.begin(), num_set.end());
        sort(unique_nums.begin(), unique_nums.end());
        
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = unique_nums.size();
        int max_len = 0;
        
        // Sliding window to find the longest subarray with continuous numbers
        int left = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < m; ++right) {
            while (unique_nums[right] - unique_nums[left] >= n) {
                ++left;
            }
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        // Minimum operations needed
        return n - max_len;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the unique elements**: \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
- **Sliding window traversal**: \(O(n)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step being the most expensive operation. The sliding window process is linear in complexity.
