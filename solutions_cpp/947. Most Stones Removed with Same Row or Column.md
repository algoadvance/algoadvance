[Leetcode 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l947)
## Problem Statement

We are given an array `stones` where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the i-th stone on a 2D plane. We need to determine the maximum number of stones that can be removed such that there is always at least one remaining stone in the same row or column as the stone being removed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What are the constraints on the number of stones and their coordinates?**
   - A: The number of stones is between 1 and 1000. The coordinates (xi, yi) of each stone are integers between 0 and 10^4.

2. **Q: Should each stone be removed one by one, or can we remove multiple stones in one step?**
   - A: Stones should be removed one by one according to the problem conditions.

3. **Q: Can there be multiple stones at the same location?**
   - A: No, each stone has a unique location.

## Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we can utilize a graph-based approach using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Union-Find. Here's the plan:

1. **Graph Representation**: Treat each stone as a node in the graph. An edge exists between two nodes if the stones are in the same row or column.
2. **Connected Components**: The problem of removing the maximum number of stones translates to finding the maximum number of stones in the same connected component minus one (since at least one stone must remain).
3. **DFS Approach**: We can use DFS to find all connected components and count the stones in each component.
4. **Union-Find Approach**:
   - Initialize each stone as its own leader.
   - Union stones that are in the same row or column.
   - For each union operation, track the number of unique connected components.
   - The result is the total number of stones minus the number of unique connected components (since one stone must be left in each connected component).

## Code

We'll implement the DFS approach to find the number of connected components and thereby solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int removeStones(vector<vector<int>>& stones) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> rows, cols;
        for (const auto& stone : stones) {
            rows[stone[0]].insert(stone[1]);
            cols[stone[1]].insert(stone[0]);
        }
        
        int numOfComponents = 0; 
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        for (const auto& stone : stones) {
            int x = stone[0], y = stone[1];
            int code = (x << 16) | y; // code to uniquely identify each stone
            if (visited.find(code) == visited.end()) {
                // New connected component found
                numOfComponents++;
                dfs(x, y, rows, cols, visited);
            }
        }
        
        return stones.size() - numOfComponents;
    }
    
private:
    void dfs(int x, int y, unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>& rows, unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>& cols, unordered_set<int>& visited) {
        int code = (x << 16) | y;
        visited.insert(code);
        
        for (int nextY : rows[x]) {
            int nextCode = (x << 16) | nextY;
            if (visited.find(nextCode) == visited.end()) {
                dfs(x, xnextY, rows, cols, visited);
            }
        }
        
        for (int nextX : cols[y]) {
            int nextCode = (nextX << 16) | y;
            if (visited.find(nextCode) == visited.end()) {
                dfs(nextX, y, rows, cols, visited);
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph**: O(N), where N is the number of stones.
- **DFS Traversal**: O(N), as each stone is visited exactly once.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(N), which is efficient given the constraint of N up to 1000.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the number of connected components and subsequently the maximum number of stones that can be removed.
