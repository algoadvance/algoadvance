[Leetcode 2653. Sliding Subarray Beauty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2653)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` containing `n` elements, and two integers `k` and `x`. The task is to find the beauty of each sliding subarray of size `k`.

The beauty of a subarray is defined as follows:
- It is the `x-th` smallest element in the subarray if it exists, otherwise it is 0.

You need to return an array of beauties for each sliding subarray of size `k`.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2, x = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], k = 3, x = 2
Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if `k` is larger than `n`?
2. Are the elements of the array guaranteed to be integers?
3. What are the constraints on the values of `k` and `x`? Specifically, can they be less than or equal to 0?
4. Is it guaranteed that `k >= x`?

## Strategy
1. **Initial Validation:**
   Validate the input for edge cases, such as `k > n` or illegal values of `k` and `x`.
   
2. **Sliding Window:**
   Use a sliding window of size `k`. For each position of the window:
   - Extract the subarray within the current window.
   - Sort this subarray.
   - Find the `x-th` smallest element in the sorted subarray.
   - Append this element to the result list.

3. **Efficiency Improvement:**
   - Instead of sorting the entire subarray repeatedly, use a data structure like a balanced BST or a multiset (available in C++) to manage the sliding window elements efficiently for insertion, deletion, and finding the `x-th` element.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - For the case where `k` or `x` are outside their valid ranges.
   - For the subarrays where the length is less than `k`.

## Code Implementation

Here's the implementation of the solution using a multiset from the C++ Standard Library for efficient insertions, deletions, and finding the `x-th` element.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getSubarrayBeauty(vector<int>& nums, int k, int x) {
        vector<int> result;
        multiset<int> window;
        deque<int> dq; // stores indices
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (i >= k) {
                // remove the element going out of the window
                auto it = window.find(nums[i - k]);
                if (it != window.end()) {
                    window.erase(it);
                }
            }
            
            // add the new element
            window.insert(nums[i]);
            dq.push_back(nums[i]);
            
            // maintain the size of the deque
            if (dq.size() > k) {
                dq.pop_front();
            }
            
            // add the x-th smallest element to the result if we have at least k elements
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                auto it = window.begin();
                advance(it, x - 1);
                result.push_back(*it);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Insertion and Deletion in a multiset:** \(O(\log k)\)
- **Finding the x-th smallest element:** \(O(x)\) (using `advance` function)
- **Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot \log k + n \cdot x)\)
  Here, `n` is the length of the input array `nums`, and `k` is the length of each sliding window.

In practical terms:
- If `x` is much smaller than `k`, the complexity can be considered \(O(n \cdot \log k)\).
- If `k` and `x` are comparable, the complexity can be considered \(O(n \cdot (x + \log k))\).
