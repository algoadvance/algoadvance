[Leetcode 2353. Design a Food Rating System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2353)
## Problem Statement

You are required to design a food rating system. The system has the following functionalities:

1. **Initialization**: The system is initialized with `n` foods and their corresponding cuisines and ratings.
   - `Food and Cuisine Arrays`: Two string arrays `foods` and `cuisines` of size `n`.
   - `Rating Array`: An integer array `ratings` of size `n`.

2. **Change Rating**: The system allows changing the rating of a specified food.

3. **Highest Rated Food by Cuisine**: The system can return the food with the highest rating for a specified cuisine. If there is a tie, the lexicographically smaller food name is returned.

### Methods

1. **FoodRatings(foods, cuisines, ratings)**: Initializes the system with the foods and their ratings.
2. **changeRating(food, newRating)**: Changes the rating of the specified food.
3. **highestRated(cuisine)**: Returns the highest-rated food for the specified cuisine.

### Example

```cpp
FoodRatings* obj = new FoodRatings(foods, cuisines, ratings);
obj->changeRating(food, newRating);
string highest_food = obj->highestRated(cuisine);
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. How many foods can we expect at maximum?
2. How frequent are the changeRating requests expected compared to the highestRated requests?
3. Can there be multiple foods with the same name?
4. Should we consider edge cases such as non-existent foods in changeRating or non-existent cuisines in highestRated?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a `unordered_map` to map food names to their corresponding cuisine and rating.
   - Use another `unordered_map` to map each cuisine to a sorted set of foods based on ratings, where foods with the same rating are ordered lexicographically.

2. **Change Rating**:
   - Update the rating in the food-to-rating map.
   - Update the sorted set of foods for the corresponding cuisine.

3. **Highest Rated**:
   - Retrieve the sorted set of foods for the specified cuisine and return the first element.

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class FoodRatings {
private:
    struct FoodInfo {
        string cuisine;
        int rating;
    };
    unordered_map<string, FoodInfo> foodToInfo;
    unordered_map<string, set<pair<int, string>>> cuisineToFoods;

public:
    FoodRatings(vector<string>& foods, vector<string>& cuisines, vector<int>& ratings) {
        int n = foods.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            foodToInfo[foods[i]] = {cuisines[i], ratings[i]};
            cuisineToFoods[cuisines[i]].emplace(-ratings[i], foods[i]);
        }
    }

    void changeRating(string food, int newRating) {
        auto& info = foodToInfo[food];
        string& cuisine = info.cuisine;
        int oldRating = info.rating;

        // Remove the old rating
        cuisineToFoods[cuisine].erase({-oldRating, food});

        // Update the rating
        info.rating = newRating;

        // Insert the new rating
        cuisineToFoods[cuisine].emplace(-newRating, food);
    }

    string highestRated(string cuisine) {
        return cuisineToFoods[cuisine].begin()->second;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: `O(n log n)` for constructing sorted sets for each cuisine.
2. **changeRating(food, newRating)**: `O(log m)` where `m` is the number of foods in the cuisine (for removing and inserting).
3. **highestRated(cuisine)**: `O(1)` for retrieving the highest-rated food in a cuisine.

This design ensures that both `changeRating` and `highestRated` operations are efficient, leveraging maps and sets for quick lookups and updates.
