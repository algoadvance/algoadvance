[Leetcode 396. Rotate Function](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l396)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. 

The **rotate function** `F` is defined as follows:
  
  `F(k) = 0 * nums[k] + 1 * nums[(k+1) % n] + ... + (n-1) * nums[(k+n-1) % n]`

Return the maximum value of `F(k)`.

The test cases are generated so that at least one valid `k` exists.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The array `nums` will have at least one element (n >= 1).
   - Elements in `nums` will fit within the range of a 32-bit integer.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `nums` has only one element? (F(k) should always be 0 regardless of k)
   - Are there any assumptions about the values (positive, negative, or zero) within `nums`?

3. **Expected Output**:
   - Return the maximum integer value of the rotate function `F(k)` for `0 <= k < n`.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - Calculate `F(0)`, which is the sum `0 * nums[0] + 1 * nums[1] + ... + (n-1) * nums[n-1]`.

2. **Subsequent Rotations**:
   - Notice how transitioning from `F(k)` to `F(k+1)` affects the sum. We can derive that:
     - `F(k + 1) = F(k) + sum(nums) - n * nums[n - k]` after rotating one step.
   - Use this relation to compute `F(k+1)` efficiently from `F(k)`.

3. **Optimize**:
   - Use a single loop to update the value of `F(k)` for all possible `k` and keep track of the maximum value.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for accumulate
#include <algorithm> // for max

class Solution {
public:
    int maxRotateFunction(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int F = 0;
        
        // Sum of all elements in nums
        int sum_nums = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);

        // Calculate F(0)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            F += i * nums[i];
        }
        
        int maxF = F;

        // Calculate F(k) for k = 1 to n-1 using the observed relationship
        for (int k = 1; k < n; ++k) {
            F = F + sum_nums - n * nums[n - k];
            maxF = std::max(maxF, F);
        }
        
        return maxF;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization** (`F(0)`): O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Each rotation** (`F(k)`): O(1) for each `k`.
- **Total time complexity**: O(n).

This results in a linear time complexity solution, which is efficient given the constraints typically observed in interview questions.

### Summary
By using an efficient update relationship between successive rotations, we avoid recalculating the rotate function from scratch for each possible rotation, thus optimizing the solution to O(n) time complexity.
