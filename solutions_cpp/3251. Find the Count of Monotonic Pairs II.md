[Leetcode 3251. Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3251)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. A pair of indices $(i, j)$ is considered **monotonic** if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. $0 \leq i < j < nums.size()$ (i.e., `i` must be less than `j` and both should be valid indices in `nums`).
2. `nums[i] <= nums[j]`

Your task is to determine the number of **monotonic** pairs $(i, j)$ such that `j - i >= k`.

**Input:**
- `vector<int> nums`: a vector of integers.
- `int k`: an integer `k`.

**Output:**
- Return the number of monotonic pairs $(i, j)$.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
2. What is the range of values for `k`?
   - `k` can be any non-negative integer, bounded by the constraints of the problem.
3. What should be returned if there are no valid pairs?
   - If there are no valid pairs, the function should return `0`.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through each possible starting index `i` in the vector `nums`.
2. For each index `i`, iterate through all possible ending indices `j` such that `j = i + k` to `nums.size() - 1`. This ensures the condition `j - i >= k` is met.
3. Check if the value at `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `nums[j]`.
4. If the condition is satisfied, increment the count of monotonic pairs.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int countMonotonicPairs(const std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + k; j < n; ++j) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[j]) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs over all `i`, the complexity of this loop is `O(n)`.
- The inner loop runs over all `j` starting from `i + k` to `n - 1`. In the worst case, the inner loop runs `n - i - k` times for each `i`.

Therefore, the total time complexity is `O(n^2)` in the worst case, as the nested loop means for each `i` we may iterate close to `n` times for `j`.

The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

If anything is unclear or if you need further optimization or additional questions, feel free to ask!
