[Leetcode 2111. Minimum Operations to Make the Array K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2111)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array `arr` consisting of `n` positive integers, and a positive integer `k`.

A `k-increasing` array is an array in which, for every index `i`, `arr[i] <= arr[i+k]`.

In one operation, you can choose an index `i` and change `arr[i]` to any positive integer.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array `k-increasing`.

## Clarifying Questions

To ensure I fully understand the problem, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. Can `k` be greater than `n` (the length of the array)?
3. Is there a constraint on the size of `n` and the elements in the array?

## Strategy
The main idea is to view the array as a collection of `k` independent subsequences. Each subsequence should be non-decreasing. We'll then calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make each subsequence non-decreasing.

Steps:
1. Iterate over the array and extract the elements of each subsequence.
2. For each subsequence, determine the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
3. The minimum operations required to make a subsequence k-increasing is the size of the subsequence minus the size of its LIS.
4. Sum the minimum operations required for all subsequences.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> lis;
    for (int num : nums) {
        auto it = upper_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), num);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(num);
        } else {
            *it = num;
        }
    }
    return lis.size();
}

int minOperations(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int operations = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        vector<int> subsequence;
        for (int j = i; j < n; j += k) {
            subsequence.push_back(arr[j]);
        }
        int lisLength = lengthOfLIS(subsequence);
        operations += subsequence.size() - lisLength;
    }
    
    return operations;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
    int k = 1;
    cout << minOperations(arr, k) << endl; // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution can be broken down as follows:
1. Extracting subsequences: O(n)
2. Computing the length of the LIS for each subsequence: O((n/k) * log(n/k)) when using binary search.

Since we have `k` subsequences:
- Total time complexity: O(k * (n/k) * log(n/k)) = O(n * log(n/k)).

This approach should be efficient enough given typical constraints in competitive programming scenarios.
