[Leetcode 1311. Get Watched Videos by Your Friends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1311)
## Problem Statement
You are given two 2D integer arrays `friends` and `watchedVideos` where `friends[i]` is a list of IDs (0-indexed) of friends of the ith person, and `watchedVideos[i]` is a list of all the videos the ith person has watched.

Given an integer `id` and an integer `level`, you need to find all the videos watched by friends at the given friendship level from the person with `id`. The videos should be returned in order of their frequency. If multiple videos have the same frequency, they should be ordered lexicographically.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum number of people and the maximum size of the `friends` and `watchedVideos` arrays?**
   - This will help determine if certain data structures or algorithms could be inefficient.
2. **Can a person have friends who are mutual friends?**
   - This will help in understanding if the friendship connections are bidirectional.
3. **What if there are no friends at the specified level?**
   - This is important to know if you should return an empty list or handle it differently.
4. **Are there any constraints on the format of the videos (e.g., only lowercase letters or digits)?**
   - This aids in determining if special handling is required for sorting.

## Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Use BFS to traverse the friendship graph starting from the given `id` to find friends at the given `level`.
2. **Frequency Counting:** Once friends at the desired level are found, count the frequency of each video watched by these friends using a hash map.
3. **Sorting:** Sort the videos first by their frequencies and then lexicographically for videos having the same frequency.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<string> watchedVideosByFriends(vector<vector<string>>& watchedVideos, vector<vector<int>>& friends, int id, int level) {
    int n = friends.size();
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(id);
    visited[id] = true;

    while (level > 0 && !q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            int current = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (int friendId : friends[current]) {
                if (!visited[friendId]) {
                    visited[friendId] = true;
                    q.push(friendId);
                }
            }
        }
        --level;
    }

    unordered_map<string, int> videoCount;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int friendId = q.front();
        q.pop();
        for (const string& video : watchedVideos[friendId]) {
            ++videoCount[video];
        }
    }

    vector<pair<string, int>> videoFrequency(videoCount.begin(), videoCount.end());
    sort(videoFrequency.begin(), videoFrequency.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.second == b.second ? a.first < b.first : a.second < b.second;
    });

    vector<string> result;
    for (const auto& p : videoFrequency) {
        result.push_back(p.first);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **BFS Traversal:** O(N + E), where N is the number of people and E is the number of friendships.
2. **Frequency Counting:** O(F * V), where F is the number of friends at the specified level and V is the average number of videos watched by a person.
3. **Sorting:** O(VlogV), where V is the number of unique videos.

Overall, the time complexity is O(N + E + F * V + VlogV).

The above combined time complexity is predominantly determined by the BFS traversal and the subsequent sorting of videos.
