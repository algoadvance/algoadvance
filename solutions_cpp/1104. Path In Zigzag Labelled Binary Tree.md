[Leetcode 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1104)
## Problem Statement
In a binary tree, the **root** node is at depth 0, and depth increases by 1 for each level, with children on the next depth, respectively.

A binary tree is labeled such that:

- The root node is labeled 1.
- For every node labeled `x` at depth `d`, its left child is labeled as `2x` and its right child as `2x + 1`.

In a **zigzag labeled** binary tree, the nodes are labeled in a zigzag pattern. The labels alternate from left-to-right to right-to-left at each depth level.

Given the `label` of a node in this zigzag labeled binary tree, return the sequence of labels that represents the path from the root of the tree to the `label` node.

### Example
```
Input: label = 14
Output: [1, 3, 4, 14]

Input: label = 26
Output: [1, 2, 6, 10, 26]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What is the maximum value for `label`?
   **A**: The maximum value for `label` can be bound to the constraints typically defined by the problem, often as large as \(10^6\), but we need explicit confirmation from the problem statement if any.

2. **Q**: What if `label` is invalid or not part of the tree, e.g., non-integer, negative number, or zero?
   **A**: Given the problem constraints do not explicitly address invalid inputs, we will assume label is always valid and a part of the tree.

3. **Q**: What about performance or constraints on the runtime?
   **A**: Efficient performance is usually expected, so we'll focus on algorithms that work in logarithmic time relative to the tree depth.


## Strategy

1. **Determine the Depth**: For a given `label`, determine at which depth it resides.
2. **Calculate Path**:
   - Follow the path from `label` to the root by reversing the node's binary representation and moving towards ancestor nodes.
   - Adjust for zigzag labeling based on the depth level.
3. **Reverse the Path**: As steps are constructed bottom-up, reverse the collected path to obtain the root-to-label path.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> pathInZigZagTree(int label) {
        std::vector<int> path;

        // Find depth of the `label`
        int level = 0;
        while ((1 << level) <= label) {
            level++;
        }

        while (label > 0) {
            path.push_back(label);

            // Calculate parent
            int maxLabelLevel = (1 << level) - 1;
            int minLabelLevel = 1 << (level - 1);
            
            label = (maxLabelLevel + minLabelLevel - label) / 2;
            level--;
        }

        // Reverse to get path from root to label
        std::reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
        
        return path;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log N), where N is the `label`. This is because each operation reduces the problem size by approximately half.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(log N), accounting for the depth of the binary tree and the path storage.

This solution efficiently calculates the path by understanding the properties of the zigzag pattern in a binary tree and utilizing mathematical properties of binary indices.
