[Leetcode 2200. Find All K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2200)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and two integers `key` and `k`. A `k-distant index` is an index `i` of `nums` for which there exists an index `j` such that `|i - j| â‰¤ k` and `nums[j] == key`.

Return a list of all `k-distant indices` sorted in increasing order.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[3] and nums[5] are the indices with value 9, and they affect the adjacent indices within a range of 1. Therefore, the resulting indices are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length of the array `nums`?
    - Are there constraints on the values within the array `nums` or the values of `key` and `k`?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should the output indices be returned in a sorted order? (Assuming yes as mentioned in the problem statement)

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - How should the function handle the cases where no elements in `nums` match `key`?
    - How should the function handle cases where `k` is much larger than the length of `nums`?

### Strategy
1. **Identify Key Indices**:
    - Traverse the array `nums` to find all indices `j` where `nums[j] == key`.

2. **Mark K-Distant Indices**:
    - Create an empty set or list to store the k-distant indices.
    - For each key index `j`, compute the range of indices influenced by this key index as `[max(0, j - k), min(len(nums) - 1, j + k)]`.

3. **Store Unique Indices**:
    - As we find the k-distant indices for each key index, store them in a set to avoid duplicates and ensure uniqueness.

4. **Sort and Return**:
    - Convert the set of indices into a sorted list and return it.

### Code
Here's the C++ code that implements the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> findKDistantIndices(std::vector<int>& nums, int key, int k) {
    std::set<int> kDistantIndices;

    // Find all indices containing the key
    for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
        if (nums[j] == key) {
            // Add k-distant indices for each key occurrence
            for (int i = std::max(0, j - k); i <= std::min(int(nums.size()) - 1, j + k); ++i) {
                kDistantIndices.insert(i);
            }
        }
    }

    // Convert set to sorted vector
    return std::vector<int>(kDistantIndices.begin(), kDistantIndices.end());
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding Key Indices**: O(n) where `n` is the length of `nums` (single traversal to find key indices).
- **Marking K-Distant Indices**: For each key index, marking K-Distant indices can take O(k). In the worst case, if every element is a key, it will take O(n * k), but each element within this range would be marked only once.
- **Overall Complexity**: The complexity is dominated by O(n * k) in the worst case.

### Space Complexity
- **Auxiliary space for storing indices**: O(n) where `n` is the size of the set (in the worst case, the set may store each element of the array).
- **Result vector**: Also O(n), since it could potentially include every index.

Overall, the algorithm is efficient given the constraints typically present in such problems.
