[Leetcode 1848. Minimum Distance to the Target Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1848)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` (0-indexed) and two integers `target` and `start`. The array contains positive integers only. Your task is to find the minimum distance between the `start` index and any index `i` such that `nums[i] == target`.

The distance between two indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)` (the absolute difference).

### Example
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 5, start = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: The target is at index 4. The distance between 3 and 4 is 1.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `start` be out of bounds?
    - No, `start` is always a valid index within `nums`.
2. Can there be multiple targets in the array?
    - Yes, your goal is to find the minimum distance to any occurrence of the target.
3. What should be returned if `target` is not present in the array?
    - The problem guarantees that the target will be in the array at least once.

### Strategy
We iterate through the array, checking each element. If the element matches the target, we calculate the distance from the `start` index and keep track of the minimum distance encountered. This ensures we only go through the array once, achieving an efficient solution.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int getMinDistance(std::vector<int>& nums, int target, int start) {
    int minDistance = INT_MAX; // Use a large number to initialize minimum distance
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == target) {
            minDistance = std::min(minDistance, std::abs(i - start));
        }
    }
    return minDistance;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. We need to iterate through the entire array in the worst case.
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum distance to the target element in a single pass through the array.
