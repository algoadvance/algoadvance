[Leetcode 869. Reordered Power of 2](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l869)
### Problem Statement

We need to determine if the digits of an integer \( N \) can be reordered to form a power of 2. In other words, the goal is to check if there exists some permutation of the digits of \( N \) that is a power of 2.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of N**: What is the range of the integer \( N \)? 
   - **Response**: The problem constraints usually follow \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Leading zeroes**: Are we allowed to have leading zeroes in the permutations?
   - **Response**: No, leading zeroes are not valid as they do not form valid integers.

3. **Negative numbers**: Can \( N \) be negative?
   - **Response**: Generally, \( N \) is assumed to be positive in such problems.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Digits**: The order of the digits doesn't matter, just their count. We can make use of the fact that for a number to be a permutation of another, their digit counts must match.
  
2. **Generate Power of 2s**: Compute all possible powers of 2 that are within the range \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 \). We only need 30 such numbers since \( 2^{30} \) is slightly over \( 10^9 \).

3. **Comparison by Digit Counting**:
   - Convert \( N \) to a string and sort its digits.
   - Do the same for all powers of 2 within the range.
   - Check if any of these representations match.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to count digits in a number and return it as a sorted string
std::string countDigits(int n) {
    std::string s = std::to_string(n);
    std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    return s;
}

bool reorderedPowerOf2(int N) {
    std::string N_digits = countDigits(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < 31; ++i) {
        int powerOf2 = 1 << i; // 2^i
        if (N_digits == countDigits(powerOf2)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    int N = 821; // Example usage
    if (reorderedPowerOf2(N)) {
        std::cout << N << " can be reordered to form a power of 2.\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << N << " cannot be reordered to form a power of 2.\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Digit Counting**: Sorting the digits has a time complexity of \( O(d \log d) \) where \( d \) is the number of digits in \( N \).
- **Power Generation**: Generating powers of 2 and their digit representation involves a constant number of iterations (30 iterations for \( 2^{0} \) to \( 2^{30} \)).

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \( O(30 \times (d \log d)) \approx O(d \log d) \) considering that \( d \), the number of digits, is at most 10 for \( N \leq 10^9 \).
