[Leetcode 2867. Count Valid Paths in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2867)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (0-indexed) and a 2D array `edges` of size `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` in the tree.

A valid path in the tree is defined as any sequence of edges that connects a pair of nodes, allowing you to start and end at any two nodes in the tree.

Your task is to count the number of unique valid paths in the tree.

**Note**:
- The length of the valid path (number of edges in the sequence) must be at least one.
- Since the number of paths could be large, you can return the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`? 
   - Are the nodes guaranteed to be uniquely labeled from `0` to `n-1`?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the number of valid paths be returned as a single integer?

Once we have this clarification, we can move forward with our solution.

## Strategy
1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - In a tree, every pair of nodes is connected by exactly one unique path.
   - For `n` nodes, the number of ways to choose two nodes is `nC2 = n*(n-1)/2`, where each pair represents a unique path.

2. **Steps**:
    - Validate input and constraints.
    - Compute the number of unique pairs `(nC2)`.
    - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdint>

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Constants
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        
        // Validate the input constraints
        if (n <= 1) return 0; // A tree must have at least two nodes to have paths
        
        // Compute number of unique pairs (valid paths) in the tree
        int64_t numPaths = (static_cast<int64_t>(n) * (n - 1)) / 2; // Using int64_t to handle large numbers
        numPaths %= MOD; // Modulo operation to keep the result within limits
        
        return static_cast<int>(numPaths);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**
  - The computation of the unique pairs and the final modulo operation are constant time operations.

## Explanation
Given the definition that every pair of nodes in a tree has a unique path between them, the problem becomes a simple combinatorial problem of picking 2 nodes out of `n` nodes, which is calculated using combinations \(nC2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This can be computed directly and efficiently with constant time operations.
