[Leetcode 2419. Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2419)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. Consider all non-empty subarrays of `nums`. The bitwise AND of a subarray is the result of performing bitwise AND operation on all the elements of the subarray:

- For example, the bitwise AND of `[1,2,3]` is `1 & 2 & 3 = 0`.

Return the length of the longest subarray with the maximum bitwise AND.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `nums`?**
   The elements in `nums` are positive integers.

2. **What is the length range of the array `nums`?**
   The length of `nums` can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Can there be multiple such subarrays with the same maximum bitwise AND?**
   Yes, return the length of the longest subarray in that case.

4. **What if all elements in the array are the same?**
   The entire array would be the subarray with the maximum bitwise AND.

### Strategy
1. **Find Maximum Element**: Identify the maximum element in the array because the maximum bitwise AND of a subarray will be the maximum element itself.
2. **Calculate Length of Longest Subarray**: Traverse the array to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray consisting of the maximum element.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Identify the maximum element in the array.
        int maxElement = *std::max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Step 2: Traverse to find the longest contiguous subarray 
        // with elements equal to the maximum element.
        int maxLength = 0;
        int currentLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == maxElement) {
                currentLength++;
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
            } else {
                currentLength = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding Maximum Element**: \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the array.
- **Calculating Length of Longest Subarray**: \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the array.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

This approach efficiently solves the problem in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to \( 10^5 \).
