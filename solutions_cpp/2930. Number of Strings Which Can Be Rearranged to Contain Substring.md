[Leetcode 2930. Number of Strings Which Can Be Rearranged to Contain Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2930)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `strings` and a string `sub`. You need to determine how many strings from the list can be rearranged so that they contain the substring `sub`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range and size of the input?**
   - The list `strings` can have up to 10‚Åµ strings.
   - Each string in `strings` and the string `sub` can have lengths up to 100.

2. **Are the characters in `sub` and `strings` limited to lowercase/uppercase English letters?**
   - Assuming they are limited to lowercase English letters (a-z).

3. **Do modified versions of the input strings count towards the result?**
   - We can only rearrange the strings, not change or add characters.

## Strategy

1. **Count Frequency of Characters in `sub`:**
   - Determine the minimum number of each character required to form the substring `sub`.

2. **Check Each String in `strings`:**
   - For each string in the input list, check if it has enough of each character to potentially be rearranged to include the substring `sub`.

3. **Count Valid Strings:**
   - If a string passes the check, count it as a valid string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

bool canFormSubstring(const string& str, const unordered_map<char, int>& subFreq) {
    unordered_map<char, int> strFreq;
    for (char ch : str) {
        strFreq[ch]++;
    }

    for (const auto& entry : subFreq) {
        if (strFreq[entry.first] < entry.second) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

int numOfStringsCanBeRearranged(vector<string>& strings, const string& sub) {
    unordered_map<char, int> subFreq;
    for (char ch : sub) {
        subFreq[ch]++;
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (const string& str : strings) {
        if (canFormSubstring(str, subFreq)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequency of Characters in `sub`:**
   - This is an O(|sub|) operation.

2. **Processing Each String in `strings`:**
   - For each string in `strings`, we count the frequency of characters, which is O(L) where L is the average length of the strings.

3. **Checking if a String Can Form `sub`:**
   - Checking the frequency counts is O(26) = O(1), because the characters are limited to a-z.

Overall Complexity:
- Preprocessing `sub`: O(|sub|)
- For each string in `strings`: O(L)
- Total for processing strings in `strings`: O(N * L)

Given that `N` is the number of strings and `L` is the average length of strings, the overall complexity is:
\[ O(N * L) \]

This should be efficient for the input limits provided.
