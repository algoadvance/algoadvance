[Leetcode 2172. Maximum AND Sum of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2172)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `numSlots` where `nums.length <= 2 * numSlots`. There are `numSlots` slots, and each slot may hold at most two numbers from `nums`.

The AND sum of a slot containing numbers _a_ and _b_ is defined as `(a & b)`, where `&` is the bitwise AND operator.

The total AND sum is the sum of the AND sums of all occupied slots.

- Return the maximum possible total AND sum of `nums` assigned to the slots.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input range and constraints**
    - What is the allowable range for the elements in `nums` and `numSlots`?
    - Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?

2. **Slot capacity**
    - Each slot can hold a maximum of two numbers. Can a slot hold only one number, or does it need exactly two numbers to contribute to the AND sum?

3. **Output Details**
    - Is the objective to maximize the sum considering the constraints fully, with potential specific assignments at each slot?

By default assumptions, we assume:
- The range for `nums[i]` and `numSlots` are reasonably small, allowing for a solution involving combinatorial approaches.
- A slot must contribute to the AND sum only when it contains exactly two numbers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Bitmask Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a bitmask to represent the placement of numbers into slots.
    - Track the best possible sum for each mask using dynamic programming.

2. **Slots Representation**:
    - Each slot can be in either empty, contain one number, or contain two numbers.
    - Use a bitmask where each bit indicates whether a number is placed or not.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
    - For every possible state, try placing another number into an appropriate slot and compute the new sum.

4. **Base Case**:
    - Start with an empty placement (mask with all zeros).

5. **Optimization**:
    - Use memoization or tabulation to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

### Code

Here's a concrete C++ implementation for the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<int, int> memo;
    
    int maximumANDSum(vector<int>& nums, int numSlots) {
        int n = nums.size();
        return dp(nums, numSlots, 0, 0, 0);
    }
    
    int dp(vector<int>& nums, int numSlots, int index, int state, int numUsed) {
        if (index == nums.size()) return 0;
        if (memo.count(state)) return memo[state];

        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < numSlots; ++i) {
            int slot_mask = (3 << (i * 2));
            int slot_count = (state & slot_mask) >> (i * 2);
            
            if (slot_count < 2) {
                int new_mask = state + (1 << (i * 2));
                int slot_pos = slot_count + 1;

                int current_and_sum = (slot_count == 1) ? (nums[index] & nums[index - 1]) : 0;

                ans = max(ans, current_and_sum + dp(nums, numSlots, index + 1, new_mask, numUsed + 1));
            }
        }

        memo[state] = ans;
        return ans;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int numSlots = 3;
    
    int result = solution.maximumANDSum(nums, numSlots);
    printf("Maximum AND Sum: %d\n", result);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The primary factor in our complexity analysis is the recursion and state representation:
- **State Representation and Transitions**: 
  - There are \(3^{numSlots}\) possible states since each slot can be in 3 states (empty, one number, two numbers).
  - Each state transition involves updating the mask and looking up or storing results in the memoization structure.
- **Overall Complexity**:
  - Given \(nums.size() \leq 2 * numSlots\), the recursion depth is bounded by \(nums.size()\).
  - Thus, the complexity is approximately \(O(3^{numSlots} \times nums.size())\), which is feasible for reasonable values of `numSlots` up to about 10-12 in practice.

This approach leverages bitmasking and dynamic programming to efficiently explore state transitions and optimize the AND sum accordingly.
