[Leetcode 1771. Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1771)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You would like to merge these two strings into one string in such a way that the resulting string is a palindrome and derive its maximum possible length. The new string should be a palindrome.

Return the maximum possible length of such palindrome.

If it is impossible to create a palindromic string, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the characters in `word1` and `word2` only lowercase English letters?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, they are.
2. Should the new palindromic string consist of characters only from `word1` and `word2`?
   - Yes.
3. Are empty strings possible for `word1` or `word2`?
   - Yes, they could be empty.
4. Can the characters in `word1` or `word2` be rearranged?
   - No, the sequence of characters in `word1` and `word2` must remain the same in the resultant palindromic string.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached dynamically using Dynamic Programming (DP). 

1. **Define State**: Use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed considering `word1[0...i-1]` and `word2[0...j-1]`.

2. **Base Cases**: 
   - If either `i` or `j` is zero (meaning one of the strings is empty at that state), the longest palindromic subsequence length would be 0.

3. **Transition**:
   - If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 2` because we can extend the subsequence by these matching characters.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` considering not taking the character from either `word1` or `word2`.

4. **Result**: The answer will be in `dp[n][m]` where `n` and `m` are lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }

    int longestPalindrome(const string& word1, const string& word2) {
        string combined = word1 + word2;
        int totalLength = combined.size();
        int word1Length = word1.size();

        // DP array to calculate LCS
        vector<vector<int>> dp(totalLength + 1, vector<int>(totalLength + 1, 0));

        for (int i = 1; i <= totalLength; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= totalLength; ++j) {
                if (combined[i - 1] == combined[totalLength - j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        int maxLength = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= word1Length; ++i) {
            for (int j = word1Length + 1; j <= totalLength; ++j) {
                if (combined[i - 1] == combined[totalLength - j]) {
                    maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxLength >= 2 ? maxLength : 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;

    string word1 = "cacb";
    string word2 = "cbba";

    int result = sol.longestPalindrome(word1, word2);
    cout << "Max palindrome length: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O((n+m)^2)\) where \(n\) is the length of `word1` and \(m\) is the length of `word2`.
- The space complexity is \(O((n+m)^2)\) due to the usage of the DP table.

This ensures an efficient solution to find the maximum possible length of a palindromic string formed from two given strings.
