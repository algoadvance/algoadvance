[Leetcode 1037. Valid Boomerang](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1037)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return `true` if these points make a boomerang, otherwise return `false`.

A boomerang is formed by three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
```

```cpp
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can points be negative?**
   - Yes, points can be any integer coordinates on the X-Y plane.

2. **Is it guaranteed that there are exactly three points?**
   - Yes, the input array `points` always contains exactly three points.

3. **Do the points need to be distinct for a valid boomerang?**
   - Yes, the points need to be distinct and must not be collinear.

## Strategy

To determine if the three points form a boomerang, they should be distinct and not collinear. Three points are collinear if the area formed by them is zero. The area of a triangle formed by three points \((x1, y1)\), \((x2, y2)\), \((x3, y3)\) can be determined via the determinant method:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2) \right| \]

For the points to not be collinear, this area should not be equal to zero:
\[ x1(y2-y3) + x2(y3-y1) + x3(y1-y2) \neq 0 \]

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

bool isBoomerang(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
    int x1 = points[0][0], y1 = points[0][1];
    int x2 = points[1][0], y2 = points[1][1];
    int x3 = points[2][0], y3 = points[2][1];
    
    return (x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) != 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is constant, \(O(1)\), because it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations irrespective of the input size. The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) as we are only using a few additional variables.
