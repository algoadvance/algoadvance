[Leetcode 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l104)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is it possible for the input tree to be empty?
     - Yes, the input tree can be empty. In such cases, the maximum depth should be 0.
   - Are there any constraints on the number of nodes in the tree?
     - Typically, the number of nodes can go up to \(10^4\), but we will assume constraints based on typical Leetcode settings unless stated otherwise.

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a single integer indicating the depth of the tree.

### Strategy
To determine the maximum depth of a binary tree, we can use Depth First Search (DFS). Specifically, a recursive approach is efficient and intuitive:

1. **Base Case:** If the current node is `nullptr`, return 0.
2. **Recursive Case:** The depth of the current node is 1 plus the maximum of the depths of the left and right subtrees.
3. **Recursion:** Compute the depth for the left subtree and the right subtree recursively.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root->left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root->right);
        return 1 + std::max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a sample binary tree:
    //        3
    //       / \
    //      9  20
    //         /  \
    //        15   7
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->right = new TreeNode(20);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(15);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    
    Solution solution;
    std::cout << "Maximum Depth of the binary tree: " << solution.maxDepth(root) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    
    // Clean up memory (optional as main is going to exit, but good for practice)
    delete root->right->right;
    delete root->right->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The function visits each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(d)\), where \(d\) is the maximum depth of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario (a completely unbalanced tree), the depth could be equal to \(N\). In a balanced tree, the depth would be \(O(\log N)\).
