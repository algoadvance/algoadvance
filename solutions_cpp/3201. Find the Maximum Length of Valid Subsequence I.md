[Leetcode 3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3201)
# Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and an array of characters `chars`. A subsequence is considered valid if it can be formed by removing some or no elements from a string, and each character in the subsequence can be matched with a character in `chars`. The character can only be used once. Return the maximum length of all valid subsequences that can be formed from the words array using the characters in `chars`.

## Example

```cpp
Input: words = ["apple", "peach", "grape"], chars = ['a', 'p', 'l', 'e', 'h']
Output: 5
Explanation: "apple" can be formed entirely from the given characters.
```

# Clarifying Questions

1. Can the same character in `chars` be reused for different words?
2. What is the maximum possible length of `words` and `chars`?
3. Are `chars` guaranteed to contain at least one character?
4. Do `words` contain only lowercase English letters?

# Strategy

1. **Character Count:** First, count the occurrence of each character in `chars`.
2. **Word Checking:** For each word in `words`, count the occurrence of each character in the word.
3. **Validation:** Check if each word can be formed using the character counts from `chars`.
4. **Length Calculation:** If the word is valid, add its length to the total length of valid subsequences.

# Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int maxLengthValidSubsequence(const std::vector<std::string>& words, const std::vector<char>& chars) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
    
    // Count the occurrence of each character in chars
    for (char c : chars) {
        charCount[c]++;
    }
    
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    // Check each word to see if it can be formed
    for (const std::string& word : words) {
        std::unordered_map<char, int> wordCount;
        for (char c : word) {
            wordCount[c]++;
        }
        
        bool canForm = true;
        for (const auto& entry : wordCount) {
            if (charCount[entry.first] < entry.second) {
                canForm = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (canForm) {
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, static_cast<int>(word.length())); // Update maximum length
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> words = {"apple", "peach", "grape"};
    std::vector<char> chars = {'a', 'p', 'l', 'e', 'h'};
    std::cout << maxLengthValidSubsequence(words, chars) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

# Time Complexity

- Counting characters in `chars`: O(n), where `n` is the number of characters in `chars`.
- Checking each word: O(m * k), where `m` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of the words.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + m * k)`. This should be efficient given constraints typical for interview problems.
