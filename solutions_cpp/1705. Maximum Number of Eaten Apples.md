[Leetcode 1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1705)
Sure, let's break this down and tackle it step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given an array `apples` and an array `days`. Apples[i] represents the number of apples that are grown and available on day i, and days[i] represents the number of days those apples will remain good before they rot.

Each day, you can decide to eat one apple if there are any available that day and they have not rotted. You want to maximize the number of apples you can eat.

Return the maximum number of apples you can eat if you choose optimally.

**Example:**
```
Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume all values (for `apples` and `days`) are non-negative integers?
   - Yes.
2. What's the maximum length of the arrays?
   - Generally, you can expect the arrays to be fairly large, let's say up to around 10^4 elements.
3. Do we have to consider only up to the days available in the input, or potentially more?
   - We need to consider all days until all apples are either eaten or rotted.

### Strategy

We use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of rotting apples, as it efficiently gives us the apple with the nearest expiration date. For each day, we'll:

1. Remove any rotten apples from the heap.
2. Add new apples to the heap with their corresponding expiration day.
3. Eat an apple from the heap if any are available.
4. Repeat until no more apples are available and no more new days are added.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int eatenApples(vector<int>& apples, vector<int>& days) {
        // Min-heap to keep track of apples' expiration dates.
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
        int day = 0, eaten = 0;
        
        while (day < apples.size() || !pq.empty()) {
            // Remove expired apples
            while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().first <= day) {
                pq.pop();
            }

            // If there are new apples available today, add them to the heap with expiration date.
            if (day < apples.size() && apples[day] > 0) {
                pq.push({day + days[day], apples[day]});
            }

            // Eat an apple if available
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                auto [exp_date, count] = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                // Eat one apple
                count--;
                eaten++;
                // If there are remaining apples, push back with one less apple.
                if (count > 0) {
                    pq.push({exp_date, count});
                }
            }
            
            day++;
        }
        
        return eaten;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Inserting and Removing from the Heap:** Each operation on the heap (insertion or removal) takes `O(log n)`, where `n` is the current size of the heap.
2. **Daily Operations:** We process each day once, leading to `O(n)` days.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the input arrays (`apples` and `days`). This is efficient given typical constraints.

### Conclusion

By leveraging a priority queue, we ensure that we always eat the apple that is about to rot soonest, maximizing the total number of apples eaten. This constitutes an optimal approach to solving the problem based on the constraints given.
