[Leetcode 2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2975)
### Problem Statement

Given an `n x m` field where some cells have fences (denoted by 1) and others are empty (denoted by 0), determine the largest possible square area that can be obtained by removing some or all the fences. Specifically, you can remove any number of fences from the field to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum values for `n` and `m`?
   - Will there always be at least one cell without a fence?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be the area of the largest square (i.e., side length squared), or just the side length of the largest square?
   
3. **Fences Removal:**
   - Can we remove all the fences from the field, or is there a constraint on how many fences we can remove?

For our solution, we are assuming:
1. There is no specific constraint on the number of fences we can remove.
2. We need to find the largest possible square area after potentially removing any number of fences.

### Strategy

The problem can be treated as a variant of the classical "largest square of 1s in a binary matrix" problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at cell `(i, j)`.
   - Initialize the DP array with zeros.
   - Transition formula: If cell `(i, j)` can be part of a square (`field[i][j]` is 0), then 
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     \]
   - If cell `(i, j)` is a fence (`field[i][j]` is 1), we can still consider it in the square:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     \]
   - Track the maximum value in the DP array to determine the largest possible square's side length.

2. **Complexity:**
   - **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times m)\)
   - **Space Complexity:** \(O(n \times m)\) (we can optimize to \(O(m)\) using a rolling array approach).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalSquare(vector<vector<int>>& field) {
        if (field.empty() || field[0].empty()) return 0;

        int n = field.size();
        int m = field[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(m, 0));
        int maxSideLength = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = field[i][j] == 0 ? 1 : 0;
                } else if (field[i][j] == 0 || field[i][j] == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]}) + 1;
                }

                maxSideLength = max(maxSideLength, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }

        return maxSideLength * maxSideLength; // Returning as area
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> field = {
        {1, 0, 1, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
        {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
        {1, 0, 1, 1, 1},
        {1, 0, 1, 0, 0}
    };
    int result = sol.maximalSquare(field);
    // Should output the maximal square area after removing fences
    cout << "Maximal square area: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a `dp` array to keep track of the largest square's side length ending at each cell.
   
2. **DP Array Filling:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, if we are at the first row or first column, set `dp[i][j]` to 1 if the cell is not a fence.
   - For other cells, if the cell can be part of a square, update `dp[i][j]` using the transition formula.
   
3. **Maximum Side Length Calculation:**
   - The maximum value in the `dp` array gives us the side length of the largest square.
   
4. **Return the Area:**
   - We return the area of the square which is side length squared.

### Time Complexity

- **Time:** \(O(n \times m)\) as we iterate over each cell once.
- **Space:** \(O(n \times m)\) for the `dp` array (can be optimized to \(O(m)\)).
