[Leetcode 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1339)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1339: **Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree**

Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example:

```markdown
**Input:**
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

**Output:** 110 
**Explanation:** Max product is achieved by splitting the tree at edge 3-5, 
after splitting, subtrees get sum = 6 and sum = 15 thus product = 6 * 15 = 90.
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- Each node's value is in the range `[1, 10000]`.

---

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume all node values will be integers?**
   - Yes, all node values are integers as per problem constraints.

2. **If there is only one node, should the product be considered zero?**
   - Yes, splitting is not possible with a single node, so the product should be zero.

3. **Is the tree always a valid binary tree?**
   - Yes, the input will always be a valid binary tree.

---

## Strategy

1. **Compute Total Sum of Tree:**
   - Perform an initial traversal of the tree to compute the total sum of all node values.
  
2. **Determine Subtree Sums:**
   - During a second traversal, calculate the sum of each subtree and store these values.

3. **Find Maximum Product:**
   - For each calculated subtree sum, compute the product if the tree were split at that node, i.e., `(total_sum - subtree_sum) * subtree_sum`.
   - Track the maximum of these products.

4. **Return the Maximum Product with Modulo:**
   - Ensure the return value is modulo `10^9 + 7` as specified by the problem constraints.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Perform a DFS to compute the entire tree sum.
2. Perform another DFS to calculate all possible subtree sums and simultaneously compute the product resulting from each split.
3. Return the maximum product found modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
private:
    long long totalSum; // To store the sum of all nodes' values in the tree
    long long maxProduct;
    
    long long computeTotalSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        return root->val + computeTotalSum(root->left) + computeTotalSum(root->right);
    }

    long long calculateSubtreeSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        long long subSum = root->val + calculateSubtreeSum(root->left) + calculateSubtreeSum(root->right);
        maxProduct = max(maxProduct, (totalSum - subSum) * subSum);
        return subSum;
    }
    
public:
    int maxProductSplitTree(TreeNode* root) {
        totalSum = computeTotalSum(root);
        maxProduct = 0;
        calculateSubtreeSum(root);
        return maxProduct % MOD;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Computing Total Sum:**
    - This requires a traversal of the entire tree: \(O(n)\).

2. **Calculating Subtree Sums and Products:**
    - This also requires a traversal of the entire tree: \(O(n)\).

**Total Time Complexity:**
\[O(n)\]

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

Using this strategy ensures we efficiently traverse the tree twice, maintaining an optimal performance for the problem constraints.
