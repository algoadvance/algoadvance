[Leetcode 881. Boats to Save People](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l881)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `i-th` person, and an `integer limit` which represents the maximum weight that a boat can carry. Each boat can carry at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of their weights is within the `limit`. Return the minimum number of boats required to carry every person.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a two-pointer technique after sorting the array of people's weights:

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the `people` array.
2. **Two Pointers Technique**: Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the lightest and heaviest person, respectively.
3. **Pairing Individuals**:
    - If the sum of the weights of the people pointed by the two pointers is within the `limit`, move both pointers inward (i.e., `left++` and `right--`).
    - Otherwise, move only the `right` pointer inward (i.e., `right--`), indicating that the heaviest person must go alone in a boat.
4. **Counting Boats**: Each iteration of pairing or moving a single person will increment the count of boats required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are weights guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. **Array Size**: Is there any constraint on the size of the `people` array?
3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any special cases we need to handle explicitly, such as empty arrays or all weights being the same?

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numRescueBoats(vector<int>& people, int limit) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end());
        int left = 0, right = people.size() - 1;
        int boats = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
                // They can share a boat
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                // The heaviest person goes alone
                right--;
            }
            boats++;
        }
        
        return boats;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `people` array.
- **Two-pointer traversal**: `O(n)` since each person is considered exactly once.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in **O(n log n)**.

### Space Complexity

- **Sorting Space**: The space complexity of the sorting algorithm is `O(n)` for `std::sort` in the worst case.
- **Two-pointer Technique**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, i.e., `O(1)`.

Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(n)** due to the sorting step.

Feel free to ask if you need further clarifications or if there are specific edge cases you'd like to discuss!
