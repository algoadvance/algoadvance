[Leetcode 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l787)
## Problem Statement

You are given a series of flights `flights`, where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`. You need to find the cheapest price from the city `src` to the city `dst` with at most `k` stops. If there is no such route, return `-1`.

## Example

### Example 1:

- **Input:**
  - `n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1`
- **Output:**
  - `200`

### Example 2:

- **Input:**
  - `n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0`
- **Output:**
  - `500`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can cities be revisited?
   **A:** No, the same city cannot be revisited according to constraints of cycles in Dijkstra's algorithm.

2. **Q:** Are there any limits on the number of cities or flights?
   **A:** The constraints typically are given in the full problem statement on LeetCode. However, for optimal implementation, we can generally expect `n` and `flights` to be reasonably large but within computational limit for algorithms like DFS, BFS, or Dijkstra's with priority queue.

3. **Q:** Is the graph directed or undirected?
   **A:** The graph representing flights is a directed graph because a flight from `A` to `B` does not imply a flight from `B` to `A`.

## Strategy

We can approach this problem using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue (min-heap). The priority queue will help efficiently fetch the current minimum cost route. Additionally, tracking the number of stops helps ensure the `k` stop condition is met.

### Steps

1. Create an adjacency list from `flights`.
2. Use a priority queue to store tuples of the format `(cost, current_city, stops)`.
3. Start by pushing the source city `(0, src, 0)` into the priority queue.
4. Use a while loop to extract the minimum cost route from the priority queue:
   - If the current city is the destination and stops are within the allowed limit, return the cost.
   - If the number of stops is less than `k + 1`, push all neighboring cities into the priority queue with updated costs and stops.
5. If the loop ends without finding the destination within `k` stops, return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

int findCheapestPrice(int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
    // Create the adjacency list
    unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> graph;
    for (const auto& flight : flights) {
        graph[flight[0]].emplace_back(flight[1], flight[2]);
    }
    
    // Priority queue: (cost, current_node, stops)
    priority_queue<tuple<int, int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
    pq.emplace(0, src, 0);
    
    // Vector to track minimum cost to reach each city with a given number of stops
    vector<vector<int>> min_cost(n, vector<int>(k + 2, INT_MAX));
    min_cost[src][0] = 0;
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [cost, curr_city, stops] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if (curr_city == dst) return cost;
        
        // If we have more stops available
        if (stops <= k) {
            for (const auto& [neighbor, price] : graph[curr_city]) {
                int new_cost = cost + price;
                // If we find a cheaper cost path or if we're visiting the neighbor with fewer stops.
                if (new_cost < min_cost[neighbor][stops + 1]) {
                    min_cost[neighbor][stops + 1] = new_cost;
                    pq.emplace(new_cost, neighbor, stops + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Adjacency List Creation:** `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges (flights).
- **Priority Queue Operations:** Each `push` and `pop` operation in the priority queue is `O(log(V + E))`. Over the entire algorithm, this results in `O((V + E) log(V + E))`.

Overall, the time complexity is **O((V + E) log(V + E))**, making the solution efficient even for relatively large inputs.
