[Leetcode 3169. Count Days Without Meetings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3169)
### Problem Statement

**3169. Count Days Without Meetings**

You are given a list of meetings, where each meeting is represented by a tuple or list with two elements: `[startDay, endDay]`. Each `startDay` and `endDay` is an integer representing the days on which the meeting starts and ends, respectively (inclusive).

Your task is to count the number of days when no meetings are scheduled.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: meetings = [[1, 3], [6, 7], [2, 5], [9, 10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Meetings are scheduled on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. Thus, there are 3 days without meetings (8, 11, 12).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the input days guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, all days are positive integers.

2. **Is the list of meetings sorted in any particular order?**
   - No, the list is not guaranteed to be sorted.

3. **What should we consider as the total range of days to check for non-meeting days?**
   - The range should span from the minimum `startDay` to the maximum `endDay` found in the list.

4. **Can there be meetings with overlapping days?**
   - Yes, there can be overlapping meetings.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the range of days to consider:**
   - First, find the minimum starting day and the maximum ending day.
  
2. **Track meeting days:**
   - Use a set to keep track of all days on which meetings occur.

3. **Count days without meetings:**
   - Iterate through the entire range from the minimum startDay to the maximum endDay, checking against the set of meeting days.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

int countDaysWithoutMeetings(const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& meetings) {
    if (meetings.empty()) return 0;

    int minDay = INT_MAX;
    int maxDay = INT_MIN;

    // Finding the range of days to consider
    for (const auto& meeting : meetings) {
        minDay = std::min(minDay, meeting.first);
        maxDay = std::max(maxDay, meeting.second);
    }

    // Using a set to track all days with meetings
    std::unordered_set<int> meetingDays;
    for (const auto& meeting : meetings) {
        for (int day = meeting.first; day <= meeting.second; ++day) {
            meetingDays.insert(day);
        }
    }

    // Counting the days without meetings
    int daysWithoutMeetings = 0;
    for (int day = minDay; day <= maxDay; ++day) {
        if (meetingDays.find(day) == meetingDays.end()) {
            ++daysWithoutMeetings;
        }
    }

    return daysWithoutMeetings;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> meetings = \{\{1, 3}, {6, 7}, {2, 5}, {9, 10}};
    std::cout << "Days without meetings: " << countDaysWithoutMeetings(meetings) << std::endl;
    // Output should be 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the range of days:** O(n), where `n` is the number of meetings.
- **Tracking meeting days using a set:** Suppose the total range from minDay to maxDay is `D`. The worst-case scenario involves adding all `D` days to the set, which is O(D).
- **Counting days without meetings:** O(D), as we iterate from minDay to maxDay.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n + D)**, where `n` is the number of meetings and `D` is the range from the smallest start day to the largest end day in the meetings.
