[Leetcode 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1910)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1910: **Remove All Occurrences of a Substring**

Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation repeatedly: find the leftmost occurrence of the substring `part` and remove it from the string `s`. Return the final string after all such operations have been performed.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
Output: "dab"
Explanation: The following operations are done:
             - s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove part = "abc" -> s = "dabaabcbc"
             - s = "dabaabcbc", remove part = "abc" -> s = "dabcbc"
             - s = "dabcbc", remove part = "abc" -> s = "dab"
```
**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= part.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `part` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are leading and trailing whitespaces allowed in the string `s` or `part`?**
   No, the problem statement ensures that `s` and `part` are lowercase English letters only.
   
2. **Will the substring `part` ever be empty?**
   No, as per the constraints `part.length >= 1`.

3. **Would `part` always exist in `s` initially?**
   Not necessarily. The problem requires checking and removing it iteratively until it no longer exists in `s`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. We will iteratively search for the substring `part` in `s`.
2. Whenever the substring `part` is found, we will remove it from `s`.
3. This process will be repeated until `part` no longer exists in `s`.

To implement this, string operations such as `find` to search for substrings and `replace` or `erase` can be utilized to modify the string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string removeOccurrences(std::string s, const std::string& part) {
    size_t pos;
    while ((pos = s.find(part)) != std::string::npos) {
        s.erase(pos, part.length());
    }
    return s;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "daabcbaabcbc";
    std::string part = "abc";
    std::string result = removeOccurrences(s, part);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the substring (find):** O(n) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Removing the substring (erase):** O(n) in the worst case because it may have to shift all the characters.
- **Total number of operations:** We might have to remove the substring multiple times.

Overall, in the worst case, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(m * n), where `m` is the length of the string `part` and `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is due to the repeated scanning and possible removal of `part` from `s`.
