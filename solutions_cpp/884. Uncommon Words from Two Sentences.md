[Leetcode 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l884)
### Problem Statement

You are given two sentences `s1` and `s2`. A word is considered uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence. You need to return a list of all the uncommon words.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - Can the input sentences be empty?
   - What is the maximum length of each sentence?
   - Are there any restrictions on the characters in the sentences?

2. **Output specifics**:
   - Should the order of uncommon words in the output list follow any specific order, e.g., sorted?

Given these questions, let's assume:
- Sentences are non-empty.
- Sentences contain only lowercase English letters and spaces.
- We do not need to sort the output list. It can be in any order.

### Strategy

1. **Count Word Frequencies**:
   - Use a hash map (unordered_map in C++) to count the frequency of each word in both sentences.
  
2. **Identify Uncommon Words**:
   - Once we have the word frequencies, iterate through the map and collect words that appear exactly once.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<string> uncommonFromSentences(string s1, string s2) {
    unordered_map<string, int> word_count;
    stringstream ss(s1 + " " + s2);
    string word;
    
    // Count the frequency of each word
    while (ss >> word) {
        word_count[word]++;
    }

    // Collect words that appear exactly once
    vector<string> result;
    for (const auto& entry : word_count) {
        if (entry.second == 1) {
            result.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    string s1 = "this apple is sweet";
    string s2 = "this apple is sour";
    vector<string> uncommon_words = uncommonFromSentences(s1, s2);
    
    for (const string& word : uncommon_words) {
        cout << word << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Word Counting**: We traverse each word in both sentences combined, which is an O(n) operation where n is the total number of characters in `s1 + s2`.
- **Frequency Map Construction**: Updating the unordered_map for each word also takes average O(1) time.
- **Collecting Uncommon Words**: Iterating over the hash map entries takes O(m) time where m is the number of unique words.

Overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n + m) \]
where n is the length of the combined sentences and m is the number of unique words.

### Space Complexity

- We use extra space for the unordered_map to store word frequencies, which will be at most O(m) where m is the number of unique words.
- The additional space for the resulting list of uncommon words also comes from the total number of unique words.

Thus, the space complexity is:
\[ O(m) \]

This solution should efficiently handle the problem within the given constraints.
