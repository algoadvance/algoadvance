[Leetcode 2811. Check if it is Possible to Split Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2811)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `m`. Initially, the given array is considered as a subarray of itself. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose a subarray of `nums` and split it into two non-empty subarrays if the sum of the elements of the chosen subarray is greater than or equal to `m`.

You need to determine whether it is possible to split the array into `n` subarrays where the sum of the elements in each subarray is at least `m`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums` and the value of `m`?
2. **Output Format**: Do we return a boolean value indicating whether it's possible to split the array?
3. **Sum Calculation**: Should we consider contiguous subarrays for splitting or any combination of the array?

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool canSplit(vector<int>& nums, int m) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int total_sum = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        total_sum += nums[i];
    }

    if (total_sum < m*n) return false;

    vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + nums[i-1];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; ++i) {
        int left_sum = dp[i+1] - dp[0];
        int right_sum = dp[n] - dp[i+1];
        
        if (left_sum >= m && right_sum >= m) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {7, 3, 9, 5, 4};
    int m = 10;
    bool result = canSplit(nums, m);
    if(result) {
        cout << "Possible to split the array." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Not possible to split the array." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Sum Check**: First, calculate the total sum of the array. If the total sum is less than `m` times the length of the array, it is impossible to split the array as required.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We use a prefix sum array `dp` to store the cumulative sum up to each index. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.
3. **Splitting the Array**: We iterate through the array and try to split it at every possible position, checking if both resulting subarrays have sums greater than or equal to `m`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves a single pass to calculate the total sum and another pass to calculate the prefix sums, both of which take `O(n)` time.
- **Space Complexity**: We use an additional array `dp` of size `n+1` for prefix sums, leading to `O(n)` space complexity.

Overall, the solution efficiently checks if the array can be split as required in `O(n)` time.
