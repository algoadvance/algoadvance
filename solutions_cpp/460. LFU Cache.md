[Leetcode 460. LFU Cache](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l460)
## Problem Statement

Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.

Implement the `LFUCache` class:

- `LFUCache(int capacity)` initializes the LFU cache with the capacity.
- `int get(int key)` gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, return -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` updates the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, adds the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least frequently used key.
  - When there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys have the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the range of the capacity?
   **A**: Capacity can be any non-negative integer. If the capacity is 0, the cache should not store any entries.
   
2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the key and the value?
   **A**: Typically, key and value are integers.

3. **Q**: How frequent are operations expected to be? Are they evenly distributed?
   **A**: That is not specified, but we need to ensure operations are efficient to handle large inputs.

## Strategy

To implement an LFU Cache, we need to track the frequency of access for each key and also ensure that when evictions are needed, we remove the least frequently used key. The key components of the strategy will include:

1. **Key-Value Map:** To store the actual key-value pairs.
2. **Key-Frequency Map:** To keep track of how frequently each key is accessed.
3. **Frequency-Doubly LinkedList Map:** To keep track of which keys have particular frequencies and to maintain the order of insertion within each frequency bucket for LRU functionality.
4. **Min Frequency Tracker:** To keep track of the minimum frequency for efficient eviction decisions.

**Data Structures:**

1. **Hash Map** for `key-value` storage.
2. **Hash Map** for `key-frequency` tracking.
3. **Hash Map of Doubly Linked List** storing keys for each frequency.
4. **Doubly Linked List** Node to store keys to maintain the order of usage within the same frequency.

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <list>

class LFUCache {
private:
    int capacity, minFreq;
    std::unordered_map<int, int> keyValue;
    std::unordered_map<int, int> keyFreq;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::list<int>> freqList;
    std::unordered_map<int, std::list<int>::iterator> keyIter;

public:
    LFUCache(int capacity) : capacity(capacity), minFreq(0) {}

    int get(int key) {
        if (keyValue.find(key) == keyValue.end()) {
            return -1;
        }
        increaseFreq(key);
        return keyValue[key];
    }

    void put(int key, int value) {
        if (capacity == 0) return; // No capacity
        
        if (keyValue.find(key) != keyValue.end()) {
            keyValue[key] = value;
            increaseFreq(key);
            return;
        }

        if (keyValue.size() == capacity) {
            evict();
        }

        keyValue[key] = value;
        keyFreq[key] = 1;
        freqList[1].push_front(key);
        keyIter[key] = freqList[1].begin();
        minFreq = 1;
    }

private:
    void increaseFreq(int key) {
        int freq = keyFreq[key];
        freqList[freq].erase(keyIter[key]);
        if (freqList[freq].empty() && freq == minFreq) {
            minFreq += 1;
        }
        keyFreq[key]++;
        freqList[freq + 1].push_front(key);
        keyIter[key] = freqList[freq + 1].begin();
    }

    void evict() {
        int key = freqList[minFreq].back();
        keyValue.erase(key);
        keyFreq.erase(key);
        keyIter.erase(key);
        freqList[minFreq].pop_back();
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **get(int key)**:
   - **Average Case**: \( O(1) \), because accessing and updating the hash maps and linked lists takes constant time.
   
2. **put(int key, int value)**:
   - **Average Case**: \( O(1) \), insertion and eviction operations also generally take constant time due to efficient data structures used.

This design ensures effective constant-time complexity for both `get` and `put` operations, making it suitable for handling a large number of cache operations efficiently.
