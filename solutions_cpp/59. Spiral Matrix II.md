[Leetcode 59. Spiral Matrix II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l59)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n x n` matrix filled with elements from `1` to `n^2` in spiral order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`? 
     - Typically, `1 <= n <= 20` for such problems, but we should confirm.
   
2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be a 2D matrix?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How do we handle the smallest case where `n = 1`?

Assuming the problem follows the typical constraints and output format:

#### Example

Given `n = 3`, the output should be:
```
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 8, 9, 4 ],
 [ 7, 6, 5 ]
]
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D vector `matrix` with dimensions `n x n` and initialize with zeros or empty values.
   - Keep track of the current number to put in the matrix.

2. **Direction Vectors:**
   - Use four direction vectors to move right, down, left, and up.

3. **Boundaries:**
   - Maintain four boundary variables (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`), initialized as `0`, `n-1`, `0`, and `n-1` respectively.

4. **Filling Logic:**
   - While there are elements to fill (`current_num <= n*n`):
     - Traverse from left to right along the top boundary, then increment the top boundary.
     - Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary, then decrement the right boundary.
     - Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary, then decrement the bottom boundary.
     - Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, then increment the left boundary.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> generateMatrix(int n) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
    int current_num = 1;
    int left = 0, right = n - 1, top = 0, bottom = n - 1;

    while (current_num <= n * n) {
        // Traverse from left to right along the top boundary.
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            matrix[top][i] = current_num++;
        }
        top++;

        // Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary.
        for (int i = top; i <= bottom; ++i) {
            matrix[i][right] = current_num++;
        }
        right--;

        // Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary.
        for (int i = right; i >= left; --i) {
            matrix[bottom][i] = current_num++;
        }
        bottom--;

        // Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary.
        for (int i = bottom; i >= top; --i) {
            matrix[i][left] = current_num++;
        }
        left++;
    }

    return matrix;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\), since every element is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the space required to store the `n x n` matrix.

This approach efficiently fills the matrix in a spiral order while maintaining ease of implementation and understanding.
