[Leetcode 2397. Maximum Rows Covered by Columns](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2397)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary matrix `mat` of size `m x n` and an integer `k`. The matrix represents a grid of `m` rows and `n` columns. Each cell in the matrix has a value of either `0` or `1`. 

You can choose at most `k` columns and cover all the rows that have all `1`s in these chosen columns. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of rows that can be covered by choosing at most `k` columns.

### Strategy
1. **Subset Enumeration**: We need to evaluate all possible combinations of columns of size `k` from `n` columns to find the subset of columns that covers the maximum number of rows.
2. **Filtering Rows**: For each subset of columns, we will count how many rows are fully covered.
3. **Optimization**: Use bit masking to efficiently generate column subsets.

### Code

Here is the C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRows(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat, int cols) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        int maxRowsCovered = 0;

        // Generate all possible combinations of columns to choose
        std::vector<int> allCols(n);
        std::iota(allCols.begin(), allCols.end(), 0);
        
        // Utility function to calculate rows covered by a given combination
        auto rowsCoveredByCombination = [&](const std::vector<int>& columnsChosen) {
            std::unordered_set<int> coveredRows;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                bool rowCovered = std::all_of(columnsChosen.begin(), columnsChosen.end(), [&](int col) {
                    return mat[i][col] == 1;
                });
                if (rowCovered) {
                    coveredRows.insert(i);
                }
            }
            return coveredRows.size();
        };
        
        // Use bitmask to generate combinations of columns of size cols
        int combinations = 1 << n; // 2^n combinations
        for (int mask = 0; mask < combinations; ++mask) {
            int countOfSetBits = __builtin_popcount(mask);
            if (countOfSetBits == cols) {
                std::vector<int> columnsChosen;
                for (int idx = 0; idx < n; ++idx) {
                    if (mask & (1 << idx)) {
                        columnsChosen.push_back(idx);
                    }
                }
                int coveredRows = rowsCoveredByCombination(columnsChosen);
                maxRowsCovered = std::max(maxRowsCovered, coveredRows);
            }
        }
        
        return maxRowsCovered;
    }
};
```

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the problem, you might want to clarify a few questions:
1. Can `k` be greater than `n`? (According to typical constraints, it should not be.)
2. Should we consider rows with all `0`s as "covered"? (Typically, no; the goal is to cover rows with `1`s.)

### Time Complexity
- **Combination Generation**: Generating all possible combinations of `k` columns from `n` columns involves evaluating `C(n, k)` (binomial coefficients), which can be quite large.
- **Bitmask Operations**: This is performed in `O(2^n)`.
- **Row Coverage Check**: For each combination, evaluating all the rows takes `O(m * k)` time in the worst case.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(2^n * m * k)`, which may be acceptable for small values of `n`, but potentially infeasible for larger `n`. 

This solution is exhaustive and aims to cover all possible subsets to guarantee the optimal outcome.
