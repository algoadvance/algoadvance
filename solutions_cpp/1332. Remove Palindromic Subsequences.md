[Leetcode 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1332)
## Problem Statement

We are given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'. A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `s` by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

The task is to remove **all** characters from the string `s` using the minimum number of operations, where in each operation you can choose a **palindromic subsequence** and remove it from `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a palindromic subsequence?**
    - A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "aba" is a palindromic subsequence.

2. **Can the string `s` be empty?**
    - Yes, the string `s` can be empty. If `s` is empty, it doesn't need any operations since it's already empty.

3. **What is the length limit of `s`?**
    - The typical constraint for problems like this on LeetCode is 1≤|s|≤1000, where |s| is the length of the string.

With these understandings, we can move towards solving the problem.

## Strategy

1. **Check if the string is empty**: If `s` is empty, return 0 since no operations are needed.

2. **Check if the string is a palindrome**: If the string `s` is a palindrome, you can remove the entire string in one operation because the whole string itself is a palindromic subsequence.

3. **General Case**: If `s` is not a palindrome, we can always remove all 'a's in one operation and all 'b's in another operation. Thus, the answer will be 2.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int removePalindromeSub(std::string s) {
        if (s.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (isPalindrome(s)) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 2;
    }

private:
    bool isPalindrome(const std::string& s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            ++left;
            --right;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Checking if a string is a palindrome**: This operation takes O(n) time where `n` is the length of the string `s` since we need to compare each character with its corresponding character from the end.

2. **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity of the `removePalindromeSub` function is O(n) due to the palindrome check.

This solution ensures we efficiently tackle the problem with optimal operations based on whether the string is a palindrome or not.
