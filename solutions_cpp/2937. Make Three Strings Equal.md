[Leetcode 2937. Make Three Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2937)
### Problem Statement

You are given three binary strings `s1`, `s2`, and `target`, of the same length. The goal is to make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal to the `target` string by performing the following operation any number of times (possibly zero times):

- Pick any character in `s1` or `s2` and replace it with its complement ('0' becomes '1' and '1' becomes '0').

Return `true` if you can make both `s1` and `s2` equal to `target`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the length constraints of `s1`, `s2`, and `target`?
     - All strings have the same length \( n \) with \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).

2. **Character Set**:
   - Can the strings contain characters other than '0' and '1'?
     - No, the strings contain only '0' and '1'.

3. **Operations on the strings**:
   - Can we pick any character at any position to flip?
     - Yes, you can flip any character at any position in `s1` or `s2`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Position Analysis**:
   Compare each character position `i` of `s1`, `s2`, and `target`.
   
2. **Condition Check**:
   Determine if it's possible to make both `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` equal to `target[i]`:
   - If `target[i] == '0'`, then both `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` should be convertible to '0'. This means `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` can be either '0' or '1', but not both being '1' at the same time (because flipping one will make it zero).
   - If `target[i] == '1'`, then at least one of `s1[i]` or `s2[i]` should be '1'.

3. **Iteration and Verification**:
   Iterate through each character and check if the above conditions hold for each index. If even one condition fails, return `false`.

### Example Walkthrough
- Example 1:
  - `s1` = "1100", `s2` = "1010", `target` = "1010"
      - At index 0: `target` is '1' and one of `s1` or `s2` has '1', which is valid.
      - At index 1: `target` is '0' and both `s1` and `s2` have '0' or one can be made '0'; valid.
      - At index 2: `target` is '1' and one of `s1` or `s2` has '1'; valid.
      - At index 3: `target` is '0' and both `s1` and `s2` have '0' or one can be made '0'; valid.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool makeStringsEqual(std::string s1, std::string s2, std::string target) {
    int n = s1.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        char t = target[i];
        if (t == '0') {
            if (s1[i] == '1' && s2[i] == '1') {
                return false;
            }
        } else if (t == '1') {
            if (s1[i] == '0' && s2[i] == '0') {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "1100", s2 = "1010", target = "1010";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << makeStringsEqual(s1, s2, target) << std::endl; // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the binary strings. This is because we only need to iterate once through the list of characters in the strings to validate the conditions.
