[Leetcode 1563. Stone Game V](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1563)
Certainly! Let's go through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. This time, they are playing "Stone Game V". The rules of the game are as follows:

- There are several piles of stones arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`.
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. On each player's turn, they can split any one pile into exactly two non-empty equal piles.
- After they split a pile, they take the pile which has a larger total number of stones (or any one if the two piles have the same total).
- The game ends when either player cannot make a move (i.e., all piles are indivisible or have no stones).
- The player with the higher total number of stones at the end of the game wins.

Return the maximum number of stones Alice can get if both players play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Split Condition**: Can a pile be split into two piles that are not necessarily equal?
   - The provided problem implies any split as long as they can pick the larger resultant pile. They split it relative to the maximum stone count in those splits.

2. **Ending Condition**: Does the game end only when no more splits can be made?
   - Yes, the game ends when no more splits can be made or useful decisions remain.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum**: Use a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of subarrays.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a 2D DP array to store the maximum scores Alice can get in each range `[i, j]` considering both players play optimally.
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the maximum score Alice can collect from the subarray `piles[i]` to `piles[j]` inclusive.
   - For each possible split point `k` from `i` to `j-1`, calculate the score by splitting the subarray `[i, j]` into `[i, k]` and `[k+1, j]`, and compute the potential maximum scores for both subarrays recursively.
3. **Optimal Split Search**: For each split, recursively compute results for both split parts and determine the best scenario.

### Time Complexity

The solution involves evaluating subarrays and split points multiple times, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^3)` due to nested iterations over split points and subarray calculations. We can try optimizing it using memoization (DP).

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> dp;
    vector<int> prefixSum;

    int stoneGameV(vector<int>& stoneValue) {
        int n = stoneValue.size();
        dp.resize(n, vector<int>(n, -1));
        prefixSum.resize(n + 1, 0);

        // Calculate prefix sums
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stoneValue[i];
        }

        return dfs(stoneValue, 0, n - 1);
    }

    int dfs(vector<int>& stoneValue, int left, int right) {
        // Base case
        if (left == right) return 0;
        if (dp[left][right] != -1) return dp[left][right];

        int maxStones = 0;

        // Try all possible splits
        for (int k = left; k < right; ++k) {
            int leftSum = prefixSum[k + 1] - prefixSum[left];
            int rightSum = prefixSum[right + 1] - prefixSum[k + 1];
            if (leftSum < rightSum) {
                maxStones = max(maxStones, leftSum + dfs(stoneValue, left, k));
            } else if (leftSum > rightSum) {
                maxStones = max(maxStones, rightSum + dfs(stoneValue, k + 1, right));
            } else {
                maxStones = max(maxStones, max(leftSum + dfs(stoneValue, left, k), rightSum + dfs(stoneValue, k + 1, right)));
            }
        }

        dp[left][right] = maxStones;
        return maxStones;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: `prefixSum` array to store the prefix sum of stones.
2. **DFS with Memoization**: The `dfs` function evaluates the maximum stones Alice can collect from a subarray, using memoization to save results of already computed subarrays.
3. **Split Evaluation**: For each split point, it calculates the sums for left and right parts and recursively determines the maximum possible stones Alice can collect.

This approach ensures we consider all possible optimal moves for Alice and Bob for each possible subarray split until no more moves can be made.
