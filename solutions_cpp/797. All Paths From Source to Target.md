[Leetcode 797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l797)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed, acyclic graph (DAG) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a list of `n` lists. Each list `graph[i]` is a list of nodes `i` can travel to directly. 

Your task is to find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Input:**
   - Should I assume a valid DAG is always provided?
   - Is it guaranteed that there will always be at least one path from node `0` to node `n-1`?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the paths be in any specific order like lexicographical, or is any order acceptable?

Assuming the answers to these questions are yes for a valid DAG, yes for at least one path, and any order is acceptable, let's proceed to design the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Utilize DFS to explore all possible paths from the source node `0` to the target node `n-1`.
   - Use a path list to keep track of nodes in the current path.
   - Once the target node is reached, add the current path to the results list.

2. **Backtracking:**
   - After exploring all paths from a node, backtrack to explore alternative paths.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int>>& result, int node) {
        // Add node to the current path
        path.push_back(node);
        
        // If we reach the last node, add the path to the result
        if (node == graph.size() - 1) {
            result.push_back(path);
        } else {
            // Recursively visit all adjacent nodes
            for (int nextNode : graph[node]) {
                dfs(graph, path, result, nextNode);
            }
        }
        
        // Backtrack
        path.pop_back();
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> path;
        dfs(graph, path, result, 0);
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> graph = {{1, 2}, {3}, {3}, {}};
    vector<vector<int>> result = sol.allPathsSourceTarget(graph);
    
    for (const auto& path : result) {
        for (int node : path) {
            cout << node << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Let `V` be the number of vertices and `E` be the number of edges in the graph.
- **Time Complexity:** 
  - In the worst case, we explore all possible paths from the source to the target, which can be exponential in nature. Therefore, the time complexity can be represented as `O(2^V * V)`. The `2^V` part comes from the number of possible paths and `V` comes from the cost of copying the path to the result.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(V)` for the recursion stack used in DFS and the path list. Additionally, we store the result, which in the worst case can have up to `2^V` paths, each of length `V`.

This method should efficiently find all paths from the source to the target node in a DAG, adhering to the given problem's requirements.
