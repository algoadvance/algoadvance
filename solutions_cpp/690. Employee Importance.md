[Leetcode 690. Employee Importance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l690)
### Problem Statement

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, their importance value, and their direct subordinates' ids.

You are asked to implement a function that takes two arguments, a list of `employees` and an integer `id`. The list of `employees` contains Employee objects. Each `Employee` object has the following attributes:
- `int id`
- `int importance`
- `vector<int> subordinates`

The goal of the function is to return the total importance value of the employee with the given id, along with all their subordinates' importance values.

Here is how the `Employee` class is defined:

```cpp
class Employee {
public:
    int id;
    int importance;
    vector<int> subordinates;
};
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validation:** Should I assume that the inputs are always valid, or do I need to handle cases where the given id does not exist in the list of employees?
2. **Unique IDs:** Can I assume that all employee IDs are unique?
3. **Non-empty List:** Can the `employees` list be empty?

*(Assuming positive answers for clarification 1 and 2, and handling the edge case for 3.)*

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Create a Mapping:** Create a hash map (or unordered_map) to easily access any employee's data using their `id`.
2. **DFS Function:** Implement a helper DFS function to recursively compute the total importance value by traversing through each employee's subordinates.
3. **Base Case and Recursion:** In the DFS function, for each subordinate, call the DFS function recursively to accumulate their importance values.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Employee {
public:
    int id;
    int importance;
    vector<int> subordinates;
};

class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        // Create a map for quick lookup of employee by id
        unordered_map<int, Employee*> employeeMap;
        for (auto employee : employees) {
            employeeMap[employee->id] = employee;
        }
        
        // DFS function to calculate total importance
        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int employeeId) -> int {
            Employee* employee = employeeMap[employeeId];
            int totalImportance = employee->importance;
            for (int subId : employee->subordinates) {
                totalImportance += dfs(subId);
            }
            return totalImportance;
        };
        
        // Start DFS from the given employee id
        return dfs(id);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Map:** O(N), where N is the number of employees. We iterate through the list once to build the hash map.
- **DFS traversal:** O(N), in the worst case, we might visit each employee once when calculating the importance.
- **Overall:** O(N). The total time complexity is linear with respect to the number of employees.

This ensures that the solution is efficient and scales well with the size of the input.
