[Leetcode 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1611)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, you need to transform it into `0` using a series of operations. In one operation, you can change exactly one bit in its binary representation from `1` to `0` or from `0` to `1`. Find the minimum number of such operations needed.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed, let's clarify a few details to ensure we understand the problem correctly:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is `n` always non-negative? (i.e., \( n \geq 0 \))
   - What is the range of `n`? (e.g., \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^9 \))

2. **Operations Allowed**:
   - Confirm whether the operations are restricted to changing just one bit at a time.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - The output should be the minimum number of operations required to transform the binary representation of `n` to `0`.

These questions help further refine our understanding and assumptions about the problem.

### Strategy
To transform the integer `n` to `0` with a minimal number of operations, we need to look deeper into how the operations affect the binary representation of `n`.

We can use a recursive formula to derive the number of operations needed:
1. For \( F(0) = 0 \)
2. For \( F(2^k - 1) = 2F(2^{k-1} - 1) + 1 \)
3. For \( n \) in general, break it down into segments that can be operated on individually.

We note that converting a contiguous sequence of bits from all 1s to 0 is non-trivial. Therefore, we will use bit manipulation techniques to achieve the desired results.

### Code
Here is a C++ implementation to achieve the transformation using the recursive strategy.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        return minimumOneBitOperationsHelper(n);
    }
    
private:
    int minimumOneBitOperationsHelper(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        int highestBit = 0;
        while ((1 << highestBit) <= n) {
            highestBit++;
        }
        highestBit--;
        
        int nextNum = n ^ (1 << highestBit);
        
        return (1 << highestBit) - 1 + 1 + minimumOneBitOperationsHelper(nextNum);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 3; // Example input
    std::cout << "Minimum operations to make " << n << " to zero: " 
              << solution.minimumOneBitOperations(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm recursively reduces the number size by taking the highest significant bit and operating on the rest.
- The time complexity is \( O(\log n) \) because we reduce the size of `n` roughly by half at each step, making it logarithmic with respect to the value of `n`.

This approach effectively minimizes the operations needed to transform `n` to `0` bit by bit.
