[Leetcode 805. Split Array With Same Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l805)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers `nums`, and your goal is to split the array into two parts `A` and `B` such that the average of both parts is the same. More formally, let the size of `A` be `m` and the size of `B` be `n`. The condition to satisfy is:
\[ \text{average}(A) = \text{average}(B) \]
\[ \frac{\sum_{A}}{m} = \frac{\sum_{B}}{n} \]
If it is possible to split the array `nums` into such parts `A` and `B`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the elements in `nums` have negative values?**
   - Let's assume the array can have negative values unless specified otherwise.

2. **Do parts A and B need to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, both parts need to be non-empty.

3. **Can we modify the parts A and B if already chosen or assign only one element to both parts?**
   - We can't choose the same element for both parts, but we can freely distribute elements between parts A and B.

4. **Is there a size constraint on the array `nums`?**
   - No specific size constraints, but typical competitive programming limits apply.

### Strategy:

To determine if we can split the array, we'll utilize dynamic programming and the concept of subsets with equal averages:
1. Calculate the total sum of the array and its length.
2. Compute the required average.
3. Use dynamic programming to find if a subset with a sum that matches the "required_sum" and size exists for the required average.

#### Detailed steps:

1. Calculate `sum(nums)` and `n = nums.size()`.
2. Iterate all possible values of `len` from 1 to `n/2` (this limits the size of subset A).
3. Calculate the possible required sums as `sumA = total_sum * len / n`. If `sumA` is not integer, continue to the next `len`.
4. Use dynamic programming to check if there's a subset of size `len` with sum `sumA`.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> 
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    bool splitArraySameAverage(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int total_sum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        for (int len = 1; len <= n / 2; ++len) {
            if ((total_sum * len) % n != 0) continue;
            int required_sum = (total_sum * len) / n;

            if (canFindSubset(nums, len, required_sum)) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

private:
    bool canFindSubset(const std::vector<int>& nums, int len, int target_sum) {
        std::vector<std::unordered_set<int>> dp(len + 1);
        dp[0].insert(0);

        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int i = len; i >= 1; --i) {
                for (auto it = dp[i-1].begin(); it != dp[i-1].end(); ++it) {
                    dp[i].insert(*it + num);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[len].find(target_sum) != dp[len].end();
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the implementation:
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Checking subset sums using dynamic programming for each possible subset size takes \(O(n \cdot \text{sum})\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity can be approximated to \(O(n \cdot \text{sum})\), where `sum` is the total sum of elements in the array. In practical terms, this can be very efficient for reasonably sized inputs but may struggle on extremely large or high-sum inputs.
