[Leetcode 2564. Substring XOR Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2564)
## Problem Statement

**2564. Substring XOR Queries**

You are given a binary string `s`. You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[i] = [first_i, second_i]`.

For each query `i`:

1. Find the substring that starts at index `first_i` and ends at second_i (both inclusive).
2. Compute the decimal value of XOR of all characters of the substring. Here, '0' and '1' are considered as 0 and 1 respectively.
3. Return an array containing the XOR values for each query.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validations**: Is it guaranteed that the indices in each query will be valid (within the bounds of the string)?
2. **String Length**: What is the maximum length of the binary string `s`?
3. **Number of Queries**: How many queries can we expect at most?

## Strategy

1. **Input Reading**: Read the binary string `s` and the array of queries.
2. **Substrings Generation**: For each query, extract the substring based on the provided indices.
3. **XOR Calculation**: Calculate XOR of all the characters in the extracted substring.
4. **Result Storage**: Store the result for each query and finally return the array of results.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> substringXorQueries(string s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> results;
    
    for(const auto& query : queries) {
        int first = query[0];
        int second = query[1];
        int xor_result = 0;
        
        for(int i = first; i <= second; ++i) {
            // XOR for '0' and '1' where '0' is treated as 0 and '1' is treated as 1
            int bit_value = s[i] - '0';
            xor_result ^= bit_value;
        }
        
        // Append result for the current query
        results.push_back(xor_result);
    }
    
    return results;
}

int main() {
    string s = "10101"; // example input
    vector<vector<int>> queries = {{0, 1}, {1, 3}, {0, 4}};
    
    vector<int> result = substringXorQueries(s, queries);
    
    // Output the results
    for(int res : result) {
        cout << res << " ";
    }
}
// Output: 1 0 1
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Substring Extraction and XOR Calculation**: For each query, we loop from `first` to `second` index in the substring. This takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of the substring.
2. **Overall Complexity**: If there are `q` queries and the length of the string `s` is `m`, the overall complexity will be `O(q * m)` in the worst case scenario.

This solution should be efficient for moderate input sizes, but for very large inputs, further optimizations may be necessary.
