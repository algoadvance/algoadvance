[Leetcode 1898. Maximum Number of Removable Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1898)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `p` and an array of integers `removable`, where `s` is the main string, `p` is a pattern string, and `removable[i]` gives the index in `s` of a character that is allowed to be removed. The goal is to determine the maximum number of characters we can remove from `s` to still make `p` a subsequence of the modified `s`.

**Example:**

```text
Input: s = "abcacb", p = "ab", removable = [3,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: After removing characters at indices 3 and 1, the resulting string is "accb", and "ab" is still a subsequence.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the indices in `removable` guaranteed to be valid indices of `s`?**
   - Yes, they are guaranteed to be valid indices, within the range `[0, len(s) - 1]`.

2. **Is there a maximum length constraint for the strings `s`, `p` or the array `removable`?**
   - Assume that the lengths of `s`, `p`, and `removable` are within reasonable constraints typically seen in interview problems (e.g., length <= 10^5).

3. **Can `p` be empty?**
   - Yes, `p` can be empty, in which case the maximum number of removable characters would be the length of `removable`.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search:**
   - Use binary search to determine the maximum number of characters that can be removed such that `p` is still a subsequence of `s`.
   
2. **Subsequence Check:**
   - To check if `p` is still a subsequence of `s` after removing certain characters, we can simulate the removal process and then check the subsequence condition.

3. **Simulate Removal Efficiently:**
   - Use a set to keep track of characters that are removed based on the current binary search midpoint. We then traverse `s` and `p` to ensure that all characters of `p` appear in order in the modified `s`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRemovals(string s, string p, vector<int>& removable) {
        int left = 0, right = removable.size();
        
        // Helper function to check if p is a subsequence of s after removing `k` elements
        auto isSubsequenceAfterRemoval = [&](int k) {
            unordered_set<int> removedIndices(removable.begin(), removable.begin() + k);
            int i = 0, j = 0;
            while (i < s.size() && j < p.size()) {
                // Skip characters at removed indices
                if (removedIndices.find(i) == removedIndices.end() && s[i] == p[j]) {
                    j++;
                }
                i++;
            }
            // Check if we have fully matched p
            return j == p.size();
        };
        
        // Binary search over the number of removals
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isSubsequenceAfterRemoval(mid + 1)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** O(log N)
- **isSubsequenceAfterRemoval Check:** O(M + N) where M is the length of `s` and N is the length of `p`
- **Overall Complexity:** O((M + N) log K) where K is the size of the `removable` array. This ensures efficiency given the constraints.

### Note:

This solution leverages binary search to iteratively check for the maximum `k` where removal of `k` elements will still allow `p` to be a subsequence of `s`. The subsequence check ensures that all required characters of `p` appear in sequence in the modified `s`.
