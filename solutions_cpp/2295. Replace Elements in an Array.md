[Leetcode 2295. Replace Elements in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2295)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` that consists of `n` distinct integers. You are also given a 2D array `operations` where `operations[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you should replace the value `ai` with `bi` in `nums`.

You need to perform all the operations in the given order and return the array once all operations have been performed.

### Example

```cpp
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6], operations = [[1,3],[4,7],[6,1]]
Output: [3,2,7,1]

Explanation: We perform the following operations on nums:
- Replace 1 with 3 => [3,2,4,6]
- Replace 4 with 7 => [3,2,7,6]
- Replace 6 with 1 => [3,2,7,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `nums` and `operations`:** 
   - Are the lengths of `nums` and `operations` finite and relatively small, or are they large enough to make time complexity a concern?
   
   Response: Let's assume typical problem constraints, e.g., `1 <= nums.length, operations.length <= 10^4`.

2. **Are all values in `nums` and `operations` distinct?**
   - Confirming `nums` contains distinct integers and each `ai` in operations will exist in `nums`.

   Response: Yes, `nums` consists of n distinct integers, and each value `ai` in `operations` will exist in `nums`.

3. **Order of Operations:**
   - Do we have to strictly follow the order of `operations`?
   
   Response: Yes, operations must be performed in the given order.

### Strategy

To achieve the desired result efficiently, we will:

1. Use a hash map (unordered_map) to keep track of the indices of elements in `nums`. This will allow us to quickly find and replace an element in `nums` according to the operations.
2. Iterate through the `operations`, and for each operation, use the hash map to find the index in `nums` and perform the replacement.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

std::vector<int> replaceElements(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& operations) {
    // Create a hash map to store the current index of each number in nums
    std::unordered_map<int, int> indexMap;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        indexMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }

    // Process each operation
    for (const auto& operation : operations) {
        int from = operation[0];
        int to = operation[1];
        // Find the index of 'from' in nums
        int index = indexMap[from];
        // Update the mapping in nums and the hash map
        nums[index] = to;
        indexMap[to] = index;
        // Remove the old value from the map
        indexMap.erase(from);
    }

    return nums;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the initial hash map of indices takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- Processing each operation takes `O(1)` due to the constant-time operations on an unordered map.
- Overall, given `m` operations, the time complexity is `O(n + m)`.

This efficient approach ensures that we handle up to 10^4 elements and operations within acceptable time limits for typical competitive programming constraints.
