[Leetcode 2614. Prime In Diagonal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2614)
## Problem Statement
**2614. Prime In Diagonal**

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of size `n x n`. Return the largest prime number that lies on either of the two diagonals of `grid`. In case, no prime number is present on the diagonals, return 0.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 which is only divisible by 1 and itself.

A number `x` is said to be on a diagonal if there exists some index `i` for which any of the following is true:
- grid[i][i] == x (elements from top-left to bottom-right diagonal)
- grid[i][n - i - 1] == x (elements from top-right to bottom-left diagonal)

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the matrix always be a square matrix (i.e., `n x n`)?
   - Yes, the problem explicitly states that the grid is of size `n x n`.

2. What is the range of numbers in the matrix?
   - Any feasible range for the problem; typically within integer limits for general problems like this.

3. What is the value of `n`? Is it controlled within a specific range?
   - The value of `n` can vary but is typically manageable within the constraints of computational limits for interviews, say, from `1` to `1000`.

## Strategy
1. **Identify diagonal elements:**
   - From top-left to bottom-right: elements `grid[i][i]` for `i` in `0` to `n-1`.
   - From top-right to bottom-left: elements `grid[i][n-i-1]` for `i` in `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Check for prime numbers:**
   - Implement a helper function `isPrime(int num)` to determine if a number is prime.
   
3. **Find the largest prime:**
   - Iterate through the identified diagonal elements and keep track of the largest prime.

4. **Edge cases:**
   - Single-element matrices.
   - Edge matrices with 0 or no primes on the diagonals.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm> // for max function

bool isPrime(int num) {
    // Any number less than 2 is not a prime number
    if (num < 2) return false;
    // Check for factors from 2 up to the square root of num
    for (int i = 2; i <= std::sqrt(num); ++i) {
        if (num % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int largestPrimeInDiagonals(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int n = grid.size();
    int largest_prime = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int top_left_diag = grid[i][i];
        int top_right_diag = grid[i][n - i - 1];

        if (isPrime(top_left_diag)) {
            largest_prime = std::max(largest_prime, top_left_diag);
        }
        if (isPrime(top_right_diag)) {
            largest_prime = std::max(largest_prime, top_right_diag);
        }
    }

    return largest_prime;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Identification of diagonal elements:** O(n) as we only need to traverse `2 * n` elements.
- **Prime check:** The `isPrime` function will run at worst O(√m), where `m` is the number being checked. 
  - Since we apply this check across 2n elements in a worst-case scenario, overall complexity results in O(n * √m).

Thus, the approach remains efficient within the typical constraints of interview problems and ensures we quickly determine the largest prime present on the diagonals.
