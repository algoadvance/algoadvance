[Leetcode 2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2406)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents all the integers from start_i to end_i inclusive.

A group of intervals is a set of intervals such that no two intervals overlap.

Return the minimum number of groups you need to make to group all the intervals.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the interval endpoints inclusive or exclusive?**
   - The endpoints are inclusive.

2. **What are the constraints on the intervals?**
   - Each interval length can be from 1 to 10^7 and there can be up to 10^5 intervals.

3. **Are intervals sorted in any way?**
   - They are not guaranteed to be sorted.

4. **What is the range of the interval values?**
   - Interval start and end can be any integer within the system's typical integer range.

5. **Can intervals overlap at endpoints?**
   - Yes, since endpoints are inclusive.

Considering these inputs, our approach will focus on overlapping intervals efficiently.

## Strategy

1. **Transform the Problem**: Convert the problem into an event-scheduling one by breaking each interval into "start" and "end" events.
2. **Sort Events**: Sort the events. When two intervals have an event at the same time, process "start" events before "end" events.
3. **Sweep Line Algorithm**: Use a sweepline algorithm to count how many intervals overlap at any point. The peak number of simultaneous overlaps will determine the minimum number of groups needed.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minGroups(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> events;
    for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
        events.emplace_back(interval[0], 1);  // 'start' event
        events.emplace_back(interval[1] + 1, -1);  // 'end' event, +1 to ensure inclusive end interval
    }

    // Sort events; if times are equal, sort by type (start events before end events)
    sort(events.begin(), events.end());

    int maxGroups = 0;
    int currentGroups = 0;

    for (const auto& event : events) {
        currentGroups += event.second;
        maxGroups = max(maxGroups, currentGroups);
    }

    return maxGroups;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> intervals = \{\{1, 3}, {2, 5}, {6, 8}, {5, 6}};
    cout << minGroups(intervals) << endl;  // Output should be 2
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Events**: The most computationally intensive part is sorting the events, which takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of intervals multiplied by 2.
- **Sweep Line Processing**: The for-loop runs through at most `2n` events, each taking constant time `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures an efficient way to count overlapping intervals and determine the minimum number of groups to handle all intervals without overlaps.
