[Leetcode 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1935)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `text` of words that are separated by one or more spaces, and a string `brokenLetters` of lowercase English letters that contains some broken letters.

Return the number of words in the `text` you can fully type using the keyboard provided that the broken letters might not work properly for typing. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

## Example

- Example 1:
  - Input: `text = "hello world"`, `brokenLetters = "ad"`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: You can only type the word "world".

- Example 2:
  - Input: `text = "leet code"`, `brokenLetters = "lt"`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: You can only type the word "code".

- Example 3:
  - Input: `text = "leet code"`, `brokenLetters = "e"`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: You cannot type any word because "e" is broken.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the text contain uppercase letters or punctuation?
    - No, the text only contains lowercase English letters and spaces.
2. Can the `brokenLetters` string be empty?
    - Yes, if `brokenLetters` is empty, then all letters are functional, and all words can be typed.
3. Are there any constraints on the length of `text` and `brokenLetters`?
    - Both `text` and `brokenLetters` can be of length up to 10,000.

## Strategy

1. **Convert Broken Letters into Set:** Use a set for `brokenLetters` to enable O(1) average lookup time.
2. **Split Text into Words:** Split the `text` based on spaces to process each word separately.
3. **Check Each Word:** For each word, check if any character is in the `brokenLetters` set. If not, it can be typed.
4. **Count Typable Words:** Increment the count for each word that can be fully typed.

Steps:
1. Convert the `brokenLetters` string into a set for efficient lookup.
2. Split the `text` by spaces to get individual words.
3. For each word, check if any of its characters are in the `brokenLetters` set.
4. If a word doesn't contain any broken letters, increment the count.

## Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Set:** O(B), where B is the length of `brokenLetters`.
- **Splitting Text into Words:** O(T + W), where T is the length of the `text` and W is the number of words.
- **Checking Each Word:** O(W * L), where L is the average length of the words.

Overall, the time complexity is O(T + B + W * L).

## Code

Here’s how we can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

int canBeTypedWords(string text, string brokenLetters) {
    unordered_set<char> broken(brokenLetters.begin(), brokenLetters.end());
    istringstream iss(text);
    string word;
    int count = 0;
    bool canType = true;

    while (iss >> word) {
        canType = true;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (broken.find(c) != broken.end()) {
                canType = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (canType) count++;
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    string text = "hello world";
    string brokenLetters = "ad";
    cout << canBeTypedWords(text, brokenLetters) << endl; // Output: 1
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a set to store broken letters for fast lookup and processes each word by checking each character to see if it’s a broken letter. If a word doesn’t contain any broken letters, it is considered typable.
