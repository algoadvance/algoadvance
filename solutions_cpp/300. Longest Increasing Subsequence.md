[Leetcode 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l300)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

### Example:
**Input**: `nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`  
**Output**: `4`  
**Explanation**: The longest increasing subsequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`, therefore the length is 4.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, but the subsequence has to strictly increase, meaning duplicates cannot be part of the same subsequence.
2. **Is the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) required, or just its length?**
   - Only the length of the longest increasing subsequence is required.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). Here's a detailed plan:

1. **DP Array Initialization**:
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.

2. **State Transition**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check all previous elements `nums[j]` where `(j < i)` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`. Update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - Every element itself can be a subsequence, so initialize `dp[i] = 1` for all `i`.

4. **Result**:
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because, for each element, we potentially compare it with all previous elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input array `nums`. This is due to the extra space required for the `dp` array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        std::vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 1);
        int maxLength = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, dp[i]);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `dp` array is initiated with all entries as 1, since each element is a subsequence of length 1 by itself.
- **Nested Loops**: The outer loop iterates over each element `i`, and the inner loop compares element `i` with all previous elements `j`.
- **Condition Check**: If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, update `dp[i]` as the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.
- **Max Length Update**: After processing each `i`, update `maxLength` with the maximum value found in `dp[i]`.

Thus, the algorithm efficiently computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence in O(N^2) time complexity.
