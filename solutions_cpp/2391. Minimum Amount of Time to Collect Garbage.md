[Leetcode 2391. Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2391)
## Problem Statement

### 2391. Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage

Given the layout of houses on a street, each house may have garbage of three different types: `M` (metal), `P` (paper), and `G` (glass). Three garbage trucks start at the first house and need to collect all the garbage. Each garbage truck is responsible for collecting one type of garbage. 

The time it takes a truck to travel between adjacent houses is given by the array `travel`, where `travel[i]` represents the time to move from house `i` to house `i+1`.

You need to determine the minimum total time required to collect all the garbage. The trucks start at the first house (house index 0).

**Constraints:**

- `garbage.length == n`
- `travel.length == n - 1`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `garbage[i]` consists of characters 'M', 'P', and 'G'.
- `1 <= travel[i] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does each truck independently travel, or can they travel together?**
   - Each truck travels independently for the type of garbage it collects.

2. **When counting the time, does each truck start immediately from house 0 or do they wait for the others to finish first?**
   - Each truck operates independently and starts at house 0.

3. **Are the time units for collecting and traveling considered the same?**
   - Yes, both collecting garbage and traveling between houses use the same time units.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Collection at House 0:**
   - Each truck collects garbage at house 0 if present.

2. **Collecting and Traveling:**
   - For each subsequent house, the respective truck moves to it and collects garbage if present there.

3. **Identify Last House Per Truck:**
   - Each type of garbage truck only needs to move up to the furthest house that contains its garbage.

4. **Time Calculation:**
   - Calculating total time involves summing collection and transition times for each type of truck.

To optimize, maintain separate counters for the last position visited by each truck and travel time up to that position.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int minTimeToCollectGarbage(vector<string>& garbage, vector<int>& travel) {
    int total_time = 0;
    vector<int> last_position(3, 0); // M, P, G positions
    vector<int> travel_time(3, 0);

    int n = garbage.size();

    // Collect garbage at each house, count occurrences and update last position
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (char ch : garbage[i]) {
            if (ch == 'M') last_position[0] = i;
            if (ch == 'P') last_position[1] = i;
            if (ch == 'G') last_position[2] = i;
            total_time++;
        }
    }

    // Sum the travel time required for each truck
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i <= last_position[0]) travel_time[0] += travel[i-1];
        if (i <= last_position[1]) travel_time[1] += travel[i-1];
        if (i <= last_position[2]) travel_time[2] += travel[i-1];
    }

    // Total time includes the travel time for each truck
    total_time += travel_time[0] + travel_time[1] + travel_time[2];

    return total_time;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> garbage = {"G","P","GP","GG"};
    vector<int> travel = {2, 4, 3};
    cout << minTimeToCollectGarbage(garbage, travel) << endl; // Expected output: 21
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization and Collection (O(n)):** We iterate through each house and each piece of garbage once.
- **Aggregation of Travel Times (O(n)):** We iterate through the travel array looking for the distances up to the last house for each garbage truck.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, given that we process each element in the garbage and travel arrays a constant number of times. This is efficient and satisfies the constraints provided.
