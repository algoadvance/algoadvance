[Leetcode 2412. Minimum Money Required Before Transactions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2412)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode problem 2412, "Minimum Money Required Before Transactions," asks you to determine the minimum initial amount of money required to complete all given transactions in any order. Each transaction is represented as a pair of integers, where the first integer is the cost of the transaction and the second integer is the cashback received after completing the transaction.

**Example:**
- For transactions = [[2, 1], [5, 0], [4, 2]], the minimum initial money required is 6.

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding to the solution, let’s clarify some points to understand the problem better:

1. **Are the transactions processed in a specific order?**
   - Any order can be selected to process transactions.
   
2. **What is the range of values for the cost and cashback?**
   - It’s important to know the possible range for an efficient solution.

3. **Is there always a solution provided the transactions list is non-empty?**
   - Yes.

Now let’s proceed to solve the problem.

## Strategy

To achieve the minimum initial amount required, we need to take care of the worst-case scenario, where we might need to spend more money upfront before getting cashback. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Classify Transactions**: Separate the transactions into two categories:
   - Transactions with non-positive net cost (cost ≤ cashback)
   - Transactions with positive net cost (cost > cashback)

2. **Sort Transactions**:
   - Transactions with non-positive net cost (cost ≤ cashback) can be processed in any order.
   - For transactions with positive net cost (cost > cashback), sort them in descending order of their net cost. This ensures that we handle more costly transactions first when we have more money.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Initial Money**:
   - Simulate the transactions starting with an initial amount and keep track of the maximum money needed at any point in time.

## Code

Let's write the C++ code implementing this strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumMoney(vector<vector<int>>& transactions) {
        int initial_money = 0, current_money = 0;
        
        // Vector to store transactions with positive net cost
        vector<vector<int>> pos_cost;
        
        for (auto &t : transactions) {
            int cost = t[0], cashback = t[1];
            if (cost > cashback) {
                pos_cost.push_back(t);
            } else {
                current_money += cost - cashback;
            }
        }
        
        // Sort transactions with positive net cost by the maximum of cost
        sort(pos_cost.begin(), pos_cost.end(), [](const vector<int> &a, const vector<int> &b) {
            return (a[0] - a[1]) > (b[0] - b[1]);
        });
        
        for (auto &t : pos_cost) {
            int cost = t[0], cashback = t[1];
            initial_money = max(initial_money, current_money + cost);
            current_money += cost - cashback;
        }
        
        return initial_money;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of Code

1. **Handle Transactions with Non-positive Net Cost**: These are managed up-front summing their net effect.
2. **Sort Transactions**: Only those with a positive net cost.
3. **Simulate Processing**: Update the minimum initial money required based on sorted transactions.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the transactions list takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of transactions.
- **Simulation**: Iterating through the transactions involves \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). 

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum initial money required to perform all transactions in an optimal order.
