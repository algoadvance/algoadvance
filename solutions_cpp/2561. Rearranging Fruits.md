[Leetcode 2561. Rearranging Fruits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2561)
## Problem Statement

You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2`, each containing `n` integers. Each integer in `basket1` occurs in `basket2`, and each integer in `basket2` occurs in `basket1`. There are `n` pairs of baskets and a pass value `p` for which the fruits can be swapped only if basket1[i] + basket2[j] >= p. You need to rearrange the fruits in such a way that the sum of the costs for swaps is minimized. The cost of swapping two fruits is given.

Return the minimum possible cost to rearrange the fruits.

Example:
```
Input: basket1 = [4, 2, 3], basket2 = [3, 2, 4], p = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Swap basket1[0] and basket2[2] which adds up to (4+4) = 8 (>= p)
- Cost is 1 since there is only one pair
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the output if no swaps are possible due to the constraint `basket1[i] + basket2[j] >= p`?
   - If no swaps can be done, the output should be `0`.

2. Are elements in the baskets unique?
   - No, there can be repeated elements.

3. How should we handle cases where multiple swaps with different sums could be achieved at the minimum cost?
   - We should always aim for the swap with the minimum cost.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Swappable Pairs**: Identify all pairs `(i, j)` for which `basket1[i] + basket2[j] >= p`.

2. **Calculate Costs**: Compute the swap cost for each valid pair and keep track of the minimum cost arrangement.

3. **Optimization**: Use a Min-Heap to always fetch the pair with the minimum cost whenever possible for swaps.

4. **Implement the solution** in a function and ensure it properly considers all constraints.

5. **Complexity**: Since we need to check all possible pairs, the number of pairs to check is `n^2`. Using a Min-Heap for minimum retrieval costs `O(log(n))`, resulting in an overall complexity of `O(n^2 log(n))`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Custom comparator for the Min-Heap
struct ComparePair {
    bool operator()(pair<int, pair<int, int>> const& p1, pair<int, pair<int, int>> const& p2) {
        return p1.first > p2.first;
    }
};

int rearrangeFruits(vector<int>& basket1, vector<int>& basket2, int p) {
    int n = basket1.size();
    priority_queue<pair<int, pair<int, int>>, vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>>, ComparePair> minHeap;

    // Generate all valid pairs and their costs
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (basket1[i] + basket2[j] >= p) {
                minHeap.push({abs(basket1[i] - basket2[j]), {i, j}});
            }
        }
    }

    vector<bool> used1(n, false), used2(n, false);
    int minCost = 0;

    // Process the heap to get the minimum cost swaps
    while (!minHeap.empty()) {
        auto top = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        int cost = top.first;
        int i = top.second.first;
        int j = top.second.second;

        if (!used1[i] && !used2[j]) {  // Ensure the items haven't already been swapped
            used1[i] = true;
            used2[j] = true;
            minCost += cost;
        }
    }

    return minCost;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> basket1 = {4, 2, 3};
    vector<int> basket2 = {3, 2, 4};
    int p = 5;

    cout << "Minimum cost: " << rearrangeFruits(basket1, basket2, p) << endl; // Expected output: 1

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Generating Pairs**: We generate pairs of indices where the sum is greater or equal to `p`.
2. **Min-Heap for Efficiency**: A min-heap helps us retrieve the minimum cost pair efficiently.
3. **Avoiding Duplicate Use**: We keep track of used indices to prevent swapping an already swapped fruit.
4. **Aggregate Cost**: Capture the sum of the minimal costs of valid swaps.

### Time Complexity
- **Pair Generation**: `O(n^2)`
- **Min-Heap Insertions/Retrieval**: `O(n^2 log(n))`
- Overall, the solution runs in `O(n^2 log(n))`.
