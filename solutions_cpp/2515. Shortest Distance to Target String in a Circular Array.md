[Leetcode 2515. Shortest Distance to Target String in a Circular Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2515)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `target`. You need to determine the shortest distance between two identical occurrences of the `target` string in a circular array. 

A circular array means that after the last element, the array resumes from the first element again, forming a loop. If the target string appears only once or not at all, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - How long can the `words` array be?
   - Are there any constraints on the length of the strings within the `words` array?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should we return if `target` is not present in the array?
   - How should we handle the case where `target` occurs exactly once?

3. **Data Type**:
   - Can words contain special characters or is it limited to alphanumeric characters?

### Strategy

1. **Tracking Indices**:
   - First, traverse the array to find all indices where the `target` string appears. 
   
2. **Calculate Distances**:
   - If the target appears fewer than twice, return `-1`.
   - Compute the smallest distance between consecutive appearances considering the circular nature of the array.
   
3. **Circular Array Handling**:
   - Add an extra distance computation for wrapping around from the end of the array to the beginning.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits> // For INT_MAX

int shortestDistanceToTargetString(const std::vector<std::string>& words, const std::string& target) {
    std::vector<int> targetIndices;

    // Collect indices of the target string's occurrences
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        if (words[i] == target) {
            targetIndices.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    // If target appears less than 2 times, return -1
    if (targetIndices.size() < 2) {
        return -1;
    }

    int minDistance = INT_MAX;
    int n = words.size();
    
    // Compute the minimum distance between consecutive indices
    for (size_t i = 1; i < targetIndices.size(); ++i) {
        int distance = (targetIndices[i] - targetIndices[i-1] + n) % n;
        minDistance = std::min(minDistance, distance);
    }

    // Wrap around: Consider distance from last occurrence back to the first occurrence
    int wrapAroundDistance = (targetIndices[0] + n - targetIndices.back()) % n;
    minDistance = std::min(minDistance, wrapAroundDistance);

    return minDistance;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Collecting indices requires traversing the `words` array once — O(n).
  - Calculating distances is linear in the number of occurrences of `target` — let's denote this number as `k`. Thus O(k), but since `k` <= `n`, this part is effectively O(n) in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity**: O(k)
  - We store indices of the target in a vector, where `k` is the number of occurrences. In the worst case, `k` can be `n`, making space complexity O(n).

This algorithm provides an efficient solution to determine the shortest distance in a circular arrangement for given scenarios.
