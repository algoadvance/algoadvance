[Leetcode 2514. Count Anagrams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2514)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of distinct anagrams you can form from `s`. An anagram of a string is a permutation of the string's characters.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "abac"
Output: 4
Explanation: The distinct anagrams of the string "abac" are "aabc", "abac", "abca", and "baca".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of string `s`? 
     - This is important for understanding the problem's computational feasibility.
   - Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return an integer denoting the number of distinct anagrams?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the output if the string is empty?
   - Are there any performance constraints we should be aware of?

Let's assume the string length is manageable (up to 100 characters) and it contains only lowercase English letters. The function should return the number of distinct anagrams as an integer.

### Strategy

To count the distinct anagrams of the string `s`, we need to consider all permutations of the characters in `s` and then determine how many of these permutations are unique. However, computing all permutations directly is impractical due to factorial growth. Instead, we can use combinatorial methods:

1. **Count Frequency of Each Character:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Use Factorials and Combinations:**
   - Compute the total number of permutations using the factorial of the string's length.
   - Divide by the factorial of each character's frequency to account for repeated characters.

### Code

Here is the C++ function to achieve the desired solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to compute factorial of a number.
unsigned long long factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    unsigned long long res = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        res *= i;
    }
    return res;
}

int countAnagrams(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> freqMap;

    // Count the frequency of each character in the string.
    for (char c : s) {
        freqMap[c]++;
    }

    // Calculate the total number of permutations.
    unsigned long long totalPermutations = factorial(s.length());

    // Divide by the factorial of each character's frequency.
    for (auto& entry : freqMap) {
        totalPermutations /= factorial(entry.second);
    }

    return static_cast<int>(totalPermutations);
}

int main() {
    string s = "abac";
    cout << "Number of distinct anagrams: " << countAnagrams(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity of the solution:

1. **Counting character frequencies:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
2. **Calculating factorial of string length:** O(n), since we compute it in a loop up to n.
3. **Calculating factorial for each character frequency:** O(k), where k is the number of unique characters, typically O(1) for constant alphabet size (26 for lowercase English letters).

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n).

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently counts the distinct anagrams using combinatorial methods, reducing the need to generate all permutations explicitly. The factorial calculations ensure we account for repeated characters appropriately, providing an optimized solution.
