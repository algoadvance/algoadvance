[Leetcode 796. Rotate String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l796)
### Problem Statement
The LeetCode problem 796 - "Rotate String" is defined as follows:

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` if and only if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts on `s`.

A shift on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position. For example, if `s = 'abcde'`, then it will be `'bcdea'` after one shift.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of the strings `s` and `goal`?**
   - Both strings can have 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 100.
   
2. **What characters are valid in the strings `s` and `goal`?**
   - The strings can consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Is there an edge case where `s` or `goal` can be empty?**
   - No, based on the constraints, `s` and `goal` must have at least one character.

4. **Is it guaranteed that `s` and `goal` will be of equal length?**
   - No, `s` and `goal` can have different lengths.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, the main idea is to check if `goal` can be obtained by rotating `s`. If two strings are of different lengths, they cannot be rotations of each other. Otherwise, we can concatenate `s` with itself (i.e., `s + s`), and check if `goal` is a substring of this concatenated string.

This works because concatenating `s` with itself essentially covers all possible rotations within its structure. For example, for `s = 'abcde'`, concatenating it with itself gives `'abcdeabcde'`. The goal string needs to be a substring of this new string to be a valid rotation.

### Code
```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool rotateString(std::string s, std::string goal) {
        if (s.length() != goal.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        std::string concatenated = s + s;
        return (concatenated.find(goal) != std::string::npos);
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Length Check**: First, check if the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different. If they are, return `false` since they cannot be rotations of each other.
2. **Concatenation**: Concatenate `s` with itself to cover all possible rotations.
3. **Substring Check**: Use the `find` function to check if `goal` is a substring of the concatenated string.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. 
  - Concatenation operation takes O(n).
  - The substring search also effectively takes O(n), assuming efficient implementation of the `find` function in the standard library.

This efficient approach ensures that the problem is solved within acceptable limits for given constraints.
