[Leetcode 2332. The Latest Time to Catch a Bus](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2332)
### Problem Statement
You are given inputs: 
1. An integer array `buses` representing the departure times of buses.
2. An integer array `passengers` representing the arrival times of passengers at the bus station.
3. An integer `capacity` representing the maximum number of passengers that can board each bus.

You need to find the latest time you can arrive at the bus station to catch a bus, without any two passengers (including yourself) arriving at the same time.

The problem constraints are:
- 1 <= buses.length, passengers.length <= 10^5
- Each element in both `buses` and `passengers` is an integer in the range `[1, 10^9]`.
- 1 <= capacity <= 10^5

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Should we assume that the bus and passenger times are given in a sorted order?**  
   No, the problem does not specify that they are sorted. Thus, we should perform this sorting ourselves.

2. **What happens if there are fewer passengers than the bus capacity?**  
   We should consider all cases and find the latest possible time you can arrive to catch a bus.

3. **Is it guaranteed that there exists a feasible arrival time?**  
   Yes, the problem assumes there will be a valid arrival time.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, I would:
1. **Sort `buses` and `passengers` arrays**: This will help us easily find the next available bus and manage passenger boarding.
2. **Simulate the boarding process**: Use two pointers, one for `passengers` and one for `buses`.
3. **Track the last time a bus can be boarded**: 
    - For each bus, count the number of passengers it can take.
    - If we find a gap before the capacity fills up, store the latest valid time accordingly.
4. **Consider edge cases**: This includes the last available bus and passengers already at the station.

Key steps:
- Ensure that no time conflicts with another passenger
- Track the maximum possible time efficiently

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int latestTimeCatchTheBus(vector<int>& buses, vector<int>& passengers, int capacity) {
    sort(buses.begin(), buses.end());
    sort(passengers.begin(), passengers.end());
    
    int n = buses.size();
    int m = passengers.size();
    
    int pasIndex = 0, busIndex = 0;
    int latestTime = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int cap = capacity;
        while (cap > 0 && pasIndex < m && passengers[pasIndex] <= buses[i]) {
            if (pasIndex == 0 || passengers[pasIndex] != passengers[pasIndex - 1] + 1) {
                latestTime = max(latestTime, passengers[pasIndex] - 1);
            }
            ++pasIndex;
            --cap;
        }
        
        if (cap > 0) {
            if (pasIndex == 0 || passengers[pasIndex - 1] != buses[i]) {
                latestTime = max(latestTime, buses[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return latestTime;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> buses = {10, 20};
    vector<int> passengers = {2, 17, 18, 19};
    int capacity = 2;
    cout << latestTimeCatchTheBus(buses, passengers, capacity) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: 
    - Both `buses` and `passengers` are sorted.
2. **Simulating bus boarding**:
    - For each bus, check how many passengers can board (up to the `capacity`).
    - Update the latest possible time you can board (i.e., one second before each passenger, if possible, else the bus departure time itself).
3. **Edge handling**:
    - Check if you can take the bus directly at its departure time if it's not conflicting with the last boarded passenger.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting** both `buses` and `passengers`: O(n log n) where n is the larger of the two arrays' sizes.
- **Simulating boarding**: O(n + m), iterating through all buses and passengers.

Overall time complexity: **O(n log n + m log m)** due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.
