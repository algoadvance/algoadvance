[Leetcode 1615. Maximal Network Rank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1615)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes and an array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there is an undirected road between nodes `ai` and `bi`, find the **maximal network rank** of the infrastructure. The network rank of two different nodes is defined as the total number of roads that are connected to either node (or both), counting each road only once.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `n`**: Can `n` be very large, or is it within certain constraints?
2. **Edges**: Can there be multiple roads between the same pair of nodes?
3. **Output**: Do we need to consider all unique pairs of nodes?

Assumptions:
- `n` is reasonably small (e.g., `n <= 100`).
- There are no multiple roads between the same two nodes.
- Each node pair's rank is calculated, and we return the maximum rank.

## Strategy
1. **Adjacency Matrix**: Create an adjacency matrix to track connections between nodes. This matrix will help in determining common roads.
2. **Degree Array**: Maintain an array to keep track of the degree (number of roads connected) of each node.
3. **Nested Iteration**: For each pair of nodes `(i, j)`, calculate the network rank by summing their degrees and then adjusting for any shared road (subtract shared road once if a shared road exists).

### Steps
1. Initialize an adjacency matrix `adj` of size `n x n` filled with zeros.
2. Initialize a degree array `degree` of size `n` filled with zeros.
3. Populate the adjacency matrix and degree array by iterating through the `roads` list.
4. Iterate through all pairs of nodes and compute the network rank.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximalNetworkRank(int n, vector<vector<int>>& roads) {
        // Initialize adjacency matrix and degree array
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);
        
        // Process the roads
        for (const auto& road : roads) {
            int u = road[0];
            int b = road[1];
            adj[u][b] = adj[b][u] = 1;
            degree[u]++;
            degree[b]++;
        }
        
        int maxRank = 0;
        
        // Calculate maximal network rank by checking all pairs
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                int currentRank = degree[i] + degree[j];
                if (adj[i][j]) {
                    currentRank--; // subtract common road
                }
                maxRank = max(maxRank, currentRank);
            }
        }
        
        return maxRank;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Adjacency Matrix and Degree Array Population**: `O(E)` where `E` is the number of roads.
- **Nested Iteration** to calculate the rank: `O(n^2)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^2 + E)`. Given the constraints (with n reasonably small), this solution should efficiently handle the problem within the provided limits.
