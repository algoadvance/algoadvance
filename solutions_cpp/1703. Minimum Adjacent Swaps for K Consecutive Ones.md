[Leetcode 1703. Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1703)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. `nums` consists of only `0`s and `1`s. In one move, you can swap any two adjacent elements in the array. Return the minimum number of moves required so that `k` consecutive 1's appear in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Example Input/Output:**
   - Input: `nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1]`, `k = 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: 
     - By swapping the second `1` with the first `0`, we get `[1,1,0,0,0,1]`, which has `2` consecutive `1`s.
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   - `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`
   - `1 <= k <= sum(nums)`

### Strategy
1. **Identify positions of 1's:**
   - Traverse the `nums` array and store indices of each `1` in a separate list.

2. **Sliding Window to Find Minimum Moves:**
   - Use a sliding window of size `k` over the list of indices to calculate the minimum number of moves required to group `k` ones together.
   - Compute the median of the indices in the current window. The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations (moves).

3. **Calculate Minimum Moves:**
   - For each group of `k` indices consider the median index.
   - Calculate the total number of adjacent swaps needed to group the indices around this median.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int minMoves(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> ones;
    
    // Collect all indices where nums[i] == 1
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == 1) {
            ones.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    int m = ones.size();
    vector<int> prefixSums(m + 1, 0);
    
    // Compute prefix sums of the ones' indices
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + ones[i];
    }
    
    int min_swaps = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= m - k; ++i) {
        int mid = i + k / 2;
        int median = ones[mid];
        
        int leftCount = mid - i;
        int rightCount = i + k - mid - 1;
        
        int leftSum = prefixSums[mid] - prefixSums[i];
        int rightSum = prefixSums[i + k] - prefixSums[mid + 1];
        
        int cost = (rightSum - leftSum) - (rightCount - leftCount) * median;
        
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, cost);
    }
    
    return min_swaps;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** Where `n` is the length of `nums` for collecting the indices of `1`s.
- **O(m):** Where `m` is the number of `1`s in `nums` for prefix sum calculation and sliding window processing.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
