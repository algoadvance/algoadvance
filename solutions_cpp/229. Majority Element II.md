[Leetcode 229. Majority Element II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l229)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, per the constraint, the array will have at least one element.

2. **Should the output be in any specific order?**
   - The problem does not specify an order, so any order is acceptable.

3. **Can I use extra space for this problem?**
   - The problem does not explicitly constrain space, but an efficient solution using constant space is preferred.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a modified version of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm which is originally used for finding the majority element (i.e., an element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times). For this problem, we need to find elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times. 

Key steps are:

1. **First Pass:** Use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to find up to 2 candidate elements that could be the majority elements.
2. **Second Pass:** Verify the count of each of these candidates to determine if they actually appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return {};

    int candidate1 = 0, candidate2 = 1; // Initialize two different candidates
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;

    // First pass to find possible candidates
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == candidate1) {
            count1++;
        } else if (num == candidate2) {
            count2++;
        } else if (count1 == 0) {
            candidate1 = num;
            count1 = 1;
        } else if (count2 == 0) {
            candidate2 = num;
            count2 = 1;
        } else {
            count1--;
            count2--;
        }
    }

    // Second pass to check if the candidates actually have the required count
    count1 = 0;
    count2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == candidate1) {
            count1++;
        } else if (num == candidate2) {
            count2++;
        }
    }

    vector<int> result;
    if (count1 > n / 3) {
        result.push_back(candidate1);
    }
    if (count2 > n / 3) {
        result.push_back(candidate2);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The solution involves two passes through the array:

1. **First Pass:** Identifying candidates takes O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the array.
2. **Second Pass:** Counting the occurrences of the candidates also takes O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we use a constant amount of extra space beyond the input array.

This solution is efficient and meets the constraints specified in the problem.
