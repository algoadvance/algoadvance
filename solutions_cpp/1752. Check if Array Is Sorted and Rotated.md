[Leetcode 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1752)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of `n` distinct integers. A permutation of the array is called a **sorted and rotated** if it is possible to rotate the array in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing.

Return `true` if the array is sorted and rotated, otherwise return `false`.

#### Example:
- Example 1:
    - Input: `nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is sorted and rotated by `3` positions to get `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`.
- Example 2:
    - Input: `nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: There is no way to rotate the array to get a non-decreasing array.
- Example 3:
    - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: `[1, 2, 3]` is already non-decreasing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, as per the problem definition, the array will always have at least one element.
2. **What is the range of array length `n`?**
   - Constraint not explicitly given in the problem, but usually, problems assume `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

### Strategy

To determine whether the array is sorted and rotated:
1. **Non-Decreasing Count**: Traverse the array and count the number of times the order goes from increasing to decreasing. 
2. **Check Boundary**: Ensure that if more than one such transition occurs, return `false`.
3. **Rotation Point**: If there is exactly one transition, check the boundary condition to confirm it's going from the largest to smallest value.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool check(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count = 0; // To count the number of rotations
    int n = nums.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Check if there is a decrease in the order
        if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    // Array is sorted and rotated if there is at most one decrease in the order
    return count <= 1;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Count Decreases**: We loop through the array and check if `nums[i]` is greater than the next element `nums[(i + 1) % n]`. Using modulo ensures that we seamlessly check the boundary condition from the last element to the first.
2. **Boundary Condition**: We use modulo to handle the checking from the last element back to the first element.
3. If `count` is more than 1 at the end of the loop, it means there are multiple places where the sorted order is broken, thus the array is neither sorted nor properly rotated.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only need to traverse the array once.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
