[Leetcode 2876. Count Visited Nodes in a Directed Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2876)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of `edges` representing a directed graph where each element `edges[i] = j` indicates there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `j`. Each node can only be reached through exactly one other node (except the starting nodes). You need to determine the number of nodes that can be eventually visited starting from each node and return the results in an array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
    - What is the range of the number of nodes (`n`) in the graph?
    - What values can the nodes take?

2. **Graph Characteristics**:
    - Is the graph guaranteed to be acyclic?
    - Could there be any self-loops?

3. **Validation**:
    - Do all the nodes from `0` to `n-1` have exactly one outgoing edge?

**Assumptions** based on typical problem constraints:
- The graph is represented such that every node (from `0` to `n-1`) has exactly one outgoing edge, implying exactly one entry in the `edges` list for each node.
- Graph can have cycles as there is no restriction mentioned about it being a DAG.

## Strategy

1. **Cycle Detection**:
    - Since each node has exactly one outgoing edge, the graph can have multiple cycles and linear paths leading into these cycles.
    - We need to detect these cycles firstly and note the size of each cycle.

2. **DFS/BFS Traversal**:
    - Perform a traversal from each node. Keep track of the visited nodes and identify the entry point into a cycle or the end of a terminal path.
    - Use a visited array to track already visited nodes and prevent reprocessing.

3. **Result Storage**:
    - For nodes leading to cycles, the size of visited nodes is their cycle size.
    - For nodes leading into these cycles from outside, compute the reachable nodes by summing the path length to the cycle and the cycle size.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

void dfs(int node, const vector<int>& edges, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int>& result, unordered_map<int, int>& cycle_lengths, vector<int>& path) {
    if (visited[node]) {
        return;
    }
    visited[node] = true;
    path.push_back(node);

    int next_node = edges[node];
    if (!visited[next_node]) {
        dfs(next_node, edges, visited, result, cycle_lengths, path);
    } else {
        // We found a cycle
        int cycle_length = 0;
        bool inCycle = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i) {
            if (path[i] == next_node) {
                inCycle = true;
            }
            if (inCycle) {
                cycle_length++;
            }
        }
        // Store cycle length for all nodes in the cycle
        if (cycle_length > 0) {
            for (int i = path.size() - cycle_length; i < path.size(); ++i) {
                cycle_lengths[path[i]] = cycle_length;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Set the result for all nodes in the current path
    for (int i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i) {
        if (cycle_lengths.count(path[i])) {
            result[path[i]] = cycle_lengths[path[i]];
        } else {
            result[path[i]] = result[edges[path[i]]] + 1;
        }
    }
}

vector<int> countVisitedNodes(const vector<int>& edges) {
    int n = edges.size();
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    vector<int> result(n, 0);
    unordered_map<int, int> cycle_lengths;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            vector<int> path;
            dfs(i, edges, visited, result, cycle_lengths, path);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> edges = {1, 2, 0, 5, 6, 3, 4};
    vector<int> result = countVisitedNodes(edges);
    for (int count : result) {
        cout << count << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Cycle Detection and Traverse**: O(n) - each node is processed exactly once in the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - for visited array, result storage, and cycle length records.

Overall, the algorithm very efficiently determines the count of reachable nodes from each starting node, even in the presence of cycles in the graph.
