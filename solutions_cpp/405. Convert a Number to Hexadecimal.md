[Leetcode 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l405)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to convert a given integer number to its hexadecimal representation. The hexadecimal numeral system is base-16, which uses sixteen symbols: 0-9 and a-f. For example, the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 26 is "1a". 

You need to write a function `toHex` that takes an integer as input and returns a string representing its hexadecimal value.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:** What is the range of the input integer value?
   - The input integer is a 32-bit signed integer.

2. **Negative Numbers:** How should negative numbers be treated?
   - For negative numbers, the hexadecimal representation should use two's complement.

3. **Leading Zeroes:** Should we consider leading zeroes in the output?
   - No leading zeroes should be in the output unless the number is zero itself.

With these clarifications, we can proceed to the next section.

### Strategy

1. **Handling Negatives:** Since the input can be negative, we need to handle the two's complement representation. For a 32-bit signed integer, this means treating negative numbers unsigned by masking with `0xFFFFFFFF`.

2. **Hexadecimal Mapping:** We need a map of digits to hexadecimal characters (`0-9` to `0-9` and `10-15` to `a-f`).

3. **Conversion Process:** 
   - Use a loop to repeatedly take the last 4 bits of the number and map it to the corresponding hexadecimal.
   - Shift the number right by 4 bits and repeat until the number is zero.
   - Since the process generates the hexadecimal digits in reverse order, reverse the final string before returning.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string toHex(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return "0";
        }

        const char hexDigits[] = "0123456789abcdef";
        std::string hexStr;
        
        // Process the number using two's complement for negative numbers
        unsigned int n = static_cast<unsigned int>(num);
        
        while (n != 0) {
            int lastFourBits = n & 0xF;
            hexStr += hexDigits[lastFourBits];
            n >>= 4;
        }
        
        // The digits were added in reverse order
        std::reverse(hexStr.begin(), hexStr.end());
        
        return hexStr;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)), where n is the absolute value of the input number. This is because the loop extracts 4 bits at a time and shifts the number right, effectively reducing it by a factor of 16 each iteration. For 32-bit integers, this loop will run at most 8 times (since 32/4 = 8).

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) excluding the space for the output string, which stores the result.

This approach efficiently converts an integer to its hexadecimal representation, handling both positive and negative values correctly.
