[Leetcode 1434. Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1434)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of hats, where `hats[i]` is a list of all the hats those person `i+1` could wear. There are 40 different types of hats labeled from 1 to 40. Return the number of ways that each person can wear a different hat. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the number of people and the types of hats?**
   - There can be up to 10 people, and the types of hats range from 1 to 40.

2. **Should each person wear exactly one hat, and should each hat be worn by at most one person?**
   - Yes, each person must wear exactly one hat, and no two people can wear the same hat.

3. **What is the output if it is impossible to assign hats such that everyone wears a hat?**
   - In such a case, the output should be 0.

### Strategy
We can use Dynamic Programming along with bit masking to solve this problem efficiently due to the manageable constraints.

1. **State Representation:**
   - `dp[mask]`: Number of ways to assign hats such that the subset of people represented by `mask` (a bitmask) are wearing different hats.
   - Here, `mask` is a bitmask of length `n` (number of people) where the i-th bit is 1 if the i-th person has been assigned a hat, and 0 otherwise.

2. **State Transition:**
   - For each hat, try assigning it to every person who can wear it and update the `dp` table.
   - Since every person must get exactly one unique hat, we use the combination of previously valid states to reach new states.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1`: Thereâ€™s one way to assign hats to zero people.

4. **Iteration:**
   - Iterate over each hat and for each person who can wear that hat, update all combinations of previous states.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - After considering all the hats, `dp[(1<<n) - 1]` will give the number of valid assignments where all people have different hats.

### Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberWays(vector<vector<int>>& hats) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = hats.size();
        vector<vector<int>> hat_to_people(41);

        // Reverse the input structure to map each hat to the list of people who can wear it
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int hat : hats[i]) {
                hat_to_people[hat].push_back(i);
            }
        }

        // dp[mask]: number of ways to distribute hats with `mask` as the people wearing them
        vector<int> dp(1 << n, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        // Iterate over each hat from 1 to 40
        for (int hat = 1; hat <= 40; ++hat) {
            vector<int> new_dp = dp;
            for (int person : hat_to_people[hat]) {
                for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
                    if ((mask & (1 << person)) == 0) { // Check if person is not yet wearing a hat
                        new_dp[mask | (1 << person)] = (new_dp[mask | (1 << person)] + dp[mask]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
            dp = new_dp;
        }

        // The solution will be in the dp array where all persons (i.e., bits) are wearing a hat
        return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(2^n \cdot 40 \cdot n)\)
  - \(2^n\) for all possible bitmasks.
  - 40 for iterating over each hat.
  - \(n\) for iterating over the people who can wear each hat.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(2^n)\) for the `dp` array.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints given by the problem.
