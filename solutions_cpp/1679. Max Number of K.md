[Leetcode 1679. Max Number of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1679)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of unique pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b == k` and both `a` and `b` are elements of the array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should we return?**
   - We need to return the count of unique pairs that sum up to `k`.

2. **Can elements be reused in multiple pairs?**
   - No, each element can only be used once in one pair.

3. **What if the array is empty or has fewer than two elements?**
   - In such cases, the function should return `0` since no pairs can be formed.

4. **Can the elements be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements can be any integers, including negatives.

5. **Are the elements of `nums` sorted?**
   - No, there is no guarantee that the elements are sorted.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash map to keep track of the counts of elements we have seen so far while iterating through the array. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize a hash map (`unordered_map`) to store the counts of each element.**
2. **Initialize a counter (`pair_count`) to keep track of the number of valid pairs.**
3. **Iterate through each element (`num`) in `nums`:**
   - Calculate the complement (`k - num`).
   - If the complement exists in the hash map and its count is greater than 0, a valid pair is found:
     - Decrement the count of the complement in the hash map.
     - Increment the `pair_count`.
   - If the complement is not found or its count is 0, increment the count of `num` in the hash map.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> num_count;
        int pair_count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int complement = k - num;
            if (num_count[complement] > 0) {
                pair_count++;
                num_count[complement]--;
            } else {
                num_count[num]++;
            }
        }
        
        return pair_count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k = 5;
    cout << "Maximum number of K-sum pairs: " << solution.maxOperations(nums, k) << endl;
    
    nums = {3, 1, 3, 4, 3};
    k = 6;
    cout << "Maximum number of K-sum pairs: " << solution.maxOperations(nums, k) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we make a single pass through the array, and each hash map operation (insert/find) takes \(O(1)\) time on average.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional space used by the hash map to store the counts of the elements. In the worst case, all elements might be unique, leading to \(n\) entries in the map.
