[Leetcode 1986. Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1986)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i]` is the integer duration of the `i^th` task, and an integer `sessionTime`. Your goal is to find the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish all the given tasks such that:

1. Each work session can have a total duration of at most `sessionTime`.
2. You cannot split a task between multiple work sessions.

Return the minimum number of work sessions needed to finish the tasks.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: tasks = [1,2,3], sessionTime = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: You can finish the tasks in two work sessions.
- First session: [1, 2] => 1 + 2 = 3
- Second session: [3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the Length of the Array and Task Durations**: What is the range of task durations and the number of tasks?
2. **Session Time Values**: What is the range of session time values?
3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases we should consider (e.g., all task durations being equal to the session time)?

Let's assume the following constraints based on typical problem constraints:
- `1 <= tasks.length <= 14`
- `1 <= tasks[i] <= 10`
- `1 <= sessionTime <= 15`

## Strategy

Given the constraints, a recursive approach with memoization will be efficient. The problem can be approached using backtracking combined with dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations and select the optimal one.

Hereâ€™s the detailed approach:
1. **Sorting Tasks**: Sort the tasks in descending order to help in fitting them into sessions efficiently.
2. **Backtracking**: Use a recursive function to attempt putting each task into an existing session or a new session, updating the session accordingly.
3. **Memoization**: Cache the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int minSessions(std::vector<int>& tasks, int sessionTime) {
        int n = tasks.size();
        std::sort(tasks.rbegin(), tasks.rend());

        // Memoization cache
        std::unordered_map<int, int> memo;

        // Try all possible combinations with bitmasks
        std::function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int mask) -> int {
            if (mask == 0) return 0; // no tasks left
            if (memo.count(mask)) return memo[mask];

            int min_sessions = n; // worst case, every task in different session
            
            for (int subset = mask; subset; subset = (subset - 1) & mask) {
                int totalTime = 0;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (subset & (1 << i)) {
                        totalTime += tasks[i];
                    }
                }
                if (totalTime <= sessionTime) {
                    // subproblem: mask ^ subset, which is mask after removing tasks in subset
                    min_sessions = std::min(min_sessions, 1 + dfs(mask ^ subset));
                }
            }
            memo[mask] = min_sessions;
            return min_sessions;
        };

        return dfs((1 << n) - 1); // full mask with all tasks
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> tasks = {1, 2, 3};
    int sessionTime = 3;
    std::cout << sol.minSessions(tasks, sessionTime) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The dominant part of this solution is the exploration of subsets and the number of recursive calls:
- **Subset Generation**: Each task can either be included or not included in a subset, leading to `2^n` possible subsets.
- **Recursive Calls**: Each subset check takes `O(n)` time to sum the selected tasks.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(2^n * n)`, which is feasible given `n` is at most 14.

This approach effectively balances recursive exploration and memoization to handle the constraints efficiently.
