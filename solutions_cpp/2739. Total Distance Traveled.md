[Leetcode 2739. Total Distance Traveled](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2739)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `trips` which represents the number of trips a car needs to make.

To complete a single trip, the car starts at `milesStart` and travels to `milesEnd` and back to `milesStart`. It continues this journey for `trips` number of times.

Write a function `totalDistance` that calculates the total distance traveled by the car for all the trips.

**Function Signature:**
```cpp
int totalDistance(int milesStart, int milesEnd, int trips);
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will `milesStart` and `milesEnd` always be positive integers?**
   - Assume they are strictly positive integers as the car needs to travel a positive distance.

2. **Is there any upper limit for the inputs?**
   - If unspecified, assume no specific upper limit, but the integers are within typical constraints for an `int` in C++.

3. **What should the function return if `trips` is 0?**
   - If `trips` is 0, it should return 0 since no trips mean no distance traveled.

4. **Is the direction (round trip) always considered?**
   - Yes, we need to consider both the distance to `milesEnd` and back to `milesStart` for each trip.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate distance per trip:** The distance for one round trip is calculated as:
   ```cpp
   distance_per_trip = 2 * (milesEnd - milesStart)
   ```
   This captures the travel from `milesStart` to `milesEnd` and back from `milesEnd` to `milesStart`.

2. **Calculate total distance:** For multiple trips, simply multiply the distance per trip by the number of trips:
   ```cpp
   total_distance = distance_per_trip * trips
   ```

3. **Edge cases:** If `trips` is 0, return 0 as no travel occurs.

## Code

Here is the C++ function to accomplish this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int totalDistance(int milesStart, int milesEnd, int trips) {
    // Special case: when 0 trips, distance traveled is 0.
    if (trips == 0)
        return 0;
    
    // Calculate the distance for one round trip.
    int distance_per_trip = 2 * (milesEnd - milesStart);
    
    // Total distance is the distance per trip times the number of trips.
    int total_distance = distance_per_trip * trips;
    
    return total_distance;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    int milesStart = 10;
    int milesEnd = 20;
    int trips = 5;
    
    int result = totalDistance(milesStart, milesEnd, trips);
    
    std::cout << "Total distance traveled: " << result << std::endl; // Should print 100
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(1)** since the calculations involve only a few arithmetic operations, making it constant in terms of execution time regardless of input values.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also **O(1)** as we only use a fixed amount of additional space for variables.
