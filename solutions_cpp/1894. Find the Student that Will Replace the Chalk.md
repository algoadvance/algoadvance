[Leetcode 1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1894)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `chalk` and an integer `k`. There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The `i`-th student will replace the chalk if the chalk runs out after they have used it.

- The students will start with a given amount of chalk, and the chalk usage between students continues in a cyclic manner.
- We need to determine which student will replace the chalk based on the given chalk usage and `k` total amount of chalk initially available.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What's the range of `k` and the elements in `chalk`?**
   - The constraints might help in determining if there are edge cases such as very large values of `k`.

2. **Should we consider any specific data types?**
   - Given that `k` and cumulative chalk usage can be large, it's important to use a suitable data type (e.g., `long long`).

3. **Are there any edge cases specified?**
   - Cases where `k` is less than the smallest chalk usage.
   - Cases where all students have the same chalk usage.
   
### Strategy

1. **Sum the Total Chalk Usage**: Calculate the total amount of chalk required for one complete cycle of students using `accumulate`.
2. **Reduce Excess Cycles**: Since the chalk usage is cyclic, reduce `k` modulo the total chalk usage to minimize unnecessary iterations.
3. **Identify the Student**: Sequentially traverse the `chalk` array and decrement `k` by the value of chalk usage of each student. When `k` becomes insufficient for the next student, return the current student's index.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int chalkReplacer(vector<int>& chalk, int k) {
        // Step 1: Compute the total chalk used in one full cycle
        long long total_chalk = accumulate(chalk.begin(), chalk.end(), 0LL);

        // Step 2: Reduce k to a manageable value by taking k % total_chalk
        k %= total_chalk;

        // Step 3: Find the student who will replace the chalk
        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.size(); ++i) {
            if (k < chalk[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            k -= chalk[i];
        }
        
        // We shouldn't reach this point with valid input, as we will always find a student
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Accumulation of Chalk**: O(n), where n is the number of students.
2. **Finding the Student**: O(n), where each student is evaluated in sequence until we find the chalk replacer.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), making this solution efficient for large inputs.
