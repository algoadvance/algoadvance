[Leetcode 1911. Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1911)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. The alternating sum of a sequence is the sum of the elements at the odd index positions subtracted by the sum of the elements at the even index positions. 

You need to find the *maximum alternating subsequence sum* of the given array.

The subsequence is a sequence derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all the integers in the array positive?**
   - No, the integers can be positive or negative.
   
2. **Can the subsequence be empty?**
   - No, the subsequence should have at least one element.

3. **What is the range of the input size?**
   - The size of the input array can be up to `10^5`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxAlternatingSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long evenPos = nums[0];  // alternates as positive 
        long long oddPos = 0;         // alternates as negative

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            evenPos = max(evenPos, oddPos + nums[i]);
            oddPos = max(oddPos, evenPos - nums[i]);
        }
        
        return evenPos;
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - Start by initializing two variables, `evenPos` and `oddPos`. 
     - `evenPos` represents the maximum alternating subsequence sum where the next element to be considered is to be added.
     - `oddPos` represents the alternating sum where the next element to be considered is to be subtracted.

2. **Traversal & Update:**
   - Traverse through the array starting from the second element. For each element update `evenPos` and `oddPos` as follows:
     - `evenPos = max(evenPos, oddPos + nums[i])`
     - `oddPos = max(oddPos, evenPos - nums[i])`
   - This way you keep track of the maximum sum for subsequences ending at every index.

3. **Result:**
   - After processing all elements, `evenPos` holds the maximum alternating subsequence sum.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. We are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures an efficient solution to finding the maximum alternating subsequence sum with optimal time and space complexities.
