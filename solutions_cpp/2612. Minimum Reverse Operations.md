[Leetcode 2612. Minimum Reverse Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2612)
Sure! Let's walk through the problem "2612. Minimum Reverse Operations" step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` containing `n` non-negative integers (0 or 1), and an integer `k`.

You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:
1. Select any subarray of length `k`, and reverse it.

The goal is to make the array non-decreasing using the minimum number of operations. If it's impossible to make the array non-decreasing, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start solving, let's clarify some potential ambiguities:
1. Can `k` be greater than `n`?
2. Are all elements in the nums array either 0 or 1, or can we have other numbers as well?
3. Can `k` be 1, and what would that imply?
4. Is there any constraint on the length of `nums`?

Given these questions, letâ€™s proceed with general assumptions:
1. `k` should usually be less than or equal to `n` to make logical sense.
2. The problem implies that the elements in `nums` are binary (0 or 1).
3. If `k` is 1, no reversing is possible, and we should check directly if the array is already sorted.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Check edge cases**: If `k == 1`, just check if the array is already sorted.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Use a sliding window of size `k` to reverse subarrays and check if this helps in approaching a sorted array.
3. **Minimum Operations**:

### Code

Here's a potential implementation of this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

// Helper function to check if the array is sorted
bool isSorted(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i - 1] > nums[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int minReverseOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    
    // Edge case: if k is 1, check if the array is sorted
    if (k == 1) {
        return isSorted(nums) ? 0 : -1;
    }
    
    std::queue<std::pair<std::vector<int>, int>> q;
    std::set<std::vector<int>> visited;
    
    // Initial step
    q.push({nums, 0});
    visited.insert(nums);
    
    // BFS to find the minimum operations
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, steps] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // If the current array is sorted, return the number of steps
        if (isSorted(current)) return steps;
        
        // Try all possible reversals of subarray of length k
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; ++i) {
            std::vector<int> next = current;
            std::reverse(next.begin() + i, next.begin() + i + k);
            
            if (visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                q.push({next, steps + 1});
                visited.insert(next);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If no solution is found
    return -1;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Checking for Sorted Array**: 
   - Directly checks if the array is sorted if `k == 1`. This is because reversing a single element won't help in sorting.
  
2. **BFS Approach**:
   - Uses BFS (Breadth First Search) to explore all possible reversals of subarrays of length `k`.
   - Keeps track of the number of operations (steps).
   - Uses a queue to explore the next possible states.
   - Uses a set to record visited states to avoid re-processing the same array state.
  
3. **Termination**:
   - If we find a sorted array, return the number of steps.
   - If there's no way to reach a sorted state after exploring all possibilities, returns -1.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity mainly depends on the BFS traversal and the number of possible states.
- In the worst-case scenario, exploring all possible permutations of the array's state can be factorial in the number of elements, but practically it will be constrained by the pattern of reversals.

This solution leverages BFS to handle the minimum number of reversals efficiently within practical limits given typical constraints on the input array size and elements.
