[Leetcode 764. Largest Plus Sign](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l764)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and an array `mines` where `mines[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a mine located at `(xi, yi)` in an `n x n` grid. Return the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1's contained in the grid. If there is none, return 0.

An "axis-aligned plus sign of 1's" of order `k` has some center `(r, c)` such that:

* It has `k` 1's in each of the four arms: up, down, left, and right.
* The rest of the entries are 0 (optional in the given context).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 500`.

2. **What are the constraints on the number of mines?**
   - `0 <= mines.length <= n * n`.

3. **Can there be multiple plus signs? If so, should we return the largest one?**
   - Yes, there can be multiple plus signs. We need to return the order of the largest plus sign.

4. **What if there are no plus signs?**
   - If there are no plus signs, return 0.

### Strategy

1. **Create a grid `n x n` initialized to 1**: Marks where the empty spaces are initially.
2. **Mark mines in the grid as 0**: This will destroy any possible plus that includes the cell with a mine.
3. **Use dynamic programming to track maximum arms' lengths for plus signs**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid, compute lengths of arms in all four directions (left, right, up, down).
   - Store minimum length of arms in a separate grid which will tell us the size of the largest plus centered at that cell.
   - Traverse the grid to find the maximum size plus.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int orderOfLargestPlusSign(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mines) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> grid(n, std::vector<int>(n, n));
        
        for (const auto& mine : mines) {
            grid[mine[0]][mine[1]] = 0;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int left = 0, right = 0, up = 0, down = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                // Left pass
                left = (grid[i][j] == 0) ? 0 : left + 1;
                grid[i][j] = std::min(grid[i][j], left);
                
                // Right pass
                right = (grid[i][n - 1 - j] == 0) ? 0 : right + 1;
                grid[i][n - 1 - j] = std::min(grid[i][n - 1 - j], right);
                
                // Up pass
                up = (grid[j][i] == 0) ? 0 : up + 1;
                grid[j][i] = std::min(grid[j][i], up);
                
                // Down pass
                down = (grid[n - 1 - j][i] == 0) ? 0 : down + 1;
                grid[n - 1 - j][i] = std::min(grid[n - 1 - j][i], down);
            }
        }

        int largestPlus = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                largestPlus = std::max(largestPlus, grid[i][j]);
            }
        }

        return largestPlus;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Initializing the grid and marking mines takes \(O(n^2)\) time.
- Each pass over the grid (left/right, up/down) is \(O(n^2)\).
- Therefore, the total time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

This solution ensures that we efficiently determine the order of the largest plus sign possible in the grid.
