[Leetcode 1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1566)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `arr`, you need to check if there exists a pattern of length `m` that repeats at least `k` times consecutively.

Formally, a pattern is a subarray of length `m` that is repeated `k` times consecutively without overlapping. More specifically, for an index `i`, the pattern is `arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[i+m-1]`. You need to check whether this subarray appears at least `k` times consecutively such that the overall length of this repeating pattern is `m*k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum length of `arr`?**
   - The array length should be at least 1.

2. **Is `m` always less than or equal to the length of `arr`?**
   - Yes.

3. **Can `k` be 1?**
   - Yes, if `k=1`, we are looking for any subarray of length `m`.

4. **Can the elements of `arr` be any positive integer?**
   - Yes, they are all positive integers.

5. **What should be returned if there are multiple patterns that meet the criteria?**
   - Just returning `true` if any such pattern exists is sufficient.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can implement the following approach:

1. Iterate through the array from the start to the point where the remaining length of the array is at least `m*k`.
2. For each starting index, check the subarray from that index till the next `m*k` positions.
3. Within this range, check if the subarray of length `m` is consecutively repeating `k` times.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool containsPattern(vector<int>& arr, int m, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m * k; ++i) {
        bool isPattern = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < m * k; ++j) {
            if (arr[i + j] != arr[i + (j % m)]) {
                isPattern = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isPattern) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization**: We start by determining the size of the array `n`.
2. **Outer Loop**: This loop iterates from the start of the array up to the point where checking a subarray of length `m * k` makes sense (`i <= n - m * k`).
3. **Inner Loop**: This loop checks if each element in the subarray of length `m * k` matches its corresponding element in the repeating pattern.
4. **Condition Check**: If at any point the subarray does not match the pattern, we break out of the inner loop. If the entire subarray matches, we return `true`.
5. **Return**: If no matching subarray is found, we return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n*m*k)** in the worst case because for each starting index, we may need to check up to `m*k` elements.
- The outer loop runs up to `O(n - m*k)` times and the inner loop checks `m*k` elements.

Therefore, the overall complexity is still manageable within the constraints typically given for such problems (assuming `n` is reasonably large but not excessively so).
