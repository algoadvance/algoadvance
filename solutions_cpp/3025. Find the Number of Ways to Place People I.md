[Leetcode 3025. Find the Number of Ways to Place People I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3025)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid where each cell can either have a person (marked as 'P') or be empty (marked as '.'). You need to find the number of ways to place people in the grid such that no two people are in the same row or column.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Dimensions**: Are the grid dimensions fixed or can they vary?
   - The dimensions of the grid can vary.

2. **Minimum Grid Size**: What is the minimum possible size of the grid?
   - The minimum size of the grid is 1x1.

3. **Multiple Grid Configurations**: Can we assume there are multiple grid configurations with different arrangements of 'P' and '.'?
   - Yes, the grid can have various configurations.

4. **Output Format**: Should the output be only the count of the valid configurations?
   - Yes, return only the count of the valid configurations.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each person must be placed such that no two people are in the same row or column.
  
2. **Valid Cells**: Identify which cells we can place people in (those marked with 'P').

3. **Use Backtracking**: To explore all potential placements using a backtracking approach.

4. **Pruning**: If a potential placement leads to an invalid state, prune that branch to improve efficiency.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you could implement the solution using C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int countWays(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
    int rows = grid.size();
    int cols = grid[0].size();
    vector<bool> rowUsed(rows, false);
    vector<bool> colUsed(cols, false);

    return backtrack(grid, rowUsed, colUsed, 0);
}

int backtrack(vector<vector<char>>& grid, vector<bool>& rowUsed, vector<bool>& colUsed, int placed) {
    int rows = grid.size();
    int cols = grid[0].size();
    if (placed == min(rows, cols)) {
        return 1;
    }

    int ways = 0;
    for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
        if (rowUsed[r]) continue;
        for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c) {
            if (colUsed[c] || grid[r][c] != 'P') continue;
            // Place a person
            rowUsed[r] = true;
            colUsed[c] = true;
            ways += backtrack(grid, rowUsed, colUsed, placed + 1);
            // Backtrack
            rowUsed[r] = false;
            colUsed[c] = false;
        }
    }
    return ways;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<char>> grid = {
        {'P', '.', 'P'},
        {'P', 'P', '.'},
        {'.', 'P', 'P'}
    };
    cout << countWays(grid) << endl; // Output: Number of valid ways
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Grid Initialization**: The grid is initialized with a given configuration.
- **Backtracking Function**: Recursively tries placing people in each cell:
  - Skips if the row or column is already used.
  - Returns a count of valid ways if the people have been placed correctly.
- **Placement and Removal**: Marks rows and columns used when placing a 'P' and reverts them when backtracking.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is exponential in nature:

- **Worst Case**: O((m*n)!) where m is the number of rows, and n is the number of columns. This arises because in the worst case, you might try placing a person in every cell of the grid.

- **Pruning**: Our pruning by row and column usage reduces many redundant calculations, but the problem remains NP-hard.

The backtracking solution is suitable for small grid sizes, for larger grids, additional heuristic techniques or dynamic programming optimizations might be necessary to improve efficiency.
