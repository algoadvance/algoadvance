[Leetcode 1764. Form Array by Concatenating Subarrays of Another Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1764)
### Problem Statement:

We are given two arrays, `groups` and `nums`. We need to determine if we can form the array `nums` by concatenating the subarrays in `groups` in the same order they appear in `groups`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the subarrays in `groups` appear in any order?**
   - No, they must appear in the same order as given in `groups`.
2. **Can `groups` have overlapping elements?**
   - Yes, but the concatenation needs to be accurate to form `nums`.

### Strategy:

1. **Iterate Over `groups`:** Traverse each subarray in `groups` to match them sequentially within `nums`.
2. **Check for Subarray Match:**
   - For each subarray in `groups`, attempt to find its elements sequentially in `nums` starting from the current index.
   - If the subarray is found, move the index in `nums` forward to the position just after the end of the matched subarray.
   - If it's not found, return `false`.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - `groups` or `nums` being empty.
   - Length of concatenated subarrays in `groups` should not exceed the length of `nums`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool canChoose(vector<vector<int>>& groups, vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int idx = 0; // pointer for nums
    
    for (const auto& group : groups) {
        bool found = false;
        while (idx <= n - group.size()) {
            bool match = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < group.size(); ++j) {
                if (nums[idx + j] != group[j]) {
                    match = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (match) {
                found = true;
                idx += group.size();
                break;
            } else {
                ++idx;
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Let `g` be the number of subarrays in `groups` and `n` be the size of `nums`.
- Matching each group of size `m` in `nums` can be done in `O(n * m)` in the worst-case scenario.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity can be approximated to `O(g * (n * m))` where `m` is the average size of subarrays in `groups`, but since each `m` is generally small and `nums` is large, we simplify it to `O(n * g)` for most practical cases.

This approach ensures that we effectively check for the concatenation of the subarrays from `groups` to form `nums` while respecting the order and positions.
