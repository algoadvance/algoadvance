[Leetcode 2025. Maximum Number of Ways to Partition an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2025)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You need to find the maximum number of ways to partition the array into exactly two non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the first subarray and the sum of the second subarray differ by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints?**
   - The length of the array `nums` is between `2` and `100000`.
   - Each element in the array `nums` is between `1` and `100000`.
   - The integer `k` can range from `-10^9` to `10^9`.
   
2. **Can subarrays overlap?**
   - No, the subarrays should be non-overlapping and non-empty.
   
3. **Do we need to return the number of ways or the maximum possible ways?**
   - We need to return the maximum possible number of ways.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Create an array `prefixSum` where `prefixSum[i]` holds the sum of the array `nums` from the beginning up to index `i`.
   
2. **Finding the Initial Partition Places:**
   - We can iterate over the array to determine possible indexes `i` where the array `nums` can be split into two subarrays (`nums[0:i]` and `nums[i:n]`). This split is valid if the difference of the sums of these subarrays is `k`.

3. **Using the Prefix Sum to Determine Partitions:**
   - For each index `i`, calculate the sum of the first subarray `sum1 = prefixSum[i-1]` and the second subarray `sum2 = totalSum - sum1` (where `totalSum` is the sum of the entire array).
   - Check if `sum1 - sum2` is equal to `k`.

4. **Maximum Number of Partitions:**
   - Keep a counter to determine the maximum number of valid partitions.
   
### Time Complexity:
- Building the prefix sum array takes `O(n)`.
- Iterating over the array to determine potential partitions also takes `O(n)`.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int maxPartitions(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> prefixSum(n, 0);
    prefixSum[0] = nums[0];
    
    // Compute the prefix sum array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }
    
    int totalSum = prefixSum[n - 1];
    int maxWays = 0;
    
    // We'll use a hashmap to track counts of prefix sums to optimize the look-up
    unordered_map<int, int> prefixFreq;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int currentPrefixSum = prefixSum[i];
        int remainingSum = totalSum - currentPrefixSum;
        
        // Check current valid partitions
        if (!i) { // Skip for prefixFreq first assignment at i=0
            prefixFreq[currentPrefixSum]++;
            continue;
        }
        if (remainingSum - currentPrefixSum == k) {
            maxWays++;
        }
        
        // Update prefix frequency for next round
        prefixFreq[currentPrefixSum]++;
    }
    
    return maxWays;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 3;
    cout << "Maximum Number of Partitions: " << maxPartitions(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - `prefixSum` is calculated to store cumulative sums of the `nums` array.
2. **Iterating for Valid Partitions:**
   - For each possible partition index `i`, check if `remainingSum - currentPrefixSum == k`.
3. **HashMap Usage:**
   - The prefix frequency map helps in constant time look-up and insertion, being used to store the count of prefix sums observed so far.
4. **Counting the Maximum Partitions:**
   - The number of valid partitions is counted and returned as the result.
