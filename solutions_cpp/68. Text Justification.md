[Leetcode 68. Text Justification](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l68)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified. You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Example:**

```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 300`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `words[i]` consists of only English letters and symbols.
- `1 <= maxWidth <= 100`
- `words[i].length <= maxWidth`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should we handle cases with minimal input sizes?
2. Do we need to consider multiple spaces within input words (e.g., spaces not visible)?
3. How should we handle a word longer than `maxWidth`?

### Strategy

1. **Greedy Packing**: We'll pack as many words as possible into each line until we can't add another word without exceeding `maxWidth`.
2. **Space Distribution**: For lines other than the last, distribute spaces as evenly as possible.
3. **Handle Last Line**: Left-justify the last line and fill the remaining space with spaces.
4. **Special Case Handling**: There will be no word length exceeding `maxWidth` as per constraints.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fullJustify(vector<string>& words, int maxWidth) {
        vector<string> result;
        int n = words.size();
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < n) {
            int totalChars = words[index].length();
            int last = index + 1;
            
            while (last < n) {
                if (totalChars + 1 + words[last].length() > maxWidth) break;
                totalChars += 1 + words[last].length();
                last++;
            }
            
            stringstream line;
            line << words[index];
            int gaps = last - index - 1;
            
            if (last == n || gaps == 0) {
                for (int i = index + 1; i < last; i++) {
                    line << " " << words[i];
                }
                for (int i = line.str().length(); i < maxWidth; i++) {
                    line << " ";
                }
            } else {
                int spaces = (maxWidth - totalChars) / gaps;
                int extraSpaces = (maxWidth - totalChars) % gaps;
                
                for (int i = index + 1; i < last; i++) {
                    for (int j = 0; j <= spaces + (i - index - 1 < extraSpaces); j++) {
                        line << " ";
                    }
                    line << words[i];
                }
            }
            
            result.push_back(line.str());
            index = last;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the total number of characters across all words. This is because we traverse all words only once and perform constant time operations for each word in the worst case.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(N)\) as we store the result in a vector of strings which will contain all the words and added spaces.
