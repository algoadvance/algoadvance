[Leetcode 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1780)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is possible to represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`:** What are the constraints on the value of `n`?
   - The constraints on `n` are typically from the problem description on LeetCode. Let's assume a common constraint where \(0 \leq n \leq 10^7\).

2. **Examples:**
   - For \( n = 12 \), the result should be `true` because \( 12 = 3^1 + 3^2 \) (i.e., 3 + 9).
   - For \( n = 91 \), the result should be `true` because \( 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4 \) (i.e., 1 + 9 + 81).
   - For \( n = 21 \), the result should be `false`.

### Strategy

To determine if `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three, consider the following:

1. **Base 3 Representation:**
   - If a number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of three, then in base 3 representation, no digit should be larger than 1. This is because \(2 \times 3^k\) would mean using the same power of three more than once.

2. **Simulation:**
   - We can convert the number `n` to its base 3 representation and check that all digits are either 0 or 1.

### Code

Here's a C++ solution to achieve the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
    while (n > 0) {
        if (n % 3 == 2) {
            return false;
        }
        n /= 3;
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    std::cout << checkPowersOfThree(12) << std::endl; // true
    std::cout << checkPowersOfThree(91) << std::endl; // true
    std::cout << checkPowersOfThree(21) << std::endl; // false
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- The function `checkPowersOfThree` takes an integer `n` and repeatedly:
    - Checks if the least significant digit in the base 3 representation is 2. If it is, returns `false` because it can't be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three.
    - Divides `n` by 3 to process the next digit in the base 3 representation.
- If we process all the digits and none of them is 2, the function returns `true`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\log_3 n)\) because each step reduces the value of `n` by a factor of 3.

This approach ensures a quick and efficient determination of whether `n` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three.
