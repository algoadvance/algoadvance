[Leetcode 219. Contains Duplicate II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l219)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is at most `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the values in the array `nums` and the integer `k`?**
   - The elements in `nums` can be any integer within the allowed range of integer values in C++.
   - It is also assumed `k` will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the array.

2. **What should be returned if the array `nums` is empty or contains only one element?**
   - If the array is empty or contains only one element, it is not possible to find two distinct indices. Therefore, the function should return `false` in such cases.

### Strategy

1. Utilize a hash map (unordered_map in C++) to keep track of the last seen index of each number.
2. Iterate through the array while updating the hash map.
   - If a number has been seen before and the difference between the current index and the last seen index is less than or equal to `k`, return `true`.
   - Otherwise, update the hash map with the current index of the number.
3. If no such pair is found by the end of the iteration, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool containsNearbyDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> index_map; // to store the latest index of each number
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (index_map.find(nums[i]) != index_map.end()) {
                if (i - index_map[nums[i]] <= k) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            index_map[nums[i]] = i; // update the index of the current number
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we are making a single pass through the array and performing constant-time operations (hash map insertions and lookups) for each element.

The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst-case scenario when all elements in `nums` are unique, resulting in the hash map storing `n` key-value pairs.
