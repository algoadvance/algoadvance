[Leetcode 2952. Minimum Number of Coins to be Added](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2952)
## Problem Statement
You are given `n` coins, where each coin has a positive integer value. Your goal is to ensure you can create every integer value from 1 to `sum(coins)` using some combination of the coins. However, if a coin value is larger than the current target number, it cannot be used to form that target.

Determine the minimum number of additional coins needed to ensure that you can create every number from 1 to `sum(coins)` using some combination of the coins given.

**Example:**
- Input: `coins = [1, 3]`
- Output: `0`

**Explanation:** You can form every number from 1 to `4` (which is the sum of the coins), so no additional coins are needed.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `n` and the individual coin values?
    - Assume `n` can be up to 10^4, and individual coin values are positive integers where each value can be up to `10^4`.
2. Should the additional coin values be within the range of existing coin values, or can they be any positive integer?
    - The additional coin values can be any positive integer.

## Strategy
1. Sort the list of coins to facilitate easier (greedy) checking.
2. Initialize a variable `current_max` to keep track of the largest value we can form with the coins so far.
3. Iterate through the sorted coin list, checking if the current coin can extend `current_max`.
4. If a gap is detected (i.e., a current coin value can't extend the `current_max`), increment a counter to add the required coins to bridge the gap.
5. Continue until you can form all values up to `sum(coins)`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minCoinsToBeAdded(std::vector<int>& coins) {
    std::sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
    int current_max = 0;
    int num_coins_added = 0;
    
    for (int coin : coins) {
        while (coin > current_max + 1) {
            num_coins_added++;
            current_max += (current_max + 1);
        }
        current_max += coin;
    }
    
    return num_coins_added;
}

// Example usage
// int main() {
//     std::vector<int> coins = {1, 3};
//     std::cout << minCoinsToBeAdded(coins) << std::endl; // Output: 0
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: We first sort the coin array.
2. **Initialization**: Set `current_max` to 0 to start forming the smallest possible number.
3. **Iteration**: Loop through each coin:
    - If the current coin is more than `current_max + 1`, we can't form `current_max + 1`. Thus, we add a new coin with value `current_max + 1` and increment `num_coins_added`.
    - If we can use the current coin, update `current_max`.
4. **Counter for Additional Coins**: Track new coins added through `num_coins_added`.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting: `O(n log n)`
- Iteration and greedily solving gaps: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
