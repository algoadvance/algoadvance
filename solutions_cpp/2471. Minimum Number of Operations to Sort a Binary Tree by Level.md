[Leetcode 2471. Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2471)
## Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values. In one operation, you can choose any two nodes at the same level and swap their values.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the values at each level sorted in a strictly increasing order.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,4,3,7,6,8,5,null,null,null,null,9,null,10]
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the values in the tree include duplicate values?
   - No, the values are unique as stated in the problem.
2. Can the tree be empty?
   - No, as the root node is guaranteed to be provided.
3. Is there a limit on the depth of the binary tree?
   - There is no specified limit, but we should handle reasonably large trees efficiently.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traverse the tree level by level.
2. **Sorting Each Level:**
   - Collect all values at each level.
   - Determine the number of swaps needed to sort these values using a helper function to compute the minimum number of adjacent swaps (minimum swaps to sort).
3. **Helper Function for Minimum Swaps:**
   - Use an approach similar to finding the minimum number of swaps to sort an array.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

// Function to calculate the minimum number of swaps to sort an array.
int minSwaps(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> temp(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        temp[i] = {arr[i], i};
    }
    
    // Sort the array based on the values.
    sort(temp.begin(), temp.end());
    
    // To keep track of visited elements.
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    int swaps = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // If the element is already visited or it is already in the correct position.
        if(visited[i] || temp[i].second == i) {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Calculate the size of the cycle.
        int cycle_size = 0;
        int j = i;
        while(!visited[j]) {
            visited[j] = true;
            j = temp[j].second;
            cycle_size++;
        }
        
        if(cycle_size > 0) {
            swaps += (cycle_size - 1);
        }
    }
    
    return swaps;
}

int minimumOperations(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    int total_swaps = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int level_size = q.size();
        vector<int> level_values;
        for (int i = 0; i < level_size; i++) {
            TreeNode* current = q.front();
            q.pop();
            level_values.push_back(current->val);
            if (current->left) q.push(current->left);
            if (current->right) q.push(current->right);
        }
        total_swaps += minSwaps(level_values);
    }

    return total_swaps;
}

// Example usage:

int main() {
    // Create the binary tree from the example.
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(8);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left->left = new TreeNode(9);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(10);

    cout << "Minimum number of operations: " << minimumOperations(root) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes, since each node is visited exactly once.
- **Minimum Swaps Calculation:**
  - Sorting: `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of nodes at the current level.
  - Tracking: `O(m)` for each level.
  
For the entire tree, the dominant time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to sorting at each level spread over all nodes in the tree.

## Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Data Structures:** `O(n)` for the BFS queue and the visited array.
- Overall, the space complexity is `O(n)`.
