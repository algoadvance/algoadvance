[Leetcode 2583. Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2583)
### Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree and a positive integer `k`. The task is to find the `k`-th largest sum of the values from the paths from the root to the leaves of this tree.

A path from the root to a leaf node is a sequence of nodes such that each node in the sequence has exactly one child that is in the sequence, and the leaf node is the last node in the sequence.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected range of input size (in terms of the number of nodes in the tree and the value of k)?**
   This helps us deduce whether a brute-force approach is feasible or whether an optimized solution is necessary.
   
2. **Can values in the binary tree be negative?**
   This impacts the sum calculations and identifying the largest sums.

3. **How should ties be handled?**
   If there are duplicate sums, do we count them separately or as a single unique sum?

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the Tree:**
   Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all root-to-leaf paths.
   
2. **Calculate Path Sums:**
   As we traverse, compute the sums of all root-to-leaf paths and keep track of these sums.

3. **Sort and Find Kth Largest:**
   After collecting all path sums, sort them and pick the k-th largest sum.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to implement the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>

class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int kthLargestPathSum(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        std::vector<int> pathSums;
        std::vector<int> currentPath;
        
        // Perform DFS to collect all path sums
        calculatePathSumsDfs(root, 0, pathSums);
        
        // Sort the path sums in non-increasing order
        std::sort(pathSums.begin(), pathSums.end(), std::greater<int>());
        
        // Return the k-th largest path sum (adjust for k being 1-indexed)
        if (k <= pathSums.size()) {
            return pathSums[k-1];
        } else {
            return -1; // Or handle the error as the caller specifies
        }
    }
    
private:
    void calculatePathSumsDfs(TreeNode* node, int currentSum, std::vector<int)& pathSums) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return;
        }
        currentSum += node->val;

        // Check for leaf node
        if (node->left == nullptr && node->right == nullptr) {
            pathSums.push_back(currentSum);
        } else {
            // Recurse for left and right children
            calculatePathSumsDfs(node->left, currentSum, pathSums);
            calculatePathSumsDfs(node->right, currentSum, pathSums);
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Tree Traversal (DFS):** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. DFS ensures every node is visited once.

2. **Calculate Path Sums:** O(P), where P is the number of paths, which in the worst case is the number of leaf nodes (âˆ¼ O(N/2) for a balanced binary tree).

3. **Sorting Path Sums:** O(P log P).

Overall, the dominant term is the sorting step, leading to a total time complexity of **O(N + P log P)**. In typical use-cases with a balanced tree, this is effectively **O(N log N)**, since P can be approximately N/2.
