[Leetcode 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1353)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Each event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startDayi <= d <= endDayi`. You can only attend one event at any day `d`.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `startDayi` and `endDayi`?**
   - The constraints usually indicate realistic ranges, but one can assume values are positive and within a feasible range for computation.

2. **Can events overlap?**
   - Yes, events can overlap, and some events might start on the same day while others end on the same day.

3. **What is the expected size of the `events` array?**
   - This is important for deciding on the algorithm's complexity.

4. **Is there any specific order of events that we need to consider while solving the problem?**
   - Not inherently, but typically sorting helps in organizing the events to manage conflicts effectively.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting and Priority Queue:**
   - First, sort the events by their start day.
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of events by their end day.
   - Iterate through each possible day, and try to attend the earliest ending event that can be attended on that day.

2. **Steps:**
   - Sort the events based on their start days.
   - Use a priority queue to keep track of events that you can attend on the current day.
   - For each day starting from the minimum start day to the maximum end day:
     - Add all the events that start on that day to the priority queue.
     - Remove events from the priority queue that have already ended.
     - Attend the event that ends the earliest.
   - Continue this process until you have checked all potential days from the minimum start day to the maximum end day.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
    // Sort events based on start day
    sort(events.begin(), events.end());
    
    // Min-heap to keep track of minimum end day of events that can be attended
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
    
    int maxEventsAttended = 0;
    int day = 0;
    int i = 0;
    int n = events.size();
    
    while (!minHeap.empty() || i < n) {
        if (minHeap.empty()) {
            // Move the day to the start of the next event
            day = events[i][0];
        }
        
        // Add all events starting on this day to the priority queue
        while (i < n && events[i][0] == day) {
            minHeap.push(events[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        
        // Remove all events that ended before today
        while (!minHeap.empty() && minHeap.top() < day) {
            minHeap.pop();
        }
        
        // Attend the event which ends the earliest
        if (!minHeap.empty()) {
            minHeap.pop();
            maxEventsAttended++;
        }
        
        day++;
    }
    
    return maxEventsAttended;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of events.
- **Heap operations:** Each event is added and removed from the heap exactly once.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution efficiently manages overlapping events and ensures the maximum number of events is attended by always prioritizing the event that ends the earliest.
