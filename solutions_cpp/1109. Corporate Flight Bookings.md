[Leetcode 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1109)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `bookings` where `bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi]` represents a booking for flights from `firsti` to `lasti` (inclusive) with `seatsi` seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array `answer` of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the total number of seats reserved for flight `i+1`.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` (the number of flights) and `m` (the number of bookings)?**
   - Typically, constraints should be clarified to understand possible performance issues with algorithms.

2. **Can `firsti` and `lasti` be out of range (i.e., less than 1 or greater than `n`)?**
   - It helps ensure assumptions about inputs are correct.

3. **Is it safe to assume that the bookings array is non-empty?**
   - Confirming if there might be edge cases with an empty bookings array.

### Strategy

The problem can be efficiently solved using a "difference array" technique which is particularly useful for managing range updates in O(1) time and processing the results in O(n) time. 

1. Initialize an array `seats` of length `n+1` with zeroes to keep track of the number of seats booked at each index.
2. For each booking in the `bookings` array, update the `seats` array:
   - Add `seatsi` to `seats[firsti - 1]`.
   - Subtract `seatsi` from `seats[lasti]` (if `lasti` is within bounds).
3. Compute the prefix sum of the `seats` array to get the total number of seats booked up to each flight.

### Code

Here's how it can be implemented in C++.

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> corpFlightBookings(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
    std::vector<int> seats(n + 1, 0);

    // Step through each booking and adjust seats array accordingly
    for (const auto& booking : bookings) {
        int first = booking[0];
        int last = booking[1];
        int seats_count = booking[2];

        seats[first - 1] += seats_count;
        if (last < n) {
            seats[last] -= seats_count;
        }
    }

    // Calculate the prefix sum to determine the number of seats booked for each flight
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        seats[i] += seats[i - 1];
    }

    // Remove the extra element used for the difference array
    seats.pop_back();

    return seats;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(m + n), where `m` is the number of bookings and `n` is the number of flights.
- **O(m)** for processing the bookings and updating the difference array.
- **O(n)** for computing the prefix sum over the `seats` array.

This solution is efficient for large values of `m` and `n`, ensuring it scales appropriately for most reasonable input sizes.

This approach ensures all operations are both time and space efficient, leveraging the difference array method to handle range updates optimally.
