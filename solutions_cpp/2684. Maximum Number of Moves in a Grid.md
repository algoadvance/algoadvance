[Leetcode 2684. Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2684)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` where each cell `(i, j)` has the following conditions:

1. The value in each cell `(i, j)` represents a value `grid[i][j]`.

Your task is to find the maximum number of contiguous "moves" you can make starting from a cell, such that the value in the next cell is strictly greater than the value in the current cell. You can move to adjacent cells (left, right, up, or down).

### Example
```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],
               [6,5,4],
               [7,10,2]]

Output: 4
```

The longest path goes as follows: from (2,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) with values (10 -> 5 -> 3 -> 1)

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are we allowed to move diagonally, or only horizontally and vertically?
   
   - Only horizontally and vertically.

2. What is the range of `m` and `n`?
   
   - Typically, m and n can go up to 1000 but should be clarified.

3. Do we need to return the maximum path length or the actual path?
   
   - The problem states to return the maximum number of moves.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: Use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems.
   
   - For each cell, compute the maximum moves starting from that cell.
   - Use a memoization table to store this result to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Implement DFS to explore all possible moves from a cell.
   
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, perform DFS to find the maximum path length.
   
   - Check four possible moves (left, right, up, and down) and ensure the next move is valid (i.e., within bounds and the value is strictly greater).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxMoves(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        int max_moves = 0;

        // Directions: right, down, left, up
        int dirs[4][2] = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int i, int j) -> int {
            if (dp[i][j] != -1) {
                return dp[i][j];
            }
            
            int max_path = 0;
            for (auto& dir : dirs) {
                int ni = i + dir[0];
                int nj = j + dir[1];
                if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n && grid[ni][nj] > grid[i][j]) {
                    max_path = max(max_path, 1 + dfs(ni, nj));
                }
            }
            
            dp[i][j] = max_path;
            return max_path;
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                max_moves = max(max_moves, dfs(i, j));
            }
        }
        
        return max_moves;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\) because each cell is visited once and then memoized, avoiding redundant calculations.
- Space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) for storing the memoization table.
