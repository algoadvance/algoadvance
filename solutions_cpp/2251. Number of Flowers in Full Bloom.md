[Leetcode 2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2251)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `flowers` and `persons`. 
- `flowers[i][0]` represents the start time of the i-th flower.
- `flowers[i][1]` represents the end time of the i-th flower.
- `persons[j]` represents the time at which the j-th person arrives.

For each person, determine the number of flowers that are in full bloom when they arrive. A flower is in full bloom if the person's arrival time is between the flower's start and end times, inclusive. Return an array of integers where the i-th integer is the number of flowers in full bloom when the i-th person arrives.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of `flowers` and `persons` arrays?**
2. **Can the start and end times of the flowers overlap or be the same?**
3. **Is it guaranteed that start time is always less than or equal to end time for each flower entry?**
4. **What is the range of values for the start and end times as well as the arrival time of persons?**
5. **Do we need to handle edge cases like no flowers or no persons in a specific way?**

Given these details, let's proceed to devise a strategy and code the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the flowers by start time and end time separately**.
2. **For each person, perform two binary searches**:
   - **Count the number of flowers that have started blooming (`start_blooms`) before or at the time of the person's arrival.**
   - **Count the number of flowers that have finished blooming (`end_blooms`) before the time of the person's arrival.**
3. **The number of flowers in full bloom will be the difference between the two counts: `start_blooms - end_blooms`**.

### Code

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> fullBloomFlowers(vector<vector<int>>& flowers, vector<int>& persons) {
    vector<int> starts, ends;
    for (const auto& flower : flowers) {
        starts.push_back(flower[0]);
        ends.push_back(flower[1]);
    }
    sort(starts.begin(), starts.end());
    sort(ends.begin(), ends.end());

    vector<int> result;
    for (int person : persons) {
        int start_blooms = upper_bound(starts.begin(), starts.end(), person) - starts.begin();
        int end_blooms = lower_bound(ends.begin(), ends.end(), person) - ends.begin();
        result.push_back(start_blooms - end_blooms);
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the `starts` and `ends` arrays** takes \(O(n \log n)\) time where \(n\) is the number of flowers.
2. **Each binary search operation** for calculating `start_blooms` and `end_blooms` takes \(O(\log n)\) time.
3. **Total time complexity**:
   - Sorting: \(O(n \log n + n \log n) = O(n \log n)\)
   - For each person, both the binary searches collectively take \(O(\log n)\). For \(m\) persons, this becomes \(O(m \log n)\).

So, the **overall time complexity** is \(O(n \log n + m \log n)\), which should be efficient for large inputs.
