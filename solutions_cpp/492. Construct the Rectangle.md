[Leetcode 492. Construct the Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l492)
### Problem Statement

Given an area `area`, design a rectangular web page, whose length `L` and width `W` satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangle must be equal to the given area.
2. The width `W` should not be larger than the length `L`, meaning `L >= W`.
3. The difference between `L` and `W` should be as small as possible.

Return an array `[L, W]` where `L` and `W` are the length and width of the rectangle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the area guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can the length and width be the same?**
   - Yes, if a perfect square root exists.

3. **Are we guaranteed that there will be a pair `(L, W)` such that `L * W = area` and `L >= W`?**
   - Yes, since the area is a positive integer, there will always exist at least one valid pair.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find two integers `L` and `W` such that `L * W = area`, `L >= W`, and the difference `(L - W)` is minimized.

Steps:
1. Start from the integer closest to the square root of the area and iterate downwards to find the first factor of the area.
2. For any factor `W` found, calculate `L` as `L = area / W`.
3. Store the pair `(L, W)` and return it as soon as we find a valid pair, since we are moving downwards from the square root, this ensures that `(L - W)` is minimized.

The reason for iterating from the square root downwards is that the factors closest to the square root will have the smallest difference.

### Code

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
    int w = static_cast<int>(std::sqrt(area));
    while (area % w != 0) {
        w--;
    }
    
    int l = area / w;
    return {l, w};
}

int main() {
    int area = 4;
    std::vector<int> result = constructRectangle(area);
    
    std::cout << "Length: " << result[0] << ", Width: " << result[1] << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

* The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\sqrt{n})\) where `n` is the area. This is because in the worst case, we iterate from the integer part of the square root of `area` down to 1 to find the first factor.
* The space complexity is \(O(1)\), except for the space used to store the result (which is \(O(2)\)).

This solution provides a balanced, minimal and efficient way to find the desired dimensions for the rectangle.
