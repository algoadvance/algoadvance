### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1144: **Decrease Elements To Make Array Zigzag**

Given an array `nums` of integers, a "zigzag" array is defined as an array where:
- `nums[0] > nums[1] < nums[2] > nums[3] < nums[4]...`

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of moves you need to make any array "zigzag". A move consists of two operations:
1. Decrease one element of the array by `1`.
2. Change it to any value other than its original value at least once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there negative numbers in the array?**
   Yes, the array can include negative numbers.

2. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

3. **What is the definition of a move?**
   In this context, a move is decrementing an element by 1.

4. **Can the array contain identical elements?**
   Yes, the array can contain identical elements, and these can also be part of the transformation process.

5. **Are there any restrictions on how we modify the array?**
   No, the primary restriction is ensuring the minimum number of moves to make the array zigzag conformant.

### Strategy

We need to check the array for two possible arrangements:
1. Make elements at even indices greater than their adjacent odd-indexed elements.
2. Make elements at odd indices greater than their adjacent even-indexed elements.

We'll calculate the cost (number of decreases needed) for both scenarios and return the minimum of the two.

### Steps and Code

1. **Initialize two counters** to keep track of the total moves needed for each scenario.
2. **Iterate through the array** and for each element, calculate the cost to make it adhere to the zigzag pattern for both scenarios.
3. **Return the minimum** of the two counters.

Here is the code that implements this strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int movesToMakeZigzag(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    // If the array has only one element, it's trivially a zigzag array
    if (n <= 1) return 0;
    
    // Two possible costs
    int evenIdxCost = 0;
    int oddIdxCost = 0;
    
    // For even index greater condition: nums[0] > nums[1] < nums[2] > nums[3] < nums[4] ...
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
        int left = (i > 0) ? nums[i-1] : INT_MAX;
        int right = (i < n-1) ? nums[i+1] : INT_MAX;
        int minAdj = min(left, right);
        if (nums[i] >= minAdj) {
            evenIdxCost += nums[i] - minAdj + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // For odd index greater condition: nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3] > nums[4] ...
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
        int left = (i > 0) ? nums[i-1] : INT_MAX;
        int right = (i < n-1) ? nums[i+1] : INT_MAX;
        int minAdj = min(left, right);
        if (nums[i] >= minAdj) {
            oddIdxCost += nums[i] - minAdj + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return min(evenIdxCost, oddIdxCost);
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we make a single pass through the array in both scenarios. Since we have two passes, it is still linear and efficient.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
