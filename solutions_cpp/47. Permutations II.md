[Leetcode 47. Permutations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l47)
## Problem Statement
The problem "Permutations II" from LeetCode requires generating all unique permutations of a given list of numbers that might contain duplicates. The result should not contain any duplicate permutations.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What is the length range of the input list?
   - The length can range from 0 to 8 (based on typical constraints for permutation problems).

2. **Output Order:** Does the order of the permutations in the output matter?
   - No, the order does not matter as long as all unique permutations are included.

3. **Duplicate Permutation Handling:** Should we assume the given input is sorted, or do we need to handle that in our algorithm?
   - We should handle sorting within the algorithm to manage duplicates effectively.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting:** First, sort the input list to make it easier to skip duplicate elements when generating permutations.
2. **Backtracking:** Use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations.
3. **Avoiding Duplicates:** Use a `visited` array to keep track of used elements and avoid using the same element more than once at the same position in different recursive calls.

### Steps:
1. **Sort the Array:** Helps in easily identifying and skipping duplicates.
2. **Backtracking Function:** Recursively build permutations while marking elements as used.
3. **Visited Array:** Keep track of which elements have been used at each position.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> permuteUnique(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        std::vector<int> current;
        std::vector<bool> visited(nums.size(), false);
        
        // Sort the nums array to handle duplicates
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        // Begin backtracking process
        backtrack(nums, current, visited, result);

        return result;
    }
    
private:
    void backtrack(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<int>& current, std::vector<bool>& visited, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& result) {
        // Base case: if current permutation is complete
        if (current.size() == nums.size()) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            // Skip used elements and duplicates
            if (visited[i] || (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1] && !visited[i-1])) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // Include this element in the current permutation
            visited[i] = true;
            current.push_back(nums[i]);
            
            // Recurse to build all possible permutations
            backtrack(nums, current, visited, result);
            
            // Backtrack: undo the choice
            current.pop_back();
            visited[i] = false;
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of generating all unique permutations is determined by the number of permutations and the cost to generate each one. In the worst case:

- **Sorting complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Permutations:** The maximum possible unique permutations for `n` distinct elements are \(n!\). However, with duplicates, this number decreases, but the upper bound remains \(n!\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n! \cdot n)\):
- \(n \log n\) for the initial sorting.
- \(n!\) for generating all unique permutations.
- \(n\) for copying each permutation into the result list.

Therefore, the combined time complexity is effectively \(O(n \cdot n!)\) in the worst case.
