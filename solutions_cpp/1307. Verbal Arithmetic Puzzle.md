[Leetcode 1307. Verbal Arithmetic Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1307)
### Problem Statement

You are given an equation, represented by words, where each letter represents a different digit from 0 to 9, and a certain order of letters is given. You need to determine whether the equation can be satisfied by assigning digits to the letters.

The equation is given in the form of a list of strings representing two sides of the equation, with each string being a word. An example would look like this:

```cpp
words = ["SEND", "MORE"]
result = "MONEY"
```

You need to check if there is a valid assignment of digits to letters so that:

\[ SEND + MORE = MONEY \]

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be leading zeros in the numbers represented by words?**
   - No, a word cannot have a leading zero unless it is the digit zero itself.

2. **Can the words contain lowercase letters or other characters apart from uppercase letters?**
   - No, the words contain only uppercase English letters.

3. **Are there constraints on the length of the words or the number of words?**
   - The length of each word and the result word will be between 1 and 7.
   - There are more constraints specified in the problem to ensure computational feasibility.

### Strategy

1. **Backtracking**:
    - Use a backtracking approach to explore all possible mappings of letters to digits.
  
2. **Prune Infeasible Paths**:
    - Ensure that words don't have leading zeros.
    - At each step, check if the partially built number exceeds the corresponding prefix of the result number.
  
3. **Check Final Equation**:
    - When a feasible set of mappings is found, ensure it satisfies the overall equation.

### Code

Hereâ€™s an implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<char, int> charToDigit;
    unordered_set<int> usedDigits;
    
    bool isValidSolution(vector<string>& words, string& result) {
        // Calculate the total sum of words
        long sum = 0;
        for (string& word : words) {
            sum += wordToNumber(word);
        }
        // Calculate the number representation of result
        long resultNumber = wordToNumber(result);
        return sum == resultNumber;
    }
    
    long wordToNumber(string& word) {
        long number = 0;
        for (char c : word) {
            number = number * 10 + charToDigit[c];
        }
        return number;
    }
    
    bool backtrack(vector<string>& words, string& result, vector<char>& uniqueChars, int index) {
        if (index == uniqueChars.size()) {
            return isValidSolution(words, result);
        }
        
        char currentChar = uniqueChars[index];
        for (int digit = 0; digit <= 9; ++digit) {
            if (usedDigits.find(digit) == usedDigits.end()) {
                charToDigit[currentChar] = digit;
                usedDigits.insert(digit);
                
                if (backtrack(words, result, uniqueChars, index + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }
                
                usedDigits.erase(digit);
                charToDigit.erase(currentChar);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
public:
    bool isSolvable(vector<string>& words, string result) {
        unordered_set<char> uniqueChars;
        for (auto& word : words) {
            for (char c : word) {
                uniqueChars.insert(c);
            }
        }
        for (char c : result) {
            uniqueChars.insert(c);
        }
        
        vector<char> uniqueCharList(uniqueChars.begin(), uniqueChars.end());
        if (uniqueCharList.size() > 10) {
            // More than 10 unique characters, not possible to map each to a unique digit
            return false;
        }
        
        return backtrack(words, result, uniqueCharList, 0);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<string> words = {"SEND", "MORE"};
    string result = "MONEY";
    if (sol.isSolvable(words, result)) {
        cout << "The equation is solvable." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The equation is not solvable." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The worst-case time complexity of this approach is \( O(10^k) \) where \( k \) is the number of unique characters. This is because each character can be assigned one of 10 digits, leading to 10 possible values.
- Since \( k \) can be at most 10, this ensures the computation remains feasible within standard backtracking limits.
