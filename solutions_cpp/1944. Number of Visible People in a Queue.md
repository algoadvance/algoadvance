[Leetcode 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1944)
Absolutely, Let's break down the solution into clear sections.

### Problem Statement

You are given an array `heights` representing the heights of people standing in a queue. Each person can see the person directly in front of them if that person is shorter than themselves. More formally, for a person standing at position `i`, if there is a person at position `j` such that `j > i` and `heights[j] < heights[i]`, then the person at position `i` can see the person at position `j`. Your task is to determine the number of people each person can see directly in front of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of the `heights` array (e.g., maximum length)?
2. **Input values**: What are the constraints on the height values (e.g., integer range)?
3. **Edge cases**: What should be the outcome for an empty array or an array with only one person?

Assumes:
- `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`

### Strategy

To efficiently determine the number of people each person can see, we can use a **monotonic stack**. The idea is to iterate through the `heights` array from right to left, maintaining a stack that helps capture the current state of visible people.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. Initialize a stack to keep track of heights and the number of visible people from each position.
2. Iterate through the `heights` array from right to left.
3. For each person at position `i`, maintain how many people they can see in front of them.
4. Use the stack to keep track of visible heights and update the counts accordingly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::vector<int> canSeePersonsCount(std::vector<int>& heights) {
    int n = heights.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n, 0);
    std::stack<int> stk;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        while (!stk.empty() && heights[i] > heights[stk.top()]) {
            result[i]++;
            stk.pop();
        }
        if (!stk.empty()) {
            result[i]++;
        }
        stk.push(i);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves iterating through the `heights` array once and uses a stack to maintain the state. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in an overall O(n) complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage used by the stack and the result array.

This method ensures we efficiently determine the number of visible people in front of each person in the queue while adhering to the constraints.
