[Leetcode 951. Flip Equivalent Binary Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l951)
## Problem Statement
You are given the roots of two binary trees, `root1` and `root2`. We need to determine if `root1` and `root2` are flip equivalent. 

Two binary trees are considered flip equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by a series of flip operations. A flip operation consists of swapping the left and right children of a node.

Here is the function signature:
```cpp
bool flipEquiv(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2);
```

Where `TreeNode` is defined as:
```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What range can the integer values of the nodes take?
   - The values are within the usual range of integers.
2. Should the function return `false` if either tree is empty?
   - If both trees are empty, they are trivially flip equivalent and should return `true`; if one is empty and the other is not, return `false`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need a recursive function that checks whether two trees are flip equivalent. Here's the strategy broken down:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If both nodes are `nullptr`, return `true`.
   - If one is `nullptr` and the other is not, return `false`.
   - If the values of the nodes are different, return `false`.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Check if children of the nodes are flip equivalent in two scenarios:
     1. No Flip: Are the left children and right children of both nodes equivalent without any flip?
     2. Flip: Are the left child of `root1` equivalent to the right child of `root2` and vice versa?
   
3. **Combining Results**: The result should be `true` if either the no-flip scenario or the flip scenario returns `true`.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation based on the above strategy:
```cpp
bool flipEquiv(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
    if (root1 == nullptr && root2 == nullptr) {
        return true;
    }
    if (root1 == nullptr || root2 == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    if (root1->val != root2->val) {
        return false;
    }
    
    bool no_flip = flipEquiv(root1->left, root2->left) && flipEquiv(root1->right, root2->right);
    bool flip = flipEquiv(root1->left, root2->right) && flipEquiv(root1->right, root2->left);
    
    return no_flip || flip;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the trees. This is because each node is visited and compared once. In the worst case, the function will perform a linear scan of all nodes.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

This strategy ensures that all nodes are evaluated correctly for flip equivalence considering both possible configurations (with or without a flip).
