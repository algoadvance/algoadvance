[Leetcode 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1668)
### Problem Statement:

**1668. Maximum Repeating Substring**

Given a string `sequence` and a string `word`, return the maximum number of times `word` can be repeated in `sequence` as a substring.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the `word` overlap within the `sequence`?**
   - No, we are looking for non-overlapping instances of `word` when it is repeated.
   
2. **What is the length range for `sequence` and `word`?**
   - The length of `sequence` and `word` doesnâ€™t exceed \(100\) characters.
   
3. **Can `sequence` or `word` be empty strings?**
   - According to the problem constraints, neither `sequence` nor `word` would be empty.

### Strategy:

1. **Concatenate `word` Multiple Times**: Create increasingly longer strings of repeated `word` (e.g., `word`, `word+word`, `word+word+word`, etc.).
   
2. **Check Substring Existence**: For each concatenated string, check if it is a substring of `sequence`.

3. **Optimize Checking**: Stop as soon as the concatenated string is no longer found in `sequence`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int maxRepeating(string sequence, string word) {
    int maxRepeat = 0;
    string repeatedWord = word;

    while (sequence.find(repeatedWord) != string::npos) {
        maxRepeat++;
        repeatedWord += word;
    }

    return maxRepeat;
}

int main() {
    string sequence = "ababc";
    string word = "ab";
    cout << "Maximum repeating: " << maxRepeating(sequence, word) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Worst-case scenario**: The outer loop runs as long as the length of `repeatedWord` is within the length of `sequence`. Suppose `n` is the length of `sequence` and `m` is the length of `word`.
- Each concatenation operation takes \(O(k \cdot m)\) time for the `k`th concatenated string and checking for a substring takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case. However, the overall complexity is dominated by the increasing size of `repeatedWord`.
- The overall time complexity approximates to \(O((n/m) \cdot n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n^2 / m)\).

### Explanation:

1. **Concatenate**: We keep concatenating `word` to a temporary `repeatedWord` string.
2. **Substring Check**: We use `find` to check if `repeatedWord` is in `sequence`.
3. **Increment**: If found, we increase the count and continue; otherwise, stop and return the count.

This ensures that we correctly identify the maximum number of times `word` can be repeated consecutively within `sequence`.
