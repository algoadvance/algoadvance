[Leetcode 3207. Maximum Points After Enemy Battles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3207)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` and `m`. `n` and `m` are the number of players in team A and team B respectively. Each player in team A has some skill points and each player in team B has some skill points. Each team's points are listed in two separate lists, `aPoints` and `bPoints`.

The two teams have a battle. In each round of the battle, you can pick one player from team A and one player from team B to fight. The player with more skill points wins the round and you get points equal to the skill points of the winning player. The player who loses the round is out of the battle. If the players have equal skill points, no points are awarded to either team and both players are out. 

Return the maximum number of points you can score if you choose the players optimally for each round.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: n = 3, m = 3, aPoints = [1, 3, 5], bPoints = [2, 2, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
- Pick player with 3 from team A and player with 2 from team B, you get 3 points.
- Pick player with 5 from team A and player with 4 from team B, you get 5 points.
- Player with 1 from team A and player with 2 from team B, no points are scored as the last player of team A loses.

Total points = 3 + 5 = 8
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. When a player loses, is there a specific order in which they lose (e.g., must take the lowest/highest first)?
2. What are the constraints such as the maximum values for `n` and `m`?
3. Are the lists `aPoints` and `bPoints` guaranteed to be of length `n` and `m` respectively?
4. Are the skill points guaranteed to be positive integers?

## Strategy

To solve this problem optimally:
1. **Sort Both Lists**: Sort `aPoints` and `bPoints`.
2. **Two-Pointer Approach**: Use two pointers to traverse the sorted lists from the highest skill points.
3. **Optimal Choice**:
    - If the current player from team A has higher skill points than the current player from team B, gain points equal to the skill points of the team A player.
    - If the skill points are tied, both players are removed without scoring any points.
    - If the current player from team B has higher skill points, no points are gained for this round.
4. **Continue Until Exhaustion**: Continue this process until one of the teams has no players left.

This two-pointer technique ensures that you make the optimal choice at each step by always comparing the strongest available players.

## Code
The implementation follows the strategy outlined above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxPoints(int n, int m, std::vector<int>& aPoints, std::vector<int>& bPoints) {
    std::sort(aPoints.begin(), aPoints.end(), std::greater<int>());
    std::sort(bPoints.begin(), bPoints.end(), std::greater<int>());

    int i = 0, j = 0;
    int totalPoints = 0;

    while (i < n && j < m) {
        if (aPoints[i] > bPoints[j]) {
            totalPoints += aPoints[i];
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (aPoints[i] < bPoints[j]) {
            j++;
        } else { // aPoints[i] == bPoints[j]
            i++;
            j++;
        }
    }

    return totalPoints;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3, m = 3;
    std::vector<int> aPoints = {1, 3, 5};
    std::vector<int> bPoints = {2, 2, 4};

    std::cout << "Maximum points: " << maxPoints(n, m, aPoints, bPoints) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Sorting `aPoints` and `bPoints` each takes \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\).
- **Two-pointers traversal**: Traversing both lists takes \(O(\max(n, m))\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\).

This approach ensures that we always make the optimal choice and compute the maximum score efficiently.
