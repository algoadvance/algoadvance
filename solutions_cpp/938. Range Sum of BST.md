[Leetcode 938. Range Sum of BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l938)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and two integers `low` and `high`. Return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes within range are [10, 7, 15]. Sum is 32.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of node values?**
   - Node values are usually within the 32-bit integer range unless otherwise specified.

2. **Can the BST have duplicate values?**
   - Typically, a BST does not have duplicate values.

3. **What is the maximum size of the tree?**
   - Constraints typically specify the size, but if not provided, consider reasonable assumptions for computational limits.

4. **Are the `low` and `high` values always valid?**
   - Assume they are valid and `low <= high`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, leverage the properties of the Binary Search Tree:

1. **Recursion**: Traverse the tree and keep a running sum of values within the range.
   - If the current nodeâ€™s value is within `[low, high]`, add it to the sum.
   - If the current node's value is less than `low`, explore only the right subtree.
   - If the current node's value is greater than `high`, explore only the left subtree.
   - Otherwise, explore both subtrees.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if (!root) {
            return 0;  // Base case: if the node is null, return 0
        }

        // Initialize the sum
        int sum = 0;
        
        // Case 1: Node's value is within the range
        if (root->val >= low && root->val <= high) {
            sum += root->val;
        }

        // Case 2: Node's value is greater than low, explore left subtree
        if (root->val > low) {
            sum += rangeSumBST(root->left, low, high);
        }

        // Case 3: Node's value is less than high, explore right subtree
        if (root->val < high) {
            sum += rangeSumBST(root->right, low, high);
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};

// Helper function to create a new node
TreeNode* newNode(int data) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode();
    node->val = data;
    node->left = node->right = nullptr;
    return node;
}

// Main function to test the solution
int main() {
    // Creating the tree from the example
    /* Tree:
            10
           /  \
          5    15
         / \     \
        3   7     18
    */
    TreeNode* root = newNode(10);
    root->left = newNode(5);
    root->right = newNode(15);
    root->left->left = newNode(3);
    root->left->right = newNode(7);
    root->right->right = newNode(18);

    Solution sol;
    int low = 7, high = 15;
    std::cout << "Range Sum of BST (7, 15): " << sol.rangeSumBST(root, low, high) << std::endl;  // Output: 32

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where `n` is the number of nodes in the BST. This is because we might end up visiting all nodes if all values fall within the range or if the tree is skewed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree due to the recursive stack. In the worst case, it is O(n) if the tree is completely unbalanced or skewed.

This solution effectively leverages the BST properties to minimize unnecessary traversals, ensuring efficient computation of the range sum.
