[Leetcode 2948. Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2948)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You can make the array lexicographically smaller by swapping elements at specified positions a limited number of times. You are given a list of queries, where each query contains a pair of indices `(i, j)`, which indicates that you can swap the elements at these positions. You have to decide in which order to perform the swaps to make the array lexicographically smallest. Return the lexicographically smallest array after all the swaps.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   - What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?
   - What is the size range for the list of queries?

2. **Output Clarification:**
   - Should the final array be output as a vector or an array?

3. **Query Constraints:**
   - Are the pairs in the queries distinct or can they repeat?
   - Can there be multiple correct solutions or is the correct solution unique?

Assuming no further exceptional conditions are stated, we will proceed with typical constraints such as:
- Array size `n` ranging from 1 to 1000.
- Each element in `nums` is within the range `[1, 1000]`.
- The number of queries `m` is also within `[1, 1000]`.

### Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - We will use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage connected components through the queries.
   - For each query `(i, j)`, we will union the indices `i` and `j`.

2. **Component Collection**:
   - After processing all queries, determine the connected components.
   - Collect all elements in the same component and sort them.

3. **Reconstruction**:
   - Carefully place the sorted elements back into their original indices to ensure the array is lexicographically smallest.

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations**: Nearly O(m), which is very efficient.
- **Sorting within Components**: O(n log n) in the worst case if the whole array is a single component.

### Code

Here is the complete C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>  // For iota

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> makeSmallestArray(vector<int>& nums, vector<pair<int, int>>& queries) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> parent(n);
        vector<int> rank(n, 0);
        
        // Initialize Union-Find
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
        
        function<int(int)> find = [&](int node) {
            if (parent[node] != node) {
                parent[node] = find(parent[node]);
            }
            return parent[node];
        };
        
        auto unionSets = [&](int u, int v) {
            int rootU = find(u);
            int rootV = find(v);
            if (rootU != rootV) {
                if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV]) {
                    parent[rootV] = rootU;
                } else if (rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]) {
                    parent[rootU] = rootV;
                } else {
                    parent[rootV] = rootU;
                    rank[rootU]++;
                }
            }
        };
        
        // Process all queries, building the union-find structure
        for (const auto& query : queries) {
            unionSets(query.first, query.second);
        }
        
        // Find and group components
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> componentMap;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            componentMap[find(i)].push_back(i);
        }
        
        // Sort each component and replace in nums
        for (auto& item : componentMap) {
            vector<int>& indices = item.second;
            vector<int> values;
            for (int index : indices) {
                values.push_back(nums[index]);
            }
            sort(values.begin(), values.end());
            for (int j = 0; j < indices.size(); ++j) {
                nums[indices[j]] = values[j];
            }
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
};
```

This code will take the given array and perform the swaps specified by the `queries` to return the lexicographically smallest possible array.
