[Leetcode 691. Stickers to Spell Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l691)
### Problem Statement
We are given a collection of `n` unique stickers where each sticker is represented by a string containing lowercase English letters. We want to determine the minimum number of stickers required to spell out a given target string. This is a combinational optimization problem where some stickers may be used multiple times.

**Function Signature**
```cpp
int minStickers(vector<string>& stickers, string target);
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we use the same sticker multiple times?**
   - Yes, each sticker can be used multiple times.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of stickers or the target?**
   - Typically, we can assume reasonable constraints like `n <= 50` and lengths of the stickers and target not exceeding `50`.

3. **What should be the output if it is not possible to form the target string with the given stickers?**
   - Return `-1` if it's impossible to form the target string.

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Count:** First, we will count the frequency of each character in the stickers and target string.
  
2. **Memoization:** Utilize a memoization technique to avoid recalculations for the same subproblems. 

3. **Recursive Helper Function:** Define a recursive function that tries to form the target by using the available stickers. This function will minimize the number of stickers used.

4. **Optimization Insight:** Use a bitmask to represent the state of target string formation, which helps in efficiently tracking which part of the target is still needed.

### Time Complexity
The problem is NP-hard, so the worst-case time complexity is exponential relative to the size of the input. However, with memoization, we can considerably reduce repeated calculations.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minStickers(vector<string>& stickers, string target) {
    int n = stickers.size();
    vector<vector<int>> stickerCount(n, vector<int>(26, 0));
    
    // Calculate stickers character frequency
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (char c : stickers[i]) {
            stickerCount[i][c - 'a']++;
        }
    }
    
    unordered_map<string, int> memo;
    memo[""] = 0;
    
    function<int(string)> helper = [&](string target) -> int {
        if (memo.count(target)) return memo[target];
        vector<int> targetCount(26, 0);
        for (char c : target) {
            targetCount[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int result = INT_MAX;
        for (auto& sticker : stickerCount) {
            if (sticker[target[0] - 'a'] == 0) continue; // Prune branches
            string newTarget;
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (targetCount[i] > 0) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < max(0, targetCount[i] - sticker[i]); j++) {
                        newTarget += (char)('a' + i);
                    }
                }
            }
            
            int tmp = helper(newTarget);
            if (tmp != -1) {
                result = min(result, 1 + tmp);
            }
        }
        
        memo[target] = (result == INT_MAX) ? -1 : result;
        return memo[target];
    };
    
    return helper(target);
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<string> stickers = {"with", "example", "science"};
    string target = "thehat";
    cout << minStickers(stickers, target) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Preprocessing Step:**
   - Compute the frequency of each character in all stickers.

2. **Memoization Dictionary:**
   - Use a dictionary to store the minimum stickers required for each possible state of the target string formation.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - Try to form the target string by applying each sticker (optimized by focusing on characters that are needed).
   - For each sticker, reduce the characters from the current target and recurse.

4. **Result Storage and Return:**
   - Store the result in the memo dictionary to avoid recomputation.
   - Return the stored result to propagate the minimum sticker count.
