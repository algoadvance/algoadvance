[Leetcode 2731. Movement of Robots](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2731)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` representing the initial positions of some robots on the number line. You are also given a 0-indexed string `s` of length `n` representing the directions in which the robots are currently moving. The `i`th robot moves towards the right if `s[i]` is 'R', and towards the left if `s[i]` is 'L'. 

The robots move simultaneously at the same speed, so by the end of each second, all the robots have moved one unit to their respective directions.

You need to determine the state of the number line after `k` seconds. Return an array where the `i`th element represents the position of the `i`th robot after `k` seconds.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7], s = "RLLR", k = 2
Output: [3, 1, 3, 9]
```

In this example:
- Initially, robots are at positions [1, 3, 5, 7].
- Robot at index 0: moves to right from 1 to 3.
- Robot at index 1: moves to left from 3 to 1.
- Robot at index 2: moves to left from 5 to 3.
- Robot at index 3: moves to right from 7 to 9.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the number line unbounded on both the left and right sides?**
   - Yes, assume it extends infinitely in both directions.

2. **Can two robots occupy the same position at the same time?**
   - Yes, they can.

3. **Can the directions and initial positions vary in any specific manner?**
   - No specific constraint. Any combination of directions and initial positions is possible.

## Strategy

Given the initial positions of the robots `nums` and their movement directions `s`, the strategy is pretty straight-forward:

1. Initialize an array `result` of the same size as `nums` to store the final positions.
2. For each robot:
   - If it moves to the right (direction is 'R'), increase its position by `k`.
   - If it moves to the left (direction is 'L'), decrease its position by `k`.
3. Return the resultant positions array.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> getRobotPositions(std::vector<int>& nums, std::string s, int k) {
    std::vector<int> result(nums.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == 'R') {
            result[i] = nums[i] + k;
        } else if (s[i] == 'L') {
            result[i] = nums[i] - k;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 5, 7};
    std::string s = "RLLR";
    int k = 2;
    
    std::vector<int> result = getRobotPositions(nums, s, k);
    
    for (int pos : result) {
        std::cout << pos << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of robots. This is because we only need to iterate through the `nums` and `s` arrays once to compute the final positions. The space complexity is also `O(n)` because we are using an additional array to store the results.
