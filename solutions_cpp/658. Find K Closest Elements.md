[Leetcode 658. Find K Closest Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l658)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, find the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. If there is a tie, the smaller elements are always preferred.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `x` be outside the range of elements in `arr`?**
   - Yes, `x` can be any integer, not necessarily within the range of elements in `arr`.

2. **What should we return if there are fewer than `k` elements in `arr`?**
   - Itâ€™s given that `k` will always be valid, i.e., `1 <= k <= arr.length`.

3. **Can there be duplicate elements in `arr`?**
   - Yes, the array may contain duplicate elements.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Closest Element**: Use binary search to locate the position in the array where `x` would fit if inserted. This helps in finding the potential starting point for the closest elements.

2. **Two pointers to find closest elements**: After finding the position, use two pointers to find the `k` closest elements:
   - Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` at this position.
   - Expand the window to the left and right to include the `k` closest elements based on the absolute difference from `x`.

3. **Sort the Result**: Since we need to return the elements in ascending order, simply sorting the resultant array of `k` elements might be necessary, but since the array is already sorted, the selected window will also be sorted correctly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdlib>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> findClosestElements(std::vector<int>& arr, int k, int x) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.size() - 1;
        while (right - left >= k) {
            if (abs(arr[left] - x) > abs(arr[right] - x)) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return std::vector<int>(arr.begin() + left, arr.begin() + right + 1);
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search for Closest Element**: Here the binary search is implicitly used to balance the left and right borders by checking the difference `|arr[left] - x|` and `|arr[right] - x|`.
2. **Window Adjustment**: The `while` loop keeps shrinking the search window until its size is exactly `k`. If the element at `left` is less close to `x` than the element at `right`, increment `left`; otherwise, decrement `right`.
3. **Extract the Result**: Finally, a subarray from `arr[left]` to `arr[right]` inclusive is returned as the result.

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search**: Although this is not explicitly a binary search over positions, the while loop mimics a binary search mechanism over window size reductions.
   - The `while` loop runs in `O(n - k)` operations, where `n` is the size of the array.
2. **Extraction of Subarray**: Copying the result array takes `O(k)`.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n - k + k) = O(n)`, but since we are performing the bulk of operations within the `while` loop it's more meaningful to consider the complexity as `O(n - k)`.
