[Leetcode 1850. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1850)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `num` representing a large integer and an integer `k`, the task is to return the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to get the k-th smallest lexicographical permutation of the string.

### Example
```
Input: num = "5489355142", k = 4
Output: 2

Explanation: The 4th smallest permutation is "5489355214". 
To achieve "5489355214", we can swap:
- 935 -> 9355
- 4 with 5 to get 5489354215
The minimum number of adjacent swaps is 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:** Is there any limit on the size of `num` or `k`?
   - Let's assume that `num` will be a string of digits and `1 <= k <= 1000`.
2. **What if `num` is already the k-th permutation?**
   - In such a case, the answer should be `0` as no swaps are necessary.

## Strategy

1. **Generate the k-th permutation:**
   - Use the next permutation algorithm to get the k-th smallest permutation. This helps us understand what the target string looks like.
   
2. **Find Minimum Adjacent Swaps:**
   - Using a two-pointer technique, determine the number of adjacent swaps required to transform the original string into the target permutation.

### Steps:
1. **Next Permutation Algorithm:**
   - Implement this function to find the k-th permutation of the initial string.

2. **Swapping to Target:**
   - Once we have the target permutation, simulate the process to count the number of adjacent swaps needed.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

// Function to implement the next permutation algorithm
void nextPermutation(std::string &num) {
    int n = num.size(), i = n - 2;
    while (i >= 0 && num[i] >= num[i + 1]) i--;
    if (i >= 0) {
        int j = n - 1;
        while (num[j] <= num[i]) j--;
        std::swap(num[i], num[j]);
    }
    std::reverse(num.begin() + i + 1, num.end());
}

int minSwapsToTransform(std::string num, const std::string &target) {
    int swaps = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < num.size(); ++i) {
        // If the current element is not in the correct place
        if (num[i] != target[i]) {
            // Find the target character in the subarray
            size_t j = i + 1;
            while (j < num.size() && num[j] != target[i]) ++j;
            
            // Bring target[i] to position i by swapping 
            // adjacent elements
            while (j > i) {
                std::swap(num[j], num[j - 1]);
                swaps++;
                j--;
            }
        }
    }
    return swaps;
}

int getMinSwaps(std::string num, int k) {
    // Find the k-th permutation
    std::string target = num;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        nextPermutation(target);
    }
    
    // Find the minimum adjacent swaps
    return minSwapsToTransform(num, target);
}

int main() {
    std::string num = "5489355142";
    int k = 4;
    std::cout << "Minimum swaps: " << getMinSwaps(num, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation:
1. **Next Permutation Algorithm:**
   - This function transforms the string to its next lexicographical permutation.
   
2. **findMinimumSwaps Function:**
   - Given two strings (`num` and `target`), this function calculates the minimum adjacent swaps needed to transform `num` into `target`.

## Time Complexity:
1. **Next Permutation Algorithm:**
   - O(n) per permutation, where `n` is the length of the string.
   
2. **Swaps Calculation:**
   - O(n^2) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the string. This happens because each swap operation takes O(n) and could be performed up to `n` times in the worst case.

Overall, the approach is efficient for moderate input sizes, working well within the given constraints.
