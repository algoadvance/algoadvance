[Leetcode 1786. Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1786)
### Problem Statement

#### 1786. Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node

Given an undirected weighted connected graph with `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between `ui` and `vi`. A path is considered restricted if the distance from the last node `n` to a node `vi` is less than the distance from the last node `n` to a node `ui`.

Return the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum value of `n`?  
   The value of `n` can be up to `2 * 10^4`.

2. Are there parallel edges or self-loops?  
   Assume no parallel edges or self-loops.

3. What are the constraints on edge weights?  
   The edge weights are positive integers.

4. Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?  
   Yes, the graph is connected.

### Strategy

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (for Shortest Distance Calculation)**:
   - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance from node `n` to all other nodes. This will help determine if a path is restricted.

2. **Dynamic Programming (for Counting Restricted Paths)**:
   - Use dynamic programming with memoization to count the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`.

3. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency list.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Keep track of the results modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

#### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

    int countPaths(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Graph representation using adjacency list
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n + 1);
        
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
            graph[u].emplace_back(v, w);
            graph[v].emplace_back(u, w);
        }
        
        // Distance array initialized to a large number (infinity)
        vector<long long> distance(n + 1, LLONG_MAX);
        distance[n] = 0;

        // Min-heap for Dijkstra's algorithm
        priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, greater<>> minHeap;
        minHeap.push({0, n});
        
        // Compute the shortest distances from node n to all other nodes
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            auto [dist, node] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            if (dist > distance[node]) continue;
            
            for (const auto& [adj, weight] : graph[node]) {
                if (distance[adj] > dist + weight) {
                    distance[adj] = dist + weight;
                    minHeap.push({distance[adj], adj});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Memoization array to store the number of restricted paths from each node
        vector<int> memo(n + 1, -1);
        
        // Function to count restricted paths using DFS and memoization
        function<int(int)> countRestrictedPaths = [&](int node) -> int {
            if (node == n) return 1;
            if (memo[node] != -1) return memo[node];
            
            long long totalPaths = 0;
            
            for (const auto& [adj, weight] : graph[node]) {
                if (distance[adj] < distance[node]) {
                    totalPaths = (totalPaths + countRestrictedPaths(adj)) % MOD;
                }
            }
            
            memo[node] = totalPaths;
            return totalPaths;
        };
        
        return countRestrictedPaths(1);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction**: \( O(E) \)
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: \( O((N + E) \log N) \)
3. **DFS with Memoization**: \( O(V + E) \)

The overall complexity is dominated by Dijkstra's algorithm, \( O((N + E) \log N) \), making it efficient given the constraints.
