[Leetcode 2454. Next Greater Element IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2454)
### Problem Statement

We are given an integer array `nums`. The problem is to find the next greater element for each element in `nums` in terms of array indices. Specifically, we need to find the smallest index `j` such that `j > i` and `nums[j] > nums[i]`. If no such `j` exists for `i`, return -1 for that `i`. The output should be an array where `output[i]` is the next greater element for `nums[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the size limitations for the array `nums`?
   - Are there any specific constraints on the elements within `nums` (e.g., range of values)?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output be an array where the ith element is the next greater element for `nums[i]`?
   
### Provided Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack to keep track of indices of the elements for which we are looking for the next greater element. We'll iterate through the array `nums` from right to left and maintain a stack. By doing so, we can achieve an efficient solution in linear time.

Here is a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize**:
   - An empty stack to keep track of indices of `nums` where the next greater element hasn't been found yet.
   - An output array `result` initialized with -1.

2. **Processing**:
   - Traverse the input array from right to left.
   - For each element, pop elements from the stack until the current element is less than the element at the index stored on top of the stack (that means we have found the next greater element).
   - The top of the stack will be greater than the current element, so update the result for the current index.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.

3. **Output**:
   - The `result` array contains the next greater elements for each index in the original array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::vector<int> nextGreaterElements(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n, -1);
    std::stack<int> s;  // Stack to store indices for which next greater element is not found
    
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        // Maintain stack such that it always contains indices of elements larger than nums[i]
        while (!s.empty() && nums[s.top()] <= nums[i]) {
            s.pop();
        }
        
        // If stack is not empty, the top element is the next greater element for nums[i]
        if (!s.empty()) {
            result[i] = nums[s.top()];
        }
        
        // Push current index onto the stack
        s.push(i);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Strategy

- **Step 1**: Iterate through `nums` from right to left.
- **Step 2**: Use a stack to track indices of potential next greater elements.
- **Step 3**: For each element, check the stack and update the result array if a larger element is found.
- **Step 4**: Push the current index onto the stack for future comparisons.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each index is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the stack used to store the indices. The output array itself also takes \(O(n)\) space.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently find the next greater elements using a single pass through the array, making it optimal for large input sizes.
