[Leetcode 1814. Count Nice Pairs in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1814)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is considered "nice" if:

1. `0 <= i < j < nums.length`
2. `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`

Where `rev(x)` is the reverse of integer `x`.

Your task is to return the number of "nice" pairs in the array `nums`. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array length?**
   - The array length `nums.length` will be between `1` and `10^5`.

2. **What are the ranges of the numbers in the array?**
   - Each integer in `nums` is a non-negative integer that can be up to `10^9`.

3. **Is there any specific condition for the reverse function?**
   - The `rev` function is a straightforward reverse of the digits of the number. For example, `rev(123)` is `321`, and `rev(100)` is `1`.

4. **What kind of result is expected?**
   - The number of nice pairs modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   - For a pair `(i, j)` to be nice, the condition `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])` should be true. It can be rephrased as:
     ```
     nums[i] - rev(nums[i]) == nums[j] - rev(nums[j])
     ```
   - We can define a new value `diff[i] = nums[i] - rev(nums[i])` and count pairs with the same `diff` value.

2. **Counting Pairs Efficiently:**
   - Using a hash map, we count occurrences of each `diff` value.
   - For each new element, if it matches previous `diff` values, it forms pairs with all previous elements having the same `diff`.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - As we count the pairs, we take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int num) {
        int rev = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            rev = rev * 10 + num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return rev;
    }

    int countNicePairs(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        std::unordered_map<int, long> countMap;
        long nicePairs = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int diff = num - reverse(num);

            if (countMap.find(diff) != countMap.end()) {
                nicePairs = (nicePairs + countMap[diff]) % MOD;
            }

            // Increment the count of this unique difference.
            countMap[diff]++;
        }

        return nicePairs;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Reverse Function:** Each call takes `O(log(num))` time where `num` is at most `10^9`. Since each number has at most 10 digits, reversing a number is `O(1)` in practical terms.
- **Main Function:** We iterate through the array of length `N`. For each element, we calculate the reverse and update the hash map in `O(1)` expected time.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(N)`

This solution is efficient and ensures we handle the constraints within acceptable limits.
