[Leetcode 2421. Number of Good Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2421)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges. Each node is uniquely numbered from `0` to `n-1` and associated with a `nodeValue[i]`. A path from node `u` to node `v` is called a "good path" if there is no node ``w`` (other than `u` and `v`) on the path such that `nodeValue[w]` is greater than `nodeValue[u]` and `nodeValue[v]`.

Given an array `nodeValue` determining the value of each node, find the total number of good paths. 

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nodeValue[i] <= 10^4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What are the constraints on the node values and the size of the tree?
   - Answer: Each node has a value from `0` to `10^4` and the number of nodes can be up to `10^5`. 

2. **Graph assumption**: Can we assume the tree is always valid, i.e., connected and has `n-1` edges for `n` nodes?
   - Answer: Yes, we assume the given tree is valid as per the problem statement.

3. **Output format**: What is the required output?
   - Answer: The total number of good paths.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a combination of Union-Find data structure and sorting:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - We'll use the Union-Find structure to help manage the connectivity of nodes efficiently as we process the nodes by increasing values.

2. **Sorting Nodes**:
   - Sort the nodes based on their values. This allows us to ensure that when processing a node, all previous nodes have been considered such that their values do not exceed the current node's value.

3. **Connectivity and Paths**:
   - As we process each node, we find its neighbors and, if the neighbor's value is the same (to ensure the condition of "good path"), we union these nodes.

4. **Count Good Paths**:
   - For each set in the Union-Find, compute the number of pairs using combinatorial calculus, which will directly relate to the good paths.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// Union-Find structure
struct UnionFind {
    vector<int> parent, rank;
    
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
        rank.resize(n, 1);
    }
    
    // Find with Path Compression
    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    // Union by Rank
    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};

int numOfGoodPaths(vector<int>& values, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    int n = values.size();
    
    // Adjacency list for the graph
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    // Nodes sorted by value
    vector<int> sortedNodes(n);
    iota(sortedNodes.begin(), sortedNodes.end(), 0);
    sort(sortedNodes.begin(), sortedNodes.end(), [&](int a, int b) {
        return values[a] < values[b];
    });
    
    UnionFind uf(n);
    int result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int node = sortedNodes[i];
        unordered_map<int, int> countMap; // to count nodes in the same component with the same value
        
        // Process neighbors
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (values[neighbor] <= values[node]) {
                uf.unite(node, neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate the number of good paths ending at this node
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (values[neighbor] <= values[node]) {
                int root = uf.find(neighbor);
                countMap[root]++;
            }
        }
        
        for (const auto& [root, count] : countMap) {
            result += (count + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find operations**: Each union/find operation is nearly constant time, O(α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Sorting**: Sorting the nodes takes O(n log n).
- **Neighbor processing**: The adjacency list traversal for each node runs in O(n).

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to sorting as the dominant component.
