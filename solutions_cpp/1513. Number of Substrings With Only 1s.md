[Leetcode 1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1513)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of '0' and '1'). Return the number of substrings with all characters '1's. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Example:
1. Input: s = "0110111"
   Output: 9
   
2. Input: s = "101"
   Output: 2

3. Input: s = "111111"
   Output: 21

### Clarifications:
1. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   The length of the string can go up to 10^5.
   
2. **What should we return if there are no '1's in the string?**
   Return 0 in such a case, as there are no substrings with all '1's.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the segments of consecutive '1's.** For example, in the string "0110111", the segments are '11', '1', and '111'.
2. **Count the length of each segment.** For a segment of length `n`, the number of substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers \( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
3. **Keep track of the counts and add them up.** Use a running sum to account for each segment count.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numSub(string s) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        long long result = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '1') {
                count++;
                result = (result + count) % MOD;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string input;
    cout << "Enter the binary string: ";
    cin >> input;
    cout << "Number of substrings with all 1s: " << sol.numSub(input) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Loop through the string `s`:** We go through each character of the string.
- **Count consecutive '1's:** If we encounter a '1', we increase our current counting variable by 1. If we encounter a '0', we reset our counting variable.
- **Update result:** Whenever we encounter '1', our current counting variable contributes to the result. This contribution is the sum of the counts of all substrings ending at that '1'.
- **Modulo operation:** We continuously take modulo operation to ensure the result does not overflow.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

This approach is efficient and directly counts the substrings without needing to generate them explicitly.
