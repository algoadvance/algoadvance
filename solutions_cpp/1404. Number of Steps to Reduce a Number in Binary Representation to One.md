[Leetcode 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1404)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` representing a number, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:
1. If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the current number is odd, add 1 to it.

The binary string will not have leading zeros.

Example:
```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" => "1110" => "1111" => "10000" => "1000" => "100" => "10" => "1"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Limits**:
   - How large can the binary string be? (This helps understand if there are any performance constraints.)
   
2. **Format of the Input**:
   - Is the input guaranteed to be a valid binary string without leading zeros?

For this solution, we will assume that the input is a valid binary string and can be large.

## Strategy

Our approach will be to simulate the process of transforming the binary string according to the given rules until it reaches "1". Here's the strategy in more detail:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Convert the binary string to an integer for easier manipulation.

2. **Simulation**:
   - Use a loop to perform the operations until the binary string is reduced to "1".
   - If the number is even, perform a right shift (which is equivalent to dividing by 2).
   - If the number is odd, increment the number to handle the addition of 1.
   - Keep track of the number of operations performed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure the function handles the minimum input of a binary string representing "1" correctly, returning 0 steps.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int numSteps(std::string s) {
    int steps = 0;
    int carry = 0;
    int n = s.length();
    
    // Starting from the least significant bit and move towards the most significant bit
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
        if (s[i] - '0' + carry == 1) {
            // If current bit (plus carry) is 1, we have to add 1 and make it carry 1
            carry = 1;
            steps += 2; // since we add 1 and then divide by 2
        } else {
            // If current bit (plus carry) is 0 or 2, we just divide by 2
            steps += 1; // just divide by 2
        }
    }
    
    // Handle the last carry if the most significant bit needed an addition
    // Since the loop does not process the most significant bit's effect comprehensively
    return steps + carry;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The function processes each bit of the binary string exactly once.
- Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the binary string.

This should be efficient enough given the constraints typically expected for such problems. If further optimizations are needed or additional considerations (such as very large inputs) are present, they should be reviewed to ensure the solution remains performant.
