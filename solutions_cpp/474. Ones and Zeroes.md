[Leetcode 474. Ones and Zeroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l474)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are at most `m` `0`s and `n` `1`s in the subset.

Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}, so the answer is 4.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The largest subset is {"0", "1"}, so the answer is 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Empty Input Handling:** How should the function behave if the input list `strs` is empty or if `m` and `n` are zero?
2. **Edge Case Verification:** Are the values for `m` and `n` guaranteed to be non-negative?

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using a dynamic programming (DP) solution, where we maintain a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]`. Here, `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of strings that we can pick with at most `i` `0`s and `j` `1`s.

#### Steps:

1. **Initial State:**
   - Initialize a `dp` table with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` to 0.

2. **DP Table Update:**
   - For each string in `strs`, count the number of `0`s and `1`s.
   - Update the DP table from bottom-right to top-left, ensuring the current string's zeros and ones contribute to the subset count accordingly.

3. **Result Extraction:**
   - The result will be stored in `dp[m][n]`.

#### Time Complexity

- Let `k` be the number of strings in `strs`.
- Each string is processed to count `0`s and `1`s in O(len) where `len` is the length of the string.
- For each string, we update a DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(k * len + k * m * n), which simplifies to O(k * len + k * m * n).

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

        for (const string &s : strs) {
            int zeros = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0');
            int ones = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '1');

            for (int i = m; i >= zeros; --i) {
                for (int j = n; j >= ones; --j) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeros][j - ones] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of strings we can pick with at most `i` zeros and `j` ones.

2. **Processing Each String:**
   - For each string in the list, count its zeros (`zeros`) and ones (`ones`).
   - Update the DP table from the bottom-right to the top-left to prevent overwriting the values needed for current computation.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The maximum subset size is stored in `dp[m][n]`. This is the answer to the problem.

By following this approach, we efficiently determine the largest subset of strings that meet the given constraints.
