[Leetcode 2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2415)
## Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a **perfect** binary tree. Reverse the node values at each **odd** level of the tree.

- For example, reversing the node values at the first odd level would result in the tree converting from:

```
        2
      /   \
     3     5
    / \   / \
   8   13 21  34
```

  to:

```
        2
      /   \
     5     3
    / \   / \
   8   13 21  34
```

- Further, reversing the node values at the third (next odd) level would change the tree from:

```
        2
      /   \
     5     3
    / \   / \
   8   13 21  34
```

  to:

```
        2
      /   \
     5     3
    / \   / \
   34  21 13  8
```

The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

**Note**: A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two children and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output**:
    - **Input**: The `root` of a perfect binary tree.
    - **Output**: The modified tree with reversed node values at odd levels.

2. **Tree Depth**: Is there any limit on the depth of the tree? 
    - The problem assumes a perfect binary tree which can technically grow indefinitely based on memory constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Level Order Traversal**:
    - Use a queue for level order traversal of the tree.
    - Track the current level.
    - Store node values for odd levels and reverse them on the fly.

2. **Reversing Node Values**:
    - Once we identify an odd level, collect node values and reverse them.
    - Update the node values with the reversed list.

## Code

Here's a C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* reverseOddLevels(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int level = 0;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            vector<TreeNode*> nodesAtCurrentLevel; // to store nodes at current level
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                if (level % 2 == 1) {
                    nodesAtCurrentLevel.push_back(node);
                }
                
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
            
            if (level % 2 == 1) {
                int n = nodesAtCurrentLevel.size();
                for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
                    swap(nodesAtCurrentLevel[i]->val, nodesAtCurrentLevel[n - 1 - i]->val);
                }
            }
            
            ++level;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Helper function for printing the tree in level order
void printTreeLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        TreeNode* node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (node) {
            cout << node->val << " ";
            q.push(node->left);
            q.push(node->right);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(8);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(13);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(21);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(34);

    Solution sol;
    root = sol.reverseOddLevels(root);

    printTreeLevelOrder(root); // Output should be: 2 5 3 8 13 21 34

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the level order traversal.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, due to the storage needed for the queue and the list used to store nodes at odd levels.
