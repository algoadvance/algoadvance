[Leetcode 1573. Number of Ways to Split a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1573)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` (a string containing only '0's and '1's). You need to find the number of ways to split the string into three non-empty parts such that each part contains the same number of '1's. 

Return the number of ways to split the string. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string `s`?**
   - Can it be very large, up to tens of thousands of characters?
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the string other than being binary (consisting of '0's and '1's)?**
   - Can we assume there are no other characters and the input is always valid?

3. **What should be returned if it's not possible to split the string as required?**
   - Should we return `0` in such cases?

### Strategy

1. **Count the Total Number of '1's:**
   - If the total number of '1's is not divisible by 3, return 0 immediately, as itâ€™s impossible to split the string as required.

2. **Divide the Task:**
   - If the total number of '1's is divisible by 3, each part should contain `totalOnes / 3` '1's.

3. **Identify Split Points:**
   - Traverse the string to find positions where the exact `k` '1's (where `k` is `totalOnes / 3`) can end for each part.
   - Use these positions to count valid starting points for the second and third parts.

4. **Calculate Possible Ways:**
   - Calculate how many valid ways we can choose the transition between first and second part, and between second and third part.
   - The total number of ways will be the product of these counts.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - As required, return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(string s) {
        const long MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = s.length();
        int totalOnes = 0;

        // Count total '1's in the string
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '1') totalOnes++;
        }

        // If totalOnes is not divisible by 3, return 0
        if (totalOnes % 3 != 0) return 0;
        if (totalOnes == 0) {
            // Special case: all zeroes. Choose 2 split points out of (n-1) gaps.
            return ((n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2) % MOD;
        }

        // Each part must contain exactly 'onesPerPart' 1's.
        int onesPerPart = totalOnes / 3;
        int firstEnd = 0, secondStart = 0, secondEnd = 0, thirdStart = 0;

        // Locate positions to decide splits
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '1') count++;
            if (count == onesPerPart) firstEnd++;
            else if (count == onesPerPart + 1) secondStart = i;
            else if (count == 2 * onesPerPart) secondEnd++;
            else if (count == 2 * onesPerPart + 1) thirdStart = i;
        }

        // Find possible ways to split at firstEnd and secondEnd ranges
        long waysToSplitFirst = (firstEnd - firstEnd + 1);
        long waysToSplitSecond = (secondEnd - secondStart + 1);

        return (waysToSplitFirst * waysToSplitSecond) % MOD;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.
  - We traverse the string multiple times but each traversal is linear.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), constant space is used apart from the input string itself.

This solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints, ensuring that even very large strings can be handled within acceptable time limits.
