[Leetcode 1825. Finding MK Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1825)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers, `m` and `k`, and a stream of integers. You need to implement a data structure that efficiently supports the following operations:

1. `addElement(int num)`: Inserts a new element `num` into the data structure.
2. `calculateMKAverage()`: Returns the MK average for the last `m` elements added to the data structure. The MK average is calculated as follows:
    - Remove the smallest `k` elements.
    - Remove the largest `k` elements.
    - Calculate the average of the remaining elements.

If there are fewer than `m` elements in the data structure, `calculateMKAverage()` should return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there an upper limit to the number of elements that will be inserted into the data structure or should it be prepared to handle up to the maximum possible integer size?
2. **Order of Elements**: Should the elements be assumed to be coming in a non-decreasing or non-increasing order, or can they be in random order?
3. **Range of `m` and `k`**: What are the constraints on `m` and `k`? Specifically, are they relatively small compared to the number of elements being inserted?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to maintain a list of the most recent `m` elements and be able to efficiently calculate the MK average. Here's the proposed strategy in detail:

1. **Data Storage**: Use a deque (double-ended queue) to store the most recent `m` elements as they allow efficient addition and removal of elements from both ends.
2. **Sorted Structure**: Use a multiset to maintain a sorted list of the current `m` elements. This allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and finding the k-th smallest or largest elements.
3. **Maintenance**: When a new element is added:
    - Insert the element into the deque and multiset.
    - If the size exceeds `m`, remove the oldest element from both the deque and the multiset.
4. **Calculation of MK Average**:
    - If the size of the multiset is less than `m`, return `-1`.
    - Remove the smallest `k` and largest `k` elements from the multiset.
    - Calculate and return the average of the remaining elements.

### Time Complexity

- `addElement()`: O(log m) for maintaining the sorted multiset and O(1) for the deque operations.
- `calculateMKAverage()`: O(m) for iterating through the multiset to remove `k` smallest and largest elements and then calculating the average.

### Code

```cpp
#include <deque>
#include <set>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

class MKAverage {
private:
    int m, k;
    std::deque<int> dq;
    std::multiset<int> ms;
    
public:
    MKAverage(int m, int k) : m(m), k(k) {}

    void addElement(int num) {
        if (dq.size() == m) {
            int oldest = dq.front();
            dq.pop_front();
            ms.erase(ms.find(oldest));
        }
        dq.push_back(num);
        ms.insert(num);
    }

    int calculateMKAverage() {
        if (dq.size() < m) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Create iterators to exclude smallest `k` and largest `k` elements.
        auto it_low = ms.begin();
        auto it_high = ms.end();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            ++it_low;
            --it_high;
        }
        
        int sum = std::accumulate(it_low, it_high, 0);
        int count = m - 2 * k;
        
        return sum / count;
    }
};
```

This C++ class `MKAverage` provides an efficient way to manage and calculate the MK average according to the problem specifications. It leverages the properties of multimset for maintaining sorted order and deque for efficient access to an ordered sequence of elements.
