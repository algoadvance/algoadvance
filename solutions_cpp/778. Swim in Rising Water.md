[Leetcode 778. Swim in Rising Water](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l778)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually is at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

You start at the top left square `(0, 0)`. Return the least time `t` such that you can reach the bottom right square `(n-1, n-1)`.

### Example
```cpp
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directional neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.

You need to wait until time 3 to be able to walk to the bottom.
```

### Constraints
- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n^2`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Movement:**
   - Is movement restricted to up, down, left, and right only? 
     - Yes, only 4-directional movement is allowed.
2. **Elevation and time:**
   - Should we assume time t increases in stages, and we check t at each stage until we can reach the end?
     - Yes, you should assume water levels (time `t`) increase incrementally.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search over time with a priority queue (min-heap) to perform an eager search for reachable places:

1. **Binary Search on Time**:
   - Define the range of time from `min(grid[0][0], grid[n-1][n-1])` to `max(grid[0][0], grid[n-1][n-1])`.
   - Use binary search to find the minimum time such that a path exists from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

2. **Flood Fill (DFS / BFS) for Path Checking**:
   - For each mid-point in the binary search, perform a flood fill starting from the top-left to check if the bottom-right is reachable with the current `t`.
   - Use a visited array to avoid cycles and redundant checks.

## Code (Using BFS and Binary Search)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int swimInWater(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        // Lambda function to check if we can swim to the last cell with time `T`
        auto can_swim = [&](int T) {
            if (grid[0][0] > T) return false;
            
            vector<vector<bool>> visited(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
            queue<pair<int, int>> q;
            q.emplace(0, 0);
            visited[0][0] = true;
            
            // Directions arrays for moving up, down, left, and right
            vector<int> dirs = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};
            
            while (!q.empty()) {
                auto [x, y] = q.front(); q.pop();
                
                // If we've reached the bottom-right corner
                if (x == n-1 && y == n-1) return true;
                
                // Explore the 4-directional neighbors
                for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
                    int nx = x + dirs[k], ny = y + dirs[k + 1];
                    if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] <= T) {
                        q.emplace(nx, ny);
                        visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            return false;
        };
        
        // Binary search for the minimum possible T
        int left = grid[0][0], right = n * n - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (can_swim(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Time Complexity**: \(O(\log(\text{max cell value}))\).
- **Path Checking Complexity (BFS)**: \(O(n^2)\).
- **Total Complexity**: \(O(n^2 \log(n^2))\).

Given \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), this solution is efficient and practical for given constraints.
