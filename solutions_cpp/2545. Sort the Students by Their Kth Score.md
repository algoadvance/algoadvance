[Leetcode 2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2545)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `score` where `score[i]` represents the scores of the i-th student in various subjects. You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to sort the students based on their k-th score (where scores are 0-indexed) in descending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints for the number of students and scores?
2. **Uniqueness of Scores**: Should we consider that k-th scores can be the same for multiple students?
3. **Expected Output**: Should the sorted 2D array retain the same structure as the input but ordered based on k-th scores?

Assumption based on common problem constraints:
- `score` array dimensions: `n x m` where `n` is the number of students, and `m` is the number of subjects.
- Each student's scores are represented in a list of integers.
- `k` is a valid index, meaning `0 <= k < m`.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: Use a custom comparator to sort the students based on their k-th score in descending order.
2. **Custom Comparator**: Utilize a lambda function to access the k-th element for comparison during the sort.

### Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> sortTheStudents(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& score, int k) {
    // Custom comparator to sort by k-th score in descending order
    auto comparator = [k](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
        return a[k] > b[k];
    };
    
    // Sort the score array using the custom comparator
    std::sort(score.begin(), score.end(), comparator);
    
    return score;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> scores = {
        {90, 80, 70},
        {85, 95, 90},
        {78, 88, 85}
    };
    int k = 1; // Sort by the scores in the second column (index 1)
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> sortedScores = sortTheStudents(scores, k);
    
    // Output sorted scores
    for (const auto& student : sortedScores) {
        for (int score : student) {
            std::cout << score << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The time complexity of the `sort` function is O(n log n), where `n` is the number of students.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) if we ignore the space required for the input data.

This ensures that the students are sorted in an efficient manner based on their k-th score.
