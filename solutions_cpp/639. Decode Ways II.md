[Leetcode 639. Decode Ways II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l639)
Sure, let's break down the problem statement and come up with a strategy to solve it along with the corresponding time complexity.

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that consists of digits and the characters `'*'`. Each `'*'` could be decoded as any digit from '1' to '9'. You need to return the total number of ways to decode the string, considering the following rules:

- Each digit from `1-9` can be decoded to a letter ('A' to 'I').
- Each `'*'` can represent any digit from `1-9`.
- Two consecutive digits can form a valid letter from `10` to `26` if interpreted as a two-digit number.
- `'*'` in any valid two-digit number can represent any digit from `1` to `9`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Typically, these types of problems will have a moderate length constraint. Let's assume up to 10^5 characters.
2. **Characters in the String**: Can the string `s` contain invalid characters?
   - For this problem, let's assume `s` only contains digits and the character `'*'`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp[0]` is `1` because there's only one way to decode an empty string.

3. **Iterative Transition**:
   - For each character `s[i]`, if it's a digit (`1` to `9`), it can be decoded individually.
   - For each character `s[i] == '*'`, it can be decoded as any digit from '1' to '9'.
   - For pairs of characters `s[i-1:i]`, check if they form a valid letter. Special care is needed if any character is a `'*'`.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation will be taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

Here’s an implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int numDecodings(const string& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;  // By definition, there's one way to decode an empty string.

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (s[i-1] == '*') {
            dp[i] = (9 * dp[i-1]) % MOD;  // '*' can represent any digit '1' to '9'
        } else if (s[i-1] != '0') {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] % MOD;  // any single digit '1' to '9'
        }

        if (i > 1) {
            if (s[i-2] == '*') {
                if (s[i-1] == '*') {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + 15 * dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "1*" to "9*", "10" to "26"
                } else if (s[i-1] <= '6') {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + 2 * dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "1X" and "2X" or "10"-"26"
                } else {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "1X" ("10", "11", … "19")
                }
            } else if (s[i-2] == '1') {
                if (s[i-1] == '*') {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + 9 * dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "1*"
                } else {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "1X" where X is a digit
                }
            } else if (s[i-2] == '2') {
                if (s[i-1] == '*') {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + 6 * dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "2*" can represent "20"-"26"
                } else if (s[i-1] <= '6') {
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i-2]) % MOD;  // "2X" where X is a digit <= 6
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of string `s`. We iterate through the string once and perform constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) because we are using a `dp` array to store the results.

This approach should handle the problem constraints efficiently and provides correct results considering the various possible interpretations of `'*'`.
