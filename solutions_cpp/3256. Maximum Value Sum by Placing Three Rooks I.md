[Leetcode 3256. Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3256)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns. Each cell in the matrix contains an integer which represents the value of that cell. Your task is to place three rooks on three different cells such that none of them share the same row or column, and to maximize the sum of the values in these three cells.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of n and m**: Can the matrix dimensions be very large?
2. **Value Range**: What are the possible values in the matrix cells (positive, negative, zero)?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should we handle cases where n or m are less than 3?

## Code

Here's a C++ implementation to solve the given problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxRookSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    int m = matrix[0].size();

    if (n < 3 || m < 3) {
        // If rows or columns are less than 3, it's not possible to place 3 rooks
        return 0;
    }

    int maxSum = INT_MIN;

    // Consider combinations of rows
    for (int row1 = 0; row1 < n - 2; ++row1) {
        for (int row2 = row1 + 1; row2 < n - 1; ++row2) {
            for (int row3 = row2 + 1; row3 < n; ++row3) {
                // For each combination of rows, consider combinations of columns
                for (int col1 = 0; col1 < m - 2; ++col1) {
                    for (int col2 = col1 + 1; col2 < m - 1; ++col2) {
                        for (int col3 = col2 + 1; col3 < m; ++col3) {
                            int currentSum = matrix[row1][col1] + matrix[row2][col2] + matrix[row3][col3];
                            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {1, 2, 3, 4},
        {5, 6, 7, 8},
        {9, 10, 11, 12},
        {13, 14, 15, 16}
    };

    cout << "Maximum Rook Sum: " << maxRookSum(matrix) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Check Dimensions**: If `n < 3` or `m < 3`, it's not possible to place 3 rooks. Return 0 in that case.
2. **Brute Force Selection**: Use nested loops to generate all possible ways to choose 3 different rows and 3 different columns.
3. **Calculate Sum**: For each combination of rows and columns, calculate the sum of the selected cells.
4. **Optimize the Sum**: Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

This solution works well for small matrices but might not be efficient for very large matrices due to its brute-force nature.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- Choosing 3 rows from `n` rows: `C(n, 3)` = \(\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\)
- Choosing 3 columns from `m` columns: `C(m, 3)` = \(\frac{m(m-1)(m-2)}{6}\)
- For each combination of rows and columns, we perform a constant-time operation to calculate the sum.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n^3 \cdot m^3)\).

This worst-case complexity can be quite high for large values of `n` and `m`. Optimized approaches might be necessary for larger inputs.
