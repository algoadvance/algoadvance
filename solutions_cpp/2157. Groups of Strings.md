[Leetcode 2157. Groups of Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2157)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only. We need to identify the groups of strings where a group is defined based on specific criteria: for each string in the group, we can convert it to any other string in the group by adding or removing one character at a time (the order in which characters can be added/removed follows these rules).

We need to determine two things:
1. The number of unique groups.
2. The size of the largest group.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Transformation rule**: Can we add/remove characters at any position, or only from the beginning/end?
   - **Answer**: The character can be added or removed at any position.

2. **Input constraints**:
   - The length of each string and the number of strings should be within reasonable limits given the problem complexity.

3. **Character set**: Only lowercase English alphabets (a-z)?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can model it using graph theory:
1. Each string is a node.
2. There's an edge between two nodes if one string can be transformed to another by adding or removing exactly one character.

To implement this in code:
1. Create a graph where each string is a node.
2. Use a modified Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to group strings.
3. Traverse each string and see how it transforms with the addition or removal of one character, and union these.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> groupStrings(std::vector<std::string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        std::unordered_map<int, int> parent;
        std::unordered_map<int, int> size;

        auto find = [&](int x) -> int {
            if (parent.find(x) == parent.end()) {
                parent[x] = x;
                size[x] = 1;
            }
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        };

        auto unionSets = [&](int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
                size[rootY] += size[rootX];
            }
        };

        std::unordered_map<std::string, int> id_map;
        int id = 0;

        for (const std::string& word : words) {
            if (id_map.find(word) == id_map.end()) {
                id_map[word] = id++;
            }
            int word_id = id_map[word];

            for (int i = 0; i <= word.length(); ++i) {
                for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ++ch) {
                    std::string temp = word;
                    if (i < word.length()) {
                        temp.insert(temp.begin() + i, ch);
                    }
                    if (id_map.find(temp) != id_map.end()) {
                        unionSets(word_id, id_map[temp]);
                    }

                    if (i < word.length()) {
                        temp.erase(temp.begin() + i);
                        if (id_map.find(temp) != id_map.end()) {
                            unionSets(word_id, id_map[temp]);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int num_of_groups = 0;
        int max_group_size = 0;
        std::unordered_set<int> unique_groups;
        
        for (const auto& entry : id_map) {
            int root = find(entry.second);
            if (unique_groups.find(root) == unique_groups.end()) {
                unique_groups.insert(root);
                num_of_groups++;
                max_group_size = std::max(max_group_size, size[root]);
            }
        }

        return {num_of_groups, max_group_size};
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Finding and union operations are almost constant time, i.e., O(α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function.
- For each word, generating all possible transformations (insertions and deletions) takes constant time.
- The overall complexity due to the need to find and union transformations across all words is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the maximum length of the word.

This solution efficiently identifies the groups and their sizes by simulating the union-find structure to connect strings based on the transformation rules.
