[Leetcode 466. Count The Repetitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l466)
## Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` and two integers `n1` and `n2`. You need to find the maximum integer `m` such that `s2^m` can be obtained from `s1^n1` under the following circumstances:

- `s1^n1` denotes string `s1` repeated `n1` times.
- `s2^m` denotes string `s2` repeated `n2` times.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The lengths of `s1` and `s2` are between 1 and 100.
   - `n1` and `n2` are between 1 and 10^6.

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be an integer representing the maximum number of times `s2` can be obtained from `s1` repeated `n1` times.

## Strategy
1. **Brute-force Method:**
   - Repeatedly expand `s1` and `s2` strings until we can directly compare portions. This, however, would be inefficient for the given constraints.

2. **Efficient Approach:**
   - Use a looping approach with a state caching mechanism to handle repetitive occurrences efficiently.

### Steps
1. Initialize counters for tracking positions in both `s1` and `s2`.
2. Track the number of completions of `s2` during the scanning of `s1`.
3. Use a hashmap to detect cycles and loop patterns.
4. Return the maximum number achieved.

By using a hashmap to track cycles, we can jump over repetitive patterns efficiently.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int getMaxRepetitions(string s1, int n1, string s2, int n2) {
    if (n1 == 0) return 0;

    int len1 = s1.length(), len2 = s2.length();
    unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> repeatCount; // {index in s2: {repeat count of s1, count of s2}}

    int s1Count = 0, s2Count = 0, index = 0;

    while (s1Count < n1) {
        s1Count++;
        for (char c : s1) {
            if (c == s2[index]) {
                if (index == len2 - 1) {
                    index = 0;
                    s2Count++;
                } else {
                    index++;
                }
            }
        }

        if (repeatCount.count(index)) {
            auto& [prevS1Count, prevS2Count] = repeatCount[index];
            int cycleCount = (n1 - s1Count) / (s1Count - prevS1Count);
            s1Count += cycleCount * (s1Count - prevS1Count);
            s2Count += cycleCount * (s2Count - prevS2Count);
        }

        repeatCount[index] = {s1Count, s2Count};
    }

    return s2Count / n2;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    string s1 = "acb";
    int n1 = 4;
    string s2 = "ab";
    int n2 = 2;
    
    cout << getMaxRepetitions(s1, n1, s2, n2) << endl;  // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The approach involves a looping mechanism through `s1` and `s2`.
- Since we cache states and detect cycles efficiently, the overall time complexity is approximately **O(n1 * len1 + n1 * len2)**, but due to the hashmap usage for repeated states, it optimizes further on average.

This solution ensures criteria are met efficiently within the problem's constraints.
