[Leetcode 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1753)
### Problem Statement

You are given three piles of stones of sizes `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. Each turn, you can remove one stone from two different piles, and your goal is to maximize the total number of stones removed. Return the maximum number of stones you can remove.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of a, b, c:** What is the range of the values for `a`, `b`, and `c`?
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers and they do not exceed \( 10^5 \).

2. **Can all piles be empty at the same time?**
   - No, because we can only remove stones from two different piles at each turn.

3. **What if any pile has zero stones?**
   - The problem constraints ensure that you can only perform an operation if there are stones in at least two of the piles.

### Strategy

To maximize the number of steps (stones removed):

1. **Always remove from the two largest piles:** By consistently removing stones from the largest piles, we maximize the diminishing resource efficiently.

2. **Handling when two largest piles are more than the sum of the third:** When the sum of stones in the two largest piles is more than the sum of the stones in the third pile, the maximum number of stones we can remove will depend on redistributing the stones effectively.

3. **Mathematical Insight:** If `a <= b <= c` (after sorting), the total number of moves possible is min((a + b + c) / 2, a + b), because:
    - You can perform (a + b) moves.
    - The moves are limited by half the total stones, because in each move, two stones are removed.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Sort a, b, c such that a <= b <= c
        if (a > b) swap(a, b);
        if (b > c) swap(b, c);
        if (a > b) swap(a, b);
        
        // If c is greater than a + b, we can't make more than (a + b) moves
        if (c >= a + b) {
            return a + b;
        }
        // Otherwise, use (a + b + c) / 2 as maximum moves
        return (a + b + c) / 2;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int a = 2, b = 4, c = 6;
    cout << "Maximum score: " << solution.maximumScore(a, b, c) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(1) \). The operations performed, such as sorting a small fixed number of elements (3 in this case) and basic arithmetic operations, are thus constant.
