[Leetcode 707. Design Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l707)
### Problem Statement

Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a single linked list or a double linked list. A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: an integer value and a next node pointing to the next node in the list or `null` if it is the tail of the list. Implement the `MyLinkedList` class:

- `MyLinkedList()` Initializes the `MyLinkedList` object.
- `int get(int index)` Get the value of the `index`-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return `-1`.
- `void addAtHead(int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
- `void addAtTail(int val)` Append a node of value `val` as the last element of the linked list.
- `void addAtIndex(int index, int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the `index`-th node in the linked list. If `index` equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
- `void deleteAtIndex(int index)` Delete the `index`-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

Example:
```plaintext
MyLinkedList linkedList = new MyLinkedList();
linkedList.addAtHead(1);
linkedList.addAtTail(3);
linkedList.addAtIndex(1,2);   // linked list becomes 1->2->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 2
linkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);  // now the linked list is 1->3
linkedList.get(1);            // returns 3
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that index values provided to the `get`, `addAtIndex`, and `deleteAtIndex` functions will be non-negative?
2. Is the linked list intended to be singly or doubly linked for this implementation?
3. What are the size constraints for the linked list? Can it be very large, which might affect performance considerations?

Assumptions:
1. Yes, the index values will be non-negative.
2. It can be either. For simplicity, we will implement a singly linked list.
3. Assume the linked list can be moderately large but within practical limits for typical interview solutions.

### Strategy

1. **Node Structure**: Implement the basic node structure for the linked list having a value and a next pointer.
2. **LinkedList Class**: Implement the `MyLinkedList` class with the required methods.
   - Use a dummy head to simplify add and delete operations.
   - Maintain a size variable to keep track of the number of elements for quick length checks.
3. **Methods**: Implement the methods ensuring boundary checks and proper node manipulation operations.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
class MyLinkedList {
private:
    struct Node {
        int value;
        Node* next;
        Node(int val) : value(val), next(nullptr) {}
    };
    
    Node* head;
    int size;

public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MyLinkedList() {
        head = new Node(0); // dummy head
        size = 0;
    }
    
    /** Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1. */
    int get(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= size)
            return -1;
        Node* current = head->next;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            current = current->next;
        }
        return current->value;
    }
    
    /** Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list. */
    void addAtHead(int val) {
        addAtIndex(0, val);
    }
    
    /** Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list. */
    void addAtTail(int val) {
        addAtIndex(size, val);
    }
    
    /** Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted. */
    void addAtIndex(int index, int val) {
        if (index > size)
            return;
        if (index < 0)
            index = 0;
        Node* prev = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            prev = prev->next;
        }
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        newNode->next = prev->next;
        prev->next = newNode;
        size++;
    }
    
    /** Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid. */
    void deleteAtIndex(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= size)
            return;
        Node* prev = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
            prev = prev->next;
        }
        Node* toDelete = prev->next;
        prev->next = toDelete->next;
        delete toDelete;
        size--;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **get(index)**: O(n) where `n` is the index since we might need to traverse the whole list.
- **addAtHead(val)**: O(1) since it directly adds the element after the dummy head.
- **addAtTail(val)**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the list as it needs to traverse to the end.
- **addAtIndex(index, val)**: O(n) where `n` is the index or the length of the list, as potentially the entire list must be traversed.
- **deleteAtIndex(index)**: O(n) where `n` is the index because it requires traversal to the node before the index.

This implementation ensures all required operations are efficient and easy to follow.
