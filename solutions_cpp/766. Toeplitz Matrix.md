[Leetcode 766. Toeplitz Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l766)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` matrix, return `true` if the matrix is a **Toeplitz Matrix**. A matrix is **Toeplitz** if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if the matrix is empty?
   - Since the definition isnâ€™t applicable, we would return `true` by convention.

2. Should the matrix contain any specific types of elements?
   - No, it can contain any integer values.

3. What if the matrix is a single row or a single column?
   - It would still be considered Toeplitz as there are no diagonals to compare.

### Strategy
1. Iterate over each element in the matrix (excluding the last row and column).
2. For each element at position `(i,j)`, compare it with the element at position `(i+1, j+1)`.
3. If any pair of elements are not equal, return `false`.
4. If all comparisons are valid, return `true`.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isToeplitzMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] != matrix[i+1][j+1]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because every element (excluding the last row and column) is checked once.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we do not use any additional space proportional to the input size.
