[Leetcode 1631. Path With Minimum Effort](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1631)
### Problem Statement
You are tasked with finding a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where every cell in the grid has an effort cost. The effort of a path is defined as the maximum difference in effort between two adjacent cells. Your goal is to minimize this effort.

Given an `m x n` grid of integers, where each integer represents the effort cost at that cell, return the minimum effort of a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Grid Size**: What are the limits on the size of the grid? 
    - The constraints are typically `1 <= m, n <= 100`.
2. **Effort Cost Range**: What are the limits on the effort costs in each cell?
    - The effort costs can range from `0 to 10^6`.
3. **Directional Movement**: Are diagonal movements allowed, or only movements in the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right)?
    - Only movements in the 4 cardinal directions are allowed.
4. **Output**: What is the expected output?
    - The minimum effort of the path.

### Strategy
- We'll use Dijkstra’s algorithm to solve this problem, adapting it for finding the minimum effort path.
- We'll maintain a distance (effort) array to track the minimum effort required to reach each cell.
- Priority Queue (Min-Heap) will help in efficiently fetching the cell with the current minimum effort.
- The key insight is that we pick the path which currently has the least effort and expand from there, thus ensuring we always take the minimum possible effort path to reach the end.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Cell {
    int x, y;
    int effort;
    Cell(int x, int y, int effort) : x(x), y(y), effort(effort) {}
};

struct Compare {
    bool operator()(Cell const& a, Cell const& b) {
        return a.effort > b.effort;
    }
};

vector<int> directions = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};

int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
    int m = heights.size();
    int n = heights[0].size();
    priority_queue<Cell, vector<Cell>, Compare> pq;
    vector<vector<int>> distance(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));

    distance[0][0] = 0;
    pq.emplace(0, 0, 0);
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [x, y, curr_effort] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();

        if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1) {
            return curr_effort;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int nx = x + directions[i];
            int ny = y + directions[i+1];

            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                int new_effort = max(curr_effort, abs(heights[x][y] - heights[nx][ny]));
                if (new_effort < distance[nx][ny]) {
                    distance[nx][ny] = new_effort;
                    pq.emplace(nx, ny, new_effort);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return 0; // This should never be reached due to the constraints of the problem.
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n \log(m \times n))\)
    - Each cell is processed once and pushed into a priority queue where each push and pop operation takes \(O(\log(m \times n))\) time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\)
    - Due to the storage requirements for the `distance` matrix and the priority queue.

This implementation efficiently finds the minimum effort path using Dijkstra’s algorithm adapted for grid-based navigation.
