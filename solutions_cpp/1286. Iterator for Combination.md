[Leetcode 1286. Iterator for Combination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1286)
## Problem Statement

Design an Iterator class that provides an iterator over all possible combinations of a given string `characters` of length `k`.

Implement the `CombinationIterator` class:

- `CombinationIterator(string characters, int combinationLength)` Initializes the object with a string `characters` of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number `combinationLength` as arguments.
- `next()` Returns the next combination of length `combinationLength` in lexicographical order.
- `hasNext()` Returns `true` if and only if there exists a next combination.

Example:

```cpp
CombinationIterator iterator = new CombinationIterator("abc", 2);
iterator.next();    // returns "ab"
iterator.hasNext(); // returns true
iterator.next();    // returns "ac"
iterator.hasNext(); // returns true
iterator.next();    // returns "bc"
iterator.hasNext(); // returns false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string `characters` contain any characters other than distinct lowercase English letters?
   - No, the problem constraints ensure `characters` contain only sorted distinct lowercase English letters.
2. What should we return if `next()` is called but there are no more combinations left?
   - We can assume that `next()` will only be called if `hasNext()` returns true.
3. What will be the maximum length of `characters`?
   - Assume the maximum length for feasible operation within reasonable constraints, say 15.

## Strategy

1. **Generate All Combinations**: We will precompute all the combinations of the given length using the first call to set up the iterator. This can be done using backtracking or combinatorial generation.
2. **Store Combinations**: Store the generated combinations in a vector.
3. **Iterator Functions**: Implement `next()` to fetch the next combination from the vector and maintain an index. Implement `hasNext()` to check if more combinations are left based on the current index.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class CombinationIterator {
private:
    std::vector<std::string> combinations;
    int currentIndex;

    void generateCombinations(const std::string &characters, int combinationLength, int start, std::string &currentCombination) {
        if (currentCombination.size() == combinationLength) {
            combinations.push_back(currentCombination);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i < characters.size(); ++i) {
            currentCombination.push_back(characters[i]);
            generateCombinations(characters, combinationLength, i + 1, currentCombination);
            currentCombination.pop_back();
        }
    }
    
public:
    CombinationIterator(std::string characters, int combinationLength) {
        currentIndex = 0;
        std::string currentCombination;
        generateCombinations(characters, combinationLength, 0, currentCombination);
    }
    
    std::string next() {
        return combinations[currentIndex++];
    }
    
    bool hasNext() {
        return currentIndex < combinations.size();
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Precomputation**: The generation of combinations is the most costly part. Generating all combinations \(C(n, k)\) where `n` is the length of `characters` and `k` is `combinationLength` takes \(O(\binom{n}{k})\).
2. **Space Complexity**: The space required to store all combinations is also \(O(\binom{n}{k})\).
3. **Operational Methods**:
   - `next()`: \(O(1)\) after precomputation.
   - `hasNext()`: \(O(1)\).

Overall, the iterator is efficient in terms of querying since we precompute all possible combinations initially.
