[Leetcode 2827. Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2827)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers low and high and an integer k, a beautiful integer is an integer x such that:
1. `low <= x <= high `
2. The digit sum of x is divisible by k. 

Return the number of beautiful integers x in the inclusive range [low, high].

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `low` and `high` always non-negative numbers?**
   - Yes, assume both `low` and `high` are non-negative integers.

2. **What is the maximum value for `high` and `k`?**
   - Assume `high` can be very large, up to \(10^9\). The value of `k` can also be large.

3. **Can the output be large?**
   - Since the range can be large, the count of beautiful integers could potentially be large.

4. **Should the function handle invalid ranges where `low > high`?**
   - Assume input will be valid according to the problem statement (`low <= high`).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:
1. **Digit Sum Function**: Create a helper function to calculate the digit sum of a number.
2. **Check Beautiful Integer**: Write a function to determine if a given number is beautiful based on its digit sum.
3. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the range from `low` to `high`, checking each number to see if it is beautiful.
4. **Optimizations**: Direct iteration might be too slow for large ranges, so consider more efficient counting methods if needed.

### Code

Here's a simple approach to solving the problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int digitSum(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

bool isBeautiful(int num, int k) {
    return (digitSum(num) % k) == 0;
}

int beautifulIntegersInRange(int low, int high, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = low; i <= high; ++i) {
        if (isBeautiful(i, k)) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int low = 10;
    int high = 20;
    int k = 5;
    std::cout << "Number of beautiful integers: " << beautifulIntegersInRange(low, high, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Digit Sum Calculation**: O(D) where D is the number of digits in the number.
- **Beautiful Check**: Each check operation involves a digit sum calculation which is O(D).
- **Iteration**: Iterating from `low` to `high` involves O(N) iterations where N = high - low + 1.

Overall Time Complexity: O(N * D), where `N` is the number of integers in the range and `D` is the maximum number of digits in the number within the range.

### Possible Optimizations

To handle large ranges, consider more advanced mathematical or combinatorial optimizations rather than brute force iteration. For instance:
- **Digit DP (Dynamic Programming)**: Precompute and store counts based on digits and re-use previous calculations.
  
However, such optimizations are beyond the scope of this simple implementation.
