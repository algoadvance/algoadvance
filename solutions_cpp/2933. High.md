[Leetcode 2933. High](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2933)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed array `hours` containing the number of hours an employee has worked over the past `n` days. An employee qualifies as a "high-access employee" if they have worked more than `8` hours in at least `5` days out of the past `7` days.

Write a function:
```cpp
int highAccessEmployees(vector<int>& hours);
```
This function should return the total count of "high-access employees".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the range of `n` (the number of days)?
   - The constraint on `n` will help determine the best sliding window or other algorithm to use.
   
2. **Thresholds**: Are 8 hours inclusive or exclusive in considering "high-access employees"?
   - This will determine the condition to check against the hours.

3. **Edge Cases**: How do we handle cases where `n` is less than 7?
   - This will ensure the function handles edge cases appropriately.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window approach to efficiently keep track of any 7-day period. Count the number of days with more than 8 hours in this window.
2. **Initial Window**: Count the qualifying days for the initial window of 7 days.
3. **Slide the Window**: Slide the window one day at a time and update the count of qualifying days accordingly.
4. **Condition Check**: At each position, check if the count of qualifying days is at least 5 and update the result count if so.

### Time Complexity
The approach involves iterating through the `hours` array once, so the time complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient for large inputs.

Here is the proposed code solution:

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int highAccessEmployees(vector<int>& hours) {
    int n = hours.size();
    if (n < 7) return 0;  // If fewer than 7 days, can't have any high-access employees
    
    int count = 0;
    int highHoursDays = 0;

    // Initial window of first 7 days
    for (int i = 0; i < 7; ++i) {
        if (hours[i] > 8) ++highHoursDays;
    }
    if (highHoursDays >= 5) ++count;
    
    // Slide the window through the rest of the days
    for (int i = 7; i < n; ++i) {
        if (hours[i] > 8) ++highHoursDays;
        if (hours[i - 7] > 8) --highHoursDays;
        if (highHoursDays >= 5) ++count;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Check**: Early return if there are fewer than 7 days since no employee can qualify.
2. **Initial Window Setup**: Iterate the first 7 elements of the array to count the qualifiable days.
3. **Sliding the Window**: For each new day added to the sliding window, update the count while removing the day that slides out of the window.
4. **Condition Check**: At each step, check if the count of qualifying days is sufficient to classify as a "high-access employee" and update the result count.

This method ensures that the count of qualifying days is always correct and efficiently slides through the array in linear time.
