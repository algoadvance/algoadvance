[Leetcode 3034. Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3034)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and a pattern array `p`. You need to find the number of contiguous subarrays in `nums` that match the given pattern `p`. An array matches the pattern if:
1. The lengths of the subarray and the pattern array `p` are the same.
2. Every element at the same index in the subarray is the same as that in the pattern.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: Can the `nums` and `p` arrays have negative numbers or zeros?
2. **Array Lengths**: What is the maximum possible length of `nums` and `p`?
3. **Output**: Should the function return the count of matching subarrays as an integer?

Let's assume:
1. Both `nums` and `p` can have positive, negative numbers and zeros.
2. The lengths of `nums` and `p` can be large, potentially in the thousands.
3. We'll return an integer representing the count of matching subarrays.

### Strategy

To find the number of subarrays in `nums` that match the array `p`, we can use a sliding window approach. The length of the sliding window will be equal to the length of `p`. As we slide the window from the beginning to the end of `nums`:

1. For each position, extract a subarray of length `p`.
2. Compare this subarray with `p`.
3. If they match, increment a counter.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int numOfSubarraysThatMatchPattern(const vector<int>& nums, const vector<int>& p) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int m = p.size();
    
    if (m > n) return 0; // If p is longer than nums, no subarrays can match.
    
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - m; ++i) {
        bool match = true;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            if (nums[i + j] != p[j]) {
                match = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (match) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> p = {2, 3, 4};

    cout << "Number of matching subarrays: " << numOfSubarraysThatMatchPattern(nums, p) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums` and \(m\) is the length of `p`.

- **Outer loop**: Runs from 0 to \(n - m\), resulting in \(O(n)\).
- **Inner loop**: Runs from 0 to \(m\), resulting in \(O(m)\).

Combining these, the overall complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), which is efficient for reasonably large inputs.
