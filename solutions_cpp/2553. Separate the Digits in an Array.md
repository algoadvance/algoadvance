[Leetcode 2553. Separate the Digits in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2553)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. The purpose of the function is to:

1. Convert each number in the array `nums` to its constituent digits.
2. Return the array of these digits in the same order as they appeared in the original numbers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of values for the integers in the input array?
   - **Clarification**: We assume integers can be both positive or negative, and the array can be of reasonable size to fit into memory.
2. **Output Format**: How should the digits of the original numbers be ordered in the output array?
   - **Clarification**: Digits of each number should appear in the same order as they appear when the number is read from left to right.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize an Output Array**: Start with an empty vector to hold the resulting digits.
2. **Iterate Through Each Number**: Convert each number to a string to easily access each digit.
3. **Extract and Store Digits**: For each character (digit) in the string representation, convert it back to an integer and push it onto the output array.
4. **Return the Output Array**: After processing all numbers, return the resulting array.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n * m)**: Where `n` is the number of elements in the input array and `m` is the average number of digits in the numbers. Each number is converted to a string and each digit is processed individually.

Here is the corresponding C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> separateDigits(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::string numStr = std::to_string(num);
        for (char digit : numStr) {
            if(digit == '-') continue; // Skip negative sign
            result.push_back(digit - '0');
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```
### Explanation
- **Initialization**: `std::vector<int> result;` prepares an empty vector to store the digits.
- **Conversion**: `std::string numStr = std::to_string(num);` converts each number to its string representation.
- **Digit Extraction**: The inner loop `for (char digit : numStr)` iterates through each character of the string. We ignore the negative sign if present.
- **Storing Digits**: `result.push_back(digit - '0');` converts the character to its integer form and adds it to the result array.
- The function finally returns the `result` vector containing all the digits in the required order.
