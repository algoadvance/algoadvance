[Leetcode 791. Custom Sort String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l791)
Sure, let's go through this problem step-by-step. Here's the structure of our discussion:

1. **Problem Statement**
2. **Clarifying Questions**
3. **Strategy**
4. **Code**
5. **Time Complexity**

### Problem Statement
Given two strings `order` and `s`. `order` is a permutation of the English alphabet. Rearrange the characters of `s` such that they match the order that `order` was sorted in. Any character in `s` that does not appear in `order` should be sorted at the end of the output string in their original order.

**Example:**
```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
Explanation: "c", "b", and "a" appear in 'order', so they are sorted like "cba". "d" is not in 'order', so it remains at the end.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `order` contain all the characters of the alphabet?
   **A:** No, `order` is a permutation of a subset of the alphabet.

2. **Q:** What should be done with characters in `s` not appearing in `order`?
   **A:** They should retain their relative positions but appear at the end of the sorted result.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of `order` and `s`?
   **A:** Yes. The strings `order` and `s` will have lengths in the range `[1, 1000]`.

### Strategy
1. **Counting characters in `s`:** We'll use a hashmap to count the occurrences of each character in `s`.
2. **Building the result based on `order`:** We'll iterate over `order` and append characters to the result string based on the count we have stored.
3. **Appending remaining characters:** Any characters in `s` that are not in `order` will be appended to the end of the result in the order they appear in `s`.

### Code
Here's how to implement the strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string customSortString(string order, string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> count;
    
    // Count each character in s
    for (char c : s) {
        count[c]++;
    }
    
    // Construct the result string based on the order
    string result;
    for (char c : order) {
        if (count.find(c) != count.end()) {
            result.append(count[c], c);
            count.erase(c);
        }
    }
    
    // Append any remaining characters not present in order
    for (char c : s) {
        if (count.find(c) != count.end()) {
            result.append(count[c], c);
            count.erase(c);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    string order = "cba";
    string s = "abcd";
    cout << customSortString(order, s) << endl; // Output: "cbad"
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Creating counts (Step 1):** This takes O(n) time where n is the length of `s`.
- **Building the result (Step 2):** This takes O(m) time where m is the length of `order`.
- **Appending remaining characters (Step 3):** This takes O(n) time where n is the length of `s`.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n + m), which is efficient given the problem constraints.

This approach ensures that characters in `s` are rearranged as per the `order` and maintains the correct positions for characters not in `order`.
