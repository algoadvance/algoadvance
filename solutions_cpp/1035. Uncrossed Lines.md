[Leetcode 1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1035)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We need to find the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw between `nums1` and `nums2` such that the lines do not cross. A connecting line is a line that connects `nums1[i]` to `nums2[j]` where `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, and the lines drawn between matching elements must not cross.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure we fully understand the problem, let's clarify a few key points:
1. Do `nums1` and `nums2` have the same length?
   - Not necessarily, they can have different lengths.
2. Are the arrays sorted?
   - There is no requirement for the arrays to be sorted.
3. What are the possible sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - Each array can contain up to 500 elements.
4. Are there any constraints on the values within `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - Both arrays contain integers between 0 and 2000.

### Strategy

The problem can be mapped to finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two arrays. The dynamic programming (DP) approach is suitable here.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

1. **Define DP Table:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the length of the longest common subsequence of `nums1[0..i-1]` and `nums2[0..j-1]`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j`: Comparing an empty `nums1` with any prefix of `nums2` yields a subsequence of length 0.
   - `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i`: Similarly, comparing any prefix of `nums1` with an empty `nums2` yields a subsequence of length 0.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
   - Otherwise: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

4. **Final Result:**
   - The value `dp[m][n]` will give the maximum number of connecting (non-crossing) lines where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.

### C++ Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxUncrossedLines(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
        int m = nums1.size();
        int n = nums2.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, 4, 2};
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {1, 2, 4};
    
    std::cout << "Maximum number of uncrossed lines: " << sol.maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2` since we need to fill an `m x n` DP table. The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the storage requirement for the DP table.
