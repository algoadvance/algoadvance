[Leetcode 693. Binary Number with Alternating Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l693)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5
Output: true
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is: 101
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is: 111
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 11
Output: false
Explanation: The binary representation of 11 is: 1011
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: true
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 is: 1010
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of n**: What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - The problem states that `n` is a positive integer, which typically means any positive integer within the range of a 32-bit integer.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Representation and Bitwise Operations**: 
    - We will leverage bitwise operations to check for alternating bits.
    - Perform `XOR` of `n` with `n >> 1`. If `n` has alternating bits, the result will be all 1's. For example, for `n = 5` (binary `101`), `n >> 1` is `010`, and `101 XOR 010 = 111`.
    - Then add 1 to the result and check if it is a power of 2 (i.e., it has only one `1` bit in its binary representation). This condition ensures that the result is indeed all 1's.

2. **Steps**:
   1. Calculate `n ^ (n >> 1)`.
   2. Add 1 to the result.
   3. Check if the result is a power of 2 by performing `(result & (result - 1)) == 0`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
        int xor_result = n ^ (n >> 1);
        return (xor_result & (xor_result + 1)) == 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    // Test cases
    int test_case_1 = 5;
    int test_case_2 = 7;
    int test_case_3 = 11;
    int test_case_4 = 10;

    std::cout << "Test Case 1 (5): " << solution.hasAlternatingBits(test_case_1) << std::endl; // Expected Output: true
    std::cout << "Test Case 2 (7): " << solution.hasAlternatingBits(test_case_2) << std::endl; // Expected Output: false
    std::cout << "Test Case 3 (11): " << solution.hasAlternatingBits(test_case_3) << std::endl; // Expected Output: false
    std::cout << "Test Case 4 (10): " << solution.hasAlternatingBits(test_case_4) << std::endl; // Expected Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1). 
  - The algorithm involves a constant number of bitwise operations which take constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).
  - No extra space is used other than a few integer variables.
