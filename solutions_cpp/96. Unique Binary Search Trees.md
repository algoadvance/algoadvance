[Leetcode 96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l96)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return the number of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that store values `1` to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`:** What is the maximum value of `n` we need to consider?
   - Generally, `n` will be within the range `[1, 19]`.

2. **Output type:** Can we assume the result will be a non-negative integer within typical constraints of the `int` type in C++?
   - Yes.

3. **Constraints:**
   - `1 <= n <= 19`.
   
### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming. The key insight is to use the concept of Catalan numbers, which count the number of BST configurations.

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize a DP array:** Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes.
2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` (An empty tree).
   - `dp[1] = 1` (A single node tree).
3. **Filling the DP Array:**
   - For each number of nodes `i` from 2 to `n`, compute `dp[i]` using previously computed values:
     - For each `j` from 1 to `i`, treat `j` as the root.
     - The left subtree would have `j-1` nodes and the right subtree would have `i-j` nodes.
     - Therefore, `dp[i] = sum(dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]) for all j in range [1, i]`.
4. **Return `dp[n]`:** The result is stored in `dp[n]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j];
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
  - We have a double loop: the outer loop runs from 2 to `n` (i.e., `O(n)`), and the inner loop (which calculates the sum) also runs up to `n` (nested `O(n)`).
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We use an array `dp` of size `n+1`.

This approach is efficient and manageable within the provided constraints.
