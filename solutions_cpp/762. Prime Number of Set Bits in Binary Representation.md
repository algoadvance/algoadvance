[Leetcode 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l762)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range `[left, right]` having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

**Definition:** 
A set bit is a bit that has a value of 1.

**Example:**
```
Input: left = 6, right = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6  -> 110 (2 set bits, which is prime)
7  -> 111 (3 set bits, which is prime)
8  -> 1000 (1 set bit, not prime)
9  -> 1001 (2 set bits, which is prime)
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, which is prime)
``` 

**Note:**
- `left` <= `right` <= 10^6
- `1 ≤ left, right ≤ 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the possible values of `left` and `right`?
   - Both `left` and `right` can range from `1` to `10^6`.

2. What is the maximum number of bits we need to consider in the binary representation of a number in the given range?
   - Numbers up to `10^6` can be represented in binary with at most 20 bits.

## Strategy

1. **Count Set Bits Function:**
   - We need a helper function to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of a number.

2. **Prime Checking Function:**
   - Create a helper function to determine if a given number is prime. Given that the number of bits will be <= 20, we just need to check for primality up to this limit.

3. **Iterate and Count:**
   - Iterate through the numbers from `left` to `right`, count the set bits, and check if this count is a prime number. If yes, increase the result count.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <bitset>

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    if (n <= 3) return true;
    if (n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
        if (n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to count the number of set bits in binary representation
int countSetBits(int n) {
    return std::bitset<21>(n).count(); // 21 to handle up to 20 bits
}

int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        int setBits = countSetBits(i);
        if (isPrime(setBits)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int left = 6;
    int right = 10;
    
    std::cout << countPrimeSetBits(left, right) << std::endl; // Output: 4
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The `countSetBits` function uses bitset which operates in O(1) for a fixed number representation (21 bits in this case).
- The `isPrime` function, in worst case, performs operations proportional to the square root of `n` (up to 20 in this scenario).
- Overall, the loop from `left` to `right` is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the range.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the range `[left, right]` and `m` is the maximum number of set bits (in this case, up to 20, a constant). This simplifies the overall complexity to O(n) given the constraints.
