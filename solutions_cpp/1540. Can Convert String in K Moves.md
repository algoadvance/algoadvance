[Leetcode 1540. Can Convert String in K Moves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1540)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `k`. You can convert `s` into `t` using the following operation: choose any index `i` in `s` and increment `s[i]` to the next character in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' follows 'y'). Incrementing 'z' changes it to 'a'. You want to determine if it's possible to convert `s` into `t` using no more than `k` operations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the strings guaranteed to be of equal length?**
    - Yes, the problem states that `s` and `t` are of the same length.
2. **Is the input limited to lowercase English letters only?**
    - Yes, the input strings are composed of lowercase English letters only.
3. **Is `k` guaranteed to be non-negative?**
    - Yes, `k` is non-negative, as operations cannot be negative.
    
## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

bool canConvertString(std::string s, std::string t, int k) {
    if (s.length() != t.length()) {
        return false;
    }
    
    std::vector<int> moveCount(26, 0);
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        int diff = t[i] - s[i];
        if (diff < 0) {
            diff += 26;
        }
        if (diff > 0) {
            moveCount[diff]++;
            int movesNeeded = diff + 26 * (moveCount[diff] - 1);
            if (movesNeeded > k) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "input";
    std::string t = "ouput";
    int k = 9;
    
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << canConvertString(s, t, k) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Determine the Difference:** Calculate the character differences needed to transform each character in `s` to the corresponding character in `t`. Taking into account wrapping (e.g., from 'z' to 'a'), compute the transformations needed.
   
2. **Count Moves Needed:** Use an array to count how many times each character difference appears. For each character difference, determine the maximum number of moves required by adding multiples of 26 (since every full cycle of 26 brings us back to the same position in the alphabet).
   
3. **Check if Convertible:** For each required move, check if it exceeds `k`. If at any point the moves required exceed `k`, return false.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. This is because we make a single pass over the strings to compute the required differences.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), which remains constant since the size of the `moveCount` vector is always 26 regardless of input size.
