[Leetcode 202. Happy Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l202)
### Problem Statement
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is a happy number.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number and `false` if not.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input:** What is the range of input values (e.g., positive integers only)?
   - **Assumption:** The input will be a positive integer.
2. **Edge Cases:** Do we need to handle extremely large numbers?
   - For typical usage, standard constraints on integers in C++ should suffice.

### Strategy
1. **Step-by-Step Process:**
   - Calculate the sum of squares of the digits.
   - Use a set to track the numbers we have seen to detect cycles.
   - Repeat until we encounter 1 (happy number) or detect a cycle (unhappy number).
   
2. **Functions Needed:**
   - A helper function to compute the sum of squares of digits.
   - A main function to implement the cycle detection using a set.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        std::unordered_set<int> seen;
        
        while (n != 1 && seen.find(n) == seen.end()) {
            seen.insert(n);
            n = getNext(n);
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }
    
private:
    int getNext(int n) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            n = n / 10;
            totalSum += digit * digit;
        }
        return totalSum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 19;  // Example input
    std::cout << (solution.isHappy(n) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Helper Function `getNext(int n)`:**
  - Calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.
  - Splits `n` digit by digit and computes their squares to accumulate the total sum.

- **Main Function `isHappy(int n)`**
  - Uses an unordered set `seen` to track visited numbers.
  - Continuously calculates the next number using the `getNext` function.
  - If a number repeats (indicating a cycle), the process stops and returns `false`.
  - If the number becomes 1, the function returns `true`.

### Time Complexity
- Each transformation step (calculation of the sum of the squares of the digits) operates in O(log n) time, where `n` is the current number.
- In the worst-case scenario, the transformation involves multiple steps before concluding (either by being happy or detecting a cycle).
- Hence, the overall complexity is hard to bound strictly but can be considered roughly O(k * log n), where `k` is the number of iterations before a cycle is detected or the number reaches 1. Typically, this converges quickly for most integers.
