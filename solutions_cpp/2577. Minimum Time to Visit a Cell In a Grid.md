[Leetcode 2577. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2577)
## Problem Statement

You are given a m x n matrix `grid` consisting of non-negative integers where `grid[i][j]` represents the time required to clear the cell `(i, j)`. You need to visit all the cells in the grid at least once, and you can only move to adjacent cells (left, right, up, or down). Find the minimum time required to visit every cell at least once.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Moving Between Cells**: Can we move between cells that have already been visited multiple times?
   - Yes, you can revisit cells multiple times if necessary.

2. **Starting Point**: Is there a given starting point, or can the journey start from any cell in the grid?
   - By default, we will assume starting from any cell unless specified.

3. **Boundaries**: Are there any specific constraints on the size of the grid?
   - Typically, for coding challenges, the grid size is reasonable such that a solution with time complexity manageable within limits is expected (often up to a few thousand cells).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we could use a variation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) considering:
1. The BFS will be utilized to traverse the grid while keeping track of the minimum time taken to arrive at each cell.
2. We will use a priority queue to explore the least time-consuming paths first, this will effectively perform a Dijkstra-like approach adapted for the grid.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a priority queue with the starting cell (initial time is 0).
2. Use a distance matrix initialized to infinity to track the minimum time to reach each cell.
3. Use BFS loop:
   - For the current cell, explore all possible adjacent cells.
   - Update the time for the neighboring cells if a shorter path is found.
   - Push the updated paths back to the priority queue.
4. Continue until all cells are visited.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the explained strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

struct Cell {
    int time;
    int x, y;
    
    bool operator>(const Cell &other) const {
        return time > other.time;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTimeToVisitCells(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        const vector<pair<int, int>> directions\{\{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        
        priority_queue<Cell, vector<Cell>, greater<Cell>> pq;
        vector<vector<int>> minTime(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
        
        minTime[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        pq.push({grid[0][0], 0, 0});
        
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [currentTime, x, y] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            if (currentTime > minTime[x][y]) continue;
            
            for (const auto& [dx, dy] : directions) {
                int newX = x + dx;
                int newY = y + dy;
                
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
                    int newTime = currentTime + grid[newX][newY];
                    if (newTime < minTime[newX][newY]) {
                        minTime[newX][newY] = newTime;
                        pq.push({newTime, newX, newY});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (const auto& row : minTime) {
            for (int t : row) {
                result = max(result, t);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialize Priority Queue and Distance Matrix**: `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
2. **Processing each Cell in the Grid**: Each cell is processed once, thus `O(m * n * log(m * n))` due to priority queue operations.

### Overall Time Complexity: 
- **O(m * n * log(m * n))**, which is efficient for reasonably sized grids.

This approach ensures all cells are visited while minimizing the total time required based on the given grid constraints.
