[Leetcode 2399. Check Distances Between Same Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2399)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in `s` appears exactly twice. You also have a 0-indexed integer array `distance` of length 26.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e., 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25).

In a well-spaced string, the distance between the two occurrences of the i-th letter is distance[i]. If the letter i does not appear in `s`, then `distance[i]` can be ignored.

Return `true` if all the letters in `s` are well-spaced according to distance, otherwise return `false`.

### Example 1:
```
Input:
s = "abaccb"
distance = [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
s = "aa"
distance = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints of the problem? 
   - The string `s` has even length between 2 and 52 (inclusive).
   - Each `distance[i]` is a non-negative integer less than 50.
2. What should the function return if the input string does not meet these constraints?
   - You can assume the input will always meet the constraints stated in the problem.

## Strategy
1. Create an integer array `first_occurrences` of length 26 to store the index of the first occurrence of each character.
2. Initialize this array to -1 for all elements.
3. Traverse the string `s`:
   - If the character's first occurrence is not recorded, store its index.
   - If the character's first occurrence is already recorded, calculate the distance between the current index and the stored index. Compare this distance with the required distance from the `distance` array.
   - If any required distance does not match, return `false`.
4. If all distances match, return `true`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool checkDistances(string s, vector<int>& distance) {
    vector<int> first_occurrences(26, -1);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        int idx = s[i] - 'a';
        if (first_occurrences[idx] == -1) {
            first_occurrences[idx] = i;
        } else {
            int required_distance = distance[idx];
            int actual_distance = i - first_occurrences[idx] - 1;
            if (required_distance != actual_distance) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once and perform constant-time operations.
- **Space complexity**: O(1), since the space used does not depend on the size of the input and the `first_occurrences` array always requires the same amount of space.
