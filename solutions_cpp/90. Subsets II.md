[Leetcode 90. Subsets II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l90)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
   - Is the input array always going to be non-empty?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the subsets be returned in any particular order?
   - What should be returned if `nums` is empty?

Assuming the answers are:
- The length of the `nums` array will be bounded, say up to `10^4`.
- The input array can be empty.
- The order of subsets in the output does not matter, and if `nums` is empty, return `[[]]`.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:**
   - First, sort the `nums` array to handle duplicates easily.
   
2. **Backtracking:**
   - Use a backtracking approach to generate subsets.
   - As we process each element, we decide whether to include it in the current subset or not.
   - To handle duplicates, if the current number is the same as the previous number, we skip the inclusion of this number to avoid duplicate subsets.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    void backtrack(int start, std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<int>& current, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& result) {
        result.push_back(current);
        for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (i > start && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;  // Skip duplicates
            current.push_back(nums[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, nums, current, result);
            current.pop_back();
        }
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());  // Sort to handle duplicates
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        std::vector<int> current;
        backtrack(0, nums, current, result);
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** O(n log n), where n is the size of the `nums` array.
- **Backtracking:** Each element has two choices (include or not include), leading to 2^n possible subsets in the worst case. For each subset, generating a copy of the subset takes O(n) time. Thus, the complexity for generating all subsets can be approximated as O(n * 2^n).

Therefore, the **overall time complexity** is O(n log n) + O(n * 2^n) â‰ˆ O(n * 2^n).

This approach ensures that we handle duplicates correctly and generates all unique subsets efficiently.
