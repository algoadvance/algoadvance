[Leetcode 900. RLE Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l900)
### Problem Statement
Design an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoded array. Specifically, for an integer sequence `S`, each element in the array `A` is described by a pair of elements: the first element is the count of the number of times the second element occurs in the uncompressed sequence. For example, the sequence `S = [100, 200, 300, 300, 300]` can be encoded to `A = [1, 100, 1, 200, 3, 300]`. 

The iterator supports the function `next(int n)`, where it exhausts the next `n` elements in the sequence and returns the last element exhausted. If there are no more elements to exhaust, `(n)` must return `-1` instead.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array `A` be empty?
   - (Assume no, the input array `A` will always represent a valid encoded sequence.)
2. Can the `next` function be called with `n` greater than the remaining elements?
   - (Yes, if `n` exceeds the remaining elements, the function should return `-1`.)

### Strategy
1. **Data Structure Design**:
   - We'll maintain the array `A` and an index to keep track of our current position within this run-length encoded array.
   - We will keep a count of the elements processed to efficiently navigate through the array.

2. **next Function**:
   - For each call to `next(n)`, we will decrement `n` by the count of the current element until `n` is `0` or there are no more elements to process.
   - If we exhaust all elements and `n` is still greater than `0`, we'll return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
- Initialization: O(1)
- Each call to `next(n)`: O(m) in the worst case, where `m` is the number of pairs in the `A` array, but typically better since we skip large chunks based on the counts directly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class RLEIterator {
public:
    RLEIterator(std::vector<int>& A) : encodedArray(A), index(0), remaining(0) {}

    int next(int n) {
        while (index < encodedArray.size()) {
            if (remaining == 0) {  // no remaining counts, move to next pair
                remaining = encodedArray[index];
                current = encodedArray[index + 1];
            }
            
            if (remaining >= n) {  // we can fulfill the request with the current element
                remaining -= n;
                return current;
            } else {  // we cannot fulfill the request, move to next pair
                n -= remaining;
                index += 2;
                remaining = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;  // exhausted all elements
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> encodedArray;
    int index;
    int current;
    int remaining;
};

// Example usage:
// std::vector<int> A = {3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5};
// RLEIterator iterator(A);
// iterator.next(2); // returns 8
// iterator.next(1); // returns 8
// iterator.next(1); // returns 5
// iterator.next(2); // returns -1
```

#### Explanation:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the iterator with the encoded array `A`.
- **next Function**: Processes `n` elements based on the remaining count, decrements `n` accordingly, and keeps track of the current position in the encoded array. If we run out of elements, it returns `-1`.

This design ensures we efficiently iterate through the RLE encoded array, maintaining a balance between simplicity and performance.
