[Leetcode 2467. Most Profitable Path in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2467)
### Problem Statement

_Leetcode 2467: Most Profitable Path in a Tree_

You have a tree rooted at `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. The tree can also be represented as an undirected graph with `n-1` edges. Each node `i` has a value `profit[i]`.

Now, you want to find the most profitable path starting from the root (node `0`) to any other node in the tree such that the sum of values (profits) of all nodes in the path is maximized. You must return this maximum sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the minimum and maximum values of `n`? 
    - What are the possible ranges for the profit values in the nodes?

2. **Nature of the Tree**:
    - Are the values in `profits` guaranteed to be non-negative? 
    - Should we consider only simple paths (non-repeating nodes) from the root?

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**:
    - Use `edges` to build an adjacency list representation of the tree.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
    - Use DFS to traverse the tree starting from the root node.
    - Keep track of the accumulated profit as you traverse.
    - At each node, compute the maximum profit achievable from this node to its leaf.
    - Return the maximum profit found during traversal.

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Tree**: The adjacency list construction takes O(n) time.
- **DFS Traversal**: Visiting each node and edge exactly once takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int mostProfitablePath(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& profit) {
        int n = profit.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        // Build adjacency list representation of tree
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], b = edge[1];
            adj[u].push_back(b);
            adj[b].push_back(u);
        }

        // To keep track of the maximum profit path
        int maxProfit = INT_MIN;
        
        // DFS function to calculate max profit
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int parent) -> int {
            int currentProfit = profit[node];
            int maxChildProfit = 0;

            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                if (neighbor != parent) {
                    maxChildProfit = max(maxChildProfit, dfs(neighbor, node));
                }
            }

            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, currentProfit + maxChildProfit);
            return currentProfit + maxChildProfit;
        };

        // Start DFS from the root node (0)
        dfs(0, -1);
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Adjacency List**:
    - Create an adjacency list from the given edges.

2. **DFS Helper Function**:
    - The DFS function takes a `node` and its `parent` to avoid revisiting the parent.
    - Accumulate the `currentProfit` from the node.
    - Traverse each child and update the `maxChildProfit`.
    - Compute the ongoing `maxProfit` using the current path's profit.

3. **Start DFS**:
    - Call the DFS from the root node `0` and initialize `maxProfit` before.
    - The function will return the maximum profit path from the root to any node in the tree.
