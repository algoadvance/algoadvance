[Leetcode 1395. Count Number of Teams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1395)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `rating` of unique integers where `rating[i]` represents the rating of the ith soldier.

You are supposed to count the number of teams you can form from this array under the following rules:
1. A team consists of exactly 3 soldiers.
2. A team is valid if the ratings of the soldiers in it are in increasing or decreasing order.

Return the number of teams you can form.

Example 1:
```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams: 
- (2,3,4) in increasing order.
- (5,3,1) in decreasing order.
- (2,5,1) in decreasing order.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: rating = [2,1,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can't form any team that satisfies the conditions.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: rating = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can form four teams: 
- (1,2,3) in increasing order.
- (1,2,4) in increasing order.
- (1,3,4) in increasing order.
- (2,3,4) in increasing order.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of the rating array?
    - The length of the rating array can be up to 200.

2. Are the ratings unique?
    - Yes, all ratings are unique.
    
3. What should be returned when no valid teams can be formed?
    - Return `0` if no valid teams can be formed.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach**: 
   - We can use three nested loops to check all possible triplets.
   - For each triplet, check if it is in increasing order or decreasing order.
   - This approach works but has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\).

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - We can use two nested loops to calculate the number of valid teams.
   - For each soldier `i`, count how many soldiers before `i` have lower (prefix lower) and higher ratings (prefix higher), and how many soldiers after `i` have lower (suffix lower) and higher ratings (suffix higher).
   - Calculate the number of combinations that can form a valid team with soldier `i` as the middle soldier.
   - This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numTeams(vector<int>& rating) {
        int n = rating.size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int leftSmaller = 0, leftLarger = 0;
            int rightSmaller = 0, rightLarger = 0;
            
            // Counting elements smaller and larger on the left side of 'i'
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (rating[j] < rating[i])
                    ++leftSmaller;
                else if (rating[j] > rating[i])
                    ++leftLarger;
            }
            
            // Counting elements smaller and larger on the right side of 'i'
            for (int k = i + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                if (rating[k] < rating[i])
                    ++rightSmaller;
                else if (rating[k] > rating[i])
                    ++rightLarger;
            }
            
            // Counting valid teams with rating[i] as the middle element
            count += leftSmaller * rightLarger + leftLarger * rightSmaller;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- We iterate over each soldier and for each soldier, calculate how many soldiers before it have a smaller or larger rating and how many soldiers after it have a smaller or larger rating.
- Calculate the possible teams by considering the soldier `i` as the middle soldier and using combinatorial counts from the left and right.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the rating array.
- This is efficient given that \(n \leq 200\).
