## Problem Statement

### 1808. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors

You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You need to find the maximum number of nice divisors of an integer `n`, whose total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) is exactly equal to `primeFactors`. Since the result may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A divisor of `n` is nice if the total number of prime factors (with multiplicity) of `d` is strictly less than the total number of prime factors of `n`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are "nice" divisors exactly?**
    - A divisor `d` of `n` is nice if `d` has fewer total prime factors (with multiplicity) than `n`.

2. **What constitutes the term "prime factors with multiplicity"?**
    - The multiplicity refers to the count of each prime factor in the prime factorization. For example, the number 18 has prime factors 2 and 3, with multiplicities 1 and 2 respectively: \(18 = 2^1 \cdot 3^2\).

## Strategy

To maximize the number of nice divisors, we can use dynamic programming or number theory based greedy approach. Given that the constraint involves working with prime factors, the problem can be reduced into maximizing product under certain sum constraints.

### Steps:

1. **Find the maximum product of integers that sum to `primeFactors`.**
   - This is akin to the "integer break" problem but adapted for prime factors.
 
2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Use modular exponentiation to keep our number within limits and to allow us to compute large powers efficiently.
   
3. **Optimal Grouping:**
   - The optimal way to form these products is to break down the number into parts that are close to 3, since the function \(3^k\) grows faster than 2.

### Detailed Plan:
- If the number of prime factors `primeFactors` is small (like 1 or 2), handle these as base cases.
- For larger values, iteratively reduce `primeFactors` by dividing it by 3 (as long as it is not less than or equal to 4), since multiplying more smaller numbers yield better products.
- Special handling for residues when `primeFactors` is in {0, 1, 2, 4}.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define MOD 1000000007

// Fast exponentiation algorithm to compute x^y % MOD
long long mod_pow(long long x, long long y, long long mod) {
    long long result = 1;
    while(y > 0) {
        if(y % 2 == 1) {
            result = (result * x) % mod;
        }
        x = (x * x) % mod;
        y /= 2;
    }
    return result;
}

int maxNiceDivisors(int primeFactors) {
    if(primeFactors <= 3) return primeFactors;
    
    if(primeFactors % 3 == 0) {
        return (int)mod_pow(3, primeFactors / 3, MOD);
    } else if(primeFactors % 3 == 1) {
        return (int)((4 * mod_pow(3, (primeFactors / 3) - 1, MOD)) % MOD);
    } else {
        return (int)((2 * mod_pow(3, primeFactors / 3, MOD)) % MOD);
    }
}

int main() {
    int primeFactors;
    cin >> primeFactors;
    cout << maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

**Time complexity:** 
- The modulo exponentiation function `mod_pow` works in \(O(\log y)\) time. Since the main loop for breaking down the number involves division, this should also bring the complexity down to logarithmic factors on higher scales. Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log primeFactors)\).
