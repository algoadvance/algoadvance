[Leetcode 498. Diagonal Traverse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l498)
### Problem Statement:
Given an `m x n` matrix `mat`, return _an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order_.

### Example:
```
Input: mat = [
  [ 1, 2, 3 ],
  [ 4, 5, 6 ],
  [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]
Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions?
   - **A:** The matrix dimensions `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns) are such that `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`.

2. **Q:** Are there any conditions where the matrix could contain negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, the matrix can contain any integers within the conventional integer range in programming.

3. **Q:** What should we return if the matrix is empty?
   - **A:** An empty matrix should return an empty list.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can traverse the matrix diagonally. We maintain a boolean flag to control the direction of traversal. We will switch directions when we hit boundaries (edges of the matrix).

Hereâ€™s how we can break down the solution:
1. Start at the top-left element of the matrix.
2. Maintain a direction flag where `true` means moving upward diagonally and `false` means moving downward diagonally.
3. For each move:
   - If moving upward and you hit the top boundary (`i == 0`), you need to move right (`j++`). If you hit the right boundary (`j == n-1`), you need to move down (`i++`).
   - If moving downward and you hit the left boundary (`j == 0`), you need to move down (`i++`). If you hit the bottom boundary (`i == m-1`), you need to move right (`j++`).
4. Continue this process until all elements are traversed.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> findDiagonalOrder(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat) {
    if (mat.empty() || mat[0].empty()) return {};

    int m = mat.size();
    int n = mat[0].size();
    std::vector<int> result;
    result.reserve(m * n);

    int i = 0, j = 0;
    bool goingUp = true;

    while (result.size() < m * n) {
        result.push_back(mat[i][j]);
        if (goingUp) {
            if (j == n - 1) {
                i++; // Hit right boundary, move down
                goingUp = false;
            } else if (i == 0) {
                j++; // Hit top boundary, move right
                goingUp = false;
            } else {
                i--;
                j++;
            }
        } else {
            if (i == m - 1) {
                j++; // Hit bottom boundary, move right
                goingUp = true;
            } else if (j == 0) {
                i++; // Hit left boundary, move down
                goingUp = true;
            } else {
                i++;
                j--;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` - We visit every element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` extra space (excluding the space needed for the output array).
