[Leetcode 2266. Count Number of Texts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2266)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `pressedKeys` representing the characters that are pressed. Each button is mapped to a list of texts:

* The button 2 is mapped to ("a", "b", "c")
* The button 3 is mapped to ("d", "e", "f")
* The button 4 is mapped to ("g", "h", "i"),
* and so on with buttons 2 to 9.

However, the button can be pressed more than once to type the corresponding character. For instance, the button 2 can be pressed 1, 2, or 3 times to type "a", "b", or "c" respectively. Also, the button can still be pressed 4 times to type "a" again.

Given a string `pressedKeys` representing the sequence of buttons pressed, return the number of possible text messages of length equal to the length of `pressedKeys` modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of `pressedKeys`?**
   - The length of `pressedKeys` can be up to 10^4.

2. **Is `pressedKeys` guaranteed to contain only digits between 2 and 9?**
   - Yes, `pressedKeys` will only contain characters from '2' to '9'.

3. **What should be done if there are repeated digits, and how do we handle them?**
   - Repeated digits can be mapped to corresponding characters based on how many times they are pressed. We need to calculate all possible combinations.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each digit can be pressed up to 4 times. For digits 7 and 9, there could be 4 mappings due to them having more letters.
   - We can use dynamic programming to count the possible combinations.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of possible ways to decode the substring `pressedKeys[0..i]`.
   - We can derive `dp[i]` from the previous states considering up to 4 previous digits if they are the same, extending the same character mapping logic.
   - Use a modulo operation (10^9 + 7) to keep the results within the integer range.

3. **Base case**:
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one way to decode a single key press.

4. **Transition**:
   - If the current and previous presses are the same, we can add up ways from previous positions up to four steps back, depending on if the button mapping allows it.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int countTexts(std::string pressedKeys) {
        constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = pressedKeys.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];

            if (i >= 2 && pressedKeys[i - 1] == pressedKeys[i - 2]) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD;
            }
            if (i >= 3 && pressedKeys[i - 1] == pressedKeys[i - 3]) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 3]) % MOD;
            }
            if (i >= 4 && pressedKeys[i - 1] == pressedKeys[i - 4] && (pressedKeys[i - 1] == '7' || pressedKeys[i - 1] == '9')) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 4]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `pressedKeys`. Each state `dp[i]` is computed in constant time by looking back at most four previous states.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for the `dp` array used to store the number of ways.

This optimized solution ensures that we efficiently count the possible combinations by leveraging the properties of constraints and dynamic programming.
