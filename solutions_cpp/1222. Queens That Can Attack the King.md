[Leetcode 1222. Queens That Can Attack the King](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1222)
## Problem Statement
In an 8x8 chessboard, there can be multiple queens and one single king. The input consists of two lists: `queens` which gives the positions of queens as a list of integer pairs, and `king` which gives the position of the king as an integer pair.

A queen can attack another piece if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal as the piece with no other pieces in between. 

Write a function that returns all the positions from which a queen can attack the king.

Example:
```cpp
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the position given in [row, column] format?
   - Yes, positions are given in [row, column] format.
2. Are there constraints on the number of queens?
   - There will be between 1 and 63 queens, and their positions will be unique and valid within an 8x8 grid.

## Strategy
1. Initialize the possible attack directions for the queens (vertical, horizontal, and diagonals).
2. Use a set to store the positions of queens for quick lookup.
3. For each direction, move step by step from the king's position towards the edge of the board.
4. Check if a queen exists at each step, if so, record that position and stop further checking in that direction.

This ensures that we are checking in all 8 possible directions from the king in an efficient manner. 

## Code
Here is the implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> queensAttacktheKing(vector<vector<int>>& queens, vector<int>& king) {
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {
        {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}, // horizontal and vertical directions
        {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1} // diagonal directions
    };

    set<pair<int, int>> queen_positions;
    for (const auto& q : queens) {
        queen_positions.insert({q[0], q[1]});
    }

    vector<vector<int>> result;

    for (const auto& dir : directions) {
        int x = king[0];
        int y = king[1];
        
        while (true) {
            x += dir[0];
            y += dir[1];
            
            if (x < 0 || x >= 8 || y < 0 || y >= 8) break;

            if (queen_positions.find({x, y}) != queen_positions.end()) {
                result.push_back({x, y});
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because:
- We always iterate a constant number of steps in each direction (at most 8x8 cells).
- Insertion and lookup in a set are average O(1) operations due to the limited number of queens (up to 63).

Thus, the algorithm works efficiently within the constraints.
