[Leetcode 1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1887)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` that contains distinct elements. In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and reduce it to a smaller value. However, this value must be a value that already exists in the array.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of array size (`n`) and possible value ranges in `nums`:**
   - This clarification will help to understand if the problem size can lead to performance issues with large inputs.

2. **Can the array contain negative numbers:**
   - This defines if there is any special consideration required for negative values.

### Code

Here's the implementation to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int reductionOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int operations = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
                operations += (n - 1 - i);
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Sort the array:**
   - By sorting the array, we can easily make sure that to reduce any element, we will always reduce to the nearest smaller element in the sorted order.

2. **Iterate from the second largest to the smallest element:**
   - We start from the second largest element and move to the leftmost side. 
   - For each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted array, if the current element is smaller than the next element, we simulate the operations needed to make it the same as the next one (which, after the operations, will all become the same as the largest element).

3. **Accumulate operations:**
   - For each movement, we need as many operations as the steps from the current element to the end of the array.
   - This approach allows us to accumulate the minimum required operations efficiently.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** This takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iterating through the sorted array:** This takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is efficient enough for practical values of \(n\).
