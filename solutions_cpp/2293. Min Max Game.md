[Leetcode 2293. Min Max Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2293)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode problem 2293: **Min Max Game**

You are given an integer array `nums`. Our goal is to repeatedly perform the following operation until we have only one number left in the array: 

1. Create a new integer array `newNums`.
2. For `i` in the range of `0` to `[n/2 - 1]`, where `n` is the current length of `nums`, replace `newNums[i]` with:
     - `min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])` if `i` is even.
     - `max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])` if `i` is odd.

Return the only number left in the array after performing the operations repeatedly.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Length of array:** Can the length of the array be any positive integer, or is it constrained to be even? 
   - Answer: Assume the length of the array is always a power of 2.
   
2. **Range of values:** Are there any constraints on the values within the array?
   - Answer: Assume elements of the array are integers within a typical range for array values.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with the given array `nums`.
2. **Iterative Reduction:** Repeat the process of constructing `newNums` from `nums` until the array length becomes 1.
3. **Array Definition:** For each step, iterate over half the length of the current `nums` array to build the `newNums` array.
4. **Conditional Assignment:** For each index, check if itâ€™s even or odd and place the minimum or maximum of pairs in `newNums`.
5. **Update State:** Replace `nums` with `newNums` and repeat until a single element remains.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minMaxGame(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    while (nums.size() > 1) {
        std::vector<int> newNums(nums.size() / 2);
        for (int i = 0; i < newNums.size(); ++i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                newNums[i] = std::min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]);
            } else {
                newNums[i] = std::max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]);
            }
        }
        nums = newNums;
    }
    return nums[0];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iteration Step:** In each iteration, the size of `nums` is halved, resulting in \((n/2, n/4, ..., 1)\).
- **Work Done per Iteration:** Within each iteration, a complete pass over the elements is required (\(O(n)\)).
- **Total Iterations:** Since the array size is reduced exponentially, there are \(log_2(n)\) iterations.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is:

\[ O(n) \text{ work per iteration} \times O(\log n) \text{ iterations} = O(n \log n) \]

This approach ensures efficient handling of the problem within the constraints.
