[Leetcode 1399. Count Largest Group](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1399)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`. Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits. Return how many groups have the largest size.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of `n`? 
   - The value of `n` can range from 1 to 10,000.
2. Are there any constraints on the input?
   - Yes, `1 <= n <= 10,000`.
3. What should the output be if `n` is a very small value (e.g., `n = 1`)?
   - For `n = 1`, the only group is `{1}` with the sum of digits being 1, hence the number of groups with the largest size is 1.

### Strategy

1. Calculate the digit sum for each number from 1 to `n`. Group the numbers by this digit sum.
2. Use a hash map (or unordered_map in C++) to keep track of the size of each group.
3. Determine the maximum size of these groups.
4. Count how many groups have this maximum size.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int sumOfDigits(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (num) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

int countLargestGroup(int n) {
    unordered_map<int, int> groupSizes;
    
    // Calculate the size of each group
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int sum = sumOfDigits(i);
        groupSizes[sum]++;
    }
    
    // Find the maximum size of groups
    int maxSize = 0;
    for (const auto &pair : groupSizes) {
        maxSize = max(maxSize, pair.second);
    }
    
    // Count the groups that have this maximum size
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto &pair : groupSizes) {
        if (pair.second == maxSize) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter n: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Number of largest groups: " << countLargestGroup(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sum of Digits Calculation**: For each digit calculation of a number `i`, the time complexity is `O(log(i))` (since there are roughly `log(i)` digits). However, summing the digits for numbers from 1 to `n` can be approximated by `O(n log(n))`.
- **Hash Map Operations**: Inserting and updating values in an unordered_map takes average `O(1)` time.
- **Finding the Maximum Group Size**: Traversing the hashmap, which has at most `O(n)` keys, takes `O(n)`.
- **Total Time Complexity**: Combining these, the overall time complexity remains `O(n log n)`.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and provides a quick way to determine the required count of groups with the largest sizes.
