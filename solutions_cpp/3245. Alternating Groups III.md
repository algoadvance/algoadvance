[Leetcode 3245. Alternating Groups III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3245)
### Problem Statement

3245. **Alternating Groups III-out**

You need to implement a function that arranges the integers from an array into alternating groups of k lengths, 
where each group alternates in increasing and decreasing order.

### Problem Description

Given an array of integers and an integer \( k \), the task is to sort the array in such a way that the first \( k \) integers 
are in ascending order, the next \( k \) integers are in descending order, and the next \( k \) integers are in ascending order again, 
and so on for the rest of the array. When the remaining part of the array is less than \( k \), sort the final segment 
according to the expected alternation (ascending or descending).

Example:
```cpp
Input: arr = [7, 3, 5, 2, 6, 1, 4], k = 3
Output: [2,3,5, 7,6,4, 1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if the array length is not a multiple of \( k \) ?**
   - If the remaining part of the array is less than \( k \), sort the remaining elements according to the expected order (ascending or descending).
   
2. **Will the array contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate numbers.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the array size and value of \( k \)?**
   - Assume 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.
   - The array can be large, so efficiency is a concern.

### Strategy

1. **Divide and Sort**:
   - Iterate through the array in chunks of \( k \) elements.
   - For each chunk, sort it in the required order (alternating ascending and descending).

2. **Handling the Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing \( n/k \) full groups, handle the leftover elements (if any) by sorting in the expected order.

### Code

Here is the C++ function to achieve this:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> alternatingGroups(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    bool ascending = true;
    int n = arr.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
        if (ascending) {
            // Ascending order
            std::sort(arr.begin() + i, arr.begin() + std::min(i + k, n));
        } else {
            // Descending order
            std::sort(arr.begin() + i, arr.begin() + std::min(i + k, n), std::greater<int>());
        }
        ascending = !ascending;
    }
    
    return arr;
}

// Helper function to print the vector
void printVector(const std::vector<int>& vec) {
    for (int val : vec) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Main function
int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {7, 3, 5, 2, 6, 1, 4};
    int k = 3;
    std::vector<int> result = alternatingGroups(arr, k);
    printVector(result);
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Complexity**: Sorting each chunk of \( k \) elements takes \(O(k \log k)\) time.
- **Loop Complexity**: There are \(n/k\) such chunks.
  - Hence, the total time complexity is \(O((n/k) \cdot k \log k) = O(n \log k)\).

- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is \(O(n \log k)\).

Feel free to test the provided function with additional test cases to ensure correctness.
