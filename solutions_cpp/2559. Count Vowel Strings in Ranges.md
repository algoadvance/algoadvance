[Leetcode 2559. Count Vowel Strings in Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2559)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `words` and two 0-indexed arrays of integers `left` and `right`.

A string is called a vowel string if it starts and ends with a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

For each query `i`, compute the number of vowel strings in the range `words[left[i]]` to `words[right[i]]` (inclusive).

Implement the function `vector<int> countVowelStringsRanges(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right)` that computes the required counts for each range specified by the `left` and `right` arrays.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The length of `words` array and both `left` and `right` arrays can be up to 10^5.
   - Each string in `words` has a maximum length of 100.

2. **Output:**
   - Return a vector of integers where each element corresponds to the count of vowel strings within the specified range for each query.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should happen with empty strings or strings that do not start and end with a vowel?
   - Should we consider `left[i] > right[i]` within the queries? (Assuming valid indices are always provided and follow `left[i] <= right[i]`).

## Strategy

1. **Determine Vowel Strings:**
   - Iterate through the `words` array and check for each word if it is a vowel string (i.e., starts and ends with a vowel).

2. **Precompute Prefix Sums:**
   - Compute a prefix sums array where each element at index `i` contains the count of vowel strings from the start of the `words` array up to index `i`.
   - This allows us to efficiently compute the number of vowel strings in any subrange with a simple subtraction.

3. **Answer Queries:**
   - For each query represented by `left[i]` and `right[i]`, calculate the number of vowel strings from the prefix sums array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isVowel(char c) {
    return c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u';
}

bool isVowelString(const string& s) {
    if(s.empty()) return false;
    return isVowel(s[0]) && isVowel(s[s.length() - 1]);
}

vector<int> countVowelStringsRanges(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right) {
    int n = words.size();
    vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
    
    // Create prefix sums
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + (isVowelString(words[i]) ? 1 : 0);
    }
    
    int q = left.size();
    vector<int> result(q, 0);
    
    // Answer queries using prefix sums
    for(int i = 0; i < q; i++) {
        result[i] = prefixSum[right[i] + 1] - prefixSum[left[i]];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing:** The prefix sum computation takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of words.
- **Query:** Each query can be answered in \(O(1)\) time due to the prefix sums.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + q)\), where \(n\) is the number of words and \(q\) is the number of queries.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle the input size constraints and answer each query in optimal time.
