[Leetcode 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1647)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make the frequency of each character unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the input string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Are there any limitations on the character set? (e.g., only lowercase English letters?)

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Should the function return an integer representing the minimum deletions required?

Assuming:
1. The input string `s` is non-empty and contains only lowercase English letters (`a` to `z`).
2. The function should return an integer representing the minimum deletions required.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - First, count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Track Frequencies**:
   - Use a data structure to track the frequencies and ensure no two frequencies are the same. This can involve decreasing the frequency of characters and counting the number of deletions.

3. **Heap/Set for Uniqueness**:
   - Use a set or a priority queue (max-heap) to ensure unique frequencies. Using a max-heap helps prioritize the highest frequencies for reduction/deletion first.

4. **Adjust Frequencies**:
   - Consider the highest frequencies first: if a frequency is already in use, decrease it until it becomes unique or zero (which implies deletion of characters).

5. **Calculate Deletions**:
   - Count how many deletions are made in adjusting frequencies.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

int minDeletions(std::string s) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> frequency_map;
    
    // Count each character's frequency
    for(char ch : s) {
        frequency_map[ch]++;
    }

    std::set<int> unique_frequencies;
    int deletions = 0;
    
    for(auto& p : frequency_map) {
        int freq = p.second;
        
        // Adjust the frequency until it becomes unique
        while(freq > 0 && !unique_frequencies.insert(freq).second) {
            freq--;
            deletions++;
        }
    }
    
    return deletions;
}

int main() {
    // Example test case
    std::string s = "aab";
    std::cout << "Minimum deletions: " << minDeletions(s) << std::endl;
    // Output: 0 (since frequencies 2 and 1 are already unique)
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Adjusting Frequencies**: O(m log m), where `m` is the number of distinct characters (in the worst case, `m = 26` for lowercase English letters).

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n + m log m) â‰ˆ O(n) for practical purposes since `m` is a small constant (26).

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**: O(m) for the frequency map and the set of unique frequencies.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: O(m), which is O(1) considering `m` is at most 26 for lowercase English letters.
