[Leetcode 2044. Count Number of Maximum Bitwise](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2044)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the number of non-empty subsets whose bitwise OR is the maximum possible value. 

A subset is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR is 3. 
There are 2 subsets with a bitwise OR equal to 3: [3], [3,1]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 16`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?
2. Is the length of the array guaranteed to be at least 1?
3. Should the solution account for non-empty subsets only?

## Strategy

The problem requires finding subsets with the maximum possible bitwise OR and counting them.

### Steps:

1. **Determine the Maximum OR Value**: Calculate the bitwise OR of the entire array to obtain the maximum possible OR value.
2. **Generate All Subsets**: Use a recursive or iterative approach to generate all possible non-empty subsets.
3. **Count Subsets with Max OR**: Iterate through all subsets and count those that have a bitwise OR equal to the maximum value.

Given that the maximum length of `nums` is 16, generating all subsets is feasible because there are `2^16 - 1` (65535) non-empty subsets.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n * 2^n)` because for each of the `2^n` subsets, we may need to compute the OR, which takes `O(n)` time in the worst case. Here `n` is the length of `nums`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countMaxOrSubsets(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxOr = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Compute the maximum possible bitwise OR value
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxOr |= num;
        }

        // Function to compute all subsets and count those with the max OR
        function<void(int, int)> dfs = [&](int index, int currentOr) {
            if (index == n) {
                if (currentOr == maxOr) {
                    count++;
                }
                return;
            }
            // Exclude nums[index]
            dfs(index + 1, currentOr);
            // Include nums[index]
            dfs(index + 1, currentOr | nums[index]);
        };
        
        // Start the DFS from the first index, with an initial OR of 0
        dfs(0, 0);
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

This code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to generate all subsets and count those with the desired OR value. The DFS function is called recursively with an index and the current OR value.

By calling `dfs(0, 0)`, the algorithm explores all subsets by either including or excluding each element, and counts subsets that achieve the maximum bitwise OR.
