[Leetcode 3154. Find Number of Ways to Reach the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3154)
## Problem Statement

You have been tasked to solve the problem of finding the number of ways to reach the `K-th` stair, given that you can climb either 1, 2, or 3 stairs at a time. Specifically, you need to write a function `waysToReachKthStair` that takes an integer `K` and returns the number of ways to reach the `K-th` stair.

## Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few aspects of the problem:
1. Is `K` always a non-negative integer? (Assumption: Yes)
2. Can we assume that the result will fit within standard integer limits? (Assumption: Yes)
3. Are there constraints on execution time and space complexity? (Assumption: Standard constraints apply.)

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - There is 1 way to stay on the ground (i.e., the 0th stair).
   - There is 1 way to reach the 1st stair: `[1]`.
   - There are 2 ways to reach the 2nd stair: `[1, 1]` and `[2]`.

2. **Recursive Relation**:
   - Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to reach the `i-th` stair.
   - The recurrence relation is:
     ```
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]
     ```
   - This is because to reach the `i-th` stair, you can come from the `(i-1)-th` stair, the `(i-2)-th` stair, or the `(i-3)-th` stair.

3. **Memoization**:
   - We will use a list to store the number of ways to reach each stair up to `K`.

4. **Iterative Solution**:
   - Initialize a list `dp` of size `K+1` with all elements as 0.
   - Fill the base cases in the list.
   - Use a loop to fill the list based on the recursive relation until the `K-th` stair.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToReachKthStair(int K) {
        if (K == 0) return 1;
        if (K == 1) return 1;
        if (K == 2) return 2;
        
        // Create a vector to store results for each stair
        std::vector<int> dp(K + 1, 0);
        // Base cases
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        
        // Fill dp array using the recursive relation
        for (int i = 3; i <= K; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 3];
        }
        
        // Return the result for the K-th stair
        return dp[K];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(K)` because we compute the number of ways for each stair from 0 to K once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(K)` to store the results for each stair up to K.

By following this strategy, we ensure that the solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient within the constraints likely given for such interview problems.
