[Leetcode 283. Move Zeroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l283)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to move all zeros in a given integer array `nums` to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation should be performed in-place.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array contain negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the array length?
   **A:** The array length can vary, but typically within the constraints of an integer array in memory.

3. **Q:** Do we need to return anything or modify the array in place?
   **A:** The array should be modified in place, and there's no need to return anything.

### Strategy

1. **Two Pointers Approach:**
   - Use two pointers:
     - One `lastNonZeroFoundAt` to keep track of the position of the last non-zero found.
     - One `cur` to traverse the array.
   - Traverse the array with `cur`. Whenever a non-zero element is found, swap it with the element at the `lastNonZeroFoundAt` index and increment `lastNonZeroFoundAt`.
   - Continue this process until the end of the array is reached.
   - This approach guarantees that all non-zero elements are moved to the beginning part of the array, and the remaining part of the array will be filled with zeros.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

void moveZeroes(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0; // Pointer to keep track of last non-zero element found
    
    // Move all non-zero elements forward
    for (int cur = 0; cur < nums.size(); cur++) {
        if (nums[cur] != 0) {
            std::swap(nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt], nums[cur]);
            lastNonZeroFoundAt++;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array once with the `cur` pointer and occasionally perform swaps.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are modifying the array in-place and no extra space is used.

### Explanation

- Initialize the `lastNonZeroFoundAt` pointer to 0.
- Iterate over the array using the `cur` pointer.
- When a non-zero element is encountered (`nums[cur] != 0`), swap it with the element at index `lastNonZeroFoundAt` and increment `lastNonZeroFoundAt`.
- By the end of the loop, all the non-zero elements would have been moved to the front of the array in their original order, and all the zero elements would be at the end of the array.
