[Leetcode 780. Reaching Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l780)
### Problem Statement
You are given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`, where `sx`, `sy` are the starting coordinates and `tx`, `ty` are the target coordinates. In one step, you can move from (x, y) to one of the following points:
- (x + y, y)
- (x, x + y)

Return `true` if you can reach the point (tx, ty) starting from (sx, sy). Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can sx or sy be larger than tx or ty?
   **A:** No, the starting point (sx, sy) is always expected to be less than or equal to the target point (tx, ty).

2. **Q:** What are the constraints on the input values?
   **A:** The integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty` are all non-negative and not necessarily bounded by a small range.

3. **Q:** Is the only operation allowed an addition of the x and y coordinates?
   **A:** Yes, you are allowed to move to (x + y, y) or (x, x + y).

### Strategy
The problem can be approached using a reverse process. Instead of starting from `(sx, sy)` and trying to reach `(tx, ty)`, we can start from `(tx, ty)` and try to reach `(sx, sy)` by reversing the allowed steps:

- If `tx > ty`, the previous step must have been from `(tx - ty, ty)` because you can't get a larger `tx` by adding `ty` to it if `tx` was initially smaller.
- If `ty > tx`, the previous step must have been from `(tx, ty - tx)` for the same reason as above.
- We can reduce the pair step by step using modulo operation to reach the starting pair `(sx, sy)` efficiently.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
    while (tx >= sx && ty >= sy) {
        if (tx == sx && ty == sy) {
            return true;
        }

        if (tx > ty) {
            if (ty > sy) {
                tx %= ty;
            } else {
                // if ty == sy, we must ensure that
                // sx can be reached from tx
                return (tx - sx) % ty == 0;
            }
        } else {
            if (tx > sx) {
                ty %= tx;
            } else {
                // if tx == sx, we must ensure that
                // sy can be reached from ty
                return (ty - sy) % tx == 0;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}

// Driver code for testing
int main() {
    int sx = 1, sy = 1, tx = 3, ty = 5;
    std::cout << (reachingPoints(sx, sy, tx, ty) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach can be discussed in terms of the worst-case scenario for the modulo operations:
- Each iteration either reduces `tx` or `ty` significantly because of the modulo operation, making the loop run efficiently.
- In the worst-case scenario, multiple division operations reduce either `tx` or `ty` each time we perform the modulo operation.

The overall time complexity is essentially `O(log(max(tx, ty)))` due to the nature of the modulo operations reducing the size of one of the coordinates roughly by half each time.
