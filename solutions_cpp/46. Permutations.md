[Leetcode 46. Permutations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l46)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of distinct integers, `nums`. Return all possible permutations of the elements in `nums`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 6`
- `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
- All the integers of `nums` are unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the input array contain duplicated elements?
   **A**: No, the array of integers is distinct as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Q**: What should we return if the input array is empty?
   **A**: According to the constraint `1 <= nums.length`, we can assume the array won't be empty.

### Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - Use backtracking to generate all permutations.
   - Create a list to store the current permutation and a boolean array to keep track of visited elements.
   - Recursively add elements to the current permutation until its size matches the input array size.
   - When the permutation is complete, add it to the result list.
   - Backtrack by setting the current element as unvisited and removing it from the current permutation.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    void backtrack(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<bool>& visited, std::vector<int>& current, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& result) {
        if (current.size() == nums.size()) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                visited[i] = true;
                current.push_back(nums[i]);
                
                backtrack(nums, visited, current, result);
                
                current.pop_back();
                visited[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> permute(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        std::vector<int> current;
        std::vector<bool> visited(nums.size(), false);
        
        backtrack(nums, visited, current, result);
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm generates all possible permutations of the given array.
- The total number of permutations of an array with `n` elements is `n!`.
- For each permutation, it takes `O(n)` time to copy it to the result list.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n * n!)`.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is also `O(n * n!)` for storing all the permutations.
- Additionally, the active stack frames and the visited array use `O(n)` extra space.
