[Leetcode 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1039)
## Problem Statement

You are given a convex polygon with `n` vertices. Your task is to triangulate the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. The score of a triangulation is the sum of the scores of its triangles. The score of a triangle is the product of the values of its three vertices. 
 
Return the minimum score of a triangulation.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`?  
     `n` will be at least 3 and at most 50.
   
   - What are the values of the vertices?  
     Each vertex is represented by an integer value.

2. **Output:**
   - Do we need to return an integer value representing the minimum score of a triangulation?

3. **Example:**
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `6` because it's already a triangle, and the product of the vertices is `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minScoreTriangulation(vector<int>& values) {
        int n = values.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int len = 3; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n-1];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    
    vector<int> values1 = {1, 2, 3};
    cout << "Minimum Score for [1, 2, 3]: " << sol.minScoreTriangulation(values1) << endl;
    
    vector<int> values2 = {3, 7, 4, 5};
    cout << "Minimum Score for [3, 7, 4, 5]: " << sol.minScoreTriangulation(values2) << endl;
    
    vector<int> values3 = {1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5};
    cout << "Minimum Score for [1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5]: " << sol.minScoreTriangulation(values3) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

- **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
  - Use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` and `j` represent the starting and ending vertices of the polygon segment.
  - `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum triangulation score for the sub-polygon from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
  - Initialize `dp[i][i]` and `dp[i][i+1]` to 0 because a single point or a line segment cannot form a triangle.
  - Use nested loops to fill the DP table:
    - The outer loop iterates over the length of the polygon segment.
    - The second loop iterates over the starting points of the segments.
    - The innermost loop iterates over possible vertices `k` dividing the segment `i` to `j`.
    - Update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum score by considering the score of the triangle formed by vertices `(i, j, k)` and the scores of sub-polygons `(i, k)` and `(k, j)`.

## Time Complexity

- The solution uses three nested loops to fill the DP table for segments of the polygon.
- Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n^3)\), where `n` is the number of vertices in the polygon.
- The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the DP table storing results for all sub-polygons.
