[Leetcode 1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1277)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `matrix`. Count the number of square submatrices that have all ones.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `m == matrix.length`
   - `n == matrix[i].length`
   - 1 <= m, n <= 300
   - `matrix[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.

2. **Output:**
   - An integer representing the number of square submatrices with all ones.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP). Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Define DP Table:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the side length of the largest square submatrix with all ones that ends at cell `(i, j)`.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - If `matrix[i][j] == 1`, we update `dp[i][j]` as:
     ```cpp
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     ```
   - This formula works because a cell `(i, j)` contributes to a larger square submatrix if its adjacent cells (top, left, and top-left diagonal) are also part of squares. We take the minimum value from these cells to ensure the side length is maximized correctly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the first row and the first column of `dp` with the same values as `matrix` since a single cell can only form a square of size 1.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - The result is the sum of all values in the `dp` table, as each value represents the count of square submatrices ending at that cell.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we iterate over each cell once and perform a constant amount of work per cell.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSquares(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int count = 0;

        // Initialize the dp array and calculate the count
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if(matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    if(i == 0 || j == 0) {
                        dp[i][j] = 1; // If it's in the first row or column
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]}) + 1;
                    }
                    count += dp[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code

- We initialize a 2D `dp` vector of the same size as `matrix`, filled with zeros.
- We iterate through each cell of the matrix.
  - If the cell `matrix[i][j]` is `1`, we check its surrounding cells to determine the size of the largest square that can end at that cell.
  - We update `dp[i][j]` based on the minimum of its top, left, and top-left diagonal neighbors plus one.
  - We add the value of `dp[i][j]` to the `count`, which keeps track of the total number of square submatrices.
- Finally, we return the `count`.

This approach ensures we efficiently count all square submatrices with all ones using dynamic programming.
