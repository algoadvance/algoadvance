[Leetcode 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1755)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the absolute difference between the sum of the nearest subsequence of `nums` and `goal`.

A subsequence is derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - The length of `nums` \( n \) will be between 1 and 40.
   - Each element of `nums` will be between -10^6 and 10^6.
   - The `goal` could be a large integer within the limit of `int`.

2. **Approach:**
   - Does every element need to be included in a subsequence?
     - No, subsequences can include any combination of elements including the empty set.
   - What kind of efficiency is required?
     - Given \( n \leq 40 \), we can consider methods that are exponential in nature but optimal for this constraint.

## Strategy

Given that the size of `nums` can be up to 40, a naive method of checking all subsequences isn't feasible directly. Instead, we can use a Meet-in-the-Middle approach, dividing the problem into two halves, then combining and comparing results.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Divide** `nums` into two halves.
2. **Generate all possible subsequence sums** for each half.
3. **Sort** one of the lists of sums for efficient binary search.
4. **For each sum** in the first list, use binary search on the sorted second list to find the closest sum to the `goal`.
5. **Find the smallest absolute difference** between the combined sums and the `goal`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int minAbsDifference(std::vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        int n = nums.size();
        // Split nums into two halves
        std::vector<int> left(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + n / 2);
        std::vector<int> right(nums.begin() + n / 2, nums.end());
        
        // Get all possible sums of subsets
        auto getAllSums = [](const std::vector<int>& arr) {
            std::set<int> sums;
            int size = arr.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < (1 << size); ++i) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                    if (i & (1 << j)) {
                        sum += arr[j];
                    }
                }
                sums.insert(sum);
            }
            return sums;
        };
        
        std::set<int> leftSums = getAllSums(left);
        std::set<int> rightSums = getAllSums(right);
        
        // Convert rightSums to a sorted vector for binary search
        std::vector<int> rightSumsVec(rightSums.begin(), rightSums.end());
        
        int minDiff = std::abs(goal);
        for (int leftSum : leftSums) {
            int desired = goal - leftSum;
            auto it = std::lower_bound(rightSumsVec.begin(), rightSumsVec.end(), desired);
            
            if (it != rightSumsVec.end()) {
                minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(goal - (leftSum + *it)));
            }
            
            if (it != rightSumsVec.begin()) {
                --it;
                minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(goal - (leftSum + *it)));
            }
        }
        
        return minDiff;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Subset Sum Generation:** Each half of the array will have at most 20 elements. There will be \( 2^{20} \) possible sums for each half.
   - Generating all subset sums for one half: \( O(2^{20} \cdot 20) \) (since we iterate and calculate sums for each subset).
   - Sorting the sums of one half: \( O(2^{20} \log 2^{20}) \).

2. **Finding Closest Sums:**
   - For each sum in the first half, a binary search in the second half: \( O(2^{20} \log 2^{20}) \).

So, the overall complexity is approximately \( O(2^{20} \log 2^{20}) \) which is feasible for \( n \leq 40 \).
