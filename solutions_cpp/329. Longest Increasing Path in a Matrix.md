[Leetcode 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l329)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` integer matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., the next cell must be within the grid).

### Example
```
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the matrix have negative numbers?
   - Yes, there are no constraints on the values of the integers in the matrix.
2. What is the range of the dimensions of the matrix (m and n)?
   - 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 200.
3. Can the matrix be empty?
   - No, it's constrained that 1 ≤ m, n so the matrix will not be empty.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a depth-first search (DFS) along with memoization. The idea is to traverse each cell, and from each cell, we recursively traverse its neighbors (if they lead to an increasing path). We'll store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

1. Initialize a 2D list `memo` with the same dimensions as the input matrix, filled with zeros. This will store lengths of the longest increasing paths starting from each cell.
2. Define a recursive DFS function that:
   - Checks if the current cell has already been computed in `memo`. If so, simply return the stored value.
   - Otherwise, for each of the four possible moves (up, down, left, right), check if the move stays within boundaries and leads to an increasing path.
   - Recursively call the DFS function on valid moves and compute the longest path.
   - Update the `memo` value for the current cell.
3. Iterate over all cells in the matrix, and evaluate the longest path using the DFS function.
4. Return the maximum value obtained from all cells.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestIncreasingPath(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty()) return 0;
        
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> memo(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int x, int y) {
            if (memo[x][y] != 0) return memo[x][y]; // If already computed, return the result

            int directions[4][2] = \{\{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
            int maxLen = 1; // Length of path from this cell itself (minimum is 1)
            
            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && matrix[nx][ny] > matrix[x][y]) {
                    maxLen = max(maxLen, 1 + dfs(nx, ny));
                }
            } 
            
            memo[x][y] = maxLen;
            return maxLen;
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                maxLength = max(maxLength, dfs(i, j));
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\) because each cell is computed only once.
- The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the `memo` array storing the results for each cell.

This solution efficiently finds the longest increasing path in a matrix with an optimized DFS approach using memoization to avoid recomputation of already solved subproblems.
