[Leetcode 2315. Count Asterisks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2315)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`, which contains `|` (pipe) and `*` (asterisk) characters. We want to determine the number of asterisks in the string that are not enclosed between pairs of pipe characters.

A pair of pipe characters is considered to enclose everything between them if there is an even number of `|` characters. For example, in the string `"|**|*|**|"`, only the first two and the last asterisk are enclosed by a pair of pipes.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
      - The string length will be between 1 and 1000.
   
2. **Character Guarantee:**
   - Can the string have other characters apart from `|` and `*`?
      - Yes, it can contain other characters, but we only care about `|` and `*`.

3. **Pipe Pair Definition:**
   - Is the enclosure limited strictly between pipe pairs, even though they are nested?
      - Yes, only consider characters between each pair of pipes.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Have a counter for asterisks that are not enclosed by pipe characters.
   - Maintain a variable to track whether the current character is within pipe-enclosed sections.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each character, check if it is a `|`. Toggle the inside-pipes flag.
   - If it is an asterisk (`*`) and we are not inside a pair of pipes, increment the asterisk counter.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle strings without any pipes.
   - Handle strings with no `*`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int countAsterisks(std::string s) {
    int asteriskCount = 0;
    bool insidePipes = false;

    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '|') {
            insidePipes = !insidePipes;
        } else if (c == '*' && !insidePipes) {
            asteriskCount++;
        }
    }

    return asteriskCount;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|";
    std::cout << "Count of asterisks not enclosed by pipes: " << countAsterisks(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We only make a single pass through the string, checking each character.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are only using a few variables to store the current state and the count of asterisks.

This solution ensures that we count only the asterisks that are outside of any pipe-enclosed section efficiently.
