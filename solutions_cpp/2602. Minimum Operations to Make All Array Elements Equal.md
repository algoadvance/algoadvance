[Leetcode 2602. Minimum Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2602)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose any integer `x` in the array and replace it with `x + k` or `x - k`.

An array is considered equal if all its elements are the same. Determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Elements Negativity**: Can the elements of the array be negative?
   - Yes, elements can be negative.
   
2. **Range of `k`**: Can `k` be zero or negative?
   - Let's assume reasonable constraints where `k` is a positive integer.

3. **Array size**: What are the constraints on the size of the array?
   - Typical constraints might be `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

4. **Uniqueness**: Are elements in the array unique?
   - There is no guarantee that elements are unique.

5. **Result Feasibility**: Is it always possible to make all elements in the array equal using the given operations?
   - Let's assume it is always achievable.

## Strategy

To make all elements in the array equal, consider the modulo behavior with respect to `k`. For any two elements `a` and `b` in `nums`, they can only be made equal if `(a - b) % k == 0`. Thus, all elements need to be equal modulo `k` to ensure they can be transformed into a common value.

### Steps:
1. Compute the modulo of each element in the array with `k`.
2. Determine the most frequent modulo value.
3. Count the minimum number of operations required to convert all elements to have the most frequent modulo value.

## Time Complexity

- Calculating modulo for each element: O(n)
- Counting frequency of remainder: O(n)
- Determine the maximum frequency: O(1) (since k can be considered O(1))

Total time complexity is O(n).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();

    // Find mod values and their frequency.
    std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int modValue = (nums[i] % k + k) % k;
        freq[modValue]++;
    }
    
    // Find the most frequent mod value.
    int maxFreq = 0;
    for(const auto& pair : freq) {
        maxFreq = std::max(maxFreq, pair.second);
    }
    
    // Minimum number of operations needed to make all elements have the same mod value
    return n - maxFreq;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 5, 7, 10};
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << "Minimum operations: " << minimumOperations(nums, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We compute the remainder of each element modulo `k`.
- We count frequencies of these remainders.
- We find the most common remainder, then derive the minimum operations needed by subtracting this count from the total count of numbers.
