[Leetcode 1909. Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1909)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You need to determine if it is possible to remove exactly one element from the array such that the resulting array is strictly increasing.

An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` for every index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`.

Return `true` if it is possible to remove one element from the array to make it strictly increasing, otherwise return `false`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,10,5,7]
Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the minimum and maximum length of the input array?
   - Are the elements of the input array bounded within certain limits?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the array is already strictly increasing?
   - How should the case where there's only one element in the array be handled?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeIncreasing(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Track the number of violations
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i-1]) {
                count++;
                if (count > 1) return false;
                // Check if removing nums[i-1] or nums[i] could solve the problem
                if (i > 1 && nums[i] <= nums[i-2] && i < n-1 && nums[i+1] <= nums[i-1]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:**
   - Traverse the array to count how many times `nums[i-1] >= nums[i]`.
   - If this count exceeds 1, return `false` immediately, as removing one element won't be sufficient.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - For each detected non-increasing pair `(nums[i-1], nums[i])`:
     - Check if removing `nums[i-1]` or `nums[i]` could potentially fix the array to make it strictly increasing.
     - Use conditions like `nums[i] <= nums[i-2]` and `nums[i+1] <= nums[i-1]` to see if removing one of the elements would lead to a potential fix.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution mostly involves a single pass through the array, making it O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, O(1).

This ensures the algorithm is efficient even for larger inputs.
