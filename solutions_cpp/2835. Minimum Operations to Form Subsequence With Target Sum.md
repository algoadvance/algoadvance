[Leetcode 2835. Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2835)
### Problem Statement
You are given a non-negative integer array `nums` and an integer `target`. In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and split it into two integers that sum up to the original element. 

Return the minimum number of operations needed to form a subsequence with a sum equal to `target` after performing the operation any number of times. If it's not possible to form such a subsequence, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the split operation be performed on an element more than once?
   - **Yes**, you can split an element as many times as needed.
2. Is the array `nums` always given and non-negative, and is `target` a positive integer?
   - **Yes**, `nums` consists of non-negative integers, and `target` is a positive integer.
3. Are there any constraints on the size of `nums` or the value of the elements?
   - Yes, the typical constraints for LeetCode problems apply. Letâ€™s assume:
     - \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
     - \( 0 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^9 \)
     - \( 1 \leq \text{target} \leq 10^9 \)

### Strategy
1. **Binary Representation Analysis**:
   - For each number in the array, consider its binary representation.
   - Each bit represents a power of two, and we can focus on these powers to try and sum up to `target`.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Use a frequency array to count the availability of each power of two in the original array.
   - Treat the problem of forming `target` using the available powers of two as a resource allocation problem.

3. **Operations Count**:
   - Track how many splits are needed if a specific power of two is short while forming the `target`.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> powerOfTwoCount;

        // Fill the map with counts of each power of two in nums
        for (int num : nums) {
            int bit = 0;
            while (num > 0) {
                int power = (1 << bit);
                if (num & power) {
                    powerOfTwoCount[power]++;
                    num -= power;
                }
                bit++;
            }
        }

        // Power of twos sums needed
        long long currentSum = 0;
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int bit = 0; bit <= 30; bit++) {
            int power = (1 << bit);
            currentSum += (long long)power * powerOfTwoCount[power];
            
            // If we need this power of two in target sum
            if (target & power) {
                if (currentSum < power) {
                    return -1;
                }
                currentSum -= power;
            }

            // Carry forward the current sum if it's more than needed
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log M)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array and \(M\) is the maximum value in `nums`. Each number is decomposed in terms of powers of 2, which takes \(O(\log M)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log M)\) for storing the counts of each power of two in the array.

This approach efficiently counts and uses the required powers of two to form the target sum with minimal operations.
