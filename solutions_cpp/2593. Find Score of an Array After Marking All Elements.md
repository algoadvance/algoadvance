[Leetcode 2593. Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2593)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Your task is to apply operations to this array according to the following rules:
1. Select the minimum element in the array and mark it and its adjacent elements (i.e., the elements immediately before and after it) as "used" (i.e., these elements cannot be selected again).
2. Add the value of the selected minimum element to a running total score.
3. Continue this process until all elements are marked.

Return the score after all elements are marked.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The problem usually specifies this. For the purpose of this example, we will assume typical constraint ranges like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

2. **What should be the output if the array is completely marked?**
   - Return the score accumulated from the selected minimum elements.

3. **Can there be duplicate elements in the array?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

### Strategy

1. **Create a Data Structure to Track "Used" Status:**
   - Use a boolean vector `used` of the same size as `nums` to track which elements have already been used.

2. **Iterate Until All Elements are Used:**
   - Find the minimum unmarked element from `nums`.
   - Mark this element and its adjacent elements in the `used` array.
   - Add the value of this minimum element to a score counter.

3. **Optimization with Min-Heap:**
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the elements and their indexes. This allows us to efficiently retrieve the smallest unmarked element.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findScore(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<bool> used(n, false); // To mark elements as used
        priority_queue<tuple<int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int>>, greater<tuple<int, int>>> minHeap;
        
        // Populate the min-heap with (value, index)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            minHeap.push(make_tuple(nums[i], i));
        }
        
        int score = 0;
        
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            auto [val, idx] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            // If the element is already used, continue to the next
            if (used[idx]) continue;
            
            // Add the value to the score
            score += val;
            
            // Mark this element and its adjacent elements as used
            if (idx > 0) used[idx - 1] = true;
            used[idx] = true;
            if (idx < n - 1) used[idx + 1] = true;
        }
        
        return score;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {3, 2, 1, 4}; // Example case
    cout << "Score: " << sol.findScore(nums) << endl; // Output should be 4 (1 + 3)
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations:** Insertion and extraction from a min-heap is O(log n).
- **Total Operations:** Each element is pushed and popped from the heap once.
  Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the heap operations.

This approach efficiently handles even the upper constraint limits on array size and provides a clear mechanism to achieve the desired score by leveraging the properties of a priority queue.
