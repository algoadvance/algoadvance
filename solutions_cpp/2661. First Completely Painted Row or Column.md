[Leetcode 2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2661)
### Problem Statement
You are given a grid of size `m x n` and an array of integers `arr` where each integer represents the cell (i, x) in `arr` that is painted accordingly. Your task is to find the first row or column that gets completely painted. Return the 0-based index of that row or column. If no row or column gets completely painted, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What type of integers does the array `arr` contain?** 
   - Assumption: `arr` contains integers that can be mapped to specific cells in a row or column.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the grid or the elements in the array?** 
   - Assume a practical range for `m` and `n` (e.g., `1 <= m, n <= 1000`) and the size of `arr`.

3. **Can the same cell be painted more than once?**
   - Yes, but each cell is counted only once towards "painting".

### Strategy
1. **Tracking Paint Counts:**
   - Use two arrays, `row_count` and `col_count`, to keep track of the number of painted cells in each row and column.
   - Initialize these arrays with zeros.
   
2. **Mapping Array Values to Cells:**
   - For each element in `arr`, interpret the value as pointing to a specific cell in the grid.
   
3. **Increment and Check:**
   - For each painted cell described by `arr[i]`, increment the paint count for the respective row and column.
   - After each increment, check if the current count for the affected row or column has reached `n` (for rows) or `m` (for columns).
   - If so, return the index.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle scenarios where `arr` might not paint any row or column completely.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int firstCompleteIndex(int m, int n, vector<int>& arr) {
    // We use two vectors to count painted cells in each row and column
    vector<int> row_count(m, 0);
    vector<int> col_count(n, 0);
    
    for (int index = 0; index < arr.size(); ++index) {
        int cell = arr[index];
        int row = cell / n;  // Assuming cell is numbered linearly
        int col = cell % n;
        
        // Increment row and column paint count
        row_count[row]++;
        col_count[col]++;
        
        // Check if the current row or column is completely painted
        if (row_count[row] == n) return row; // Full painted row found
        if (col_count[col] == m) return col + m; // Full painted column found
    }
    
    // If no row or column was completely painted
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** O(m + n), for initializing the row and column count arrays.
- **Processing arr:** O(k), where `k` is the size of `arr`.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(m + n + k), which is efficient for practical purposes given typical constraints.

### Usage
The function `firstCompleteIndex` takes:
- `m` and `n` representing the dimensions of the grid.
- `arr` denoting the sequence of paint instructions.

It returns the index of the first completely painted row or column, if any. If neither happens, it returns -1.
