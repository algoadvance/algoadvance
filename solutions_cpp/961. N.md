[Leetcode 961. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l961)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of size `2N`, there are `N+1` unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times. Return the element that is repeated N times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can we assume the array `A` always has exactly one element repeated N times?
   - What are the constraints on the elements of the array? (e.g., range of values)
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should we handle any specific edge cases? (e.g., invalid inputs)

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, I will use the following approach:

1. **Hash Set to Track Seen Elements:**
   - Traverse through the array while maintaining a set of seen elements.
   - For each element, check if it's already in the set.
   - If it is, then this is the repeated element, so return it.
   - If it is not, add the element to the set.

This approach ensures that we only make a single pass through the array and keep an auxiliary space proportional to the number of unique elements, which makes the algorithm efficient in terms of both time and space.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of unique elements (half the size of array).
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), for storing unique elements in a set.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedNTimes(std::vector<int>& A) {
        std::unordered_set<int> seen;
        for(int num : A) {
            if(seen.count(num)) {
                return num;
            }
            seen.insert(num);
        }
        // If input constraints are guaranteed, the function will always return from within the loop.
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize an empty unordered set `seen` to keep track of elements we have encountered.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Loop through each element `num` in array `A`.
   - For each `num`, check if it exists in the set `seen`.
     - If it does, this is the repeated element, so return `num`.
     - If it does not, insert `num` into the set.

3. **Safety Net:**
   - If the input constraints guarantee that there's always one repeated element, the function will not reach the return statement outside the loop.
   - Otherwise, this return statement is just a safety net in case of unexpected inputs.

By iterating through the array and checking for the repeated element as described, the solution ensures we find the N-repeated element efficiently.
