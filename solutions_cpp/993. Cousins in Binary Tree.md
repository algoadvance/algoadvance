[Leetcode 993. Cousins in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l993)
### Problem Statement:

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth `k` node are at depth `k+1`.

Two nodes of a binary tree are *cousins* if they have the same depth but have different parents.

Given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values of two different nodes `x` and `y`, return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y` are cousins.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
- Each node has a unique integer value.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What should be returned if `x` or `y` is not present in the tree?**
   - We can assume both `x` and `y` are guaranteed to be in the tree according to the problem statement.
2. **Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - No, as per the problem statement, each node has a unique integer value.
3. **What are the edge cases to consider?**
   - Nodes `x` and `y` might be at different depths or might have the same parent.

### Strategy:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal (BFS).
   - For each node visited, keep track of its depth and parent node.
   - When we find node `x`, record its depth and parent.
   - When we find node `y`, record its depth and parent.
   - After traversal, check if `x` and `y` have the same depth but different parents.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isCousins(TreeNode* root, int x, int y) {
        if (!root) return false;
        
        queue<tuple<TreeNode*, int, TreeNode*>> q;
        q.push({root, 0, nullptr});  // Tuple of (node, depth, parent)
        
        int x_depth = -1, y_depth = -1;
        TreeNode* x_parent = nullptr;
        TreeNode* y_parent = nullptr;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto[node, depth, parent] = q.front(); q.pop();
            
            if (node->val == x) {
                x_depth = depth;
                x_parent = parent;
            } else if (node->val == y) {
                y_depth = depth;
                y_parent = parent;
            }
            
            if (x_depth != -1 && y_depth != -1) {
                break;  // Stop searching if both nodes are found
            }
            
            if (node->left) {
                q.push({node->left, depth + 1, node});
            }
            if (node->right) {
                q.push({node->right, depth + 1, node});
            }
        }
        
        return x_depth == y_depth && x_parent != y_parent;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The BFS traversal ensures that each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the queue used for the BFS, which in the worst case, stores one level of the tree nodes.
