[Leetcode 1617. Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1617)
### Problem Statement
You are given `n` cities from `1` to `n`, and `n-1` roads such that there is exactly one way to travel between any two different cities (i.e., the cities form a tree).

A subtree is any connected subgraph within this tree.

A subtree's "diameter" is the maximum distance between any two nodes in the subtree. The distance between two nodes in a subtree is the number of edges on the path between them. 

Return an array `answer` of size `n-1` where `answer[i]` is the number of subtrees with a diameter equal to `i+1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:**
   - `n` (the number of cities)
   - `edges` (a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `[u, v]` indicating that there is a road between city `u` and city `v`)

2. **Output Format:**
   - A list `answer` where `answer[i]` is the number of subtrees with a diameter equal to `i+1`.

3. **Constraints:**
   - `2 <= n <= 15`
   - Each pair represents a bidirectional road.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.

2. **Subtree Generation:**
   - Generate all possible subtree combinations from the given tree. Since `n` is relatively small (maximum 15), it's feasible to consider all subsets of nodes.

3. **Diameter Calculation:**
   - For each subtree, find the diameter using either:
     - BFS twice (first BFS to find the furthest node, and then a second BFS from that node to determine the diameter).
     - DFS to acquire the furthest distance.

4. **Counting Subtrees:**
   - Count the subtrees for each possible diameter and store these counts in the `answer` array.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Create the graph (adjacency list)
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n + 1);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        vector<int> answer(n - 1, 0);
        
        for (int subset = 1; subset < (1 << n); ++subset) {
            vector<int> nodes;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (subset & (1 << i)) {
                    nodes.push_back(i + 1);
                }
            }

            if (nodes.size() < 2) continue;

            if (isConnected(nodes, graph)) {
                int diameter = findDiameter(nodes, graph);
                if (diameter > 0 && diameter <= n - 1) {
                    answer[diameter - 1]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }

private:
    bool isConnected(const vector<int>& nodes, const vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        if (nodes.empty()) return false;

        unordered_map<int, bool> visited;
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(nodes[0]);
        visited[nodes[0]] = true;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (find(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), neighbor) != nodes.end() && !visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int node : nodes) {
            if (!visited[node]) return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    int findDiameter(const vector<int>& nodes, const vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int furthestNode, distance;
        tie(furthestNode, distance) = bfs(nodes[0], nodes, graph);
        tie(furthestNode, distance) = bfs(furthestNode, nodes, graph);

        return distance;
    }

    pair<int, int> bfs(int start, const vector<int>& nodes, const vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        unordered_map<int, int> dist;
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(start);
        dist[start] = 0;

        int furthestNode = start, maxDistance = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                if (find(nodes.begin(), nodes.end(), neighbor) != nodes.end() && !dist.count(neighbor)) {
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                    q.push(neighbor);

                    if (dist[neighbor] > maxDistance) {
                        maxDistance = dist[neighbor];
                        furthestNode = neighbor;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return {furthestNode, maxDistance};
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}};
    int n = 4;

    vector<int> result = solution.countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(n, edges);

    for (int count : result) {
        cout << count << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The code checks all subsets of cities, which are `2^n`.
- For each subset, the code performs BFS which is `O(n)`.

Overall time complexity: `O(2^n * n^2)`.

Given `n <= 15`, this complexity is feasible.
