[Leetcode 2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2206)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2206: **Divide Array Into Equal Pairs**

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers. You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that each pair contains exactly two equal elements. Return `true` if you can divide the array into `n` pairs, otherwise return `false`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: 
There are 3 pairs such as (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 2).
```

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide the array into pairs.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What if `nums` is empty or has just one element?**
   - We are given that `nums` contains `2 * n` elements, so these cases should not occur.
2. **Do we have any constraints on the size of `nums` or the values within `nums`?**
   - Typically, array size constraints and integer constraints given by the platform or problem description apply.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**: Use a hash map to count the frequency of each integer in `nums`.
2. **Check Pairability**: Ensure that each integer has an even frequency, as exactly two elements are needed to form a pair.

### Steps

1. **Initialize Frequency Map**: Use a hash map (or array if values are within a small range) to count occurrences of each integer.
2. **Check Frequencies**: Traverse the frequency map to check if each value's frequency is even.
3. **Return Result**: Return `true` if all values have even frequencies, otherwise return `false`.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    bool divideArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        
        // Count frequencies of each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }
        
        // Check if all frequencies are even
        for (auto& entry : freq) {
            if (entry.second % 2 != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - Counting frequencies takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - Checking if each frequency is even takes `O(m)` time where `m` is the number of distinct elements. In the worst case, `m` can be `n`, so this process is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)`
  - The hash map stores up to `m` distinct elements, which in the worst case could be `n`. Hence, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

This solution efficiently checks if it's possible to divide the array into equal pairs of elements.
