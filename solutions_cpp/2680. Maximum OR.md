[Leetcode 2680. Maximum OR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2680)
# Problem Statement
You are given a list of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the maximum value of the bitwise OR operation that is possible by removing exactly one element from the list.

# Clarifying Questions
1. Can the list contain duplicates?
   - Yes, the list can contain duplicate integers.

2. What is the size range of the list?
   - The size of the list can range from 2 to 10^5 elements.

3. What values can the integers in the list take?
   - The integers can range from 0 to 10^9.

4. Can the final list be empty?
   - No, as we are only removing one element, the final list will still contain at least one element.

# Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
1. Compute the bitwise OR of the entire list.
2. For each element in the list, compute the bitwise OR of the list without that element.
3. Keep track of the maximum OR value obtained in the previous step.

# Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int maxORRemovingOneElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 1) {
        return 0; // Edge case, though per problem constraint, n >= 2
    }
    
    // Compute the total OR of the array
    int totalOR = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        totalOR |= num;
    }
    
    int maxOR = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        // Compute the OR without the current element
        int currentOR = totalOR & (~num);
        maxOR = max(maxOR, currentOR);
    }
    
    return maxOR;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << "Maximum OR after removing one element: " << maxORRemovingOneElement(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

# Time Complexity
- **Initial OR computation:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
- **Iterating through elements:** O(n) per element to compute the OR without that element.
  
Overall Time Complexity: O(n), which is efficient given the problem constraints. The space complexity is O(1) if we do not consider the input storage.
