[Leetcode 713. Subarray Product Less Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l713)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the input array contain negative integers or zero?
   **A**: According to the problem constraints, `nums` will contain positive integers. Negative numbers or zeroes are not considered.

2. **Q**: What should be returned if `k` is less than or equal to 1?
   **A**: If `k` is less than or equal to 1, it's impossible to have any subarray with a product less than `k` since the smallest product of positive integers starts from 1. Therefore, the result should be 0.

3. **Q**: What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and `k`?
   **A**: The problem states:
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
   - `0 <= k <= 10^6`

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window (two-pointer) technique to efficiently calculate the subarray products and count those that meet the criteria. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers and Product**:
   - Use two pointers, `left` at the start of the window and `right` to expand the window.
   - Maintain a variable `product` to store the product of the elements in the current window.

2. **Expand the Window**:
   - Iterate with the `right` pointer over the array. Multiply the current element to the product.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
   - If the product reaches or exceeds `k`, increment the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the product is less than `k`.

4. **Count Subarrays**:
   - For each position of `right`, all subarrays ending with `right` and starting from `left` to `right` are valid. The count of such subarrays is `right - left + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle the special case where `k` is less than or equal to 1.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    if (k <= 1) return 0;
    
    int left = 0;
    int product = 1;
    int result = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
        product *= nums[right];
        
        while (product >= k) {
            product /= nums[left];
            ++left;
        }
        
        result += right - left + 1;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` increment and once by `left` increment). Thus, it is an efficient solution suitable for large inputs given the constraints \(1 \leq nums.length \leq 3 \times 10^4\).
