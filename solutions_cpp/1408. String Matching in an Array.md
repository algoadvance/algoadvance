[Leetcode 1408. String Matching in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1408)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of string `words`, return all strings in `words` that are a substring of another word in any order. A `substring` is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the input strings case-sensitive?
   - **A:** Yes, the strings are case-sensitive.
2. **Q:** Can a word be a substring of itself?
   - **A:** No, a word cannot be a substring of itself in the context of the problem.
3. **Q:** Do we need to consider duplicates in the result?
   - **A:** No duplicates will be present in the result as each word should appear once no matter how many times it appears as a substring.

### Strategy
1. We will iterate over each pair of words in the list.
2. For each pair, check if one word is a substring of the other.
3. If it is, add the substrings to the result set.
4. Convert the set to a vector and return it.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

vector<string> stringMatching(vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_set<string> resultSet;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < words.size(); j++) {
            if (i != j && words[j].find(words[i]) != string::npos) {
                resultSet.insert(words[i]);
                break; // No need to check further if we've found at least one match
            }
        }
    }
    
    return vector<string>(resultSet.begin(), resultSet.end());
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"mass", "as", "hero", "superhero"};
    vector<string> result = stringMatching(words);
    
    for (const string& word : result) {
        cout << word << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(n^2 \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the size of the `words` vector and \(m\) is the average length of words. This complexity arises because we are comparing each pair of words and performing a substring search which, in the worst case, is linear with respect to the length of the word.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because we store the results in a set which, in the worst case, could store all words.
