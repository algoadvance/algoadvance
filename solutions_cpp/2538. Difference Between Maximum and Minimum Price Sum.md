[Leetcode 2538. Difference Between Maximum and Minimum Price Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2538)
## Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and exactly `n-1` edges. The root of the tree is the node `0`. If `edges = [[a1, b1], [a2, b2], ..., [an-1, bn-1]]`, then there is an edge between `ai` and `bi` for each `i` (0 <= i <= n-2).

Each node has a price associated with it, given in an array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the `i-th` node.

The price sum of a given path is defined as the sum of the prices of the nodes along the path.

Your task is to return the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum of paths starting from the root node `0`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree structure confirmation**: Is the input guaranteed to form a valid tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees a tree structure in the input.

2. **Edge cases**: 
   - What should be the output if the tree has only one node?
     - The difference in this case is `0` since both maximum and minimum price sums are equal to the price of the single node.

## Strategy

1. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Perform Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and calculate the price sums of all paths starting from the root.
   
2. **Track Maximum and Minimum Sums**:
   - While traversing, maintain two variables to track the maximum and minimum price sums encountered.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
   - Use a recursive DFS function to explore each node and update the maximum and minimum sums.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

void dfs(const vector<vector<int>>& adj, const vector<int>& price, int node, int parent, long long currentSum, long long& maxSum, long long& minSum) {
    // Add the price of the current node to the current sum
    currentSum += price[node];
    
    // Check if it's a leaf node (no child other than parent)
    bool isLeaf = true;
    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (neighbor != parent) {
            isLeaf = false;
            dfs(adj, price, neighbor, node, currentSum, maxSum, minSum);
        }
    }
    
    if (isLeaf) {
        // Update maxSum and minSum if it's a leaf node
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
        minSum = min(minSum, currentSum);
    }
}

int maxMinPriceDifference(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& price) {
    // Number of nodes
    int n = price.size();
    
    // Adjacency list representation of the tree
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    // Variables to store the maximum and minimum price sum
    long long maxSum = LLONG_MIN;
    long long minSum = LLONG_MAX;
    
    // Start DFS from the root node (0) with initial currentSum as 0
    dfs(adj, price, 0, -1, 0, maxSum, minSum);
    
    // Return the difference between maximum and minimum price sum
    return maxSum - minSum;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node and edge is traversed once in the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, primarily due to the adjacency list and recursion stack in DFS, which can go up to `O(n)` in case of a skewed tree.

By this strategy, the implementation computes the required difference efficiently using a depth-first traversal of the tree structure.
