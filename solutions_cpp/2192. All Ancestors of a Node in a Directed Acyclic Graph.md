[Leetcode 2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2192)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` denotes a directed edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i`.

Return a list `answer`, where `answer[i]` is a list of all the nodes that are ancestors of the `i`-th node, sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - `n` is the number of nodes and is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
   - `edges` is a list of pairs, and each pair has two distinct nodes `[from_i, to_i]`.
   - No cycles exist in the graph (DAG property).

2. **Output Format**:
   - `answer` should be a list of `n` lists, with each sublist containing the sorted list of ancestors for the corresponding node.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single node graph with no edges.
   - Node with no ancestors.
   - Proper handling of disconnected subgraphs.

### Strategy:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a `vector<vector<int>>` for the adjacency list to store the edges.
   - A `vector<set<int>>` to store ancestors of each node since sets handle duplicate entries and allow for easy insertion and retrieval in sorted order.
   - A `queue<int>` for processing nodes in topological order using Kahn's algorithm (BFS).

2. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Calculate the indegree of each node.
   - Initialize a queue with nodes having an indegree of zero.
   - Use BFS to process each node and update ancestors for its children.

3. **Ancestor Tracking**:
   - For each node processed, add it to the ancestor list of its children.
   - Transfer the ancestors of the current node to its children.
   - Use sets for storing ancestors to maintain order and uniqueness.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getAncestors(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        vector<int> indegree(n, 0);
        
        // Build the graph and calculate indegrees
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            indegree[edge[1]]++;
        }
        
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        vector<set<int>> ancestors(n);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                ancestors[neighbor].insert(node);
                ancestors[neighbor].insert(ancestors[node].begin(), ancestors[node].end());
                
                if (--indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        vector<vector<int>> result(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result[i] = vector<int>(ancestors[i].begin(), ancestors[i].end());
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Graph Construction**:
  - Building the adjacency list and computing indegrees: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.

- **Topological Sorting and Processing**:
  - Each node and edge is processed once: O(V + E).

- **Ancestor Propagation**:
  - Since each ancestor set is propagated in O(log k) insertion time complexity (using sets), and in the worst case, all nodes may be ancestors to each other, this step has a complexity of O(V * E * log V).

- **Overall**:
  - The overall complexity considering all steps is O(V + E + V * E * log V).

This approach ensures that each ancestor list is retrieved in sorted order and handles the DAG properties correctly.
