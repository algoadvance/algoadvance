[Leetcode 2932. Maximum Strong Pair XOR I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2932)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, find two integers `a` and `b` from the array such that the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` is maximized. Return the maximum XOR value.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the integers in the array?**
   - Typically, array values are within the range of standard 32-bit integers, i.e., from `-2^31` to `2^31-1` unless stated otherwise.
   
2. **Is the array guaranteed to have at least two elements?**
   - Let's assume the array always contains at least two elements since we need at least two numbers to calculate the XOR.

3. **Can the integers in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, we should assume integers can be both positive and negative.

4. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - For the purpose of this question, let's assume the array size (`n`) can be reasonably large, up to `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Naive Approach:**
   - Compare all pairs and calculate their XOR values. Track the maximum XOR value found.
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n^2)\) which might be infeasible for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach using Trie:**
   - Utilize a Trie data structure to store binary representations of numbers.
   - For each number, insert it into the Trie and then for each bit of the current number, try to find the opposite bit in the Trie to maximize the XOR.
   - This approach leverages bitwise properties and tries to minimize the maximum possible outcome with the right combination of bits.

### Code

Here is the implementation using the Trie optimization:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[2];
    TrieNode() {
        children[0] = children[1] = nullptr;
    }
};

class Trie {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
public:
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    void insert(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        // Insert each bit to the Trie
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; --i) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (!node->children[bit]) {
                node->children[bit] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[bit];
        }
    }

    int getMaxXOR(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        int max_xor = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; --i) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (node->children[1 - bit]) {
                max_xor |= (1 << i);
                node = node->children[1 - bit];
            } else {
                node = node->children[bit];
            }
        }
        return max_xor;
    }
};

int findMaximumXOR(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    Trie trie;
    int max_xor = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        trie.insert(num);
        max_xor = std::max(max_xor, trie.getMaxXOR(num));
    }
    return max_xor;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8};
    std::cout << "Maximum XOR: " << findMaximumXOR(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion into Trie:** \(O(N \cdot L)\)
- **Finding Maximum XOR:** \(O(N \cdot L)\)
  - where \(L\) is the number of bits necessary to represent the integers (usually 32 bits).
- **Overall Complexity:** \(O(N \cdot L)\), which is efficient for large arrays compared to the \(O(N^2)\) naive approach.

Each number is inserted into the Trie and checked for maximum XOR, resulting in a relatively optimal and feasible solution.
