[Leetcode 2977. Minimum Cost to Convert String II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2977)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, we want to convert it into a palindrome with the minimum cost. The operations allowed for the conversion are:
- Remove one character from the string. (cost = 1)
- Remove all characters of a specific character from the string. (cost = Frequency of the character in the string)

You need to return the minimum cost to convert `s` into a palindrome.

Example:
- Input: `s = "abcb"`
- Output: `2`
  
Explanation:
1. Remove character 'a' -> cost = 1
2. Remove character 'b' -> cost = 1
Total cost = 1 + 1 = 2

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the cost of removal depend on the frequency of the character in the entire string or just the continuous sequence before removal?
2. Can we remove the characters in any order?
3. Are we allowed to remove characters iteratively and check again?

Assuming that:
- The cost of removal for each character individually is 1.
- Removing a character and removing all occurrences of it is allowed.
- The goal is to make the string a palindrome using these operations.

## Strategy

1. **Define a Helper Function:** To determine whether a given substring is a palindrome.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to convert each substring to a palindrome.
    - `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum cost to convert the substring `s[i:j+1]` to a palindrome.
3. **Cost Calculation:** Update the DP values considering all possible splits and operations on substrings.

## Code

Here's the code implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

bool isPalindrome(string &s, int i, int j) {
    while (i < j) {
        if (s[i] != s[j]) return false;
        i++;
        j--;
    }
    return true;
}

int minCostToConvertPalindrome(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    
    // Base case: Single character is always a palindrome, cost is 0.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i][i] = 0;
    }
    
    // Length of substring varies from 2 to n
    for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            if (isPalindrome(s, i, j)) {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            } else {
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n-1];
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    cout << minCostToConvertPalindrome(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution:

- The nested loops execute `O(n^2)` times. For each iteration, they compute the palindrome check in `O(n)` in the worst case.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^3)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(n^2)` to store the dynamic programming table `dp`.

This solution efficiently finds the minimum cost to convert the given string into a palindrome using the defined operations.
