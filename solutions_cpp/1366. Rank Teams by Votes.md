[Leetcode 1366. Rank Teams by Votes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1366)
## Problem Statement

In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the votes of the second position to resolve the conflict, and so on. If two or more teams are still tied, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Given an array of strings `votes` which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system described above.

**Example:**
```
Input: votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
Output: "ACB"
Explanation: 
Team A was chosen as the first position three times, teams B and C were each chosen as the first position one time.
Since A has the most votes for the first position, A comes first.
By the second position, C has the most votes for the second position, so C comes second.
Finally, B comes third.
```

**Constraints:**
1. `1 <= votes.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= votes[i].length <= 26`
3. votes[i].length == votes[j].length for all `i`, `j`.
4. votes[i] contains only uppercase English letters.
5. All characters in `votes[i]` are unique.
6. All the characters that occur in `votes[i]` also occur in `votes[j]` for all `i`, `j`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any specific constraints on the number of teams in each vote?
    - Each vote string will have the same number of teams and will be unique and valid as per the problem constraints.
2. Should the result string contain all the teams, even if some teams have no first-position votes?
    - Yes, the result string should contain all the teams sorted as per the described ranking system.
3. Can we assume the input to always be valid and within given constraints?
    - Yes, we can assume the input is valid and adheres to the constraints mentioned.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a Ranking Matrix:** Use a dictionary where each key is a team and each value is a list of counts for each ranking position.
2. **Count Votes:** For each vote string, update the respective counts in the ranking matrix.
3. **Sort Teams:** Sort the teams based on the ranking matrix. If counts are the same, sort alphabetically.

## Code

Here's the C++ code implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

std::string rankTeams(std::vector<std::string>& votes) {
    if (votes.empty()) return "";
    
    int num_teams = votes[0].size();
    std::unordered_map<char, std::vector<int>> team_rank_count;
    
    // Initialize the ranking matrix
    for (char team : votes[0]) {
        team_rank_count[team] = std::vector<int>(num_teams, 0);
    }
    
    // Count the votes
    for (const std::string& vote : votes) {
        for (int i = 0; i < vote.size(); ++i) {
            team_rank_count[vote[i]][i]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Create a list of teams
    std::vector<char> teams(votes[0].begin(), votes[0].end());
    
    // Define a custom comparator for sorting
    auto compare = [&](char a, char b) {
        for (int i = 0; i < num_teams; ++i) {
            if (team_rank_count[a][i] != team_rank_count[b][i]) {
                return team_rank_count[a][i] > team_rank_count[b][i];
            }
        }
        return a < b; // If all counts are equal, sort alphabetically
    };
    
    // Sort teams based on the comparator
    std::sort(teams.begin(), teams.end(), compare);
    
    // Convert sorted teams to a result string
    return std::string(teams.begin(), teams.end());
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> votes = {"ABC", "ACB", "ABC", "ACB", "ACB"};
    std::cout << rankTeams(votes) << std::endl; // Output: "ACB"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- **Initialization of the ranking matrix:** O(n), where n is the number of teams.
- **Counting votes:** O(v * n), where v is the number of votes and n is the number of teams.
- **Sorting teams:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the number of teams.
- Overall: **O(v * n + n log n)**
