[Leetcode 902. Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l902)
## Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array of distinct integers `digits` representing the digits we can use to construct numbers. Return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `N` that can be formed using the digits.

### Example:
- **Input:** `digits = ["1", "3", "5", "7"], N = 100`
- **Output:** `20`

Explanation:
The valid numbers are:
1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 33, 35, 37, 55, 57, 77, 111, 113, 115, 117, 133, 135.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all the elements in `digits` guaranteed to be unique and sorted?
   - Yes, they are distinct and sorted.
2. Is `N` an integer and what is its possible range?
   - Yes, it is an integer. 1 <= `digits.length` <= 9 and 1 <= N <= 10^9.

## Strategy
1. **Length Counting:** 
   - Count all numbers that have fewer digits than `N`.

2. **Prefix Counting for Equal Length:**
   - Count numbers that have the same length as `N` without exceeding it.
   - Use a recursive function to count these numbers by maintaining a prefix that forms the number.

### Steps:
1. Convert `N` to a string to facilitate counting based on lengths of digits.
2. Count numbers of length less than `N`.
3. Use a recursive search to count numbers of the same length as `N` that do not exceed it.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int atMostNGivenDigitSet(vector<string>& digits, int N) {
        string S = to_string(N);
        int n = S.size(), dp[10] = {};
        
        dp[n] = 1;
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (auto d : digits) {
                if (d[0] < S[i])
                    dp[i] += pow(digits.size(), n-i-1);
                else if (d[0] == S[i])
                    dp[i] += dp[i+1];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
            dp[0] += pow(digits.size(), i);
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};

```

## Time Complexity
- **Conversion of N to string** is O(log N).
- **Recursive counting:** 
  - Processing each digit of N involves at most 9 recursive calls (length of digits).
  - For each digit, we try all possible digits (up to 9).
  This results in an overall time complexity of O((log N) * (digits.length)), where log N is the number of digits in N, and digits.length can go up to 9.

Thus, the solution is efficient enough for the given constraints.
