[Leetcode 2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2530)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can remove any element from the list `nums` and add it to your score. Then, you may add the integer that you removed divided by 3 (rounded down) back into the list `nums`. Your goal is to maximize your score after exactly `k` operations.

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How do we handle large numbers?**
   - Since the problem allows for numbers up to `10^9`, and operations may repeatedly divide this by 3, we must handle potential large and decreasing integers efficiently.
   
2. **Is the result to be returned as an integer?**
   - Yes.

3. **Can numbers become zero or negative, and how do we handle them?**
   - Division by 3 should always result in a non-negative integer due to rounding down.

### Strategy

This problem is based on greedy strategy and priority queues (max-heaps). We will use a max-heap to always remove the largest number to maximize our score in each operation.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize a max-heap with negative numbers**: Since C++'s priority queue is a min-heap by default, we'll store negative values to mimic a max-heap.
2. **Perform `k` operations**:
   - Extract the maximum element from the heap.
   - Add the extracted element's absolute value to the score.
   - Calculate the new value to be inserted back into the heap (floor division of the number by 3).
   - Insert this new value back into the heap.
3. **Sum the results and return the score**.

### Code Implementation

Here's the code to implement the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int maxScoreAfterKOperations(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Create a max-heap using negated values
    priority_queue<long long> maxHeap;
    
    // Insert all numbers into the max-heap
    for (int num : nums) {
        maxHeap.push(num);
    }
    
    long long score = 0;
    
    // Perform k operations
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        // Extract the maximum element
        long long maxVal = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        
        // Add its absolute value to the score
        score += maxVal;
        
        // Compute the next value to be added back to the heap
        long long nextVal = maxVal / 3;
        
        // Insert the next value back to the heap
        maxHeap.push(nextVal);
    }
    
    return score;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30};
    int k = 3;
    cout << "Maximal Score: " << maxScoreAfterKOperations(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

**Initialization**:
- Building the max-heap initially with `n` elements takes `O(n)` time.

**Operations**:
- Each of the `k` operations includes a `pop` and a `push` operation on the heap.
- Each `pop` and `push` operation in a heap of size `n` takes `O(log n)` time.

**Overall**:
- Total time complexity: `O(n + k log n)`

This should be efficient enough given the constraints.
