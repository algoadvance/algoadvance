[Leetcode 1329. Sort the Matrix Diagonally](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1329)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` matrix `mat`, sort each matrix diagonal in ascending order and return the resulting matrix.

A matrix diagonal is a diagonal line of cells starting from some cell in either the topmost row or leftmost column and going in the bottom-right direction until it reaches the matrix's end.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Ensure that the matrix's values and dimensions are as expected. Can we assume that the matrix is always non-empty and that all rows are of the same length?
2. **Output Format**: Should the returned result be a new matrix, or should the original matrix be modified in place?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the matrix dimensions (e.g., 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 100)?

Given that the problem is direct, these clarifying questions cover the primary concerns.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Diagonals**:
    - Diagonals can be identified by their starting points. For any diagonal, if we start at `mat[i][j]`, the next element on the diagonal would be `mat[i+1][j+1]`.

2. **Sort Diagonals**:
    - To sort, we would first collect all elements on each diagonal into a list, sort this list, and then put them back into their respective positions.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
    - Loop through the starting positions of all diagonals (start from the first column and then the top row).
    - Extract elements of each diagonal.
    - Sort the extracted elements.
    - Rewrite the sorted elements back into their positions.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> diagonalSort(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        
        // Diagonals can be mapped by (i - j)
        map<int, vector<int>> diagMap;
        
        // Populate the map with diagonals
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                diagMap[i - j].push_back(mat[i][j]);
            }
        }
        
        // Sort each diagonal in the map
        for (auto& diag : diagMap) {
            sort(diag.second.begin(), diag.second.end());
        }
        
        // Write sorted diagonals back to the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                mat[i][j] = diagMap[i - j].back();
                diagMap[i - j].pop_back();
            }
        }
        
        return mat;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Extracting Elements**: O(m * n), as we traverse each element.
- **Sorting Diagonals**: Sorting each diagonal which can be at most `min(m, n)` elements long:
  - Sorting time for each diagonal is O(min(m, n) * log(min(m, n))),
  - There are `m + n - 1` diagonals in total.
- **Writing Back Sorted Elements**: O(m * n).

Overall time complexity is **O(m * n * log(min(m, n)))**, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is efficient for the given problem constraints and should work well for typical test cases.
