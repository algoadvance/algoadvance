## Problem Statement

**2857. Count Pairs of Points With Distance**

Given an integer `k` and an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of every `i-th` point on a 2D plane, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` for which the Euclidean distance between `points[i]` and `points[j]` is exactly `k`.

### Key Points:
1. The input array `points` can have up to `10^4` points.
2. The Euclidean distance between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is \(\sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}\).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the value range of `k`?**
   - Assumed to be a non-negative integer.

2. **What are the coordinates' range?**
   - Assumed to be within the range of standard 2D grid limits (ex. \([-10^4, 10^4]\)).

3. **Should the distance be an integer?**
   - Yes, and must be exactly `k`.

4. **Can we have duplicate points?**
   - Yes.

5. **Are `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` considered same pair or different?**
   - Assuming they are the same pair.

## Strategy

To check for the distance between any two points, the Euclidean distance formula can be used:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \]
For this distance to be exactly `k`, the above formula should be simplified and checked as:
\[ k^2 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 \]

### Steps:
1. Iterate through each pair of points in the array.
2. For each pair, calculate the squared distance.
3. Check if the squared distance equals `k^2`.
4. Count such pairs.

Given the constraint `10^4` points, this results in a quadratic time complexity of O(n^2), which should be acceptable.

## Code

Here's how this can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairsWithDistanceK(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int kSquared = k * k;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.size(); ++j) {
                int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
                int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
                int distSquared = (x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1);
                if (distSquared == kSquared) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above approach is:
- **O(n^2)**: Due to the nested loops checking each pair of points.
  - The space complexity is **O(1)** since no additional space is used that scales with input size.

This approach should be efficient for the given constraints, as \( n \) can be at most \( 10^4 \).
