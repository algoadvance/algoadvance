[Leetcode 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2140)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [points_i, brainpower_i]`.

- `points_i` is the points you get for solving the ith question.
- `brainpower_i` is the number of subsequent questions that you will skip after solving the ith question. 

For example, if you solve question `i`, you will earn `points_i` points but you will be forced to skip the next `brainpower_i` questions. 

Return the maximum points you can earn starting from the first question.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the array will always have at least one question?
   - Yes.
2. Are there any constraints on the values of `points_i` and `brainpower_i`?
   - The values of `points_i` and `brainpower_i` can be reasonably large but within typical problem constraints.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming to decide the optimal set of questions to answer to maximize the total points. 

#### Steps:

1. **Define State**:
   Let `dp[i]` be the maximum points that can be obtained from the `i-th` question to the end.

2. **State Transition**:
   - If we solve the `i-th` question, we gain `points[i]` points and move to question `i + brainpower[i] + 1`.
   - If we skip the `i-th` question, we move to the next question and the points remain `dp[i + 1]`.

   The transition relation can be defined as:
   \[
   dp[i] = \max(\text{points}[i] + dp[i + \text{brainpower}[i] + 1], dp[i + 1])
   \]

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `i` is beyond the last question, return 0 because no points can be earned from non-existent questions.

4. **Result**:
   - Start from the first question and compute the result using the `dp` array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    long long mostPoints(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& questions) {
        int n = questions.size();
        std::vector<long long> dp(n + 1, 0);
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int next_index = i + questions[i][1] + 1;
            long long solve_current = questions[i][0] + (next_index < n ? dp[next_index] : 0);
            long long skip_current = dp[i + 1];
            dp[i] = std::max(solve_current, skip_current);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of questions. Each question is considered once, and the subsequent state transition is computed in constant time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) for the `dp` array which stores the maximum points achievable from each question index to the end.
