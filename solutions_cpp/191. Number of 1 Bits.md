[Leetcode 191. Number of 1 Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l191)
### Problem Statement
Write a function `hammingWeight` that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the range of the input integer?
    - The input is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
2. **Output**: What should be the output for an integer with no '1' bits?
    - The output should be `0`.
3. **Edge Cases**: Do we need to handle negative input values?
    - Since the input is an unsigned integer, there are no negative numbers.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem in several ways, but the most straightforward method is to iterate through each bit of the number and count the number of '1' bits.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a count to `0`.
2. Iterate through all 32 bits of the integer.
3. For each bit, check if it is '1':
   - Perform a bitwise AND operation with `1`.
   - If the result is `1`, increment the count.
4. Right shift the integer by one position.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all bits have been checked.
6. Return the count.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count += (n & 1);  // Increment count if the last bit is 1
            n >>= 1;           // Right shift n by 1 
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    uint32_t n = 11;  // Example input: binary representation of 11 is 1011
    std::cout << "Number of 1 bits: " << sol.hammingWeight(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the number of iterations is fixed (32 times) for a 32-bit integer. Each operation inside the loop is constant time.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are only using a few integer variables for counting and bit manipulation without any additional data structures.
