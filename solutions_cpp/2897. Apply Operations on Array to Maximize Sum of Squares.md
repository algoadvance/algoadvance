[Leetcode 2897. Apply Operations on Array to Maximize Sum of Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2897)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, perform a series of operations to maximize the sum of squares of the array elements. In one operation, you can increment any single element of the array `nums` by `1`. Perform exactly `k` such operations.

Return the maximum sum of squares possible after applying exactly `k` operations.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], k = 3
Output: 29
Explanation:
- Incrementing any element by 1: [1, 2, 4] with sum of squares = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21
- Incrementing two elements by 1: [1, 3, 4] with sum of squares = 1 + 9 + 16 = 26
- Incrementing three elements by 1: [2, 3, 4] with sum of squares = 4 + 9 + 16 = 29 -> maximum possible.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values in the array nums?**
   - Generally, constraints will define integer limits or specific ranges.

2. **Is there any constraint on the value of k?**
   - Typically `k` would be a non-negative integer with some upper bound.

3. **Can the array nums be empty?**
   - Usually for such problems, the array would not be empty, but it's good to confirm.

To keep this explanation concise, let's assume typical constraints:
- The elements of `nums` are in the range \([1, 10^4]\).
- \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
- \(1 \leq \text{len(nums)} \leq 10^5\).

### Strategy

To maximize the sum of squares, we should focus on incrementing the smallest elements first. Using a min-heap can help us efficiently track and increment the smallest element.

**Steps:**
1. Create a min-heap from the array `nums`.
2. Perform `k` operations, where in each operation:
   - Extract the smallest element from the heap.
   - Increment this element by 1.
   - Push the incremented value back into the heap.
3. Calculate the sum of squares of the transformed array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int maximizeSumOfSquares(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Min-heap to always increment the smallest element
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    // Perform k increments
    while (k--) {
        int smallest = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        minHeap.push(smallest + 1);
    }

    // Compute the sum of squares
    long long sumOfSquares = 0;
    while (!minHeap.empty()) {
        int num = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        sumOfSquares += static_cast<long long>(num) * num;  // Use long long to prevent overflow
    }

    return static_cast<int>(sumOfSquares);
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    int k = 3;
    cout << maximizeSumOfSquares(nums, k) << endl;  // Output: 29
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the initial heap:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Each heap operation:** \(O(\log n)\).
- **Total for `k` operations:** \(O(k \log n)\).
- **Final computation of the sum of squares:** \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(k \log n + n)\). Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough.

This solution will efficiently handle the problem within the constraints typically expected from similar problems.
