[Leetcode 1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1190)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses. The task is to reverse the characters in each pair of matching parentheses in the string. You need to return the resulting string after all the characters inside the parentheses have been reversed.

Here are the constraints to consider:
- 0 <= s.length <= 2000
- s only contains lowercase English letters and parentheses.
- It's guaranteed that all parentheses are balanced.

## Clarifying Questions

Before we start with the solution, let's clarify some points:
1. **Nested Parentheses:** What should happen with nested parentheses? (All inner substrings should be reversed first)
2. **Empty Parentheses:** How should empty parentheses be handled? (They should be simply removed)

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the positions of the parentheses and reverse the substrings as we encounter closing parentheses. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. Traverse through the string.
2. Use a stack to store the index of every opening parenthesis `(` encountered.
3. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis `)`, pop the last index of `(` from the stack and reverse the substring that is within these parentheses.
4. Continue this process until the entire string is processed.
5. Remove all parentheses from the final reversed string.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string reverseParentheses(string s) {
        stack<int> st;
        string result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                st.push(i);
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                int start = st.top();
                st.pop();
                reverse(s.begin() + start + 1, s.begin() + i);
            }
        }
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c != '(' && c != ')') {
                result += c;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for the above solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.

- The traversal of the string takes \(O(n)\) time.
- Each reversal operation inside the parentheses also takes \(O(n)\) time in total over the entire string because each character is reversed at most once.

Thus, the overall time complexity remains \(O(n)\).

In conclusion, this solution efficiently uses a stack to handle nested structures and ensures that all reversals are conducted correctly and in the required order.
