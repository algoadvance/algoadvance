[Leetcode 3036. Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3036)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, count the number of subarrays that can be rearranged to match a given pattern `target`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the elements in `nums` and `target` integers?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Can both `nums` and `target` contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, both can contain duplicates.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and `target`?**
   - Usually, constraints would be provided; however, for optimal solutions, let's assume `nums` can be large.

4. **Is the length of `target` guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of `nums`?**
   - Yes, for a valid subarray check, it should be shorter or equal to `nums`.

5. **Should the output be the number of such subarrays?**
   - Yes, the output should be the count of subarrays that can be rearranged to match `target`.

## Strategy

To determine if a subarray can be rearranged to match the pattern `target`, we can consider the following:

1. **Use Frequency Counters:** Maintain frequency counters for elements in the `target` and for the current window in `nums`.
   
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use the sliding window of size equal to the length of `target` to check each possible subarray in `nums`.
   
3. **Compare Frequency Counters:** If the frequency counter of the current window matches that of `target`, it indicates that the subarray can be rearranged to match `target`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int countSubarraysWithTargetPattern(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& target) {
    unordered_map<int, int> targetCount;
    unordered_map<int, int> windowCount;
    int targetLength = target.size();
    int numCount = nums.size();
    int matchCount = 0; // To store the result

    // Create the frequency map for target
    for (int num : target) {
        targetCount[num]++;
    }

    // First window initialization
    for (int i = 0; i < targetLength; i++) {
        windowCount[nums[i]]++;
    }

    // Compare the first window
    if (windowCount == targetCount) {
        matchCount++;
    }

    // Slide the window over the nums array
    for (int i = targetLength; i < numCount; i++) {
        windowCount[nums[i]]++; // Add the next element to the window
        windowCount[nums[i - targetLength]]--; // Remove the first element of the previous window

        if (windowCount[nums[i - targetLength]] == 0) {
            windowCount.erase(nums[i - targetLength]);
        }

        // Compare the current window with target frequency map
        if (windowCount == targetCount) {
            matchCount++;
        }
    }

    return matchCount;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> target = {4, 2, 3};
    cout << "Number of subarrays that can be rearranged to match pattern: " << countSubarraysWithTargetPattern(nums, target) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Constructing the frequency map for `target`:** O(m) where `m` is the length of `target`.
- **Initializing the first window's frequency map:** O(m).
- **Sliding the window across `nums`:** O(n - m) where `n` is the length of `nums`. Each slide operation involving an insert and a delete operation is O(1).

- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the length of `nums`.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently and effectively count the number of valid subarrays.
