[Leetcode 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1823)
### Problem Statement

You are given the number of people, `n`, and an integer, `k`. You have to determine the winner of the game.

The game is played as follows:

1. Start with the first person and count `k` people clockwise (including the starting person).
2. The person you land on is removed from the circle and the count begins again from the next person.
3. This process is repeated until only one person remains, who is the winner.

Return the winner of the game.

### Example
```
Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3

Input: n = 6, k = 5
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the values for `n` and `k`?
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`.

2. What should the function return in the case of invalid inputs?
   - Assume the inputs will always be within the specified constraints.

3. Should the function handle large values of `k` efficiently?
   - Yes, the size of `k` can be large, but the problem can be solved efficiently using modular arithmetic.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using the concept of the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is a theoretical model of a certain counting-out game.

For the Josephus problem:
- The position of the last person standing can be computed recursively.

The recursive relation is as follows:
- `Josephus(n, k) = (Josephus(n - 1, k) + k) % n`
- Base case: `Josephus(1, k) = 0`, since there is only one person left.

We can build this iteratively from the base case to avoid stack overflow issues with recursion for large values.

The final position would be adjusted for `0`-indexing.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the Josephus Problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        int winner = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // For each i, compute position as per Josephus problem relation
            winner = (winner + k) % i;
        }
        // Return adjusted to 1-indexed position
        return winner + 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 5;
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << "The winner is: " << solution.findTheWinner(n, k) << std::endl; // Output should be 3

    n = 6;
    k = 5;
    std::cout << "The winner is: " << solution.findTheWinner(n, k) << std::endl; // Output should be 1

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`. We iterate from `1` to `n` to calculate the winner. This is efficient enough for the problem constraints.

### Explanation

1. Initialize `winner` to `0`, which corresponds to the base case of the Josephus problem.
2. Iterate through `1` to `n` and update `winner` using the relation `(winner + k) % i`.
3. The final result needs to be adjusted for the problemâ€™s requirement of `1`-indexed results. Therefore, we return `winner + 1`.
