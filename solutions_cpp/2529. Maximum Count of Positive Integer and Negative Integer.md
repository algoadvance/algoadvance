[Leetcode 2529. Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2529)
### Problem Statement

The problem is about counting the number of positive and negative integers in a given array and returning the maximum count between these two counts.

You are given an array `nums` that may contain positive integers, negative integers, and zeros. You need to return the maximum of the counts of positive integers and negative integers in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain zero?**
   Yes, the array can contain zero, but zero is neither positive nor negative, so it should not be counted in either category.

2. **What is the range of numbers in the array?**
   The problem does not specify the exact range, but typically it could be any 32-bit integer.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the array?**
   The problem statement does not specify constraints, but typically LeetCode problems assume the array can have up to \(10^5\) elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can simply iterate through the array and maintain two counters:
- One to count the number of positive integers.
- Another to count the number of negative integers.

After traversing the array, we compare these two counters and return the maximum value.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumCount(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int positiveCount = 0;
        int negativeCount = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                ++positiveCount;
            } else if (num < 0) {
                ++negativeCount;
            }
        }

        return std::max(positiveCount, negativeCount);
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution solution;
//     std::vector<int> nums = {-1, -2, -3, 0, 1, 2, 3};
//     int result = solution.maximumCount(nums);
//     std::cout << "Maximum count of positive or negative integers: " << result << std::endl;
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once to count the positives and negatives. 

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space (only a few integer variables for counting).

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently and correctly.
