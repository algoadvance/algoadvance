[Leetcode 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l703)
# Problem Statement
You need to design a class to find the Kth largest element in a stream. The class should have the following components:

- A constructor that takes an integer `k` and an array of integers `nums`.
- A method `int add(int val)` that appends the integer `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the Kth largest element in the stream.

# Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input array `nums` always sorted?**
   - No, `nums` may be unsorted.
2. **Can `nums` be empty?**
   - Yes, `nums` can be empty.
3. **Can `k` be greater than the length of `nums`?**
   - Yes, `k` can be greater than the length of `nums`. At any point in time, if the number of elements in the list is less than `k`, the Kth largest element will be the smallest value (`INT_MIN` can be used in this implementation).

# Strategy
To efficiently manage the Kth largest element in a stream, use a min-heap (priority queue in C++). The heap will have a size of at most `k`. 

- **Initialization**: Populate the heap with at most `k` elements from the input array `nums`.
- **Adding Elements**: For each new element, if the heap is not full (contains fewer than `k` elements), push it into the heap. Otherwise, compare it with the smallest element in the min-heap. If it is larger than the smallest (top of the heap), pop the smallest element and insert the new element.

This ensures that the heap contains the `k` largest elements seen so far, with the smallest of these `k` elements at the top, which is the Kth largest element.

# Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class KthLargest {
private:
    int k;
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;
    
public:
    KthLargest(int k, std::vector<int>& nums) {
        this->k = k;
        for (int num : nums) {
            add(num);
        }
    }
    
    int add(int val) {
        if (minHeap.size() < k) {
            minHeap.push(val);
        } else if (val > minHeap.top()) {
            minHeap.pop();
            minHeap.push(val);
        }
        return minHeap.top();
    }
};
```

# Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`KthLargest` constructor)**: O(N log k), where N is the number of elements in the initial array `nums`. Each insertion into the heap takes O(log k) time.
- **Adding Element (`add` method)**: O(log k), as we may need to insert the element into the heap or replace the smallest element.

This approach ensures efficient handling of each new element while maintaining the kth largest result.
