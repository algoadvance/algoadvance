[Leetcode 1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1723)
## Problem Statement
You are given `n` jobs and `k` workers. Each job requires **time[i]** amount of time to complete, where **time[i]** is the time required by the `i-th` job. Each worker can be assigned any number of jobs but a worker can only work on one job at a time. Find the minimum possible maximum working time of any worker, which is the minimum time such that all jobs can be completed.

### Example:
```
Input: time = [3, 2, 3], k = 3
Output: 3

Input: time = [1, 2, 4, 7, 8], k = 2
Output: 11
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Does each worker have the same efficiency?** 
   - Yes, each worker has the same efficiency and can process one job at a time.
2. **Can jobs be split between workers?**
   - No, each job has to be assigned entirely to one worker.
3. **Is there any constraint on the number of jobs relative to the number of workers?**
   - Typically, we assume `n >= k` since assigning zero jobs to any worker would be unnecessary to consider for minimum maximum working time.

## Strategy
- We need to minimize the maximum working time amongst all workers.
- We can use a binary search method to determine the possible minimum maximum working time.
- We will use a helper function to check if a given maximum working time is feasible by utilizing Depth-First Search (DFS).

### Steps:
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Define the search range for the maximum working time. The lower bound is the maximum job time (because the heaviest job can't be split), the upper bound is the sum of all job times (one worker does all jobs).
   
2. **Feasibility Check using DFS**:
   - Try to assign jobs to workers and check if the assignment can be done such that no worker surpasses the current assumed maximum working time.
   - Use an array to track cumulative job times assigned to each worker.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinishWork(int maxTime, const std::vector<int>& jobs, std::vector<int>& workers, int k, int idx) {
        if (idx == jobs.size()) return true;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            if (workers[i] + jobs[idx] <= maxTime) {
                workers[i] += jobs[idx];
                if (canFinishWork(maxTime, jobs, workers, k, idx + 1)) return true;
                workers[i] -= jobs[idx];
            }
            if (workers[i] == 0) break; // No point in giving the job to another worker who is currently idle
        }
        return false;
    }

    int minimumTimeRequired(std::vector<int>& jobs, int k) {
        std::sort(jobs.rbegin(), jobs.rend()); // Sort jobs in descending order
        int left = *std::max_element(jobs.begin(), jobs.end());
        int right = std::accumulate(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), 0);
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            std::vector<int> workers(k, 0);
            if (canFinishWork(mid, jobs, workers, k, 0)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` for sorting the jobs.
- **Binary Search**: The number of iterations is `log S` where `S` is the total sum of the job times.
- **DFS Check**: The complexity is `O(k^n)` in the worst case but gets effectively reduced due to pruning mentioned in the feasibility checks.

Thus, the overall complexity can be approximated as `O(n log n + log S * k^n)`. However, due to pruning and the sorted order of jobs, effective runs are much faster than the theoretical worst case.
