[Leetcode 2475. Number of Unequal Triplets in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2475)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers `nums`. A triplet of indices `(i, j, k)` is called **unequal** if:
```
0 <= i < j < k < nums.length, and
nums[i], nums[j], and nums[k] are pairwise distinct.
```
Return the number of unequal triplets in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicate values?**
   Yes, the array can contain positive integers, and duplicates are allowed.
   
2. **What is the expected range of the array length and the values in it?**
   The length of `nums` will be between 1 and 1000, and each integer in `nums` will be between 1 and 1000.
   
3. **How should the function behave if the array length is less than 3?**
   If the length of `nums` is less than 3, it should return 0, as it's not possible to form a triplet.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: If the length of `nums` is less than 3, return 0 immediately.
2. **Brute Force Approach**: Iterate through all possible triplets using three nested loops and check if the elements are distinct.
3. **Count Valid Combos**: For each valid triplet, where the elements at indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are distinct, increment a counter.
4. **Return the Counter** after iterating through all possible triplets.

This brute-force approach is feasible given the constraints (0 <= len(nums) <= 1000), making the maximum number of combinations \( \binom{1000}{3} \approx 166,167,000 \), which should be manageable.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int unequalTriplets(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n < 3) return 0;
    
    int count = 0;
    
    // Iterate through all possible triplets
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                if (nums[i] != nums[j] && nums[j] != nums[k] && nums[i] != nums[k]) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst-case Time Complexity**: \( O(n^3) \)
  - Three nested loops each iterating through elements based on `n` length of `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)
  - We are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

The brute force approach should be acceptable given the constraints and allows us to directly count and verify the distinct property required for the triplets.
