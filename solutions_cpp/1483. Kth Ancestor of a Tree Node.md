[Leetcode 1483. Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1483)
## Problem Statement

Given a tree with `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, you are asked queries about its K-th ancestor. The tree is rooted at node `0`. The K-th ancestor of a tree node `u` is defined as the ancestor who is `K` edges away from `u` in the path from `u` to the root.

Implement the `TreeAncestor` class:

- `TreeAncestor(int n, vector<int>& parent)`:
  * Initializes the object with the number of nodes in the tree and the parent array, where `parent[i]` is the parent of `i`.
- `int getKthAncestor(int node, int k)`:
  * Returns the k-th ancestor of the given node `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Structure**: Is it guaranteed that the input will always represent a valid tree structure?
2. **Ancestor Requests**: Is there a limit on the number of ancestor queries (`getKthAncestor` calls)?
3. **Parent array**: Can `parent[0]` be relied upon always being `-1` since the root node has no parent?

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, especially for multiple queries, we can use binary lifting technique which preprocesses the tree and allows query answers in `O(log N)` time. Here are the steps:

1. **Preprocessing with Binary Lifting**:
   - Create an up table `up[i][j]`, where `up[i][j]` is the 2^j-th ancestor of node `i`.
   - Fill the table using the parent array and then compute ancestors for higher powers of two.

2. **Querying with Binary Lifting**:
   - For each query, use the `up` table to jump through ancestors in powers of two, effectively reducing the problem size every jump.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class TreeAncestor {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> up;
    int LOG; // Maximum power of two we consider
    
    TreeAncestor(int n, vector<int>& parent) {
        LOG = log2(n) + 1;
        up = vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(LOG, -1));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            up[i][0] = parent[i]; // The direct parent
        }
        
        // Precompute up using binary lifting technique
        for (int j = 1; j < LOG; ++j) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (up[i][j-1] != -1) {
                    up[i][j] = up[up[i][j-1]][j-1];
                } else {
                    up[i][j] = -1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) {
        for (int j = 0; j < LOG; ++j) {
            if ((k & (1 << j)) > 0) {
                node = up[node][j];
                if (node == -1) return -1; // Early stopping if no such ancestor exists
            }
        }
        return node;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: `O(n log n)`. Each node fills a part of the `up` table independently.
- **Querying**: `O(log k) = O(log n)`. Each query involves at most `log k` jumps through ancestors.

The preprocessing phase ensures that each query is handled very efficiently, making this approach well suited for a large number of ancestor queries.
