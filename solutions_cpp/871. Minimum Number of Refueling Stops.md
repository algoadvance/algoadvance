[Leetcode 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l871)
## Problem Statement
You are driving a vehicle that has a fuel tank with an infinite capacity, but initially contains exactly `startFuel` liters of fuel. There are gas stations along the way where you can refuel. Each station is represented as a pair `(position, fuel)`, indicating that the station is located at `position` miles from the start line and has `fuel` liters of fuel available.

You want to reach a destination that is `target` miles away. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of refueling stops you need to make to reach the destination. If it is not possible to reach the target, return `-1`.

Input:
- `target`: the destination distance in miles.
- `startFuel`: the initial amount of fuel in liters.
- `stations`: a vector of pairs where each pair represents `(position, fuel)`.

Output:
- Return the minimum number of refueling stops needed to reach the target or `-1` if it is not possible.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the stations be at the same position? No, all stations have unique positions.
2. Is the position of the stations sorted in increasing order of distance from the start? Yes.
3. What is the maximum value for `target` and `startFuel`? Both can be up to `10^9`.
4. What is the maximum number of gas stations? Up to `500`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm with a max-heap (priority queue):

1. Start by setting the current fuel to `startFuel`.
2. Iterate through each station in the order they appear.
3. If the current fuel is less than the distance to the next station, refuel from the stations visited so far, using the maximum fuel available first (hence the use of a max-heap).
4. Push the current station's fuel into the max-heap. If you cannot reach the next station because the heap is empty (no fuel stations visited before), return `-1`.

By following the above strategy, we ensure that we are using the least amount of refuel stops and maximizing the fuel available at each step.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& stations) {
        // Max-heap to store the available fuel at visited stations
        std::priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
        int currentFuel = startFuel;
        int numberOfStops = 0;
        int index = 0; // to track station index
        
        while (currentFuel < target) {
            // Check all stations that can be reached with the current fuel
            while (index < stations.size() && stations[index].first <= currentFuel) {
                maxHeap.push(stations[index].second);
                index++;
            }
            
            // If we can't reach the next station and no fuel is available, return -1
            if (maxHeap.empty()) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            // Refuel with the station that provides the maximum fuel
            currentFuel += maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            numberOfStops++;
        }
        
        return numberOfStops;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this algorithm can be analyzed as:
- In the worst case, visiting and pushing each gas station into the heap takes `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of stations.
- Every time we refuel, the worst case is also `O(log N)` because of the max-heap operations.
Thus, the overall Time Complexity is `O(N log N)`.
