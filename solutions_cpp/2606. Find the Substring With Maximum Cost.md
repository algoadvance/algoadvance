[Leetcode 2606. Find the Substring With Maximum Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2606)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`, and an array `values` where the `i-th` element represents the cost of the `i-th` character in the string. Your task is to find the contiguous substring of `s` that has the maximum possible sum of character costs, and return that maximum sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` and the length of the `values` array?
2. **Negative Costs**: Can the `values` array contain negative values?
3. **Empty Substring**: Should we consider the scenario where the substring can be empty resulting in a sum of 0?

### Strategy

We can use the **Kadane's Algorithm** to solve this problem efficiently. This algorithm is commonly used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in an array of integers. 

Here's the general idea:
- Traverse the array `values` while maintaining the current maximum sum (`current_sum`) and the global maximum sum (`max_sum`).
- For each element at position `i`, decide whether to include it in the current subarray or start a new subarray from that position.
- The decision is based on whether adding the current element to the existing subarray's sum would yield a greater sum than starting fresh from the current element.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxSubstringCost(const std::string &s, const std::vector<int> &values) {
    if (s.empty() || values.empty() || s.size() != values.size()) {
        return 0;
    }

    int max_sum = values[0];
    int current_sum = values[0];

    for (size_t i = 1; i < values.size(); ++i) {
        current_sum = std::max(values[i], current_sum + values[i]);
        max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_sum);
    }

    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abcde";
    std::vector<int> values = {1, -2, 3, 5, -3};
    std::cout << "Maximum cost of substring: " << maxSubstringCost(s, values) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s` or the length of the `values` array. This is because we only traverse the array `values` once.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first element, initializing both the `current_sum` and `max_sum` to the first element's value.
2. **Iteration**: For each subsequent element:
   - Calculate the new `current_sum` as the maximum of the current element alone or the current element plus the previous `current_sum`.
   - Update `max_sum` if the new `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.
3. **Return Result**: After iterating through the array, `max_sum` holds the maximum possible sum for any contiguous subarray.

This method ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum without needing nested loops, providing an optimal solution for the problem.
