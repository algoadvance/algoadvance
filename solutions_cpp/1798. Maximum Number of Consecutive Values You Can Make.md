[Leetcode 1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1798)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the values of coins that you have. You can make some value `x` if you can choose some of these coins such that their sum is equal to `x`.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make starting from and including `1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values in the `coins` array?**
   - The values in the `coins` array are positive integers.
   
2. **Can I assume the array `coins` is not empty?**
   - Yes, for this problem, you can assume the array is not empty.
   
3. **Is the array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted, but it can be sorted if needed.

4. **What is the maximum size of the `coins` array (n)?**
   - The maximum length of the `coins` array is not explicitly provided but let's assume it fits in typical programming contest constraints, usually up to a few thousand elements.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: First, we sort the array. This is crucial for the strategy because it allows us to build consecutive sums efficiently.
2. **Greedy Technique**: We maintain a current range of sums that we can make. Initially, we can make the value 0.
3. **Iterate and Expand**: For each coin, if it can extend our current consecutive range of sums, we add it to our current sum range. If we can't use the coin to extend our range, we stop.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumConsecutive(std::vector<int>& coins) {
        std::sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
        int maxConsecutive = 1; // Initially, you can make values up to 0 + 1 - 1 = 1
        
        for (int coin : coins) {
            // If the coin is greater than the current maxConsecutive, we can't use it to extend the range
            if (coin > maxConsecutive) {
                break;
            }
            // Extend the range by adding the value of the current coin
            maxConsecutive += coin;
        }
        
        return maxConsecutive;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the `coins` array is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Iterating**: After sorting, we iterate through the array once, which has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), dominated by the sorting step.

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum number of consecutive values that can be formed starting from 1 using a combination of sorting and a greedy expanding technique.
