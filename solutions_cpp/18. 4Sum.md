[Leetcode 18. 4Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l18)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, are there elements a, b, c, and d in `nums` such that a + b + c + d = `target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of `target`.

**Note:**
- The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

You need to implement a function in C++:

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> fourSum(vector<int>& nums, int target);
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Size Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - Typically constraints can help guide how we approach the problem.
2. **Element Values**: Are there any constraints on the values of integers within the array?
3. **Output Format**: Should the quadruplets be returned in any specific order, or are they just required to be unique?
4. **Duplicates**: Should the solution take into account the possibility of duplicate numbers but ensure unique quadruplets?

Assuming:
- The size of the array `nums` is reasonably small (e.g., ≤ 200).
- The integers can be any value within the typical integer range.
- No specific output order, but results must be unique.

### Strategy:

1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the array to ease the identification of duplicates and manage the two-pointer approach efficiently.
   
2. **Iterative Reduction**: Use a nested loop to fix the first two numbers, and then apply the two-pointer technique to find pairs that match the remaining target for the other two numbers.
   
3. **Avoid Duplicates**: After sorting, skip over duplicate values for both sets of elements (the fixed elements and pair elements).

4. **Two-pointer Technique**: Within the nested loop, use the left and right pointers to find sums efficiently.

### Code:

Here is the complete C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> fourSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int n = nums.size();

    if (n < 4) return result;

    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 3; i++) {
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
            
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 2; j++) {
            if (j > i + 1 && nums[j] == nums[j - 1]) continue;
                
            int left = j + 1;
            int right = n - 1;
                
            while (left < right) {
                long long sum = (long long)nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[left] + nums[right];
                    
                if (sum == target) {
                    result.push_back({nums[i], nums[j], nums[left], nums[right]});
                        
                    while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
                    while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
                        
                    left++;
                    right--;
                } else if (sum < target) {
                    left++;
                } else {
                    right--;
                }
            }
        }
    }
        
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is:

1. **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.
2. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer two loops run `O(n^2)`.
   - The innermost while loop runs in linear time, i.e., `O(n)` in the worst case.
   
Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^3)`. Although this isn't optimal for very large arrays, it is acceptable given reasonable constraints (e.g., `n ≤ 200`).

### Additional Notes:

- Handle cases where integer overflows might occur by using `long long` for sum calculations.
- Ensure to skip duplicates to maintain unique quadruplet results.
