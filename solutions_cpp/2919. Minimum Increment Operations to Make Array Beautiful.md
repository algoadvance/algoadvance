[Leetcode 2919. Minimum Increment Operations to Make Array Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2919)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

You can perform two types of operations on the array any number of times:
1. Increment any element by 1.
2. Increment any element by any positive integer value k to k places ahead in the array.

An array is considered beautiful if for any two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` where `i < j`, `nums[i] < nums[j]`. In other words, the array is strictly increasing.

You need to find the minimum number of operations required to make the array `nums` beautiful.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input array guaranteed to have at least one element?**
   - Yes, the array has at least one element.
2. **Are we limited by the magnitude of the increment operations?**
   - No, increment operations can be as large as necessary.
3. **Can the increment operations be applied to any element of the array?**
   - Yes, you can increment any element of the array any number of times.

## Strategy
To make the array strictly increasing, we need to ensure that for every `i < j`, `nums[i] < nums[j]`. This can be achieved by incrementing the elements where the condition is violated.

1. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
2. For each element, check if it is not larger than the previous element.
3. If it is not, calculate the required increment to make it larger than the previous element.
4. Apply the increment and keep a count of the total increments made.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array, because we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minIncrementForBeautifulArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int operations = 0;
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i-1]) {
            int increment = nums[i-1] - nums[i] + 1;
            nums[i] += increment;
            operations += increment;
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```

## Explanation of the Code
1. **Initialization:** We initialize `operations` to count the total number of increments needed.
2. **Iterate through the Array:**
   - Start from the second element and iterate to the end of the array.
   - For each `i-th` element, check if `nums[i] <= nums[i-1]`.
   - If so, calculate the required increment to make `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`.
   - Increment `nums[i]` and add the increment value to `operations`.
3. **Return the Total Operations:** After processing the entire array, return the total number of increments made.

This approach ensures that the array will be strictly increasing with the minimal number of increment operations.
