[Leetcode 1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1987)
### Problem Statement

Let's consider a binary string, i.e., a string consisting only of '0' and '1'. A subsequence of a binary string is considered "good" if and only if it doesn't contain leading zeros unless it is exactly "0". Given a binary string `binary`, return the number of unique good subsequences in `binary`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range for the binary string?**
   - The length of the binary string can be up to `10^5`.

2. **Can the input string contain only '0's or only '1's?**
   - Yes, the input can consist of only '0's or only '1's.

3. **Should the output consider the subsequence "0" as a valid unique good subsequence if it is exactly "0"?**
   - Yes, the subsequence "0" is considered valid if the entire input string is "0".

4. **What is the definition of a good subsequence?**
   - A good subsequence cannot have leading zeros unless the subsequence is exactly "0".

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We need to count subsequences that are unique and "good".
   - We can utilize a dynamic programming approach or rules based on counting '0's and '1's.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Utilize a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique good subsequences ending at the `i`-th position of the binary string.

3. **Counting Approach:**
   - Maintain two counters: `end_with_0` and `end_with_1` to track subsequences ending with '0' and '1' respectively.
   - Keep an indicator `has_zero` to handle whether a '0' exists to count subsequences like "0".

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Use modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow and conform to the problem constraints.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(std::string binary) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        long long end_with_0 = 0;
        long long end_with_1 = 0;
        bool has_zero = false;
        
        for (char ch : binary) {
            if (ch == '0') {
                has_zero = true;
                end_with_0 = (end_with_0 + end_with_1) % MOD;
            } else {
                end_with_1 = (end_with_0 + end_with_1 + 1) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        // Includes the whole sequence of zeros if any zero is present
        return (end_with_1 + (has_zero ? 1 : 0)) % MOD;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the binary string. We process each character of the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a fixed amount of extra space (counters and boolean flag).

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `end_with_0`, `end_with_1` to zero for counting subsequences.
   - Initialize `has_zero` to false to check if '0' exists.

2. **Iterate through string:**
   - For each '0': update `end_with_0`.
   - For each '1': update `end_with_1`.

3. **Return result:**
   - Result is the sum of `end_with_1` and `1` if there is a `has_zero` subsequence of "0", all taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.
