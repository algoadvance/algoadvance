[Leetcode 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1293)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You are also given an integer `k` representing the maximum number of obstacles you can remove. You need to find the shortest path from the upper-left corner (0,0) to the lower-right corner (m-1, n-1) of the grid that allows you to remove at most `k` obstacles.

Return the length of the shortest path such that you can reach the lower-right corner. If it is not possible to reach the destination within the given constraints, return `-1`.

### Example:
#### Input:
- `grid = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]`
- `k = 1`

#### Output:
- `6`

#### Explanation:
- The shortest path without removing any obstacle is `10`. However, by removing one obstacle at grid[1][1], we can find a path with length `6`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the grid have dimensions of size 0?**
   - No, the grid will have a positive non-zero number of rows and columns.
2. **Are all cell values either 0 or 1?**
   - Yes, each cell is either empty (`0`) or contains an obstacle (`1`).
3. **Can `k` be larger than the number of `1`s in the grid?**
   - Yes, but that should not affect the solution since we can remove only as many obstacles as present in the grid.

## Strategy
1. We will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path, as BFS naturally finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
2. We will use a 3D visited array `visited[x][y][remaining_k]` to track visited states, where `remaining_k` is the number of obstacles that can still be removed at cell `(x, y)`.
3. Starting from `(0, 0)`, we will explore all 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right).
4. For each direction, we will:
   - Check if the next cell is within grid bounds.
   - Check if moving to the next cell with the current number of obstacles removed is a better state.
   - If true, push the new state to the queue.
5. Stop and return the path length when we reach `(m-1, n-1)`; if the queue is empty, return `-1`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        // Directions for moving in the grid
        vector<vector<int>> directions = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        
        // 3D visited array to keep track of visited states
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> visited(m, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(k+1, 0)));
        
        // Queue for BFS: (x, y, current_k, steps)
        queue<tuple<int, int, int, int>> q;
        q.push({0, 0, k, 0});
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y, cur_k, steps] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            // If we reach the bottom-right cell
            if (x == m-1 && y == n-1) {
                return steps;
            }
            
            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0];
                int ny = y + dir[1];
                
                // Check if we are within the grid bounds
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                    int nk = cur_k - grid[nx][ny];
                    
                    // If we can visit the next cell
                    if (nk >= 0 && !visited[nx][ny][nk]) {
                        visited[nx][ny][nk] = 1;
                        q.push({nx, ny, nk, steps + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Not possible to reach the destination
    }
};
```
## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n \times k)\)
   - Each cell can be visited with up to `k` different states.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n \times k)\) 
   - Due to the 3D visited array.

This solution efficiently finds the shortest path considering obstacle removals using BFS.
