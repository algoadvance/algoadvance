[Leetcode 1031. Maximum Sum of Two Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1031)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `firstLen` and `secondLen`, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays of lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `firstLen` and `secondLen` be equal?
2. What are the constraints on the array's length and the values within it?
3. If there are multiple answers, should any specific order or condition be used to determine the result?

Assuming standard constraints based on similar problems:
- The length of `nums` is between `2` and `1000`.
- The values in `nums` are between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

### Strategy:
1. Use a sliding window approach to find subarrays of lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.
2. Traverse the array while maintaining the maximum sums of non-overlapping subarrays.
3. Calculate the possible non-overlapping combinations and update the result accordingly.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Traverse the array from left to right, computing the maximum sum of the subarrays of lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen` separately.
2. Traverse the array from right to left for the same purpose.
3. For each position in the array, calculate possible combinations of sums and choose the maximum.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumTwoNoOverlap(std::vector<int>& nums, int firstLen, int secondLen) {
        return std::max(maxSumTwoNoOverlapHelper(nums, firstLen, secondLen), 
                        maxSumTwoNoOverlapHelper(nums, secondLen, firstLen));
    }
    
private:
    int maxSumTwoNoOverlapHelper(const std::vector<int>& nums, int firstLen, int secondLen) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        int maxFirst = 0;
        int maxSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = firstLen + secondLen; i <= n; ++i) {
            maxFirst = std::max(maxFirst, prefixSum[i - secondLen] - prefixSum[i - secondLen - firstLen]);
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, maxFirst + prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[i - secondLen]);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`. This is because we make a single pass through the array to compute the prefix sums and another pass to determine the non-overlapping subarray sums.
- The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the usage of the `prefixSum` array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum possible without overlapping between the two subarrays.
