[Leetcode 1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1460)
### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `target` and `arr`, you can perform the following operation on `arr` any number of times:

- Choose any non-empty subarray of `arr` and reverse it.

Return `True` if you can make `arr` equal to `target`, or `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the elements in the arrays always integers?
   - Yes.
2. Can the arrays contain duplicate elements?
   - Yes.
3. Are the lengths of `target` and `arr` always the same?
   - Yes.
4. What are the constraints on the size of the arrays?
   - The length of `target` and `arr` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

### Strategy
Reversing subarrays implies that we can rearrange the elements in `arr` in any order. Therefore, the problem reduces to checking if both arrays contain the same elements with the same frequencies.

The easiest way to do this is to:
1. Sort both arrays.
2. Compare them element by element.

If the sorted arrays are identical, then `arr` can be transformed into `target` by a series of subarray reversals. If not, it cannot.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting each array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Comparing the sorted arrays takes \(O(n)\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canBeEqual(std::vector<int>& target, std::vector<int>& arr) {
        // Sort both target and arr
        std::sort(target.begin(), target.end());
        std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        
        // Compare the sorted arrays
        return target == arr;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: We sort both `target` and `arr`.
2. **Comparison**: We use the `==` operator to check if the sorted arrays are identical.

This method ensures that we are checking if both arrays can be rearranged to be the same, which is the core requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion
This solution is efficient and leverages sorting to simplify the problem of checking for equality after potentially unlimited subarray reversals.
