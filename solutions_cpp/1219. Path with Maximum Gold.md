[Leetcode 1219. Path with Maximum Gold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1219)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell has an integer value representing the amount of gold in that cell. You can start from any cell in the grid and move to one of the neighboring cells (left, right, up, or down) to collect the gold. You cannot visit the same cell more than once in a single path. Your goal is to find the maximum amount of gold you can collect starting from any cell.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can I start from any cell in the grid, regardless of the cell's value?
   - Yes, you can start from any cell in the grid.
2. What happens if all cells have gold values set to 0?
   - If all cells have gold values set to 0, the maximum amount of gold collected would be 0 since no movement would yield any gold.
3. Are there any constraints on the grid's dimensions?
   - The constraints are generally given in the problem description, but for this example, assume common constraints like `m, n <= 20` and the values of gold in each cell will be between `0` and `100`.

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking** Approach:
   - We use Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking to explore all potential paths starting from each cell.
   - For each cell, consider it as the starting point and perform DFS to explore all possible paths by moving to its neighbors.
   - Keep a track of the maximum gold collected during each DFS exploration.
   - Mark the cell as visited by setting its value to 0 when entering and restoring its original value upon leaving to maintain the grid's state for other explorations.

2. **Termination Condition:**
   - The DFS will terminate when there are no valid unvisited neighboring cells to move to.

3. **Complexity Consideration:**
   - The complexity is dependent on `O((m \cdot n) \cdot 4)^{mn}` since we perform DFS starting from each cell.

### Code Implementation
Here's the code that implements the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumGold(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        int maxGold = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] != 0) {
                    maxGold = std::max(maxGold, dfs(grid, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        return maxGold;
    }

private:
    int dfs(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y) {
        // If out of bounds or cell has no gold, return 0
        if (x < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y < 0 || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int currentGold = grid[x][y];
        grid[x][y] = 0;  // Mark the cell as visited by setting its gold to 0

        // Explore all four directions
        int maxGold = 0;
        std::vector<int> directions = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int newX = x + directions[i];
            int newY = y + directions[i + 1];
            maxGold = std::max(maxGold, dfs(grid, newX, newY));
        }

        grid[x][y] = currentGold;  // Backtrack and unmark the cell
        return currentGold + maxGold;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O((m \cdot n)^2)\) in the worst case because each cell could potentially be visited multiple times during the DFS.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot n)\) for the recursion stack in the worst case due to the depth of the DFS stack.

This solution ensures that we explore all possible paths starting from each cell effectively and aggregates the maximum gold that can be collected on any valid path.
