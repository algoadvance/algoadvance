[Leetcode 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3005)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr`. Your task is to determine the number of elements in the array that appear with the maximum frequency.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output if the array is empty?**
   - Return `0` since no elements exist in the array.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the range of values within it?**
   - For optimal performance, we're assuming the size of the array can be reasonably large, but not exceedingly huge that it can't fit into memory or be handled in a typical coding interview scenario.

3. **Can the array contain both positive and negative integers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain any integer values.

## Strategy

1. **Count the Frequency:**
   - Use a hashmap (`unordered_map` in C++) to count the frequency of each element in the array.

2. **Determine Maximum Frequency:**
   - Traverse the hashmap to find the maximum frequency.

3. **Count Elements with Maximum Frequency:**
   - Traverse the hashmap again to count how many elements have this maximum frequency.

## Time Complexity

- Counting the frequency of elements will take \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- Finding the maximum frequency and counting elements with that frequency also takes \(O(n)\), making the overall time complexity \(O(n)\).

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

int countElementsWithMaximumFrequency(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequencyMap;

    // Count the frequency of each element
    for (const int &num : arr) {
        frequencyMap[num]++;
    }

    // Find the maximum frequency
    int maxFrequency = 0;
    for (const auto &entry : frequencyMap) {
        if (entry.second > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = entry.second;
        }
    }

    // Count how many elements have this maximum frequency
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto &entry : frequencyMap) {
        if (entry.second == maxFrequency) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1};
    std::cout << "Number of elements with maximum frequency: " << countElementsWithMaximumFrequency(arr) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This solution reads the array, counts frequencies, identifies the highest frequency, and then counts how many elements have that frequency, all while maintaining excellent time complexity.
