[Leetcode 3261. Count Substrings That Satisfy K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3261)
Sure, let's go through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

Suppose you are given two strings `s` and `t` and an integer `k`. You need to find the number of substrings of `s` for which the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the substring plus the sum of the ASCII values of the corresponding characters in a substring of the same length from `t` is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. How long can the strings `s` and `t` be?
2. Are the strings guaranteed to be of the same length?
3. Are we interested in contiguous substrings?
4. Do we need to handle any special characters or just standard ASCII letters?

Let's assume the following based on typical constraints:
1. The length of the strings `s` and `t` can go up to `10^3`.
2. Yes, the strings are of equal length.
3. Yes, substrings should be contiguous.
4. Only standard ASCII characters need to be considered.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can break it into parts:
1. Iterate over all possible substrings of `s`.
2. For each substring of `s`, generate the corresponding substring from `t`.
3. Calculate the ASCII sum of characters for both substrings.
4. Check if the sum of these ASCII values is divisible by `k`.
5. Count the number of valid substrings.

We can use a nested loop to generate all possible substrings, another loop to compute their sums, and a final check for the divisibility condition. 

### Code

Here is the C++ code for the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int countSubstrings(string s, string t, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count = 0;

    // Iterate over all starting points of substrings
    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        int sum_s = 0;
        int sum_t = 0;
        
        // Check substrings of increasing lengths from the starting point
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            sum_s += s[end];
            sum_t += t[end];
            if ((sum_s + sum_t) % k == 0) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcd";
    string t = "efgh";
    int k = 10;
    cout << "Count of valid substrings: " << countSubstrings(s, t, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- `countSubstrings` function iterates over all possible substrings by varying the start and end indices.
- For each substring defined by `(start, end)`, it calculates the sum of ASCII values of the characters in both `s` and `t`.
- It checks if the sum of these values modulo `k` is zero.
- If true, it increments the count of valid substrings.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be analyzed as follows:
- The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (O(n)).
- The inner loop runs from `start` to `n-1` (O(n) in the worst case).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n^2)\). This is manageable for strings of length up to `10^3`.

This approach ensures we properly count all valid substrings while maintaining a reasonable time complexity given the constraints.
