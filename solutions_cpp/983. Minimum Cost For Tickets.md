[Leetcode 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l983)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `days` where `days[i]` is the day you need to travel for the `i-th` trip and an integer array `costs` where `costs[0]` is the cost of a 1-day pass, `costs[1]` is the cost of a 7-day pass, and `costs[2]` is the cost of a 30-day pass.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the days within `days` array always sorted in ascending order?
   - Yes, they are sorted in ascending order.
   
2. Can the same day appear more than once in the `days` array?
   - No, each day is unique.

3. Is there any specific limit to the number of elements in the `days` array?
   - The size of `days` can be at most 365.

4. Is the last day of travel guaranteed to be within a year?
   - Yes, the last day will not exceed 365.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). We'll create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover all travel days up to and including day `i`.

Steps:
1. Initialize a `dp` array of size `last_day + 1` where `last_day` is the last travel day from the `days` array.
2. Set `dp[0]` to 0 because thereâ€™s no cost before day 1.
3. Use a set for quick lookup to identify if a day is a travel day or not.
4. For each day from `1` to `last_day`, compute the minimum cost considering:
   * If it's a travel day:
     1. `dp[i-1] + costs[0]` (1-day pass)
     2. `dp[max(0, i-7)] + costs[1]` (7-day pass)
     3. `dp[max(0, i-30)] + costs[2]` (30-day pass)
   * Otherwise, it remains the same as `dp[i-1]`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the range of days from 1 to the maximum day in `days` (at most 365). This is because we iterate through each day once and perform a constant amount of work for each day.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        unordered_set<int> travel_days(days.begin(), days.end());
        int last_day = days.back();
        vector<int> dp(last_day + 1, 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= last_day; ++i) {
            if (travel_days.find(i) != travel_days.end()) {
                dp[i] = min({
                    dp[i - 1] + costs[0], 
                    dp[max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1], 
                    dp[max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2]
                });
            } else {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[last_day];
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We create a set from `days` to check travel days in O(1) time. `last_day` is set to the last day from `days`.
2. **DP Array**: `dp[i]` stores the minimum cost to travel up to day `i`.
3. **Iteration**: For each day, if it's a travel day (exists in set), we update `dp[i]` as the minimum cost of:
   - Adding a 1-day pass to the cost up to the previous day.
   - Adding a 7-day pass to the cost up to 7 days before.
   - Adding a 30-day pass to the cost up to 30 days before.
   If it's not a travel day, `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.

This approach ensures we find the minimal cost to cover all travel days effectively.
