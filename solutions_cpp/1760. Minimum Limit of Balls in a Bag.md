[Leetcode 1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1760)
### Problem Statement

1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

You are given an integer array `nums` where the `i-th` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum number of balls in a bag. 

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum number of balls in a bag after performing the operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can a bag be split into two bags with equal numbers of balls?
   - Yes, as long as both bags have a positive number of balls.

2. Will the `nums` array always have at least one element?
   - Yes, assume `nums` will have at least one element (i.e., `n` â‰¥ 1).

3. Is it guaranteed that we can always perform up to `maxOperations` operations?
   - Yes, we can always perform up to the specified `maxOperations`.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Optimal Size**:
   - Use binary search to determine the minimum possible maximum number of balls in a bag that we can achieve. 
   - Define `left` as 1 (minimum possible number of balls in a bag) and `right` as the maximum value in `nums` (highest number of balls in any bag).

2. **Check Feasibility**:
   - For a mid-point value in the binary search, check if it's possible to reduce each bag's size to be at most `mid` using at most `maxOperations` operations.
   - To do this, for each bag in `nums`, calculate the number of splits needed if the bag size exceeds `mid`. Sum up the required operations and see if it is within `maxOperations`.

3. **Update Search Range**:
   - If the current mid-point value is feasible, it means we might be able to reduce further, so move the right boundary.
   - If not, adjust the left boundary.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool canReduceToMax(vector<int>& nums, int maxSize, int maxOperations) {
    int operations = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > maxSize) {
            operations += (num - 1) / maxSize; // Number of operations needed to reduce 'num' to at max 'maxSize'
        }
        if (operations > maxOperations) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int minimumSize(vector<int>& nums, int maxOperations) {
    int left = 1, right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (canReduceToMax(nums, mid, maxOperations)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log(max(nums))),
- **Feasibility Check**: For each mid, we check all items in `nums`, which takes O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n * log(max(nums))), where `n` is the number of bags in `nums`.
