[Leetcode 1447. Simplified Fractions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1447)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1, which can be represented in the form `a/b` such that:
- \(0 < a < b \leq n\)
- `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).


### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the input integer `n`? 
   - Typically, problem constraints are such that `1 <= n <= 100`.

2. **Output Format**: How should the resulting fractions be formatted in the output list?
   - Each fraction should be represented as a string "a/b".

3. **Constraints**: Can we assume `n` is always a positive integer within the mentioned range?
   - Yes, we can assume the input is always valid and within the specified range.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Result List**: Create a list to store the simplified fractions as strings.
2. **Iterate Over Possible Denominators (b)**: Loop over all values of `b` from 2 to `n` because for any fraction `a/b`, `b` must be greater than `a`.
3. **Iterate Over Numerators (a)**: For each `b`, loop over all values of `a` from 1 to `b-1`.
4. **Check if Coprime**: Determine if `a` and `b` are coprime by checking if `gcd(a, b) == 1`.
5. **Add to Result**: If they are coprime, add the fraction `a/b` to the result list.

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm primarily involves iterating through pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a < b <= n`.
- For each pair, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm has an average time complexity of `O(log(min(a, b)))`.

Overall, the approach is efficient for the given constraints, typically `O(n^2 log n)` in the worst case.

### C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <numeric> // for std::gcd

std::vector<std::string> simplifiedFractions(int n) {
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    for (int b = 2; b <= n; ++b) {
        for (int a = 1; a < b; ++a) {
            if (std::gcd(a, b) == 1) {
                result.push_back(std::to_string(a) + "/" + std::to_string(b));
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::vector<std::string> fractions = simplifiedFractions(n);
    for (const std::string& frac : fractions) {
        std::cout << frac << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Include Necessary Headers**: We include headers for input-output operations, vector, string manipulation, and numeric operations (for GCD).
2. **Function Definition**: The function `simplifiedFractions` takes an integer `n` and returns a vector of strings representing the simplified fractions.
3. **Nested Loops**: The outer loop runs through possible denominators `b` from 2 to `n`. The inner loop iterates through numerators `a` from 1 to `b-1`.
4. **Check Coprimeness**: We use `std::gcd` to check if `a` and `b` are coprime.
5. **Store Result**: If they are coprime, we format the fraction as a string and store it in the result vector.
6. **Main Function**: In the `main` function, we read the input `n`, call `simplifiedFractions`, and print the results.

This structured approach ensures clarity in understanding and efficiency in execution.
