[Leetcode 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1411)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing an `n x 3` grid. The goal is to count the number of distinct ways to paint the grid such that no two adjacent cells have the same color. The allowed colors are represented by three different colors.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Adjacent Definition**: Do "adjacent cells" include both horizontally and vertically adjacent cells?
   - **Answer**: Yes, any two cells that share a common edge are considered adjacent.

2. **Color Reuse**: Can the same set of colors be reused in different rows?
   - **Answer**: Yes, colors can be reused but not in adjacent cells within the same row and vertically.

3. **Color Constraints**: How many colors are available for painting?
   - **Answer**: There are three fixed colors available.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by defining states based on the patterns of painting a row. Each row can be categorized into two major patterns:

1. **Pattern Type A (3-color pattern)**: A row that uses three different colors, e.g., (A, B, C)
2. **Pattern Type B (2-color pattern)**: A row that uses two colors, e.g., (A, B, A)

Let's denote:
- `dpA[i]` as the number of ways to paint up to the i-th row ending with a 3-color pattern.
- `dpB[i]` as the number of ways to paint up to the i-th row ending with a 2-color pattern.

### Initial Values:
- `dpA[1] = 6` (all permutations of three colors: 3! = 3*2*1)
- `dpB[1] = 6` (two combinations repeated in 3 ways: choose two colors C(3,2) and permute two positions in two ways)

### Recurrence Relations:
- A row painted with pattern type A can follow either an A-pattern or B-pattern row from the previous row.
- A row painted with pattern type B can only follow an A-pattern row from the previous row.

Formulas:
- `dpA[i] = 2 * dpA[i-1] + 2 * dpB[i-1]`
- `dpB[i] = 2 * dpA[i-1] + 3 * dpB[i-1]`

Finally, the total ways to paint the grid will be the sum of the two patterns for the nth row:
- `Total = dpA[n] + dpB[n]`

### Code

Here's the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfWays(int n) {
        // Base cases
        long long dpA = 6; // Pattern A count for row 1
        long long dpB = 6; // Pattern B count for row 1
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            long long newDpA = (2 * dpA + 2 * dpB) % MOD;
            long long newDpB = (2 * dpA + 3 * dpB) % MOD;

            dpA = newDpA;
            dpB = newDpB;
        }

        return (dpA + dpB) % MOD;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 2; // Example input
    std::cout << "Number of ways to paint " << n << " x 3 grid: " << solution.numOfWays(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** because we are iterating through the rows from 1 to `n` and performing constant-time operations for each row.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using only a fixed amount of space irrespective of the input size `n`.
