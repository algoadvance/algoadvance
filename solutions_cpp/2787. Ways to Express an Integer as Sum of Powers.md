[Leetcode 2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2787)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers `n` and `x`. Return the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of the `x`-th power of unique positive integers. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are negative numbers allowed?**
   - No, only positive integers are allowed.

2. **Can the sum use the same number multiple times?**
   - No, each number used in the sum must be unique.

3. **Is the order of numbers in the sum important?**
   - No, the order does not matter.

4. **What is the range of `n` and `x`?**
   - Typically these problems constrain `n` and `x` to manageable sizes, but let's assume a wide range for robustness.

### Strategy

This problem is essentially about finding combinations of unique integers such that their `x`-th powers sum up to `n`. We can solve it with dynamic programming (DP). Here's the plan:

1. **Define the DP Array:**
   - Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to express the number `i` as the sum of unique `x`-th powers.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to express 0, by using the empty sum.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each integer `i`, and for each integer `j` (starting from 1 and increasing) such that `j^x` is a valid power:
     - For every `k` from `n` down to `j^x` (to ensure each number is used once):
       - Add the number of ways to make `k - j^x` to `dp[k]`.

4. **Result:**
   - The result will be `dp[n]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(int n, int x) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;

        // Initialize the dp array where dp[i] will be the number of ways to form sum i
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // There's one way to make 0 sum: use no powers

        // Iterate through each number and its x-th power
        for (int i = 1; std::pow(i, x) <= n; ++i) {
            int power = std::pow(i, x);
            // Update the dp array backwards to avoid using the same number multiple times
            for (int j = n; j >= power; --j) {
                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - power]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   We initialize `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to express the number 0, which is to use an empty set.

2. **DP Transition:**
   We iterate over each potential base integer `i` and compute its `x`-th power. Then, we update the `dp` array from `n` down to the value of `power` to ensure we don't reuse the same base integer multiple times.

3. **Result:**
   Finally, the total number of ways to form `n` as a sum of `x`-th powers of unique integers is stored in `dp[n]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** `O(1)`
- **Outer Loop (iterate through possible bases):** Let `m` be the maximum base such that `m^x <= n`. This loop runs `O(m)` times.
- **Inner Loop (update dp array):** Each update runs `O(n)` times.

The overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the largest integer such that `m^x <= n`.
