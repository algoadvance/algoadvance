[Leetcode 23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l23)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: lists = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**
- `k == lists.length`
- `0 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
- `-10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4`
- The linked-lists are sorted in ascending order.
- The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `10^4`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the solution handle empty lists?
   - Yes, the solution should handle empty lists.
   
2. What should be the format of the final merged list?
   - The final merged list should be in the form of a linked-list.

3. Is there any constraint on space complexity?
   - There is no explicit constraint on space complexity, but an efficient solution is desirable.

4. What is the expected time complexity?
   - An optimal solution would have a time complexity of \(O(N \log k)\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes across all lists.

## Strategy

1. **Min-Heap Approach**:
   - Use a min-heap to efficiently get the minimum element among the heads of the k lists.
   - Insert the next element of the list back into the heap after removing the current minimum.
   - Continue until all elements are inserted into the merged list.

### Steps:
1. Create a min-heap to store tuple elements containing the value of the node and its list index.
2. Initialize the min-heap with the head of each linked list.
3. Extract the minimum element from the heap and add it to the result list.
4. If the extracted node has a next node, insert the next node into the min-heap.
5. Continue until the heap is empty.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class ListNode {
public:
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode* next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

struct compare {
    bool operator()(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        return l1->val > l2->val;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeKLists(vector<ListNode*>& lists) {
        priority_queue<ListNode*, vector<ListNode*>, compare> minHeap;
        
        // Initialize the heap with the head of each list.
        for (auto list : lists) {
            if (list != nullptr) {
                minHeap.push(list);
            }
        }
        
        ListNode dummy;
        ListNode* tail = &dummy;
        
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            ListNode* minNode = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            // Add the minNode to the merged list.
            tail->next = minNode;
            tail = tail->next;
            
            // If there is a next node, push it into the heap.
            if (minNode->next != nullptr) {
                minHeap.push(minNode->next);
            }
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Initializing the heap takes \(O(k \log k)\) time.
- Each insertion and extraction operation on the heap takes \(O(\log k)\) time.
- Since we insert a total of \(N\) nodes (where \(N\) is the sum of the lengths of all lists), the overall time complexity is \(O(N \log k)\).

The space complexity is \(O(k)\) as we store at most \(k\) nodes in the heap at any point.
