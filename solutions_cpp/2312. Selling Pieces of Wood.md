[Leetcode 2312. Selling Pieces of Wood](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2312)
Certainly! Let's start by outlining the different sections to provide a clear and structured solution to the problem.

### Problem Statement

You are given a wooden board of size m x n. You want to sell this board for money by cutting it into smaller pieces according to specific selling prices given in a list. The selling prices for different piece sizes are provided as a 2D list where each list item is `[height, width, price]`, which means you can sell a piece of wood of size `height x width` for `price`.

You can make any number of cuts (both horizontal and vertical) on the board to get smaller pieces, but each piece obtained should match one of the given sizes. The goal is to maximize the total selling price of the pieces obtained from the original board.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the cuts be made in any direction?**
   - Yes, cuts can be made both horizontally and vertically.
   
2. **Can a piece be sold only if it exactly matches one of the given sizes?**
   - Yes, a piece can be sold only if it exactly matches one of the given sizes.

3. **Are the dimensions and prices guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, dimensions and prices are positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum selling price obtainable for a piece of wood of size `i x j`.

Here's the strategy:

1. Initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum price for a piece of wood of size `i x j`.
2. Iterate through all possible sizes of the piece `(i, j)` and update `dp[i][j]` by considering:
   - Direct selling price if the size `(i, j)` is in the price list.
   - The maximum price obtainable by making horizontal cuts and vertical cuts.
3. For each size `(i, j)`, iterate through all possible cuts:
   - For horizontal cuts: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i-k][j])` for all `k` from 1 to `i-1`.
   - For vertical cuts: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j-k])` for all `k` from 1 to `j-1`.
4. The final result will be stored in `dp[m][n]`.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int sellingWood(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& prices) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> price_map;
    
    for (const auto& price_entry : prices) {
        int height = price_entry[0];
        int width = price_entry[1];
        int price = price_entry[2];
        price_map[height][width] = price;
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (price_map.count(i) && price_map[i].count(j)) {
                dp[i][j] = price_map[i][j];
            }

            for (int k = 1; k < i; ++k) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i - k][j]);
            }

            for (int k = 1; k < j; ++k) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j - k]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach can be analyzed as follows:
- Initializing the `dp` array takes `O(m * n)`.
- Filling out the `price_map` takes `O(p)` where `p` is the number of price entries.
- For each cell in `dp[i][j]`:
  - Each cell potentially takes `O(i + j)` time for horizontal and vertical splits.
  - Thus, filling out each cell takes `O(m + n)` iterations per cell.

So, the overall time complexity is approximately `O((m * n) * (m + n))`.

By using dynamic programming, this approach efficiently calculates the maximum possible selling price for the given board size.
