[Leetcode 2540. Minimum Common Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2540)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in non-decreasing order. There is exactly one integer that is common in both arrays. Return this integer. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Clarifying Questions 
1. Is it guaranteed that both arrays will have exactly one integer in common?
   - Yes, this is specified in the problem.
2. Can the arrays be of different lengths?
   - Yes, the arrays can be of different lengths but they are both sorted.
3. Are there any constraints on the values or lengths of the arrays?
   - Yes, typical constraints will apply based on problem statement e.g., the size of `nums1` and `nums2` is within the range [1, 10^4] and the values of elements are within a certain range of integers.

### Strategy
Since we need to achieve an O(log n) runtime complexity, a binary search approach is suitable here. One effective way of solving this problem involves using the fact that both arrays are sorted:

1. Loop through each element in `nums1`.
2. For each element in `nums1`, perform a binary search in `nums2` to see if that element exists in `nums2`.
3. As soon as we find the common element, we return it.

This approach ensures that we are leveraging the O(log n) property of binary search.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int getCommon(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
        for(int num : nums1) {
            if (binarySearch(nums2, num)) {
                return num;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Based on problem constraints this should never happen.
    }

private:
    bool binarySearch(const std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            }
            else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Outer Loop (iterating through `nums1`)**: O(m), where `m` is the length of `nums1`.
- **Binary Search on `nums2` for each element of `nums1`**: O(log n), where `n` is the length of `nums2`.

Combining both, the overall time complexity is:
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(m log n).

This satisfies the requirement of achieving a logarithmic runtime since one array is traversed linearly while the other is searched logarithmically.
