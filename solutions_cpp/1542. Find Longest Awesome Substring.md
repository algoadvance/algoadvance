[Leetcode 1542. Find Longest Awesome Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1542)
### Problem Statement

The problem states that you are given a string `s` of digits (0-9). Your task is to find the length of the longest substring of `s` such that the substring has at most one character with an odd count. In other words, the substring should either have all even counts of characters or all even counts with one character having an odd count.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Characteristics:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
     - Usually constraints are mentioned in the problem, but commonly, it might be up to \(10^5\).

2. **Output Characteristics:**
   - Is the answer supposed to be just the length of the substring, or do we need to return the substring itself?
     - The problem typically requires us to return the length of the substring.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use the concept of bitmasking to efficiently track the parity (odd or even) of the digits in the substring.

1. **Bitmask Representation:**
   - We represent the parity of counts of digits in a bitmask of length 10 (one bit for each digit from '0' to '9').
   - For example, if the bit at position `i` is `1`, it means the count of digit `i` is odd; if the bit is `0`, the digit count is even.

2. **Transition and Lookup:**
   - As we iterate through the string, we update the bitmask by flipping the corresponding bit for each digit.
   - We use a map (or dictionary) to record the first occurrence of each bitmask.

3. **Conditions for Valid Substring:**
   - If two indices have the same bitmask, the substring between these indices has all even counts for each digit.
   - Alternatively, substrings are also valid if they differ by exactly one bit (indicating exactly one odd count among the digits).

Here is the C++ code based on this strategy.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestAwesome(string s) {
        unordered_map<int, int> first_occurrence;
        first_occurrence[0] = -1; // base case: bitmask 0 at index -1
        int max_length = 0;
        int current_mask = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            int digit = s[i] - '0';
            current_mask ^= (1 << digit);
            
            // Check if this exact mask was seen before
            if (first_occurrence.find(current_mask) != first_occurrence.end()) {
                max_length = max(max_length, i - first_occurrence[current_mask]);
            } else {
                first_occurrence[current_mask] = i;
            }
            
            // Check masks that differ by one bit (meaning one odd count allowed)
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; ++j) {
                int mask_with_one_bit_flipped = current_mask ^ (1 << j);
                if (first_occurrence.find(mask_with_one_bit_flipped) != first_occurrence.end()) {
                    max_length = max(max_length, i - first_occurrence[mask_with_one_bit_flipped]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max_length;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times 10) = O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once and perform constant time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1024) = O(1)\). The bitmask can have at most 1024 different states (since \(2^{10} = 1024\)), making our map of fixed size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest awesome substring with the optimal time complexity.
