[Leetcode 2261. K Divisible Elements Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2261)
### Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem: 2261. K Divisible Elements Subarrays**

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`. A subarray of `nums` is called a **K Divisible Elements subarray** if:

1. The number of elements in the subarray that are divisible by `p` is at most `k`.

Return the number of distinct K Divisible Elements subarrays in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of the inputs:** 
   - What is the range of values for `nums`, `k`, and `p`?
   - Answer: `nums` will be an array of integers, each integer value in the range of `1` to `10^9`. The length of `nums` will be ≤ 200. `k` and `p` are integers in the range of 1 to 200 and 1 to 10^9 respectively.

2. **Definition of distinct subarrays:** 
   - Should subarrays with the same elements but different starting or ending indices be considered the same?
   - Answer: No, they should be considered as the same subarray if they have the same sequence of elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a two-pointer or sliding window approach to generate all possible subarrays, and then filter those that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` elements divisible by `p`. To ensure that subarrays are counted as distinct based on their elements, we will use a set to store them as tuples (immutable sequences in Python).

Here are the steps in detail:

1. **Initialize an empty set to store distinct subarrays.**
2. **Iterate through all possible starting points of subarrays.**
3. **For each starting point, iterate through possible ending points of subarrays, keeping a count of the elements divisible by `p`.**
4. **If the subarray has more than `k` elements divisible by `p`, terminate that sequence.**
5. **Convert the valid subarray to a tuple and add it to the set.**
6. **Return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct K Divisible Elements subarrays.**

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int countDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k, int p) {
    // To store distinct valid subarrays as strings
    unordered_set<string> subarrays;

    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int countDivisible = 0;
        string subarray = "";
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            // Check if current element is divisible by p
            if (nums[j] % p == 0) {
                countDivisible++;
            }
            // If count of divisible elements exceeds k, stop extending this subarray
            if (countDivisible > k) {
                break;
            }
            // Append current element to subarray string
            subarray += to_string(nums[j]) + ",";
            // Insert the subarray string to the set
            subarrays.insert(subarray);
        }
    }
    // The size of the set is the number of distinct subarrays
    return subarrays.size();
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 3, 2, 2};
    int k = 2;
    int p = 2;
    cout << "Number of distinct K divisible subarrays: " << countDistinct(nums, k, p) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs `O(n)` times where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- The inner loop runs `O(n)` times in the worst case.
- Constructing and inserting a substring into a set is `O(m)` where `m` is the maximum length of the subarray.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^3)` for constructing and inserting all possible subarrays into the set.

While this is quite high, it should be feasible given the constraint `n ≤ 200`. If `n` was significantly larger or performance is a concern, further optimizations or more sophisticated data structures (like tries) might be necessary.
