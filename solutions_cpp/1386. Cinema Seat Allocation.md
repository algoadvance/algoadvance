[Leetcode 1386. Cinema Seat Allocation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1386)
## Problem Statement

You are managing a cinema and before the cinema starts, you want to allocate the seats in a way that the maximum number of families can watch together.

A family consists of 4 people and they need to sit together in one row. In the cinema, there is a row arrangement as follows:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
You can assume that seats 1 and 10 are always reserved for aisle, meaning a family can sit in the seats between 2 and 9 without interruption.

Given the number of rows `n` and a list of reserved seats `reservedSeats`, output the maximum number of families that can be seated together in the cinema without having to sit apart.

### Example
1. Input: `n = 3`, `reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]`
2. Output: `4`

**Explanation:**
- Row 1 has reserved seats at positions 2, 3, and 8: So either segment [4,5,6,7] can still seat one family.
- Row 2 has reserved seat at position 6: So two segments [2,3,4,5] and [7,8,9] can each seat one family.
- Row 3 has reserved seats at positions 1 and 10: So two segments [2,3,4,5] and [6,7,8,9] can each seat one family.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)`
- `reservedSeats[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n`
- `1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10`
- All reservedSeats[i] are distinct.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can multiple families sit in the same row in different sections? 
   - Yes, multiple families can be seated in the same row as long as they fit in the available sections (i.e., [2,3,4,5] or [6,7,8,9]).

2. Are the rows independent of each other regarding the seat reservations?
   - Yes, each row is managed independently in terms of seat allocation.

3. What is the meaning of `reservedSeats` in the context of this problem?
   - `reservedSeats` is a list of pairs, where each pair `[i, j]` indicates that the seat `j` in row `i` is reserved and cannot be used for seating families.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a hash map to track which seats are reserved for each row.
2. For each row, check three possible family sitting configurations:
   - Configuration 1: [2,3,4,5]
   - Configuration 2: [4,5,6,7]
   - Configuration 3: [6,7,8,9]
3. If a row can accommodate two families using two different configurations, count both.
4. Iterate over each row, check possible configurations, and accumulate the number of families that can be seated together.
5. Since families can only fit in specific seat configurations, rows without any reserved seats can accommodate up to two families directly.

## C++ Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, vector<vector<int>>& reservedSeats) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> reserved;
        
        // Populate the reserved seats map
        for (const auto& seat : reservedSeats) {
            reserved[seat[0]].insert(seat[1]);
        }
        
        // Initialize max family count
        int maxFamilies = 2 * n;  // Assume each row can accommodate 2 families
        
        // Loop over each row with reserved seats
        for (const auto& row : reserved) {
            // Subtracting a maximum of 2 families from this row initially
            maxFamilies -= 2;
            
            bool canPlaceLeft = true, canPlaceMiddle = true, canPlaceRight = true;
            
            // Check left block [2,3,4,5]
            for (int i = 2; i <= 5; ++i) {
                if (row.second.count(i)) {
                    canPlaceLeft = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            // Check right block [6,7,8,9]
            for (int i = 6; i <= 9; ++i) {
                if (row.second.count(i)) {
                    canPlaceRight = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            // Check middle block [4,5,6,7]
            if (!canPlaceLeft && !canPlaceRight) {
                for (int i = 4; i <= 7; ++i) {
                    if (row.second.count(i)) {
                        canPlaceMiddle = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Add possible families seating back to count for this row
            if (canPlaceLeft) maxFamilies++;
            if (canPlaceRight) maxFamilies++;
            if (!canPlaceLeft && !canPlaceRight && canPlaceMiddle) maxFamilies++;
        }
        
        return maxFamilies;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Constructing the `reserved` map: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of `reservedSeats`.
- Checking each row: \(O(m)\), as the number of reserved seats impacts the computation rather than the number of rows \(n\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of reserved seats, which is efficient given the constraints: \(1 \leq m \leq \min(10 \times n, 10^4)\).
