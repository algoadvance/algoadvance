[Leetcode 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1005)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to maximize the sum of the array by modifying the array in the following way: You can repeat the operation of choosing an element from the array and negating it at most `k` times. Your goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing exactly `k` negations.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose to negate the number 3, and the array becomes [4,2,-3].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,-1,0,2], k = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose to negate -1 and then negate 0 two times. The array becomes [3,1,0,2].
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], k = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose to negate -3 and -4, the array becomes [2,3,1,5,4].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?  
   **A**: Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate elements.

2. **Q**: Is there a constraint on the size of `nums`?  
   **A**: Yes, the length of `nums` can be up to 10,000.

3. **Q**: Can the values in `nums` be zero or negative?  
   **A**: Yes, the elements in `nums` can be zero, negative, or positive.

4. **Q**: What are the limits of `k`?  
   **A**: The value of `k` can be up to 10,000.

## Strategy

1. Sort the array `nums`.
2. Prioritize negating the smallest numbers (which are negative) as they will have the most significant impact on the sum.
3. After using up `k` negations or becoming unable to increase the sum further (if we run out of negative numbers to negate), we should decide based on parity of remaining `k`:
  - If `k` is even after the above steps, continue as remaining negations will cancel out.
  - If `k` is odd, negate the smallest absolute value in `nums` (because it minimizes the negative impact on the sum).

## Code
Hereâ€™s the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int largestSumAfterKNegations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() && k > 0; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] < 0) {
            nums[i] = -nums[i];
            --k;
        }
    }
    
    if (k % 2 == 1) {
        // If k is odd, flip the smallest element
        auto it = std::min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        *it = -*it;
    }
    
    return std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Negation loop**: `O(n)` in the worst-case scenario.
- **Summation**: `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
