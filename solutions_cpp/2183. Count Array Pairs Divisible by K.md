[Leetcode 2183. Count Array Pairs Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2183)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of pairs `(i, j)` (with `i < j`) such that `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

Let's clarify a few things about the problem:
1. **Size of `nums`**: What is the size of the array `nums`? This will help in understanding the solution's possible time complexity.
2. **Value Range**: What are the possible values for elements in `nums` and for `k`? This will help us understand if there are constraints that might allow for optimizations.
3. **Edge Cases**: What should be the expected output if `nums` has less than two elements or if `k` is larger than the product of any two numbers in `nums`?

Let's assume the array size can be large (up to \(10^5\)) and values in `nums` and `k` are within a practical range for typical problem constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Understand Conditions**: To find (i, j) pairs such that \(nums[i] * nums[j] \% k == 0\).
2. **Prime Factorization**: Factorize k to determine its prime factors. This helps in understanding the divisibility conditions required for `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
3. **Frequency Map**: Maintain a frequency map of remainders when nums are divided by k.
4. **Efficient Pair Counting**: Use the frequency map to efficiently count pairs.

### Steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of k**: Find the prime factors of k and their respective powers.
2. **Remainder Mapping**: For each number in nums, find the required remainder modulo k that would pair with current number to make the product divisible by k.
3. **Count Pairs**: Use a map to store counts of remainders and count valid pairs efficiently.

## Code

Here's an implementation strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        int n = nums.size();
        long long count = 0;

        // Count the frequencies of gcd values with respect to k
        for(int num : nums) {
            freq[gcd(num, k)]++;
        }

        // Calculate valid pairs
        for(auto a : freq) {
            for(auto b : freq) {
                if((long long)a.first * b.first % k == 0) {
                    count += (a == b ? a.second * (a.second - 1) / 2 : (long long)a.second * b.second);
                }
            }
            // To avoid counting pairs twice
            freq.erase(a.first);
        }

        return count;
    }

private:
    //Helper function to calculate gcd
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while(b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Prime Factorization of k**: \(O(\sqrt{k})\)
- **Frequency Map Construction**: \(O(n \log k)\) due to gcd computation for each element with respect to `k`.
- **Pair Counting**: \(O(m^2)\) where m is the number of unique gcd values, which can be significantly smaller than n in practice.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by \(O(n \log k)\) for practical input sizes, making the solution efficient for larger inputs.
