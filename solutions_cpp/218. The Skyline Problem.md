[Leetcode 218. The Skyline Problem](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l218)
## Problem Statement

The Skyline Problem is a graphical problem that involves calculating the skyline formed by merging several rectangular buildings. Given the start and end x-coordinates, along with the height of each building, determine the key points that define the skyline. 

### Input:
- A list of buildings where each building is represented as a triplet `[Li, Ri, Hi]`:
  - `Li` is the left x-coordinate of the ith building.
  - `Ri` is the right x-coordinate of the ith building.
  - `Hi` is the height of the ith building.

### Output:
- A list of key points `[x, y]` which represents the skyline. A key point is only added if there is a change in the height from the previous point.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the maximum number of buildings?**
   * Typical constraints are necessary to estimate complexity and performance. If not provided, it's usually safe to assume large input sizes should be efficiently handled.

2. **Can two buildings have the same start or end points?**
   * Buildings can have overlapping regions, and handling these correctly is crucial.

3. **Are all coordinates and heights integers?**
   * Usually, coordinates and heights are integers in such problems for simplicity.

## Strategy

1. **Event Creation**:
   * Create events for both the start (`Li`) and end (`Ri`) of each building.
   * Represent each event as `(x, -H)` for a start event and `(x, H)` for an end event. Negative heights differentiate start from end events.

2. **Sort Events**:
   * Sort events by x-coordinate. In case of tie:
     * `(-H)` should come before `(H)` (i.e., start before end if they are at the same position).

3. **Max-Heap Management**:
   * Use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the currently active buildings.
   * Remove buildings from the heap when an end event is processed.

4. **Result Construction**:
   * Keep the last height to help detect changes in the skyline.
   * Append a new key point to the result whenever the current maximum height changes.

## Time Complexity

The primary operations involve sorting and heap operations. Sorting the events takes `O(N log N)`, and each event is processed with heap operations taking `O(log N)`, leading to an overall time complexity of `O(N log N)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& buildings) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> events;
        for (const auto& b : buildings) {
            events.emplace_back(b[0], -b[2]);  // left x, -height
            events.emplace_back(b[1], b[2]);   // right x, height
        }

        // Sort events
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());

        // Max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of heights
        multiset<int> activeHeights = {0};  // dummy ground height
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        int prevMaxHeight = 0;

        for (const auto& event : events) {
            int x = event.first;
            int h = event.second;
            
            if (h < 0) {
                // Start of building
                activeHeights.insert(-h);
            } else {
                // End of building
                activeHeights.erase(activeHeights.find(h));
            }

            // Current max height
            int currMaxHeight = *activeHeights.rbegin();
            
            // If the max height changes, we add a key point
            if (currMaxHeight != prevMaxHeight) {
                result.push_back({x, currMaxHeight});
                prevMaxHeight = currMaxHeight;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

The above code successfully captures the essence of the skyline problem, transforming the buildings' start and end points into events, processing these events while managing a max-heap to obtain the critical points that define the skyline.
