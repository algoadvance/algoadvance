[Leetcode 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1170)
## Problem Statement:
Given two string arrays `queries` and `words`, for each query string in `queries`, determine how many words in `words` have a frequency of their smallest character that is greater than the frequency of the smallest character in the query string.

**Example:**
```
Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The smallest character frequency of "cbd" is 1 (character 'b'); the smallest character frequency of "zaaaz" is 3 (character 'a'). Since 3 > 1, there is 1 word in words that satisfies this condition.
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= queries.length <= 2000
- 1 <= words.length <= 2000
- 1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10
- queries[i][j], words[i][j] are English lowercase letters.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should we return the results in the same order as the queries input?
   - Yes, the results should correspond to each query in the same order as given.
   
2. Will the words and queries strings always contain at least one character?
   - Yes, they will contain between 1 and 10 characters as per the constraints.

## Strategy:
1. Define a helper function `countSmallestCharFrequency` to determine the frequency of the smallest character in a given string.
2. Compute the frequency for each word in `words` using the helper function and store these frequencies.
3. For each query in `queries`, compute the frequency and compare it against the frequencies computed from `words`.
4. Count how many word frequencies are greater than the current query's frequency and store the counts.
5. Return the list of counts at the end.

This approach ensures a clear separation of tasks (computing frequencies and comparing them), and leverages the constraint that query and word lengths are relatively small, making the approach efficient.

## Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int countSmallestCharFrequency(const string &str) {
    int freq[26] = {0};
    for (char c : str) {
        ++freq[c - 'a'];
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        if (freq[i] > 0) {
            return freq[i];
        }
    }
    return 0; // theoretically unreachable if str is non-empty
}

vector<int> numSmallerByFrequency(vector<string>& queries, vector<string>& words) {
    vector<int> result;
    vector<int> wordFrequencies;

    for (const string &word : words) {
        wordFrequencies.push_back(countSmallestCharFrequency(word));
    }
    
    for (const string &query : queries) {
        int queryFreq = countSmallestCharFrequency(query);
        int count = 0;
        for (int wf : wordFrequencies) {
            if (wf > queryFreq) ++count;
        }
        result.push_back(count);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
1. Calculation of the smallest character frequency for each string (queries and words):
   - Each string is of maximum length 10, hence `O(1)` for each.
2. Total time for computing frequencies for `queries` of size `m` and `words` of size `n`:
   - `O(m + n)`.
3. Comparison step for each query with each word's frequency:
   - `O(m * n)`.

Overall time complexity: `O(m * n)`, which is manageable given the constraints (`m, n <= 2000`).
