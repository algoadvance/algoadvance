[Leetcode 1590. Make Sum Divisible by P](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1590)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of positive integers nums. You are also given an integer p. Find the smallest length of a contiguous subarray that you can remove so that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by p. Return the length of the subarray. If it is impossible, return -1.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the original array.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the array is 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 10. 10 % 6 = 4. We can remove the subarray [4], leaving us with [3,1,2]. The sum of this subarray is 6, which is divisible by 6.

Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9, but we can remove the subarray [5,2], which leaves us with [6,3]. The sum of [6,3] is 9, which is divisible by 9.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the elements of the array have a zero value?
    - No, it is stated that the elements are positive integers.
2. Should the solution handle cases where `nums` or `p` is very large?
    - Yes, the solution should be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently.

## Strategy
1. Calculate the total sum of the array and compute its remainder when divided by `p`.
2. The goal is to find the smallest subarray that, when removed, makes the remaining sum divisible by `p`.
3. Use the prefix sum array technique combined with a hashmap to find the remainder for sums up to the current index efficiently.
4. Iterate through the array and use the hashmap to determine the smallest subarray length that, if removed, results in the total sum being divisible by `p`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int p) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long totalSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate total sum of nums
        for(int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        // If the total sum is already divisible by p
        if (totalSum % p == 0) return 0;
        
        int remainder = totalSum % p;
        unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumMap;
        prefixSumMap[0] = -1;  // Initial prefix sum before index 0
        int currentSum = 0;
        int minLength = n;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            currentSum = (currentSum + nums[i]) % p;
            int target = (currentSum - remainder + p) % p;
            
            if (prefixSumMap.find(target) != prefixSumMap.end()) {
                minLength = min(minLength, i - prefixSumMap[target]);
            }
            
            prefixSumMap[currentSum] = i;
        }
        
        return minLength == n ? -1 : minLength;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) because we perform a single pass through the array to compute prefix sums and use a hashmap to track modulo results efficiently.
- The space complexity is O(min(n, p)) because the hashmap will store at most `n` keys corresponding to the prefix sums modulo `p`.

This ensures the solution is efficient even for large input sizes.
