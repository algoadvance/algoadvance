[Leetcode 1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1234)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string containing only the characters 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'. A string is said to be **balanced** if every character appears exactly `n/4` times where `n` is the length of the string. 

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced to make the string balanced. If the string is already balanced, return 0.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.
```
```
Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace one 'Q' to 'R' to make s balanced.
```
```
Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the last two 'Q' to 'ER'.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s.length` is a multiple of 4
- `s` contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'. 

## Clarifying Questions
Before jumping into the solution, let's clarify a few things:
1. **Edge Cases**: Are there edge cases we need to consider such as very short or very long strings?
2. **Input Validation**: Can we assume that input strings are always valid as per constraints?
3. **Multiple Possible Solutions**: Are there multiple valid substrings that can be replaced, and do we just need to return the length of the smallest one?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to find the minimum substring that can be replaced to balance the string. The main idea is:
1. Calculate the required count for each character to make the string balanced: `n/4`.
2. Identify the excess of each character (if it exceeds `n/4`).
3. Use a sliding window to find the smallest window that can be replaced to make the string balanced.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int balancedString(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int requiredCount = n / 4;
    unordered_map<char, int> count;

    for (char c : s) {
        count[c]++;
    }

    unordered_map<char, int> excess;
    for (auto &pair : count) {
        if (pair.second > requiredCount) {
            excess[pair.first] = pair.second - requiredCount;
        }
    }

    if (excess.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    int left = 0;
    int minLength = n;
    unordered_map<char, int> windowCount;

    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        windowCount[s[right]]++;
        
        while (left <= right && 
               windowCount['Q'] >= excess['Q'] && 
               windowCount['W'] >= excess['W'] && 
               windowCount['E'] >= excess['E'] && 
               windowCount['R'] >= excess['R']) {
            minLength = min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            windowCount[s[left]]--;
            left++;
        }
    }

    return minLength;
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "QWER";
    string s2 = "QQWE";
    string s3 = "QQQW";

    cout << "Test case 1: " << balancedString(s1) << endl;
    cout << "Test case 2: " << balancedString(s2) << endl;
    cout << "Test case 3: " << balancedString(s3) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**:

- The initial pass to count character frequencies is O(n).
- The sliding window pass is O(n) since each character is processed at most twice (once when extending the window to the right, and once when contracting it from the left).

Thus, this approach is efficient and should handle the problem's constraints well.
