[Leetcode 1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1389)
### Problem Statement
Given two arrays `nums` and `index`. Your task is to create a target array under the following rules:

1. Initially, the target array is empty.
2. Inserting the elements of `nums` into `target` at the positions specified by `index`. Specifically, `target[index[i]]` should be `nums[i]`.

Return the target array.

### Example
**Input:**
```
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
index = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**
```
[0, 4, 1, 3, 2]
```

**Explanation:**
```
nums       index      target
0          0          [0]
1          1          [0,1]
2          2          [0,1,2]
3          2          [0,1,3,2]
4          1          [0,4,1,3,2]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of `nums` and `index` arrays?
   - The arrays will have the same length, with a maximum length constraint of 100.
2. Are the input arrays guaranteed to be valid (i.e., `index` will always contain valid positions for insertion)?
   - Yes.

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty target array.
2. Iterate through `nums` and `index` simultaneously.
3. For each element in `nums`, insert it into the target array at the position provided by the corresponding element in `index`.
4. Return the final target array.

In C++, we can use the `insert` method of the `vector` class to perform the insertion at specific index positions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> createTargetArray(const std::vector<int>& nums, const std::vector<int>& index) {
    std::vector<int> target;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        target.insert(target.begin() + index[i], nums[i]);
    }
    
    return target;
}

int main() {
    // Sample input
    std::vector<int> nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::vector<int> index = {0, 1, 2, 2, 1};
    
    // Function call
    std::vector<int> target = createTargetArray(nums, index);
    
    // Output result
    for (int num : target) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\) due to the use of `insert` which can be expensive. Each insertion operation takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case because elements need to be shifted to the right to make space. Since there are `n` insertions, the overall complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

However, given the constraints (maximum length of 100), this quadratic time complexity is manageable for this problem size.
