[Leetcode 2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2379)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `blocks` representing a row of blocks where each block can be either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black). You are also given an integer `k`, the number of consecutive blocks you need to get. You need to find the minimum number of recolors needed to get at least `k` consecutive black blocks.

### Example:
- **Input:** `blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7`
- **Output:** `3`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input blocks string be empty?**
   - No, the constraints guarantee that the length of the string is at least 1.
2. **What is the maximum length of the string blocks?**
   - The maximum length is not explicitly specified but we should assume it can be quite large.
3. **Are there any characters other than 'W' and 'B' in the input string?**
   - No, the string blocks will only contain 'W' and 'B'.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique:** 
   - Use a sliding window of size `k` to iterate through the string.
   - For each window, count the number of 'W' blocks (i.e., white blocks).
   - Track the minimum number of 'W' blocks found in any window of size `k`.

2. **Calculate Initial Window:** 
   - Begin by counting the 'W' blocks in the first window of size `k`.

3. **Slide the Window:** 
   - Move the window one block to the right.
   - Adjust the count of 'W' blocks by subtracting the block that is no longer in the window and adding the new block that enters the window.
   - Update the minimum white block count if the current window has fewer 'W' blocks.

4. **Return the Minimum:** 
   - The minimum number of 'W' blocks in any window of size `k` is the answer, as these are the blocks that need to be recolored.

## Time Complexity

- The sliding window technique ensures that we traverse the string in `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the `blocks` string.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumRecolors(std::string blocks, int k) {
        int n = blocks.size();
        
        // Initial count of 'W' in the first window of size k
        int whiteCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            if (blocks[i] == 'W') {
                ++whiteCount;
            }
        }
        
        int minRecolors = whiteCount;
        
        // Sliding window approach
        for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
            // Remove the effect of the leftmost block of the previous window
            if (blocks[i - k] == 'W') {
                --whiteCount;
            }
            // Add the effect of the current block
            if (blocks[i] == 'W') {
                ++whiteCount;
            }
            // Update minimum recolors needed
            minRecolors = std::min(minRecolors, whiteCount);
        }
        
        return minRecolors;
    }
};
```

By following this approach, you can efficiently find the minimum number of blocks that need to be recolored to get at least `k` consecutive black blocks.
