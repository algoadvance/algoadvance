[Leetcode 242. Valid Anagram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l242)
Sure! Let's go through the problem-solving process for "242. Valid Anagram" from LeetCode.

### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, write a function to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

**Note:**
- You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: Are the input strings limited to a specific length?
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Are the comparisons case-sensitive? However, for this problem, it's stated that the strings contain only lowercase alphabets.
3. **Space Complexity Considerations**: Can we use extra space for counting characters?

Assuming we have clarity and no further questions, we can move on to the strategy.

### Strategy

An anagram requires that both strings, when sorted, look the same. Thus, the character counts should match for both strings.

There are two primary ways to solve this problem:

1. **Sorting Method**:
    - Sort both strings.
    - Compare the sorted strings.
  
2. **Frequency Counting Method**:
    - Use a dictionary or an array (since only lowercase alphabets) to count the frequency of each character in both strings.
    - Compare the frequency counts.

We will use the Frequency Counting Method as it generally offers better performance.

### Time Complexity

The Sorting Method would involve `O(n log n)` time complexity due to sorting. The Frequency Counting Method operates in `O(n)` time for counting and comparing, where `n` is the length of the strings.

### Code

Here is the solution using the Frequency Counting Method:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool isAnagram(std::string s, std::string t) {
    if (s.size() != t.size()) {
        return false;
    }

    std::vector<int> count(26, 0); // Since there are 26 lowercase letters

    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        count[s[i] - 'a']++;
        count[t[i] - 'a']--;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        if (count[i] != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "anagram";
    std::string t = "nagaram";
    
    if (isAnagram(s, t)) {
        std::cout << "The strings are anagrams." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The strings are not anagrams." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Vector Initialization**: We initialize a vector `count` of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) to keep track of character frequencies.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: We simultaneously traverse both strings, incrementing the count for characters in `s` and decrementing for characters in `t`.
3. **Verification**: After processing both strings, we check if all counts are zero. If any count is non-zero, it means the strings have different character frequencies, and thus, they are not anagrams.

By following this approach, we ensure an efficient `O(n)` time complexity solution.
