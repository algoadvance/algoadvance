[Leetcode 1847. Closest Room](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1847)
## Problem Statement
You are given two lists, `rooms` and `queries`, of length `n` and `m` respectively. Both lists are 2D lists where each element consists of two integers. The list `rooms` has elements [roomID, roomSize], and represents available rooms with corresponding IDs and sizes. The list `queries` has elements [preferredID, minSize], and represents requests to find the best room such that:
1. The room has a size greater than or equal to `minSize`.
2. Among such rooms, the room with the closest ID to `preferredID` is chosen. If there are multiple such rooms, return the room with the smallest ID.

If there is no room that satisfies the conditions for a query, return -1 for that query.

Return an array of results where each element is the result of a corresponding query.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are room IDs unique?
   - Yes, each room ID is unique.
2. Can the size of the rooms be zero or negative?
   - No, room sizes are positive integers.
3. Is the order of answers important?
   - Yes, the result should correspond in the order of the input queries.

## Strategy
1. Sort the rooms based on their sizes in ascending order.
2. For each query, check the available rooms that meet the minimum size requirement.
3. Use binary search techniques to efficiently find the closest room based on room ID.
4. Store the results of each query and return the final array of results.

## Code
Here's a concise implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> closestRoom(vector<vector<int>>& rooms, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        // Sort rooms based on size
        sort(rooms.begin(), rooms.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });
        
        // Prepare the queries with indices to keep track of original order
        int q = queries.size();
        vector<vector<int>> indexedQueries(q);
        for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
            indexedQueries[i] = {queries[i][0], queries[i][1], i};
        }
        
        // Sort queries based on minSize in descending order
        sort(indexedQueries.begin(), indexedQueries.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] > b[1];
        });
        
        vector<int> results(q, -1);
        set<int> availableRooms;
        
        int r = rooms.size();
        int index = r - 1;
        
        for (const auto& query : indexedQueries) {
            int preferredID = query[0];
            int minSize = query[1];
            int queryIdx = query[2];
            
            // Add sufficiently large rooms to the available set
            while (index >= 0 && rooms[index][1] >= minSize) {
                availableRooms.insert(rooms[index][0]);
                --index;
            }
            
            if (availableRooms.empty()) {
                results[queryIdx] = -1;
                continue;
            }
            
            // Find the room with ID closest to preferredID
            auto it = availableRooms.lower_bound(preferredID);
            int closestID = -1;
            
            if (it != availableRooms.end()) {
                if (closestID == -1 || abs(*it - preferredID) < abs(closestID - preferredID)) {
                    closestID = *it;
                }
            }
            
            if (it != availableRooms.begin()) {
                --it;
                if (closestID == -1 || abs(*it - preferredID) < abs(closestID - preferredID)) {
                    closestID = *it;
                }
            }
            
            results[queryIdx] = closestID;
        }
        
        return results;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting rooms: \(O(n\log n)\)
- Sorting queries: \(O(m\log m)\)
- Processing each query: \(O(\log n)\) for set operations, worst, \(O(m\log n)\)

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O((n+m)\log n)\).
