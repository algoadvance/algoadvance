[Leetcode 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1004)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most `k` 0's.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What should be returned if the input list is empty?
   - **A**: An empty list would return 0 since there are no consecutive 1's.

2. **Q**: What is the range of values in the binary array `nums`?
   - **A**: The elements in the binary array will be either 0 or 1.

3. **Q**: What are the constraints on the array size and the integer `k`?
   - **A**: According to the problem, `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= k <= nums.length`.

### Strategy

This problem can be efficiently solved using the **sliding window technique**. The strategy involves maintaining a window that contains at most `k` zeros and trying to maximize the window size. Hereâ€™s how it can be structured:

1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.
2. Traverse the array with the `right` pointer and expand the window by moving `right`.
3. Keep a count of zeros within the window.
4. When the count of zeros exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right until the count of zeros within the window is less than or equal to `k`.
5. Track the maximum window size during this traversal.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int longestOnes(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    int maxOnes = 0;
    int zeroCount = 0;
    
    while (right < nums.size()) {
        if (nums[right] == 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        }
        
        while (zeroCount > k) {
            if (nums[left] == 0) {
                zeroCount--;
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        maxOnes = std::max(maxOnes, right - left + 1);
        right++;
    }
    
    return maxOnes;
}
```

### Strategy Explained

- **Initialization**: Start with both pointers `left` and `right` at the beginning of the array. `maxOnes` will store the maximum length of subarray found and `zeroCount` the count of zeroes in the current window.
  
- **Expand the window**: By moving the `right` pointer, we expand our window and add elements one by one.

- **Adjusting the window**: Every time we encounter a `0`, increment `zeroCount`. If `zeroCount` exceeds `k`, it means we have more than `k` zeros in the current window, so move the `left` pointer to the right to shrink the window until `zeroCount` is less than or equal to `k`.

- **Update maxOnes**: After adjusting the window, update `maxOnes` with the current window size if it's larger than the previously recorded window size.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice, once when the `right` pointer expands the window and once when the `left` pointer shrinks it.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

The algorithm is efficient and scalable for large input sizes within the given constraints.
