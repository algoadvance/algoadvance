[Leetcode 2509. Cycle Length Queries in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2509)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, which denotes a binary tree with nodes numbered from `1` to `n` rooted at `1`, and an array of queries where each query is a pair of integers `(a, b)`, return an array of integers where each integer is the length of the cycle between nodes `a` and `b`.

A cycle in this context is defined as the path connecting node `a` to node `b` through their lowest common ancestor (LCA), and the length is the number of edges in this path.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Tree Structure**: Are the nodes considered as a binary tree or is there a specific structure?
   - Nodes are indexed 1 to `n` in a binary tree structure.
   
2. **LCA Definition**: Is it important to find the exact path using LCA, or can we use theoretical properties to determine the cycle length?
   - We need only the length of the cycle, so computing LCA and utilizing it to determine the distance will suffice.

3. **Input Constraint**: What are the constraints for `n` and the number of queries?
   - Typically, constraints will be provided in the problem description (e.g., `n <= 10^5`).

## Strategy
1. **Path Calculation**: Use the binary tree properties to determine the path length from nodes `a` and `b` to the root. Using this, the path length can be derived without explicitly constructing the tree.
2. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**: Compute the LCA using the relationship between node positions in a complete binary tree.
3. **Cycle Length**: The cycle length will be the sum of distances from `a` to LCA and `b` to LCA.

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. Define a helper function to compute the distance from a node to the root in a binary tree using bitwise operations.
2. Define a function to compute the LCA by traversing the tree upwards using index properties.
3. Use the distances to determine the cycle length.

## Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to get the depth of a node in a binary tree
int getDepth(int node) {
    int depth = 0;
    while (node > 1) {
        node /= 2;
        depth++;
    }
    return depth;
}

// Function to find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of nodes a and b
int findLCA(int a, int b) {
    while (a != b) {
        if (a > b)
            a /= 2;
        else
            b /= 2;
    }
    return a;
}

// Function to perform cycle length queries
vector<int> cycleLengthQueries(int n, vector<pair<int, int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int a = query.first;
        int b = query.second;
        int lca = findLCA(a, b);
        int distance = getDepth(a) + getDepth(b) - 2 * getDepth(lca);
        result.push_back(distance);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int n = 10;
    vector<pair<int, int>> queries = {{4, 7}, {8, 9}};
    vector<int> results = cycleLengthQueries(n, queries);

    // Output results
    for (int length : results) {
        cout << length << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Depth Calculation**: Each depth calculation takes O(log n) since it involves logarithmic traversal up the tree.
2. **LCA Calculation**: Each LCA calculation takes up to O(log n) time due to the traversal upwards in the binary tree.
3. **Overall Complexity**: For `q` queries, the overall complexity is O(q * log n).

This ensures that the solution is efficient even for larger values of `n` and a high number of queries.
