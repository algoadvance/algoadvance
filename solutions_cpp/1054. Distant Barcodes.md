[Leetcode 1054. Distant Barcodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1054)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `barcodes`, where barcodes[i] is the ith barcode, rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer that meets this condition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum size of the `barcodes` array?
    - What range of values can the barcodes have?
      - Answer: The size of the `barcodes` array is from 1 to 10000.
      - Answer: The barcode values can range from 1 to 10000.

2. **Output**:
    - Do we need multiple valid results?
    - Answer: Any valid rearrangement where no two adjacent barcodes are equal can be returned.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if the array consists of a single barcode?
      - Answer: Return the array as is since a single barcode cannot have duplicates next to it.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Use a hashmap or unordered_map to count the frequency of each barcode.

2. **Max-Heap**:
    - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always fetch the most frequent barcode that hasn't been placed adjacent to its previous placement.

3. **Rearrangement**:
    - While traversing through the list for rearrangement, always pick the most frequent barcode available that isn't the same as the last placed barcode.

4. **Plan**:
    - Count the frequency of each barcode.
    - Push the barcodes along with their frequencies into a max-heap.
    - Pop elements from the max-heap one by one and place them in the new array ensuring no two adjacent elements are the same.
    - Use a temporary holder to ensure the last popped element isn't immediately reinserted into the max-heap.

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the number of barcodes.
- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion and removal from the heap is \(O(\log N)\). Combined operations result in \(O(N \log N)\).
- The overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

vector<int> rearrangeBarcodes(vector<int>& barcodes) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    for (int barcode : barcodes) {
        freq[barcode]++;
    }

    priority_queue<pair<int, int>> maxHeap;
    for (auto& entry : freq) {
        maxHeap.push({entry.second, entry.first});
    }

    vector<int> result;
    pair<int, int> prev = {0, 0};
    
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        auto current = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        
        result.push_back(current.second);
        current.first--;
        
        if (prev.first > 0) {
            maxHeap.push(prev);
        }

        prev = current;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Count**: Create a hashmap to count the occurrences of each barcode.
2. **Max-Heap Initialization**: Insert pairs of (frequency, barcode) into a max-heap.
3. **Rearrangment Process**:
    - Continuously pop the most frequent barcode.
    - Insert it into the result list.
    - Decrement its frequency.
    - Ensure the previous element, if still valid, is pushed back to the heap.
4. **Termination**: The loop ensures no two adjacent barcodes are the same by leveraging the properties of max-heap and using a temporary holder.

The solution ensures efficient rearrangement leveraging heap data structures, ensuring the conditions are met optimally.
