[Leetcode 2740. Find the Value of the Partition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2740)
## Problem Statement

You are given a complete integer array `nums`. We would like to partition the array into two non-empty parts such that:

1. The first part contains the leftmost element of the array and at least one more element.
2. The second part contains at least one element.

The value of a partition is defined as the sum of the left part minus the sum of the right part.

Given `nums`, return the maximum possible value of a partition.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in `nums` include negative numbers?
    - Yes, the problem does not specify any restrictions against negative numbers.

2. What is the minimum length of the input array `nums`?
    - The minimum length of `nums` should be 2, as the array needs to be partitioned into two non-empty parts.

3. Is the partitioning done in a way that the array is divided into contiguous subarrays?
    - Yes, the left part will be the continuous starting segment and the right part will be the continuous remaining segment.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through Possible Partitions:**
    - We need to iterate through the possible partitions from the second element to the second last element. At each possible partition point `i`, we will calculate the sum of the left part and the sum of the right part.

2. **Calculate the Sums Efficiently:**
    - We will maintain two running sums:
        - `left_sum` to keep track of the sum of elements up to the current partition point.
        - `right_sum` to keep track of the sum of remaining elements.

3. **Update Maximum Partition Value:**
    - At each partition point `i`, calculate the partition value as `left_sum - right_sum`.
    - Update the maximum partition value whenever we find a partition value that is greater than the maximum we've seen so far.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxPartitionValue(const vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();

        // Initialize left_sum and right_sum
        int left_sum = nums[0];
        int right_sum = 0;

        // Calculate initial right_sum (sum of all elements except the first one)
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            right_sum += nums[i];
        }

        // Initialize max_partition_value
        int max_partition_value = left_sum - right_sum;

        // Iterate from the second element to the second last element
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            left_sum += nums[i];
            right_sum -= nums[i];
            max_partition_value = max(max_partition_value, left_sum - right_sum);
        }

        return max_partition_value;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initial Calculation of `right_sum`**: O(n)
- **Single Pass through the Array for Partitions**: O(n)
- Total Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`.

The algorithm effectively solves the partitioning problem in linear time, making it efficient and suitable for relatively large arrays.
