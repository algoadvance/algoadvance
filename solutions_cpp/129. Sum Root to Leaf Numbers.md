[Leetcode 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l129)
### Problem Statement
The problem "Sum Root to Leaf Numbers" is defined as follows:

Given a binary tree where each node contains a single digit (0-9), each root-to-leaf path could represent a number. An example of this would be from the root to the leaf being 1→2→3, which represents the number 123. The goal is to find the total sum of all the numbers represented by the different root-to-leaf paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?
   - Usually, the problem constraints for LeetCode problems are within reasonable input sizes for the problem to be solved efficiently, typically up to a few thousand nodes.

2. Are all nodes guaranteed to have value digits between 0 and 9?
   - Yes, each node in the binary tree contains a single digit, and valid input must be in the range 0-9.

3. What is the output if the tree is empty?
   - If the tree is empty, the sum should be 0.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. During the traversal:
- At each node, we maintain the current number formed.
- When reaching a leaf node (both left and right children are null), we add the current number to the total sum.

#### Steps
1. Start traversing from the root with an initial number of 0.
2. For each node, update the current number by: `current_number = current_number * 10 + node->val`.
3. If a leaf node is reached (both children null), add the `current_number` to the total sum.
4. Recursively traverse left and right subtrees with the updated number.
5. Return the total sum.

### Code
Here’s how we can implement this in C++:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int currentSum) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        currentSum = currentSum * 10 + node->val;
        
        // If it's a leaf node, return the current sum.
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            return currentSum;
        }
        
        // Otherwise, proceed to the left and right children.
        int leftSum = dfs(node->left, currentSum);
        int rightSum = dfs(node->right, currentSum);
        
        return leftSum + rightSum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - This is because each node is visited exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree.
  - In the worst case, the recursion stack will go as deep as the height of the tree. For a balanced tree, this will be O(log n), and for a skewed tree, this will be O(n).

This ensures an efficient traversal and summation of all root-to-leaf numbers in the tree.
