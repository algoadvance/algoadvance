[Leetcode 1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1263)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid that contains the following integers:

- `0` represents an empty cell.
- `#` represents a wall.
- `B` represents the box.
- `S` represents the starting point of the player.
- `T` represents the target location of the box.

Your goal is to move the box `B` to the target position `T` in the minimum number of moves. The player can move up, down, left, right, and cannot pass through walls or the box. If the player moves to the cell adjacent to the box, they can push the box in the direction they are facing. Each move is counted as a step.

Write a function:

```cpp
int minPushBox(vector<vector<char>>& grid);
```

to find the minimum number of moves required to push the box to the target. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the box be pushed outside the grid?**
   - No, the box must remain within the bounds of the grid.

2. **Can the player walk on and through the target location `T`?**
   - Yes, the player can walk over and through the target location `T`.

3. **Is the grid guaranteed to contain exactly one each of `S`, `B`, and `T`?**
   - Yes, the grid will contain exactly one `S`, one `B`, and one `T`.

## Strategy

The problem can be approached with a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) for exploring possible positions and states (positions of both the player and the box).

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Identify the initial positions of the box and the player.
2. **State Representation**: Represent the state in a BFS search as a tuple containing the player's position and the box's position.
3. **BFS Search**:
    - Explore all 4 possible movements (up, down, left, right).
    - For each direction, check if the player can move to the new position required to push the box.
    - If the player can move to the required position, then check if the box can be pushed to a new position in that direction.
    - Keep track of visited states to avoid redundant work.
4. **Termination**: If the box reaches the target, return the number of moves. If all states are exhausted without reaching the target, return `-1`.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

typedef tuple<int, int, int, int> State; // (player_x, player_y, box_x, box_y)

bool isValid(int x, int y, vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
    return (x >= 0 && x < grid.size() && y >= 0 && y < grid[0].size() && grid[x][y] != '#');
}

vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

int minPushBox(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    int startX, startY, boxX, boxY, targetX, targetY;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 'S') {
                startX = i;
                startY = j;
            }
            if (grid[i][j] == 'B') {
                boxX = i;
                boxY = j;
            }
            if (grid[i][j] == 'T') {
                targetX = i;
                targetY = j;
            }
        }
    }

    queue<State> q;
    set<State> visited;
    q.push({startX, startY, boxX, boxY});
    visited.insert({startX, startY, boxX, boxY});
    int moves = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            auto [playerX, playerY, currBoxX, currBoxY] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (currBoxX == targetX && currBoxY == targetY) {
                return moves;
            }

            for (auto &[dx, dy] : directions) {
                int newPlayerX = currBoxX - dx;
                int newPlayerY = currBoxY - dy;
                int newBoxX = currBoxX + dx;
                int newBoxY = currBoxY + dy;
                if (isValid(newPlayerX, newPlayerY, grid) && isValid(newBoxX, newBoxY, grid)) {
                    if (visited.find({newPlayerX, newPlayerY, currBoxX, currBoxY}) == visited.end()) {
                        q.push({newPlayerX, newPlayerY, currBoxX, currBoxY});
                        visited.insert({newPlayerX, newPlayerY, currBoxX, currBoxY});
                    }
                    if (visited.find({currBoxX, currBoxY, newBoxX, newBoxY}) == visited.end()) {
                        q.push({currBoxX, currBoxY, newBoxX, newBoxY});
                        visited.insert({currBoxX, currBoxY, newBoxX, newBoxY});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ++moves;
    }

    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is determined by the BFS traversal, which explores all valid states of the player and box:

- **State Space**: Each state can be represented as (player_x, player_y, box_x, box_y), leading to a state space of size \(O(m^2 \cdot n^2)\).
- **Operations per State**: Each state can potentially lead to 4 new states (one for each direction).

Therefore, in the worst case, the time complexity is \(O(m^2 \cdot n^2)\) due to the large state space and the number of transitions.
