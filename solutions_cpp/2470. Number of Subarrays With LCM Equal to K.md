[Leetcode 2470. Number of Subarrays With LCM Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2470)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and a positive integer `k`. Return the number of subarrays of `nums` where the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the subarray's elements is equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the length range of the array `nums`?
   **A:** The length of `nums` ranges from 1 to 1000.

2. **Q:** What is the range of the elements in the array `nums`?
   **A:** The elements in the array `nums` range from 1 to 1000.

3. **Q:** Can the LCM of the subarray's elements exceed `k`?
   **A:** Yes, but those subarrays should not be counted as mentioned in the problem.

4. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `k`?
   **A:** `k` is a positive integer and will fall within the possible values formed by the elements of `nums`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to check each subarray and compute its LCM. If the LCM matches `k`, we count it. Given the constraints, this approach should be feasible:

1. **Brute Force Approach**: Iterate over all possible subarrays and compute their LCMs.
    - For each starting point `i` in the array:
        - Initialize the current LCM to 1.
        - Loop through each ending point `j` starting from `i` and update the LCM for the subarray `nums[i:j+1]`.
        - If the updated LCM equals `k`, increment the count.
    - The LCM of a subarray can be efficiently calculated using the formula:
      \[
      \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
      \]

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single-element subarrays.
    - Array elements exactly equal to `k`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::gcd

using namespace std;

// Function to compute LCM of two numbers
int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a * (b / gcd(a, b));
}

int subarraysWithLCMEqualToK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    int n = nums.size();

    // Iterate over all possible subarray start points
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int currLCM = 1;
        
        // Calculate the LCM for subarray nums[i:j+1]
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            currLCM = lcm(currLCM, nums[j]);
            
            // If current LCM exceeds k, no further subarrays starting with i will match
            if (currLCM > k) break;
            
            if (currLCM == k) count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 4, 6};
    int k = 12;
    int result = subarraysWithLCMEqualToK(nums, k);
    cout << "Number of subarrays with LCM equal to " << k << ": " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer loop (starting points):** Runs `n` times.
- **Inner loop (ending points):** Runs `n-i` times on average.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(n^2)\), making it feasible under the problem's constraints.

### Space Complexity

- The auxiliary space used is constant, i.e., \(O(1)\), since we only utilize a few extra variables for calculations.
