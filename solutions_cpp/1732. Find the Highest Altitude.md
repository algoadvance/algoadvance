[Leetcode 1732. Find the Highest Altitude](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1732)
## Problem Statement
A cyclist rides a bike on a road that follows a sequence of points with varying altitudes. You are given an array `gain` where `gain[i]` is the net gain (or loss) in altitude between point `i` and point `i + 1` for all `i` (0 ≤ i < gain.length). The initial altitude is 0, and you need to return the highest altitude the cyclist reaches.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can altitude values be negative?
   - Yes, gain values can be negative, indicating a loss in altitude.
  
2. What should be the return value if there are no gain values?
   - If `gain` is empty, the starting altitude (which is 0) is the highest altitude.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   - The constraints would typically align with typical LeetCode constraint guidelines — array size could be up to \(10^4\), and individual gain values could range between -100 and 100.

## Strategy
1. Initialize the current altitude to be 0.
2. Traverse through the `gain` array, updating the current altitude at each step by adding the net gain (or subtracting if it's a loss).
3. Keep track of the highest altitude encountered during the traversal.
4. Return the highest altitude recorded.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the `gain` array because we only need a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since we are only using a few extra variables for tracking current and maximum altitude.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for max

int largestAltitude(std::vector<int>& gain) {
    int current_altitude = 0;
    int highest_altitude = 0;
    
    for (int g : gain) {
        current_altitude += g;
        highest_altitude = std::max(highest_altitude, current_altitude);
    }
    
    return highest_altitude;
}
```

Here’s a brief description of the code:
1. **Initialization:** Start from 0 altitude (`current_altitude`) and initialize `highest_altitude` to 0.
2. **Loop through each gain entry:** Update the `current_altitude` by adding the current gain value. Use `std::max` to update `highest_altitude` if `current_altitude` is higher.
3. **Return the highest altitude achieved.**

This solution ensures we efficiently track the highest altitude without needing additional space beyond a few integer variables.
