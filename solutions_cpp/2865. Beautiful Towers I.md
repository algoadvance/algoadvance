[Leetcode 2865. Beautiful Towers I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2865)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of heights that represents the heights of consecutive towers in a cityscape. Each tower's height is represented as an integer in a list. You want to perform the minimum number of operations to make the skyline look 'beautiful'. A skyline is considered 'beautiful' if each tower is either strictly greater than or strictly less than the tower just before and just after it. This means no two consecutive towers have the same height and no two consecutive 'up' or 'down' patterns are the same.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the skyline beautiful. Each operation can increase or decrease the height of any tower by 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: 
   - What is the maximum length of the list of heights?
   - Are the height values always positive integers?

2. **Operations**:
   - Can we assume that increasing or decreasing by 1 always contributes as only one operation, regardless of the distance moved?

3. **Edge cases**:
   - Are all heights distinct?
   - What initial conditions are considered already 'beautiful'?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each tower follows an alternating pattern of increasing and decreasing heights. We will use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum operations required to achieve this pattern.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize two DP arrays: `up` and `down`, both the size of the input list.
   - `up[i]` - Minimum operations to make the height at position `i` part of an 'up' pattern.
   - `down[i]` - Minimum operations to make the height at position `i` part of a 'down' pattern.
   
2. Traverse the list from left to right:
   - For each tower, calculate the cost to make it part of an 'up' pattern and a 'down' pattern.

3. Use the results of the DP arrays to determine the minimum operations needed for a 'beautiful' skyline.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

int minOperationsToBeautifulSkyline(vector<int>& heights) {
    int n = heights.size();
    if (n <= 1) return 0;

    vector<int> up(n, INT_MAX);    // Cost to make each position part of an 'up' pattern
    vector<int> down(n, INT_MAX);  // Cost to make each position part of a 'down' pattern

    // Initial base case scenarios
    up[0] = 0;  // No operations needed if we consider the first tower as the starting of 'up'
    down[0] = 0; // Similarly no operations needed if starting pattern is 'down'

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        // Calculating cost to continue 'up' pattern at index i
        if (heights[i] > heights[i-1])
            up[i] = down[i-1]; // No operation needed if heights[i] naturally continues 'up' pattern
        else
            up[i] = down[i-1] + abs(heights[i-1] + 1 - heights[i]);

        // Calculating cost to continue 'down' pattern at index i
        if (heights[i] < heights[i-1])
            down[i] = up[i-1]; // No operation needed if heights[i] naturally continues 'down' pattern
        else
            down[i] = up[i-1] + abs(heights[i-1] - 1 - heights[i]);
    }

    // The answer will be the minimum of the last elements of 'up' and 'down'
    return min(up[n-1], down[n-1]);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, since we only iterate through the list once and perform constant-time operations within each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, since we are maintaining two arrays `up` and `down` of size `n`.

This solution efficiently determines the minimum operations needed to make the skyline beautiful using dynamic programming.
