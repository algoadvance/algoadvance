[Leetcode 1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1081)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the smallest subsequence of `s` that contains all the distinct characters of `s` exactly once. Note that the solution must satisfy certain conditions:
1. It should be the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
2. Each character should appear exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of string `s`?
   - The length of the string `s` is between 1 and 10^4.

2. **Character Set**: Will the string `s` only contain lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Output**: If there are multiple answers which one should be returned?
   - Since the condition states to return the smallest lexicographical order, we return the smallest possible subsequence in lexicographical terms.

### Strategy
We will utilize a greedy algorithm combined with a stack and a few auxiliary arrays to achieve the desired result:
1. **Count Array**: Keep a count of remaining occurrences of each character as we traverse the string.
2. **Visited Array**: Track characters that have already been added to the result stack.
3. **Stack**: Use a stack to build the result subsequence character by character.

Steps to approach:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: Traverse the string `s` and initialize the count array with the frequency of each character.
2. **Greedily Build the Result**:
   - Traverse the string `s` again.
   - For each character, check if it has been visited (included in the result).
   - If not, ensure the stack maintains the smallest lexicographical order:
     - Compare the top of the stack with the current character.
     - If the character at the top of the stack appears later in the string and is lexicographically greater than the current character, pop it from the stack and mark it as not visited.
   - Add the current character to the stack and mark it as visited.
   - Decrement the count of the current character.
3. **Build Result**: Convert the characters in the stack to a resultant string.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

std::string smallestSubsequence(std::string s) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
    std::unordered_map<char, bool> inStack;

    // Count occurrences of each character
    for (char c : s) {
        charCount[c]++;
    }

    std::stack<char> st;

    for (char c : s) {
        // Decrement the count for the current character
        charCount[c]--;

        // If character is already in the stack, continue
        if (inStack[c]) continue;

        // Maintain characters in lexicographical order in the stack
        while (!st.empty() && st.top() > c && charCount[st.top()] > 0) {
            inStack[st.top()] = false; // Mark the popped characters as not in stack
            st.pop();
        }

        // Push the current character to the stack and mark it as in stack
        st.push(c);
        inStack[c] = true;
    }

    // Construct the final result from the stack
    std::string result;
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result = st.top() + result;
        st.pop();
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "cbacdcbc";
    std::cout << "Smallest Subsequence: " << smallestSubsequence(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Traversal and Operations**: Each character is processed at most twice, once for checking and possibly moving it into the stack, and once for removal from the stack.
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

This approach ensures that we get the smallest lexicographical order while maintaining the constraint that each character appears only once in the resultant subsequence.
