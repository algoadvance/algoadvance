[Leetcode 743. Network Delay Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l743)
## Problem Statement
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (u_i, v_i, w_i)`, where `u_i` is the source node, `v_i` is the target node, and `w_i` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We need to send a signal from a given node `k`. Return the time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be multiple edges between the same nodes?**
   - Typically, no, but if there are, choose the edge with the minimum weight.
   
2. **Can the signal path form cycles?**
   - Yes, cycles can form in the graph.
   
3. **Are the weights of the edges (time) always positive?**
   - Yes, the problem states travel times, so they are positive integers.

4. **Will the given node `k` always be valid (within 1 to n)?**
   - Yes, `1 <= k <= n`.

## Strategy
We will model this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in a graph with edge weights.

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list. Each node will have a list of tuples representing the target node and the weight of the edge.
  
2. **Min-Heap**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the least cost edge.

3. **Distance Array**: Maintain an array to track the minimum distance to each node. Initialize the distance to the starting node `k` to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.

4. **Priority Queue Initialization**: Start the priority queue with the starting node `k` with distance 0.

5. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm Execution**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty, extract the minimum distance element.
   - Update the distances for its adjacent nodes if a shorter path is found.
   - Add the updated nodes to the priority queue for further exploration.

6. **Result Calculation**: If all nodes are reachable, the time for the signal to reach the farthest node is the answer. Otherwise, return `-1`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int networkDelayTime(vector<vector<int>>& times, int n, int k) {
    // Graph representation
    unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> graph;
    for (const auto& edge : times) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
        graph[u].emplace_back(v, w);
    }
    
    // Distance array
    vector<int> dist(n + 1, INT_MAX);
    dist[k] = 0;
    
    // Min-heap priority queue
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    pq.emplace(0, k);
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [current_dist, u] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if (current_dist > dist[u]) {
            continue;
        }
        
        for (const auto& [v, w] : graph[u]) {
            if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                pq.emplace(dist[v], v);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the result
    int max_delay = *max_element(dist.begin() + 1, dist.end());
    return max_delay == INT_MAX ? -1 : max_delay;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Graph Building**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: O((E + V) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O((E + V) log V).
