[Leetcode 2663. Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2663)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, modify the string `s` to the lexicographically smallest beautiful string which is strictly greater than `s`. A beautiful string is defined as a string where no two adjacent characters are the same and no two consecutive characters are the same. Characters can be used up to `k` times in the string.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
s = "abcz"
k = 4
```
**Output:**
```
"abda"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there constraints on the values of `s` and `k`?**
   - Yes, `s` will only contain lowercase English letters, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 26.

2. **Is it guaranteed that a valid output always exists?**
   - No, if no valid beautiful string exists, we might need to return an appropriate indicator or behavior (e.g., return an empty string or say "no solution").

3. **How do we define "strictly greater" in terms of lexicographical order?**
   - A string `A` is considered strictly greater than a string `B` if in the first position where they differ, the character in `A` comes after the character in `B` in the alphabet.

## Strategy

1. **Find the first position where we can increment a character and still maintain the lexicographical order.**
2. **Ensure the new string is a beautiful string by checking and correcting the characters to the right of the increment position, if needed.**

### Steps:

1. Start by trying to increment the last character of `s`.
2. If it reaches 'z', move to the previous character.
3. When a valid increment is found, check the remaining part of the string to ensure it does not violate the beautiful string conditions.
4. Adjust the remaining part by picking the smallest possible valid characters that do not violate the constraints of no adjacent and no consecutive identical characters.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

string lexicographicallySmallestBeautifulString(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    char limit = 'a' + k - 1;

    // Try to increment from the last character onwards
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (char c = s[i] + 1; c <= limit; ++c) {
            // Try setting s[i] to c and see if we can resolve the suffix
            if ((i > 0 && c == s[i-1]) || (i > 1 && c == s[i-2])) {
                continue;
            }

            s[i] = c;

            // Now, build the smallest possible suffix
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                for (char newChar = 'a'; newChar <= limit; ++newChar) {
                    if ((j > 0 && newChar == s[j-1]) || (j > 1 && newChar == s[j-2])) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    s[j] = newChar;
                    break;
                }
            }

            return s;
        }
    }

    return "";  // No solution possible case
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcz";
    int k = 4;
    cout << lexicographicallySmallestBeautifulString(s, k) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * k), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the size of the character set we can use. In each character change, we might need to check up to `k` possible characters, and in the worst case (if we need to adjust the entire string), we would do this `n` times.
