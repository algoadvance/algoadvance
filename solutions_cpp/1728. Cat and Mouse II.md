[Leetcode 1728. Cat and Mouse II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1728)
## Problem Statement

The problem "1728. Cat and Mouse II-out" requires solving a two-player game. Here are the specifics:

- The game is played on an `n x m` grid represented by a 2D array `grid`.
- There are four types of cells on the grid:
  - 'C' represents the initial position of the cat.
  - 'M' represents the initial position of the mouse.
  - 'F' represents a location on the grid where food is located.
  - '.' represents an empty cell.
  - ‘#’ represents an obstacle.
- The mouse and the cat take turns:
  - The mouse goes first.
  - The mouse and cat can move in one of four directions: up, down, left, right.
  - They cannot move into cells with obstacles or outside of the grid.
- The mouse wins if it reaches the food. The cat wins if it catches the mouse.
- The maximum number of moves allowed is 1000 for simplicity.

The goal is to determine whether the mouse can win given optimal moves by both players.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Game Rules**: Can the cat and mouse pass through the same cell simultaneously?
2. **Move Limits**: Both cat and mouse can make one move at a time in one of four specified directions?
3. **Initial Move**: Does the mouse always start the game?
4. **Game End**: The game ends if the mouse reaches the food or the cat catches the mouse?

## Strategy

To efficiently determine the winner, we need to account for the optimal strategies for both the cat and mouse. A feasible approach to solve this would be to leverage dynamic programming with memoization. 

Steps:
1. Create a DP table to store results for positions and moves made.
2. Create a utility function to simulate moves of both the cat and the mouse.
3. Recursively simulate the game from the perspective of both players using memoization.
4. For each state, determine the chances of reaching the food or being caught and update the DP table accordingly.
5. Finally, return whether the mouse can reach the food or not.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    int dp[100][100][100][2]; // (catX, catY, mouse_moves, turn)
    vector<vector<int>> directions{{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    int n, m;

    bool canMouseWin(int mouseX, int mouseY, int catX, int catY, vector<vector<char>>& grid, int mouseMoves, int turn) {
        // Base cases
        if (mouseMoves >= 100 || mouseX == catX && mouseY == catY || grid[mouseX][mouseY] == 'F') {
            return grid[mouseX][mouseY] == 'F';
        }
        
        if (dp[catX][catY][mouseMoves][turn] != -1) return dp[catX][catY][mouseMoves][turn];

        bool mouseTurn = (turn % 2 == 0);
        vector<vector<int>>& currentPlayerDirs = mouseTurn ? directions : directions;

        if (mouseTurn) {
            for (auto& dir : currentPlayerDirs) {
                int newX = mouseX + dir[0];
                int newY = mouseY + dir[1];
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < m && grid[newX][newY] != '#') {
                    if (canMouseWin(newX, newY, catX, catY, grid, mouseMoves + 1, turn + 1)) {
                        return dp[catX][catY][mouseMoves][turn] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return dp[catX][catY][mouseMoves][turn] = false;
        } else {
            for (auto& dir : currentPlayerDirs) {
                int newX = catX + dir[0];
                int newY = catY + dir[1];
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < m && grid[newX][newY] != '#') {
                    if (!canMouseWin(mouseX, mouseY, newX, newY, grid, mouseMoves, turn + 1)) {
                        return dp[catX][catY][mouseMoves][turn] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return dp[catX][catY][mouseMoves][turn] = false;
        }
    }

public:
    bool canMouseWin(vector<string>& grid) {
        n = grid.size();
        m = grid[0].size();
        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
        int mouseX, mouseY, catX, catY;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 'M') {
                    mouseX = i;
                    mouseY = j;
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 'C') {
                    catX = i;
                    catY = j;
                }
            }
        }

        vector<vector<char>> newGrid(n, vector<char>(m));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                newGrid[i][j] = grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return canMouseWin(mouseX, mouseY, catX, catY, newGrid, 0, 0);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<string> grid = {
        "####F",
        "#C...",
        "M...."
    };
    cout << sol.canMouseWin(grid) << endl;  // Output: true or false depending on the grid configuration and positions.
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution would primarily depend on the size of the DP table and the number of recursive calls:

- **Grid Size**: \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the dimensions of the grid.
- **Turn Count**: We're simulating up to 1000 moves, so the turn count contributes as \(O(turn)\).
- **Memoization table**: We store results for each state of \(dp[100][100][1000][2]\), each state taking constant time \(O(1)\).

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n \times m \times 1000 \times 2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \times m \times 1000)\). Generally, this approach would be efficient given the constraints.
