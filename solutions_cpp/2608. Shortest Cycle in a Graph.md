[Leetcode 2608. Shortest Cycle in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2608)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges`, where `n` is the number of nodes (numbered from `0` to `n-1`), and `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

You need to find the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n` and the size of `edges`?**
   - Typically, we should assume constraints such as `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= edges.length <= 10^4`.

2. **Can an edge appear more than once in the input?**
   - In the given problem description, there might be an instance of multiple edges between two nodes. We should handle the graph as an undirected simple graph by preprocessing to remove duplicates.

3. **How should we handle disconnected graphs?**
   - We need to check the shortest cycle in each connected component of the graph.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. This is space efficient and will allow us to traverse the graph easily.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We will use a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to detect the shortest cycle. For each node, initiate a BFS to find the shortest cycle that includes the node.
   - Maintain a parent array or map to track the node from which we came to the current node to ensure we do not process the edge backward to the parent.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - During BFS traversal, if we revisit a node that is not the parent of the current node, it means a cycle has been detected. Use this condition to update the shortest cycle length.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle graphs with no edges or disconnected components separately by returning `-1` if no cycle is found after processing all nodes.
   
### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findShortestCycle(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Create the adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            graph[u].push_back(v);
            graph[v].push_back(u);
        }

        // Function to perform BFS and find the shortest cycle that includes the start node
        auto bfs_shortest_cycle = [&](int start) {
            vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);
            vector<int> parent(n, -1);
            queue<int> q;
            
            q.push(start);
            distance[start] = 0;
            
            int shortest_cycle_length = INT_MAX;
            
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int u = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                for (int v : graph[u]) {
                    if (distance[v] == INT_MAX) {
                        distance[v] = distance[u] + 1;
                        parent[v] = u;
                        q.push(v);
                    } else if (parent[u] != v) {
                        shortest_cycle_length = min(shortest_cycle_length, distance[u] + distance[v] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
            return shortest_cycle_length;
        };

        int result = INT_MAX;
        
        // Process each node as the starting point of the BFS
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result = min(result, bfs_shortest_cycle(i));
        }

        return (result == INT_MAX) ? -1 : result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **BFS per node:** \(O(V + E)\) for each node (V is nodes, E is edges).
- **Total:** \(O(V(V + E))\)
    - Here, V is the number of nodes, and E is the number of edges.
    - Worse case involves traversing each node with BFS, leading to a quadratic complexity in terms of nodes, but since edges are somewhat limited by the dense graph scenario. This can still perform efficiently within typical constraints.

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space:** \(O(V + E)\) for the adjacency list and additional storage for BFS traversal, mainly the distance and parent arrays.
- **Overall:** \(O(V + E)\)

This approach ensures the shortest cycle is effectively detected using a comprehensive BFS strategy over each node, taking care of all possible variations and valid cycles.
