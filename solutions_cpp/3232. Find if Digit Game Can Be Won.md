[Leetcode 3232. Find if Digit Game Can Be Won](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3232)
## Problem Statement
You are given a game where a two-player game starts with a positive integer `n`. The players take turns performing the following operation: subtract from `n` the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. You need to determine if the starting player can force a win given that both players play optimally.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of input `n`?**
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 10^9`.
   
2. **What should be the output format?**
   - Return `true` if the starting player can force a win; otherwise, return `false`.

3. **Can we assume that both players know the optimal strategy?**
   - Yes, both players play optimally.

## Strategy
To determine if the starting player can force a win, we need to observe the pattern that occurs as powers of 2 are subtracted from `n`.

1. **Calculate the Largest Power of 2:** For a given `n`, we need to determine the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. This can be done using bitwise operations.
2. **Turn Simulation:** By recursively or iteratively simulating the game, we can track whose turn it is and whether they win or lose.
3. **Optimal Play Observation:** By observing simple cases, we can deduce that if `n` is a power of 2, the second player always wins, because the first player will reduce `n` to 0 in their turn.

An efficient approach:
- If `n` is found to be of the form `n = 2^k`, the first player always loses.
- If `n` is not a power of 2, the first player has a strategy to make it `2^k` in subsequent moves.

We can achieve this reasoning with the following implementation.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool canWinDigitGame(int n) {
    return (n & (n - 1)) != 0;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number: ";
    cin >> n;

    if(canWinDigitGame(n)) {
        cout << "Starting player can force a win." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Starting player cannot force a win." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
The function `canWinDigitGame` checks if `n` is a power of 2:
- **Bit Manipulation Trick:** `(n & (n - 1))` is `0` if and only if `n` is a power of 2. This is because powers of 2 have only one bit set in their binary representation.
- Return `true` if the result is non-zero, meaning `n` is not a power of 2 and the first player can force a win.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of determining if `n` is a power of 2 using the bit manipulation trick is O(1). This is because the operation involves just a couple of bitwise operations, and these are constant-time operations.

This solution is optimal and provides quick determination of the winning strategy for the starting player.
