[Leetcode 959. Regions Cut By Slashes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l959)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid, where each cell can either be empty, contain a forward slash '/', or a backslash '\'. Your task is to determine how many distinct regions are formed by these slashes.

Slash '/' divides a square into two regions along the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.
Backslash '\' divides a square into two regions along the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format:**
   - Is the grid given as a vector of strings where each string denotes a row? (e.g., `[" /", "/ "]`)
   - Is it always guaranteed that the grid will contain only the characters `' '`, `'/'`, and `'\'`?

2. **Output format:**
   - Should the output be the total number of distinct regions formed?

3. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value of `n`?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently manage and dynamically query the connected components.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Grid Transformation:** Each cell divided by slashes can be seen as 4 smaller triangles. We'll map each such cell to 4 nodes.
   - Top triangle
   - Right triangle
   - Bottom triangle
   - Left triangle

   Given a cell (i, j), these 4 nodes can be indexed distinctly (for example, using a unique index).

2. **Union-Find Initialization:** Initialize a Union-Find structure to keep track of connected regions.

3. **Edge Connections:** Depending on the slash type in each cell:
   - If it's a space `' '`, union all 4 triangles.
   - If it's a forward slash `'/'`, union top-right and bottom-left triangles.
   - If it's a backslash `'\'`, union top-left and bottom-right triangles.

4. **Adjacent Cell Connections:** Ensure adjacent cells share edges correctly:
   - Right triangle of current cell with the Left triangle of the cell to the right.
   - Bottom triangle of current cell with the Top triangle of the cell below.

5. **Count Regions:** After processing all the cells, the number of distinct regions will be the number of unique roots in our Union-Find structure.

## Code

Here's how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) parent[i] = i;
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x]) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY])
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY])
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> parent;
    std::vector<int> rank;
};

class Solution {
public:
    int regionsBySlashes(std::vector<std::string>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        UnionFind uf(4 * n * n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int base = 4 * (i * n + j);
                char c = grid[i][j];

                if (c == ' ') {
                    // Unite all 4 parts
                    uf.unite(base + 0, base + 1);
                    uf.unite(base + 1, base + 2);
                    uf.unite(base + 2, base + 3);
                } else if (c == '/') {
                    // Unite 0-3 and 1-2
                    uf.unite(base + 0, base + 3);
                    uf.unite(base + 1, base + 2);
                } else if (c == '\\') {
                    // Unite 0-1 and 2-3
                    uf.unite(base + 0, base + 1);
                    uf.unite(base + 2, base + 3);
                }

                // Unite right-neighbor
                if (j + 1 < n) {
                    uf.unite(base + 1, 4 * (i * n + (j + 1)) + 3);
                }

                // Unite bottom-neighbor
                if (i + 1 < n) {
                    uf.unite(base + 2, 4 * ((i + 1) * n + j) + 0);
                }
            }
        }

        // Count number of unique roots
        int regions = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4 * n * n; ++i) {
            if (uf.find(i) == i) regions++;
        }
        return regions;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Initializing the Union-Find structure takes \(O(n^2)\) operations where `n` is the grid size.
- Performing `union` and `find` operations efficiently take near constant time, amortized over the entire operation.
- Processing all cells and connecting them is \(O(n^2)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\). The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) due to the storage required for the Union-Find structure.
