[Leetcode 2262. Total Appeal of A String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2262)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, the *appeal* of a string is defined as the number of distinct characters in that string. For example, the appeal of `"abbca"` is 3 because it contains 3 distinct characters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.

The *total appeal* of a string is the sum of appeal of all of its substrings.

Given a string `s`, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`? 
   - The length of `s` can be up to 10^5.

2. **Character Set**: Is the string `s` guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Output**: Should the function return an integer?
   - Yes, the function should return an integer representing the total appeal of the string.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, it's important to avoid generating all substrings explicitly, as doing so would be computationally infeasible for large strings due to the high number of possible substrings.

Instead, we can take advantage of the properties of substrings and the unique positions of each character to determine the total appeal:
1. **Track Last Seen Position**: Use a data structure (like a map or an array) to keep track of the last seen position of each character.
2. **Contribution Calculation**: For each character in the string, calculate its contribution to substrings ending at the current character.
   - The appeal contribution of a character `c` at index `i` is influenced by how many new substrings include `c` since the last time `c` was seen.
3. **Summing Contributions**: Accumulate the contributions from each character as we iterate through the string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long appealSum(string s) {
        long long totalAppeal = 0;
        long long currentTotalAppeal = 0;
        unordered_map<char, int> lastOccurrence;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            char c = s[i];
            if (lastOccurrence.find(c) != lastOccurrence.end()) {
                currentTotalAppeal += (i - lastOccurrence[c]);
            } else {
                currentTotalAppeal += (i + 1);
            }
            lastOccurrence[c] = i;
            totalAppeal += currentTotalAppeal;
        }
        
        return totalAppeal;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "abbca";
    cout << "Total Appeal of String \"" << s << "\": " << solution.appealSum(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Initialization**: `totalAppeal` tracks the running total appeal, and `currentTotalAppeal` tracks the cumulative appeal contribution up to the current position.
2. **Loop Through Characters**: Iterate through each character in the string.
3. **Contribution Calculation**:
   - If the character has been seen before, only the substrings from the last seen index to the current index need to be updated.
   - If the character is new, its appeal is contributed by all substrings ending at the current position.
4. **Update Last Seen**: Store the current index as the last occurrence of the current character.
5. **Accumulate Appeals**: Add `currentTotalAppeal` to `totalAppeal` for each position.

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as the size of the `unordered_map` is bounded by the fixed character set size (26 for lowercase English letters).
