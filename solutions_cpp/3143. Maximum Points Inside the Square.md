[Leetcode 3143. Maximum Points Inside the Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3143)
## Problem Statement:
The problem requires finding the maximum number of points that lie inside or on the perimeter of a square. Given a list of 2D coordinates representing the points and a square of side length `sideLength`, determine the maximum number of points that can be enclosed within or lie on the border of the square. 

You can adjust the position of the square freely, but its orientation must remain upright (aligned with the x and y axes).

**Example:**
```
Input: points = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], [5,6]], sideLength = 2
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
- The coordinates of the points and the side length are non-negative integers.
  
## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are points guaranteed to be unique?**
   Assume yes, no two points share the same coordinates.

2. **Can the coordinates of the points or the side length be 0?**
   Yes, both are allowed to be 0. A point at the origin can be within a square of side length 0.

3. **What is the maximum number of points or the size of points array?**
   Assume reasonable constraints, say up to \(10^4\) points.

## Strategy:
1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate over each point as a potential bottom-left corner of the square.
   - For each potential bottom-left corner, check if moving the square in allowable positions if the maximum number of points in the square increases.

2. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Iterate through each point and consider it as the reference of the bottom-left or bottom-right of the square.
   - Count how many points fall within this square.
   - Maintain a global maximum count.

3. **Edge Handling:**
   - Shift the square up and to the right slightly to consider points that lie on the border.

## Code Implementation:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPoints(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points, int sideLength) {
        int max_points = 0;

        for (const auto& point : points) {
            int x = point[0];
            int y = point[1];
            // Check as bottom-left corner
            max_points = std::max(max_points, countPointsInSquare(points, x, y, sideLength));
            // Check as bottom-right corner
            max_points = std::max(max_points, countPointsInSquare(points, x - sideLength, y, sideLength));
            // Check as top-left corner
            max_points = std::max(max_points, countPointsInSquare(points, x, y - sideLength, sideLength));
            // Check as top-right corner
            max_points = std::max(max_points, countPointsInSquare(points, x - sideLength, y - sideLength, sideLength));
        }

        return max_points;
    }

private:
    int countPointsInSquare(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points, int x, int y, int sideLength) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            int px = point[0];
            int py = point[1];
            if (px >= x && px <= x + sideLength && py >= y && py <= y + sideLength) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Brute Force:** \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of points.
  - The outer loop iterates through each point.
  - The inner loop checks the potential square boundary which also involves each point.

## Optimizations:
1. Utilizing data structures for efficient range queries like QuadTree or Sweep Line algorithms can optimize the overlapping range checks.
2. Sorting points based on x and y coordinates and using binary search for range checks can reduce the square checks.
   
This approach provides a straightforward solution with acceptable performance for many practical input sizes, though it might need optimization for very large datasets.
