[Leetcode 676. Implement Magic Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l676)
## Problem Statement
Design a data structure that is initialized with a list of different words. Provided a string, you should determine if you can change exactly one character in this string to match any word in the data structure.

Implement the `MagicDictionary` class:

- `MagicDictionary()`: Initializes the object.
- `void buildDict(vector<string> dictionary)`: Builds a dictionary through a list of words.
- `bool search(string searchWord)`: Returns true if you can change exactly one character in `searchWord` to match any word in the dictionary, otherwise returns false.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Scope**:
    - Can `dictionary` contain duplicate words?
    - How large can the dictionary and the searchWord be?

2. **Character Set**:
    - Are the words in the dictionary and the searchWord composed of only lowercase English letters?

3. **Functionality**:
    - Should `buildDict` overwrite the existing dictionary or extend it?

Assuming the dictionary contains only unique words composed of lowercase English letters, and `buildDict` overwrites the existing dictionary.

## Strategy
1. **Data Storage**: Store each word in a set for quick look-up.
2. **Checking Transformations**: To determine if you can convert `searchWord` into a dictionary word by changing exactly one character:
   - For each word in the dictionary with the same length as `searchWord`, compare the words character by character.
   - Count the number of differing characters. If exactly one character differs, return true.
3. **Optimizations**:
   - Use a hashmap where the key is the length of the words. This allows fast access to only those words in the dictionary which have the same length as the `searchWord` when searching.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class MagicDictionary {
private:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<string>> dictionaryMap;

public:
    MagicDictionary() {
    }

    void buildDict(vector<string> dictionary) {
        dictionaryMap.clear();
        for (const string& word : dictionary) {
            dictionaryMap[word.size()].insert(word);
        }
    }

    bool search(string searchWord) {
        int wordLength = searchWord.size();
        if (dictionaryMap.find(wordLength) == dictionaryMap.end()) {
            return false;
        }

        for (const string& word : dictionaryMap[wordLength]) {
            int diffCount = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < wordLength; ++i) {
                if (searchWord[i] != word[i]) {
                    ++diffCount;
                }
                if (diffCount > 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (diffCount == 1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Build Dictionary**: O(n) where n is the total number of characters in the dictionary (since we insert each word into the map).
2. **Search**: O(m * k) where m is the size of the `searchWord` and k is the number of words in the dictionary that have the same length as `searchWord` (since we check each word of the same length character by character).

This approach ensures efficient look-up by leveraging a hashmap and reduces unnecessary comparisons by focusing only on words of the same length.
