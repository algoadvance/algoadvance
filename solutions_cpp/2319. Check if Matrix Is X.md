[Leetcode 2319. Check if Matrix Is X](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2319)
### Problem Statement

Given a square matrix `grid`, return `true` if the matrix is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return `false`.

An X-Matrix has the following properties:
1. All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero.
2. All other elements are zeros.

For example:
```
Input: grid = [[2,0,0,1],
               [0,3,1,0],
               [0,5,2,0],
               [4,0,0,2]]
Output: true

Input: grid = [[5,7,0],
               [0,3,1],
               [1,0,5]]
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the size of the matrix grid?
2. Can we assume that the input grid is always a square matrix (i.e., same number of rows and columns)?
3. Are there any constraints on the values of the elements in the matrix?

### Strategy

To determine if a given matrix is an X-Matrix, use the following steps:

1. Iterate over each element in the matrix.
2. Check if the element is on one of the diagonals:
   - Primary diagonal: `i == j`
   - Secondary diagonal: `i + j == n - 1`
3. Confirm that diagonal elements are non-zero.
4. Confirm that non-diagonal elements are zero.
5. Return `true` if both conditions are satisfied for all elements, otherwise `return false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkXMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if ((i == j || i + j == n - 1)) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 0) 
                        return false;
                } else {
                    if (grid[i][j] != 0) 
                        return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) because we need to iterate through each element in the `n x n` matrix exactly once to check the conditions.

### Explanation

1. **Primary Diagonal Check**:
   - Positions where `i == j` are points on the primary diagonal.
   
2. **Secondary Diagonal Check**:
   - Positions where `i + j == n - 1` are points on the secondary diagonal.
   
3. **Validation**:
   - For diagonal elements (`i == j` or `i + j == n - 1`), ensure they are non-zero.
   - For non-diagonal elements, ensure they are zero.

This approach ensures that every element is checked exactly once, leading to optimal performance.
