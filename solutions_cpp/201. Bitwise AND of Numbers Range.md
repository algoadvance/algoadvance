[Leetcode 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l201)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 201: **Bitwise AND of Numbers Range**

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What are the constraints on `left` and `right`?
   - **Constraint**: `0 <= left <= right <= 2^31 - 1`
   
2. **Order of Input**: Should we assume `left` is always less than or equal to `right`?
   - Yes, it is given that `0 <= left <= right`.

### Strategy

1. **Observation**:
   - When performing bitwise AND on a range of numbers, if we look at their binary representation, the result changes significantly when there is a change in the bit from `0` to `1` or `1` to `0` within the range.
   - The bits that remain the constant `1` across all numbers in the range `[left, right]` will contribute to the final result.

2. **Common Bit Prefix Strategy**:
   - We can solve the problem by aligning `left` and `right` such that they share the common prefix of bits.
   - We right-shift both `left` and `right` until they are equal because the differing bits beyond the common prefix will yield `0` when ANDed.

3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a `shift` counter to count the number of right shifts.
   - Right shift both `left` and `right` until they become equal.
   - Left shift the result back by the number of shift operations performed.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing this strategy:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        int shift = 0;
        // Find the common prefix
        while (left < right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            shift++;
        }
        // Left shift the result back to its original position
        return left << shift;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm:
- The number of shifts required to make `left` equal to `right` depends on the number of bits in `right`. In the worst case, this would be around \( O(\log N) \), where \( N \) is the value of `right`.

The space complexity is \( O(1) \) as we are only using a few extra integer variables for shifting operations.

### Explanation

1. **Common Bit Prefix**: By right-shifting both `left` and `right` until they are the same, we effectively find the common bit prefix.
2. **Left Shift Back**: The number of shifts determines how many trailing zeros there are, so we need to left-shift back to get the final result where those trailing bits are zeroed out.

This solution efficiently finds the bitwise AND of all numbers in the given range using bit manipulation.
