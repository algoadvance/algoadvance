[Leetcode 456. 132 Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l456)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of n integers `nums`, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`. Return `true` if there is a 132 pattern in `nums`, otherwise, return `false`.

### Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `false`
  - Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
- Example 2:
  - Input: `nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]`
  - Output: `true`
  - Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
- Example 3:
  - Input: `nums = [-1, 3, 2, 0]`
  - Output: `true`
  - Explanation: There are several 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2] and [-1, 3, 0].

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values in the array `nums`?
2. What is the length of the array?
3. Are there any duplicate values in the array?
4. Are there any specific constraints related to time & space complexity we need to consider for the solution?

If there are no specific constraints provided, we should aim for an efficient solution with a good balance between time and space complexity.

## Strategy
To find the 132 pattern, we need to track three values such that `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]` with `i < j < k`. Here's a strategy to solve it efficiently:

1. **Maintain a Stack and Auxiliary Array**:
    - Use a stack to keep track of possible candidates for `nums[k]` (the middle value).
    - Use an auxiliary array `min_array` to keep track of the minimum value up to the current index (potential `nums[i]`).

2. **Traverse the Array Backwards**:
    - Traverse the array from right to left. This helps in efficiently maintaining potential candidates for `nums[k]` (since they need to be smaller than the preceding numbers as we look for a valid `nums[j]`).

3. **Find Potential k values while ensuring constraints**:
    - While iterating, for each `nums[j]`, we check if there's a valid `nums[k]` in the stack such that `nums[k]` is greater than `min_array[j]` but less than `nums[j]`.
    - Update the stack accordingly.

This approach ensures that we check each element multiple times in a controlled manner, leading to an efficient solution.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

bool find132pattern(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n < 3) return false;
    
    // Create min_array to track the minimum value up to the current index
    vector<int> min_array(n);
    min_array[0] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        min_array[i] = min(min_array[i - 1], nums[i]);
    }
    
    // Use a stack to keep track of potential nums[k] candidates
    stack<int> stk;
    
    for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        // Find a valid nums[k] that is greater than min_array[j] but less than nums[j]
        while (!stk.empty() && stk.top() <= min_array[j]) {
            stk.pop();
        }
        if (!stk.empty() && stk.top() < nums[j]) {
            return true;
        }
        // Add the current element nums[j] as a potential nums[k]
        stk.push(nums[j]);
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. This complexity arises because:
- We iterate through the array once to create the `min_array`.
- We iterate through the array again while managing the stack.

Space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the auxiliary space used for `min_array` and the stack.

With these details, the solution should efficiently determine if a 132 pattern exists in the given array.
