## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 433: Minimum Genetic Mutation

A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with characters from the set `{'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'}`.

Given a gene `start` string, a gene `end` string, and a list of `bank` strings (all of which represent valid genetic sequences), return the minimum number of mutations needed to transform the `start` gene to the `end` gene using the following rules:

1. Each mutation must change exactly one character in the gene string.
2. The mutation must result in a new gene string that is in the `bank`.

If it is not possible to mutate the `start` gene to the `end` gene, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What if `start` or `end` is not in the `bank`?**
   - `start` does not need to be in the bank, but `end` must be in the `bank` for a valid transformation to exist.
   
2. **Can there be duplicate strings in the bank?**
   - No, the `bank` contains distinct strings.

3. **Are all strings in `bank` guaranteed to be 8 characters long and composed of `{A, C, G, T}`?**
   - Yes, all strings are valid and of the correct format.

4. **Is the input guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, based on the problem statement.

## Strategy

This problem can be formulated as an unweighted graph traversal problem where each gene string is a node and an edge exists between two nodes if they differ by exactly one character (i.e., one mutation).

### Steps:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - BFS is suitable because it explores all possibilities level by level (i.e., all one-step mutations from current strings at each level).
   - Perform BFS starting from the `start` gene string.
   - Each valid mutation (a string present in the bank and not visited yet) is added to the BFS queue.
   - Keep track of the number of mutations (levels) taken to reach the `end` gene string.
   - If `end` is reached during BFS, return the number of steps taken.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `end` is not in the `bank`, immediately return `-1`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Initialization (putting the bank into a set):** O(n), where `n` is the number of strings in the bank.
- **BFS traversal:** In the worst case, each string has up to 8 neighbors (one-step mutations), leading to O(n * 8) = O(8n) => O(n).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Function to check if two strings differ by exactly one character
bool oneMutationApart(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
    int diffCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i) {
        if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
            ++diffCount;
            if (diffCount > 1) return false;
        }
    }
    return diffCount == 1;
}

int minMutation(string start, string end, vector<string>& bank) {
    unordered_set<string> bankSet(bank.begin(), bank.end());
    if (!bankSet.count(end)) return -1;

    queue<pair<string, int>> bfsQueue;
    bfsQueue.push({start, 0});
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    visited.insert(start);

    vector<char> genes = {'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'};

    while (!bfsQueue.empty()) {
        auto [current, steps] = bfsQueue.front();
        bfsQueue.pop();

        if (current == end) {
            return steps;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < current.size(); ++i) {
            char originalChar = current[i];
            for (char gene : genes) {
                if (gene == originalChar) continue;

                current[i] = gene;
                if (bankSet.count(current) && !visited.count(current)) {
                    bfsQueue.push({current, steps + 1});
                    visited.insert(current);
                }
            }
            current[i] = originalChar; // revert back for the next iteration
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

int main() {
    string start = "AACCGGTT";
    string end = "AACCGGTA";
    vector<string> bank = {"AACCGGTA"};

    cout << "Minimum mutations: " << minMutation(start, end, bank) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **oneMutationApart Function:** Helper function to check if two strings differ by exactly one character.
2. **minMutation Function:** Main function that uses BFS to find the minimum number of mutations needed.
3. **Initialization:** Convert the `bank` to an unordered_set for O(1) look-up times.
4. **BFS Traversal:** Use a queue to keep track of the current string and the number of mutations made.
5. **Mutate and Enqueue:** For each position in the current string, try mutating it with 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and if the mutated string is in the bank and not visited, enqueue it.
6. **Return Result:** If the `end` string is reached, return the number of mutations; otherwise, when the traversal is complete and `end` is not reached, return -1.
