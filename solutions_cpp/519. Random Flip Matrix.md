[Leetcode 519. Random Flip Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l519)
Sure, I'll help you solve the problem "519. Random Flip Matrix" from LeetCode. Below is the structured approach:

### Problem Statement
You are given the number of rows `m` and number of columns `n` of a 2D binary matrix which is initially all 0s. You need to implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(int m, int n)` Initializes the object with the number of rows `m` and columns `n`.
- `vector<int> flip()` Returns a random index `[r, c]` (row and column index) such that the cell is 0, and then changes it to 1.
- `void reset()` Resets all the cells of the matrix to be 0.

Your efficient solution should ensure that `flip` works in almost constant time with no significant extra memory overhead.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that the matrix will not exceed a certain size?  
   **A:** Yes, but the goal is to handle large matrices efficiently.
   
2. **Q:** Can the same cell be flipped more than once without resetting?  
   **A:** No, once flipped, it becomes 1 and should not be flipped again until a reset.

3. **Q:** How should we handle cases where all cells are flipped?  
   **A:** If all cells are flipped, calling `flip` should be avoided or can throw an exception.

### Strategy
- Use a map to simulate the 2D matrix flips.
- Keep track of the total number of cells and the number of remaining cells to flip.
- Use a hash map to maintain a mapping of flipped positions for efficient flipping.

### Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    int rows, cols, total;
    unordered_map<int, int> flipped;
    
public:
    Solution(int m, int n) : rows(m), cols(n), total(m * n) {
        srand(time(0)); // Seeding for randomness
    }
    
    vector<int> flip() {
        int randPos = rand() % total--;
        int actualPos = randPos;
        
        if (flipped.find(randPos) != flipped.end()) {
            actualPos = flipped[randPos];
        }
        
        if (flipped.find(total) != flipped.end()) {
            flipped[randPos] = flipped[total];
        } else {
            flipped[randPos] = total;
        }
        
        return {actualPos / cols, actualPos % cols};
    }
    
    void reset() {
        total = rows * cols;
        flipped.clear();
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization (`Solution`)**: Initialize the matrix dimensions and total cells. Seed the random number generator.
- **Flip (`flip`)**: Pick a random position. Use a hash map to find the actual position to be flipped. Swap mappings for efficient future access.
- **Reset (`reset`)**: Clear the map and reset the total cells count.

### Time Complexity
- **`flip`**: O(1) amortized - HashMap operations (insert/find) are O(1) on average.
- **`reset`**: O(1) - Just clearing the hash map and resetting a counter.

This solution ensures that the flip operation runs efficiently even for a large matrix size.
