[Leetcode 2310. Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2310)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` whose units digit is `k`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 25, k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The numbers with units digit 5 that are <= 25 are: 5, 15, 25.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 9, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The number with units digit 1 that are <= 9 is: 1.
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= n <= 10000`
- `0 <= k <= 9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - How should the function handle `n` being 0? 
   - What if `k` is 0?
   
2. **Expected Outputs**:
   - Should the function return 0 if no such numbers exist?
   - Are negative integers considered?

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int countNumbersWithUnitsDigitK(int n, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    
    // Check every number from 0 to n
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        // If the units digit of i is equal to k
        if (i % 10 == k) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n = 25;
    int k = 5;
    std::cout << "Number of integers ≤ " << n << " with units digit " << k << " is: " << countNumbersWithUnitsDigitK(n, k) << std::endl;

    // You can add more test cases here
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Iterate Through all Numbers**: 
   - Loop from 0 to `n` to check each number.
   
2. **Check Units Digit**:
   - For each number, check if its units digit (`i % 10`) is equal to `k`.

3. **Count Valid Numbers**:
   - If a number’s units digit is `k`, increment the counter.

4. **Return the Count**:
   - After the loop, return the total count.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** since the program iterates through each number from 0 to `n`. This is efficiently manageable given the constraint `0 <= n <= 10000`.
