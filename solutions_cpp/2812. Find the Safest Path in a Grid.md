[Leetcode 2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2812)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid `matrix` of positive integers, where `matrix[i][j]` represents the value at position `(i, j)` in the grid.

You start from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and want to reach the bottom-right corner `(m-1, n-1)` in exactly `m + n - 2` moves. 

Your goal is to maximize the minimum value in the path from start to end.

You can only move right or down, and you must take every step exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of dimensions for the grid (m and n)?
2. Are the values in the grid guaranteed to be positive integers?
3. Can we assume that m and n will be at least 1?
4. Are we always guaranteed that a path exists (i.e., m and n dimensions always allow for exactly m + n - 2 moves)?
5. Do the constraints allow for an efficient algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a priority queue-based search?

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) with Max-Heap**: We can use a BFS approach combined with a max-heap (priority queue) to find the path that maximizes the minimum value.
2. **Tracking the Minimum Value**: Along the path, we keep track of the minimum value seen so far and try to maximize this value.
3. **Visited States**: Use a visited matrix to keep track of the cells we have traversed.
4. **Initialization**: Start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and traverse using BFS, always picking the path with the highest minimum value seen so far.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n * log(m * n)) - Each cell is processed once, and each insertion into the heap is logarithmic in the number of cells.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) - For the heap and the visited states.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Define a triplet structure to store the x, y coordinates and the minimum value.
struct Triplet {
    int x, y, minVal;
    bool operator<(const Triplet &other) const {
        return minVal < other.minVal;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumMinimumPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        // Directions for moving right and down
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{1, 0}, {0, 1}};
        
        // Priority queue (max-heap) to store the current maximum minimum value path
        priority_queue<Triplet> pq;
        pq.push({0, 0, grid[0][0]});

        // Visited matrix to avoid revisiting cells
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [x, y, minVal] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();

            // If we've reached the bottom-right corner, return the current minVal
            if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1) return minVal;
            
            for (const auto& [dx, dy] : directions) {
                int newX = x + dx;
                int newY = y + dy;

                if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && !visited[newX][newY]) {
                    visited[newX][newY] = true;
                    pq.push({newX, newY, min(minVal, grid[newX][newY])});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // This return statement might never be reached as per problem constraints
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Data Structures**:
   - We use a max-heap to always expand the path that has the highest minimum value.
   - A `visited` matrix to track which cells have been processed.
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Start from `(0, 0)` and initialize the minimum value to `grid[0][0]`.
   - Iteratively expand the neighboring cells (down and right) and push them into the heap.
   - Always choose the path with the highest minimum value on the heap.
   - When we reach the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`, the value at that point in the heap is the answer.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single cell grid.
   - Grids with obstacles where movement is heavily constrained.

This approach ensures we explore the optimal paths efficiently and find the safest path as defined by the highest minimum value.
