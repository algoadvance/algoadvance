[Leetcode 2376. Count Special Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2376)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. Return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `n` that are special.

A positive integer is considered special if all of its digits are distinct.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we dive into the solution, let's clarify some key points:
1. What are the constraints on the value of `n`? Is `n` guaranteed to fit within standard integer limits?
2. Are there any specific edge cases we should consider, such as `n` being a single-digit number?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to count numbers less than or equal to `n` where all digits are distinct. This requires considering two parts:
1. Numbers with fewer digits than `n`, which always need to be counted as they are definitely smaller.
2. Numbers with the same number of digits as `n`, which requires careful construction to ensure digits are distinct.

Here's the plan:
1. Break `n` into its individual digits. 
2. Use a backtracking approach to generate all valid numbers with distinct digits.
3. Track the numbers with digits fewer than `n` and those with exact digits carefully.
4. Combine the counts for both cases.

### Code

Here's an implementation of our strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSpecialNumbers(int n) {
        vector<int> digits = getDigits(n);
        int len = digits.size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> memo(len, vector<int>((1 << 10), -1));
        
        return countWithPrefix(digits, 0, 0, true, memo);
    }

private:
    vector<int> getDigits(int n) {
        vector<int> digits;
        while (n > 0) {
            digits.push_back(n % 10);
            n /= 10;
        }
        reverse(digits.begin(), digits.end());
        return digits;
    }
    
    int countWithPrefix(const vector<int>& digits, int idx, int used, bool tight, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
        if (idx == digits.size()) return 1;

        if (!tight && memo[idx][used] != -1) return memo[idx][used];

        int limit = tight ? digits[idx] : 9;
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int digit = 0; digit <= limit; ++digit) {
            if (used & (1 << digit)) continue; 
            if (digit == 0 && used == 0) {
                result += countWithPrefix(digits, idx + 1, used, tight && digit == limit, memo);
            } else {
                result += countWithPrefix(digits, idx + 1, used | (1 << digit), tight && digit == limit, memo);
            }
        }

        if (!tight) memo[idx][used] = result;
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 100;
    cout << "Special numbers <= " << n << ": " << sol.countSpecialNumbers(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **getDigits**: Converts the number `n` into its individual digits for easier manipulation.
2. **countWithPrefix**: Uses backtracking to count numbers with specific constraints:
    - `idx` is the current digit index being processed.
    - `used` is a bitmask representing which digits have been used so far.
    - `tight` is a boolean indicating whether the current number being formed is still tied to the maximum constraints imposed by `n`.

3. **Memoization**: We use memoization (`memo`) to store intermediate results for efficiency.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dependent on the number of digits in `n` (let's call this `d`) and the bitmask operations. Given that `d` can be at most 10 (since we're dealing with digits), the complexity is:
- Number of states: `d * 2^10` which is manageable with the given constraints.

Thus, the approach should be efficient for typical problem constraints.
