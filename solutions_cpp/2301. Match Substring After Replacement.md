[Leetcode 2301. Match Substring After Replacement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2301)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `sub`, and a 2-dimensional array `mappings` where each `mappings[i]` represents a pair of characters, determine whether `sub` can be formed by replacing characters in `s` according to the mappings. The characters from `s` can be replaced according to the mappings in zero or more moves.

**Example:**
```
Input:
s = "abcdef"
sub = "azced"
mappings = [['a', 'a'], ['b', 'z'], ['c', 'c'], ['d', 'd'], ['e', 'e'], ['f', 'd']]

Output:
True

Explanation:
'a' -> 'a'
'b' -> 'z'
'c' -> 'c'
'd' -> 'd'
'e' -> 'e'
'f' -> 'd'
so, sub "azced" can be formed from s "abcdef".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the order of characters in `s` have to match the order of characters in `sub` exactly?**
   - Yes, the order must be the same. The mapping only applies to replace characters, not to change their order.

2. **Can characters be mapped to multiple different characters?**
   - A character can be mapped to multiple different characters, allowing replacements to form `sub`.

3. **Are the strings and `mappings` containing only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, we will assume the constraints include only lowercase English letters for this problem.

### Strategy

1. Create a dictionary from the `mappings` array to quickly check if a character can be mapped to another character.
2. Iterate through both `s` and `sub` simultaneously:
   - For each character in `sub`, check if the corresponding character in `s` can be mapped to it using the dictionary.
   - If it can be mapped, continue; otherwise, return `False`.
3. If all characters in `sub` can be successfully mapped from `s`, return `True`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool canFormSubstring(string s, string sub, vector<vector<char>>& mappings) {
    if (s.size() < sub.size()) return false;

    // Create a mapping dictionary
    unordered_map<char, unordered_set<char>> mapDict;
    for (const auto& mapping : mappings) {
        mapDict[mapping[0]].insert(mapping[1]);
    }

    // Iterating through each possible starting point in s
    for (int start = 0; start <= s.size() - sub.size(); start++) {
        bool canMatch = true;

        // Check each character of sub with substring of s
        for (int j = 0; j < sub.size(); j++) {
            char sChar = s[start + j];
            char subChar = sub[j];

            // Check if mapping is possible
            if (sChar != subChar && (mapDict.find(sChar) == mapDict.end() || mapDict[sChar].find(subChar) == mapDict[sChar].end())) {
                canMatch = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (canMatch) return true;
    }

    return false;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcdef";
    string sub = "azced";
    vector<vector<char>> mappings = \{\{'a', 'a'}, {'b', 'z'}, {'c', 'c'}, {'d', 'd'}, {'e', 'e'}, {'f', 'd'}};

    if (canFormSubstring(s, sub, mappings)) {
        cout << "True" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "False" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the mapping dictionary takes O(k), where k is the number of mappings.
- Iterating through each potential starting position in `s` and checking against `sub`:
  - Outer loop (starting positions): O(n - m + 1), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `sub`.
  - Inner loop (character comparison): O(m).
- Total: O(k + (n - m + 1) * m) ~ O(k + n * m).

This ensures that our approach will be efficient for reasonably sized inputs.
