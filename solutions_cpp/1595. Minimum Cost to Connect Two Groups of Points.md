[Leetcode 1595. Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1595)
### Problem Statement

You are given two groups of points where the i-th point in the first group is connected to the j-th point in the second group with a cost `cost[i][j]`. Your task is to connect each point in the first group to at least one point in the second group such that the total cost is minimized. You may connect each point in the second group to multiple points in the first group, but each point in the first group must be connected to exactly one point in the second group initially.

Return the minimum cost required to connect the two groups of points.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the dimensions of `cost` matrix variable?**
   Yes, the dimensions can vary, and the number of points in the two groups need not be equal.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix?**
   Yes, generally the problem constraints will be such that a DP algorithm can handle the size efficiently even if the brute force solution isnâ€™t feasible.

3. **How are the costs present in the `cost` matrix?**
   The cost matrix `cost[i][j]` contains the cost to connect point `i` from the first group to point `j` from the second group.

### Strategy

To tackle this problem, a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach is suitable. We define a state in our DP which allows us to efficiently compute the minimum cost dynamically.

We'll use a bitmask to keep track of the connections to the second group:
- **DP State**: Let `dp[i][mask]` be the minimum cost to cover all points in the first group up to the `i-th` point, with `mask` representing the set of points in the second group that have been connected.

### Dynamic Programming Recurrence:
1. **Base Case**: When no points in the first group are connected (`i = 0`), the cost is zero.
2. **Transition**: Iterate over all points in the first group and compute costs for connecting them to the second group while updating the `mask`.

Using a 2D DP table where the first dimension is the point index in the first group, and the second dimension is the bitmask for the second group, we can compute the desired solution iteratively.

### Code

Here's a detailed C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int connectTwoGroups(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& cost) {
        int n = cost.size();
        int m = cost[0].size();
        int fullMask = (1 << m) - 1;
        
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(1 << m, INT_MAX));
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int mask = 0; mask <= fullMask; ++mask) {
                if (dp[i][mask] == INT_MAX) continue;
                for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                    dp[i + 1][mask | (1 << j)] = std::min(dp[i + 1][mask | (1 << j)], dp[i][mask] + cost[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = INT_MAX;
        for (int mask = 0; mask <= fullMask; ++mask) {
            int sum = dp[n][mask];
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                if ((mask & (1 << j)) == 0) {
                    int minCost = INT_MAX;
                    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                        minCost = std::min(minCost, cost[i][j]);
                    }
                    sum += minCost;
                }
            }
            result = std::min(result, sum);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **State Space**: There are \`O(n * 2^m)\` states.
- **Transition**: Each state relies on iterating over all points in the second group.
- **Overall Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n * m * 2^m), where \`n\` is the number of points in the first group and \`m\` is the number of points in the second group.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible connection sets optimally using dynamic programming combined with bitmasking.
