[Leetcode 2213. Longest Substring of One Repeating Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2213)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `queryCharacters` and an integer array `queryIndices`, both of length `k`. Initially, you have the string `s`. For the `i-th` query, you need to update the `s[queryIndices[i]]` character of `s` to `queryCharacters[i]`. Return an array representing the length of the longest substring containing the same character after each query.

### Example 1:
- Input: 
  - `s = "babacc"`
  - `queryCharacters = ['b', 'b', 'b']`
  - `queryIndices = [1, 3, 3]`
- Output: `[3, 3, 4]`
- Explanation:
  - After updating `s[1]` to 'b', the string becomes `"bbbacc"`, with longest repeating substring "bbb".
  - After updating `s[3]` to 'b', the string becomes `"bbbbcc"`, with longest repeating substring "bbbb".
  - After updating `s[3]` to 'b' again, string remains `"bbbbcc"`, with longest repeating substring "bbbb".

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Am I allowed to modify the string directly on each query?**
   - Yes, you are allowed to modify the string directly for each query.
   
2. **Should the final output list contain the lengths after each individual query or condition?**
   - Yes, the list should contain the maximum length of a substring containing the same character after executing each query sequentially.

3. **Do queries in `queryCharacters` and `queryIndices` arrays have the same length always?**
   - Yes, both arrays `queryCharacters` and `queryIndices` will always have the same length `k`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Initial Longest Substring Calculation:** 
   - We need to find the initial longest substring of the same character.

2. **Modification and Update:**
   - For each query, update the specified character in the string.
   - Recalculate the longest substring of the same character only in the potentially affected regions of the string. The entire string does not need to be rescanned unless it's the first calculation. This can be done by considering the left, right, and the modified character impacts.

3. **Tracking Changes Efficiently:**
   - As characters are modified, the longest substring might or might not change, but it should be calculated efficiently around the modified indexes.

4. **Data Structures:**
   - Use an array or a linked list to hold the length of consecutive characters.
   - Take special care of handling edge cases like modifying characters at the boundaries.

## Code

Here's a C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate initial longest substring length of the same character
int getLongestSubstring(const string& s) {
    int maxLen = 0, currentLen = 1;
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == s[i-1]) {
            currentLen++;
        } else {
            maxLen = max(maxLen, currentLen);
            currentLen = 1;
        }
    }
    maxLen = max(maxLen, currentLen);
    return maxLen;
}

vector<int> longestRepeatingSubstring(string s, vector<char>& queryCharacters, vector<int>& queryIndices) {
    vector<int> result;
    int longest = getLongestSubstring(s);

    for (size_t i = 0; i < queryCharacters.size(); ++i) {
        char oldChar = s[queryIndices[i]];
        char newChar = queryCharacters[i];

        if (oldChar != newChar) {
            s[queryIndices[i]] = newChar;
            int left = queryIndices[i], right = queryIndices[i];
            
            // Extend left
            while (left - 1 >= 0 && s[left] == s[left - 1]) left--;
            // Extend right
            while (right + 1 < s.size() && s[right] == s[right + 1]) right++;
            
            longest = max(longest, right - left + 1);
        }

        result.push_back(longest);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Pre-processing (initial longest substring calculation):** O(n)
- **For each query:** O(n) in the worst case, as finding the left and right boundaries could potentially scan the entire string.
- **Total Complexity:** O(k * n) where `k` is the number of queries and `n` is the length of the string. 

This approach takes into account the linear traversal of the string for each modification, though each query tries to minimize recalculations by focusing only on the affected region around the change.
