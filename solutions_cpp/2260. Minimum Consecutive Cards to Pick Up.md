[Leetcode 2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2260)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are considered consecutive if they are in adjacent positions within the array.

Your task is to find the minimum number of consecutive cards you need to pick up such that there is at least one `pair` of cards with the same value among them. If no such pair exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Card Values**: Can the card values be negative, or are they always non-negative integers?
   - **Assumption**: The card values are non-negative integers.
  
2. **Array Length**: Is there a constraint on the length of the cards array?
   - **Assumption**: The length of the cards array fits within standard input size constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if the `cards` array is empty or has only one card?
   - **Assumption**: If the `cards` array is empty or has only one card, return -1 as no pair can exist.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window with HashMap**:
   - Use a hashmap to track the last seen index of each card value.
   - Iterate over the `cards` array while maintaining the minimum length of the window that contains at least one pair of cards with the same value.
   - Update this minimum length whenever a duplicate card value is found.
   
2. **Key Points**:
   - Traverse the `cards` array while keeping track of the last position of each card value using a hashmap.
   - Compute the distance between the current position and the last position where the same card value was seen to determine the length of the window.
   - Update the minimum window length whenever a smaller valid window is found.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of cards. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, k)), where k is the range of card values (in the worst case, we may store all values in the hashmap).

### Code
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCardPickup(vector<int>& cards) {
        unordered_map<int, int> lastIndex;
        int minLength = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < cards.size(); ++i) {
            int card = cards[i];
            if (lastIndex.find(card) != lastIndex.end()) {
                minLength = min(minLength, i - lastIndex[card] + 1);
            }
            lastIndex[card] = i;
        }
        
        return minLength == INT_MAX ? -1 : minLength;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- We maintain an `unordered_map<int, int> lastIndex` to store the last seen index of each card.
- We initialize `minLength` to `INT_MAX`. This will hold the minimum window length that contains a pair of cards with the same value.
- As we iterate over the card array:
  - If the card has been seen before (exists in `lastIndex`), we calculate the window length from the last seen index to the current index and update `minLength`.
  - Update the last seen index of the current card.
- After processing all cards, if `minLength` remains `INT_MAX`, it indicates no pairs were found, and we return -1.
- Otherwise, we return `minLength`.
