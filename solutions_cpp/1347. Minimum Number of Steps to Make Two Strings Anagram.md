[Leetcode 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1347)
### Problem Statement:

Given two equal-size strings `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose any character of `t` and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Are both strings `s` and `t` guaranteed to be the same length?
      - **Yes.**
    - What are the character sets of the strings? Are they lowercase English letters?
      - **Yes, the strings contain only lowercase English letters.**
      
2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return an integer which is the minimum number of steps required?
      - **Yes, an integer value.**

### Strategy:

1. **Counter Arrays**:
    - Use two arrays to count the occurrences of each character in strings `s` and `t`.
    - Calculate how many characters need to be changed in `t` to make it an anagram of `s`.

2. **Calculation**:
    - Traverse through the frequency arrays and count the differences where `s` has more characters than `t`.
    - Sum these differences to get the minimum number of changes required.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(std::string s, std::string t) {
        std::vector<int> countS(26, 0), countT(26, 0);
        
        for (char c : s) {
            countS[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : t) {
            countT[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int steps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (countS[i] > countT[i]) {
                steps += countS[i] - countT[i];
            }
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Counting the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t` takes O(n), where `n` is the length of the strings.
  - Comparing and calculating the steps taken from the frequency arrays takes O(26), which is a constant time operation.
  - Overall time complexity: **O(n)**.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Two additional arrays of size 26 are used to store character frequencies.
  - Overall space complexity: **O(1)** as 26 is a constant.
