[Leetcode 3218. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3218)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the side length of a square cake of size `n x n` and an array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a possible cut position. You want to make cuts at all the positions denoted in the array `cuts`, and you can cut either horizontally or vertically. Note that you must make the cuts in the specified order, and cutting the cake into smaller pieces costs money proportional to the larger dimension of the remaining piece of cake.

Return the minimum total cost of making all cuts.

### Example
```cpp
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16

Explanation:
Perform the cuts in the following order:
- Cut at position 1: Cake changes from size 7 x 7 to 1 x 7 and 6 x 7 (cost: 7, as the larger dimension is 7)
- Cut at position 3: Cake changes to 1 x 7, 2 x 7, and 4 x 7 (cost: 7, as the larger dimension is 7)
- Cut at position 4: Cake changes to 1 x 7, 2 x 7, 3 x 7, and 1 x 7 (cost: 7, as the larger dimension is 7)
- Cut at position 5: Cake changes to 1 x 7, 2 x 7, 3 x 7, 1 x 1, and 5 x 5 (cost: 5, as the larger dimension is 5)
Total cost = 7 + 7 + 7 + 5 = 26
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we always assume that the cake is cut in the given order of the `cuts` array?
2. Are the cuts always provided in a sorted order, or do we need to sort them ourselves?
3. Can `cuts` contain duplicate values?
4. Are there constraints on the length of `cuts` array and the value of `n`?

## Strategy

The problem can be approached as a dynamic programming (DP) problem. Here are the steps to solve it:

1. **Sort the Cuts**: To manage the problem, make sure the cuts array is sorted.
2. **Define DP State**:
   - `dp[i][j]` will denote the minimum cost to make cuts within the subsegment from cut `i` to cut `j`.
3. **Base Case**:
   - If there are no cuts needed between `i` and `j`, the cost is 0.
4. **Transition**:
   - For each possible cut between `i` and `j`, calculate the cost of making that cut plus the cost of making the remaining cuts inside the two resulting segments.
5. **Final Answer**:
   - The optimal answer will be stored in `dp[0][cuts.size() - 1]`, which considers all cuts.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cuts) {
        // Include the edges of the cake in the cuts array
        cuts.push_back(0);
        cuts.push_back(n);
        sort(cuts.begin(), cuts.end());
        
        int m = cuts.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(m, 0));
        
        // dp[i][j] will denote the minimum cost to cut the segment from cuts[i] to cuts[j]
        for (int len = 2; len < m; ++len) { // start from smallest segment length to the largest
            for (int i = 0; i < m - len; ++i) {
                int j = i + len; // ends at j
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cuts[j] - cuts[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][m-1];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> cuts = {1, 3, 4, 5};
    int n = 7;
    cout << sol.minCost(n, cuts) << endl; // Output: 16
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the cuts array takes O(k log k), where `k` is the number of cuts.
- The main DP solution involves filling a DP table of size `k x k`, and for each cell, we potentially look at all other cells between `i` and `j`, making it O(k^3) in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(k^3), where `k` is the number of elements in the `cuts` array.
