[Leetcode 2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2070)
Sure! Let's walk through solving the LeetCode problem "2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query" using C++. Here's the approach displayed in structured sections:

### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `items` where `items[i] = [pricei, beautyi]` denotes the price and beauty of an item. You are also given an integer array `queries` where `queries[j]` denotes the maximum price you are willing to pay for an item.

For each `queries[j]`, find the maximum beauty of an item that you can buy with at most `queries[j]` price. If no such item exists, the answer to that query is `0`.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of `items` and `queries`?
2. Can we assume all prices and beauties are positive integers?
3. Should the output maintain the order of queries as they are provided in the input?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<int> maximumBeauty(vector<vector<int>>& items, vector<int>& queries) {
    // Sort items by price
    sort(items.begin(), items.end());
    
    // Create a pairs of price and maximum beauty up to that price
    vector<pair<int, int>> maxBeauty;
    int currentMaxBeauty = 0;
    for (const auto& item : items) {
        currentMaxBeauty = max(currentMaxBeauty, item[1]);
        maxBeauty.emplace_back(item[0], currentMaxBeauty);
    }
    
    // Processing the queries
    vector<int> results(queries.size());
    
    for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
        int query = queries[i];
        // Binary search to find the maximum beauty for the given price
        auto it = upper_bound(maxBeauty.begin(), maxBeauty.end(), make_pair(query, INT_MAX));
        
        if (it == maxBeauty.begin()) {
            results[i] = 0; // No items can be bought with the given price
        } else {
            --it; // Step back to find the valid item
            results[i] = it->second;
        }
    }
    
    return results;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Items**: Start by sorting the items based on their prices. This helps in efficiently accessing items up to a certain price.
2. **Track Maximum Beauty**: Traverse the sorted items and keep track of the maximum beauty observed so far. Store these values as pairs of (price, max_beauty).
3. **Binary Search for Queries**: For each query, use binary search to find the highest price that is less than or equal to the query price. Return the corresponding beauty value.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Items**: O(n log n), where n is the number of items.
2. **Creating the maxBeauty List**: O(n), as we simply traverse the sorted items list once.
3. **Processing Queries**: Each query involves a binary search, which is O(log n). Therefore, for q queries, this becomes O(q log n).

Combining these gives an overall time complexity of **O(n log n + q log n)**, where n is the number of items and q is the number of queries.
