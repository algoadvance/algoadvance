[Leetcode 1172. Dinner Plate Stacks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1172)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1172: **Dinner Plate Stacks**

You have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and each stack has a fixed capacity. Implement the `DinnerPlates` class:

- `DinnerPlates(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the capacity of each stack.
- `void push(int val)` Pushes the given integer `val` into the leftmost stack with size less than `capacity`.
- `int pop()` Returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack, or returns `-1` if all stacks are empty.
- `int popAtStack(int index)` Returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index and removes it from that stack, or returns `-1` if the stack is empty.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should we assume about the initial state of the stacks?
   - All stacks start empty.

2. How to handle the situation when performing `popAtStack` with an index that is out of bounds?
   - Return `-1` if the index is out of bounds or the stack at the given index is empty.

3. Are there any constraints on the values of the input integers?
   - The values could be any valid integer.

4. Can I assume that all operations will fit within practical memory limits for real applications? 
   - Yes.

5. What should be done if a stack reaches its capacity and another `push` operation occurs?
   - A new stack should be created to accommodate additional items if all current stacks are full.

## Strategy

To efficiently manage the operations described, we can use:
- A vector of stacks to hold the data.
- A priority queue (min-heap) to quickly find the leftmost stack that has available capacity.
- Another priority queue (max-heap) to find the rightmost non-empty stack for pop operations.

The operations will be implemented as follows:
- **push**: Push to the leftmost stack with available capacity.
- **pop**: Pop from the rightmost non-empty stack.
- **popAtStack**: Pop from the specified stack if it has elements.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <queue>

class DinnerPlates {
private:
    int capacity;
    std::vector<std::stack<int>> stacks;
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> available;
    std::priority_queue<int> non_empty;
    
public:
    DinnerPlates(int capacity) : capacity(capacity) {}

    void push(int val) {
        cleanAvailable();
        if (available.empty()) {
            stacks.push_back(std::stack<int>());
            available.push(stacks.size() - 1);
        }
        int idx = available.top();
        stacks[idx].push(val);
        non_empty.push(idx);
        if (stacks[idx].size() == capacity) available.pop();
    }

    int pop() {
        cleanNonEmpty();
        if (non_empty.empty()) return -1;
        int idx = non_empty.top();
        int val = stacks[idx].top();
        stacks[idx].pop();
        if (stacks[idx].empty()) non_empty.pop();
        available.push(idx);
        return val;
    }

    int popAtStack(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= stacks.size() || stacks[index].empty()) return -1;
        int val = stacks[index].top();
        stacks[index].pop();
        available.push(index);
        return val;
    }

private:
    void cleanAvailable() {
        while (!available.empty() && stacks[available.top()].size() == capacity) {
            available.pop();
        }
    }

    void cleanNonEmpty() {
        while (!non_empty.empty() && stacks[non_empty.top()].empty()) {
            non_empty.pop();
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **push**: Average and worst-case O(log n), where n is the number of stacks (due to priority queue operations).
- **pop**: Average and worst-case O(log n).
- **popAtStack**: Average and worst-case O(log n) for clean-up, plus O(1) for the actual pop operation.

This design ensures effective utilization of available capacity while keeping the operations efficient.
