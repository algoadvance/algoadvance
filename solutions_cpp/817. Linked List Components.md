[Leetcode 817. Linked List Components](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l817)
### Problem Statement:
We are given the head of a linked list and an array `nums` that is a subset of the elements in the linked list. The goal is to determine the number of connected components in the linked list that are formed by the elements in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is meant by "connected components"?**
   - A connected component is a maximal subset of nodes such that every two nodes are either directly connected or are connected through other nodes in the subset.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the linked list or `nums` array?**
   - Yes, typically there's a constraint on the length. For example:
     - The length of the linked list will be in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
     - The size of the array `nums` will be in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
     - The values must always be unique and present in the linked list.

### Strategy:
1. **Create a Set of Nums:**
   - Convert the array `nums` into a set to allow O(1) average time complexity for checking membership.

2. **Traverse the Linked List:**
   - As we traverse the linked list, keep track of whether we are currently in a component by checking if a node’s value is in the set and whether it’s the start of a new component.

3. **Count Components:** 
   - Count transitions from a non-member node to a member node in `nums`.

### Code:
Here's how you can implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode* next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int numComponents(ListNode* head, std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Create a set of nums for efficient lookup
        std::unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        ListNode* current = head;
        int componentCount = 0;
        bool inComponent = false;

        // Traverse the linked list
        while (current != nullptr) {
            // Check if current node is in nums
            if (numSet.find(current->val) != numSet.end()) {
                // If we're not already in a component, we've found a new component
                if (!inComponent) {
                    componentCount++;
                    inComponent = true;
                }
            } else {
                // If current node is not in nums, we're not in a component
                inComponent = false;
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
        return componentCount;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Construction of numSet:** O(n), where n is the size of `nums`.
- **Traversal of linked list:** O(L), where L is the length of the linked list.
- Overall time complexity is **O(L + n)**.

### Space Complexity:
- Using a set to store `nums` requires O(n) space.
  
Thus, this approach is efficient and well-suited for the problem constraints.
