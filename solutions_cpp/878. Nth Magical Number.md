[Leetcode 878. Nth Magical Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l878)
### Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, you are tasked with finding the `n`th magical number. A number is considered magical if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.

Return the `n`th magical number modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What are the upper limits of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \)?
     - According to LeetCode, up to \( 10^9 \).
   - Should we anticipate any special cases such as \( a = b \)?
     - No need for special handling; the logic handles this inherently.
  
2. **Output:**
   - Should we return the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \)?
     - Yes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a binary search combined with number theory (Least Common Multiple, LCM) can be used effectively. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - We initialize a search range from 1 to \( 10^9 \times \min(a, b) \), because the `n`th magical number must be within this range.

2. **Calculate LCM:**
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` can be calculated using \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - Define and apply a helper function that counts magical numbers up to a given number `x`.
   - The function `\text{count\_magical\_up\_to}(x)` returns the count of numbers up to `x` that are divisible by either `a` or `b`. This can be determined as:
     - \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{x}{b} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{x}{\text{LCM}(a, b)} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Finding the Nth Magical Number:**
   - Use the above helper in a binary search to find the smallest number `m` such that \( \text{count\_magical\_up\_to}(m) \) is at least `n`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int nthMagicalNumber(int n, int a, int b) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        long long lcm = (long long)a * (b / gcd(a, b));
        
        auto countMagicalUpTo = [&](long long x) {
            return x / a + x / b - x / lcm;
        };
        
        long long low = 1;
        long long high = static_cast<long long>(n) * min(a, b);
        
        while (low < high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (countMagicalUpTo(mid) < n) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return low % MOD;
    }
    
private:
    int gcd(int x, int y) {
        while (y != 0) {
            int temp = y;
            y = x % y;
            x = temp;
        }
        return x;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 5, a = 2, b = 3;
    cout << solution.nthMagicalNumber(n, a, b) << endl;  // Expected output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log(n \cdot \text{min}(a, b))) \times O(\log(\text{max}(a, b))) \).
  - The binary search runs in \( O(\log(n \cdot \text{min}(a, b))) \).
  - Counting magical numbers involves division and GCD, each of which is approximately \( O(\log(\text{max}(a, b))) \).

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), since only a few extra variables are used regardless of the input size.

This solution provides an efficient method to determine the \( n \)th magical number, ensuring correctness through binary search and number theory principles.
