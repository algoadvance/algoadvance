[Leetcode 1001. Grid Illumination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1001)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a grid of size `N x N` and an array `lamps` of lamp positions, where each lamp position is represented as `[x, y]`. Each lamp illuminates every square on their row, column, and both diagonals (top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left).

You are also given an array `queries`, where each query represents a position `[x, y]`. For each query, determine whether the query position is illuminated or not. If it is illuminated, return `1`; otherwise, return `0`. Additionally, after checking each query, turn off any lamps that are located at the query position or adjacent to it.

The grid's upper-left corner is `(0, 0)` and the bottom-right corner is `(N-1, N-1)`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are lamp positions unique?** 
    - Yes, assume there are no duplicate positions in the `lamps` array.

2. **What should be the initial state of a grid cell?**
    - Initially, assume all cells are turned off and only become illuminated when there is a lamp that affects them.

3. **Is it possible for the `queries` array to contain duplicate positions?**
    - Yes, the same position can appear multiple times in the `queries`.

4. **What are the constraints on `N`, the size of the grid?**
    - N is in the range [1, 10^9], which implies large grids and indicates efficient handling is required.

5. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `lamps` and `queries` arrays?**
    - They are not specified, but let's assume they are feasible within typical competitive programming limits.

## Strategy:
1. **Data Structures:** Use hash maps to efficiently manage counts of illuminated rows, columns, and diagonals.
2. **Lighting a Lamp:** When a lamp is placed, it increases the count of illuminations on its row, column, and both diagonals.
3. **Query:** For each query, check if it's illuminated by checking counts of its row, column, or diagonals.
4. **Turning Off Lamps:** After a query, turn off the lamp at the queried position and its adjacent cells. Adjust counts accordingly.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> gridIllumination(int N, vector<vector<int>>& lamps, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        unordered_map<int, int> row, col, diag1, diag2;
        unordered_set<pair<int, int>, pair_hash> lamp_set;
        
        auto add_lamp = [&](int x, int y) {
            if (lamp_set.emplace(x, y).second) {
                ++row[x];
                ++col[y];
                ++diag1[x - y];
                ++diag2[x + y];
            }
        };
        
        for (const auto& lamp : lamps) {
            add_lamp(lamp[0], lamp[1]);
        }
        
        auto remove_lamp = [&](int x, int y) {
            if (lamp_set.erase({x, y})) {
                if (--row[x] == 0) row.erase(x);
                if (--col[y] == 0) col.erase(y);
                if (--diag1[x - y] == 0) diag1.erase(x - y);
                if (--diag2[x + y] == 0) diag2.erase(x + y);
            }
        };
        
        vector<int> result;
        static const vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {1, 1}, {-1, -1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}};
        
        for (const auto& query : queries) {
            int x = query[0], y = query[1];
            if (row.count(x) || col.count(y) || diag1.count(x - y) || diag2.count(x + y)) {
                result.push_back(1);
            } else {
                result.push_back(0);
            }
            
            for (const auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir.first, ny = y + dir.second;
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < N && ny >= 0 && ny < N) {
                    remove_lamp(nx, ny);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

private:
    struct pair_hash {
        inline size_t operator()(const pair<int, int>& v) const {
            return v.first * 31 + v.second;
        }
    };
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Initialization:** O(L), where L is the number of lamps.
- **Query Processing:** Each query is processed in O(1) for checking illumination and O(1) for removing up to 9 lamp positions (adjacent and current), yielding O(1) per query.
- **Overall:** Total time complexity is O(L + Q) where Q is the number of queries.
