[Leetcode 2080. Range Frequency Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2080)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of integers `arr` and a list of queries `queries`. Each query is of the form `(left, right, value)`, where `left` and `right` are indices within the array `arr` and `value` is an integer. For each query, you need to return the frequency of the given `value` in the subarray of `arr` that starts at `left` and ends at `right` (inclusive).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range Boundaries**: Are the `left` and `right` values inclusive?
   - Yes, both `left` and `right` values are inclusive boundaries.
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and `queries`?
   - Are the values in `arr` within a specific range (e.g., only positive integers, any integers)?
   - How should we handle out-of-bound indices in the queries, or do we assume all indices are valid?

### Strategy
To efficiently handle multiple range frequency queries, the following steps can be taken:
1. **Pre-processing**:
   - Maintain a dictionary `occurrences` where each key is a distinct value in `arr` and each value is a list of indices where this specific value appears in `arr`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(left, right, value)`, utilize the pre-processed `occurrences` map to count how many times the `value` appears between the indices `left` and `right`.

To count the number of times a value appears between `left` and `right`, binary search can be used since the indices list for each value will be sorted. This will improve the efficiency of the count operation.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class RangeFreqQuery {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> occurrences;

public:
    RangeFreqQuery(std::vector<int>& arr) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
            occurrences[arr[i]].push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    int query(int left, int right, int value) {
        if (occurrences.find(value) == occurrences.end()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        const std::vector<int>& indices = occurrences[value];
        // Find the insert positions using binary search
        auto left_it = std::lower_bound(indices.begin(), indices.end(), left);
        auto right_it = std::upper_bound(indices.begin(), indices.end(), right);
        
        // Distance between the iterators gives the count of elements in range
        return std::distance(left_it, right_it);
    }
};

// Example usage:
// std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3};
// RangeFreqQuery rfq(arr);
// int result = rfq.query(1, 4, 2); // Should return 2
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Pre-processing**:
   - Building the `occurrences` map requires iterating over the entire array. This step is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - Each query uses binary search within the list of indices. The time complexity of each binary search is `O(log m)` where `m` is the number of occurrences of the `value` in `arr`. Given that we perform two binary searches, the overall query processing would be `O(log m)` for each query.

Overall, this approach ensures efficient query processing after an initial linear-time preprocessing step.
