[Leetcode 1034. Coloring A Border](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1034)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `row`, `col`, and `color`. Each value in the grid represents the color of the cell.

The given `cell` represents the starting point `(row, col)`, and you must change the color of all cells connected to this cell. Two cells are connected if they have the same color and share at least one side.

The border of a connected component is all the cells connected to the starting cell that either face the outer border of the grid or whose neighbors have a different color.

Change the color of all border cells to the given `color`.

Return the final grid.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,2]], row = 0, col = 0, color = 3
Output: [[3,3],[3,2]]
```

### Constraints
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- 1 <= grid[i][j], color <= 1000
- 0 <= row < m
- 0 <= col < n

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Connected Cells Definition**: Cells are only considered connected if they share an edge and have the same initial color, correct?
   - Yes, thatâ€™s correct.
2. **Grid Modification**: When we modify the border cells to the new color, other inner cells should remain unchanged even if they are part of the same connected component?
   - Yes, only border cells need to be changed to the new color.

## Strategy
1. **DFS/BFS for Connected Component**: We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all cells in the connected component starting from `(row, col)`.
2. **Identify Border Cells**: During the traversal, we identify cells on the border:
   - Cells on the edge of the grid.
   - Cells adjacent to a different color.
3. **Temporary Marking**: We will temporarily mark visited cells to avoid revisiting them.
4. **Change Border Color**: Once we identify border cells, we modify their color to the new specified color.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int initialColor, vector<vector<int>>& visited, vector<pair<int, int>>& borders) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        visited[x][y] = true;
        
        int directions[4][2] = {{0,1},{0,-1},{1,0},{-1,0}};
        bool isBorder = false;

        for (auto dir : directions) {
            int newX = x + dir[0];
            int newY = y + dir[1];
            if (newX < 0 || newY < 0 || newX >= m || newY >= n || grid[newX][newY] != initialColor) {
                isBorder = true;
            } else if (!visited[newX][newY]) {
                dfs(grid, newX, newY, initialColor, visited, borders);
            }
        }

        if (isBorder) {
            borders.push_back({x, y});
        }
    }

    vector<vector<int>> colorBorder(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int row, int col, int color) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> visited(m, vector<int>(n, false));
        vector<pair<int, int>> borders;
        int initialColor = grid[row][col];

        dfs(grid, row, col, initialColor, visited, borders);

        for (auto borderCell : borders) {
            grid[borderCell.first][borderCell.second] = color;
        }

        return grid;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **DFS Traversal**: O(m * n). In the worst case, we might visit every cell in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the `visited` array and the recursion call stack.

This solution ensures that all border cells of the connected component are correctly identified and modified according to the given color.
