[Leetcode 3148. Maximum Difference Score in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3148)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid `grid` consisting of non-negative integers. You can move from any cell `(i, j)` to any other cell `(k, l)` within the grid to maximize or minimize a certain score.

The score is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value in the path from the start cell to the end cell. You need to return the maximum difference score you can achieve by any valid path within the grid.

Example: 
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[1,3,5],[2,8,4],[1,6,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The path that gives the maximum difference is from cell (0,0) to cell (1,1) or from cell (1,1) to cell (2,1), which both give a difference of 7 (8 - 1).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are diagonal movements allowed?**
   - For this problem, assuming only up, down, left, right movements are allowed unless specified otherwise.

2. **Is the grid guaranteed to contain at least one row and one column?**
   - Yes, otherwise the problem wouldn't make sense.

3. **Should we consider paths that enter and exit the same cell to have a difference of 0?**
   - Yes, because the score is calculated by the difference between the maximum and minimum value in a path, and if the path starts and ends at the same cell, the difference is 0.

4. **Does the path allow revisiting cells?**
   - Assuming that cells can be revisited but the same cell will not contribute further value beyond its initial encounter in the difference computation.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Strategy**: Since we need to evaluate a score for every possible path, we can use BFS to explore all possible paths from each starting cell.
   - For each cell (i, j), use BFS to explore all reachable cells.
   - Keep track of the maximum and minimum values encountered in the current path.
   - Calculate the score (difference between max and min) for each path and update the maximum score found.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: Alternatively, to avoid recomputing paths repeatedly, we can use a dynamic programming approach where we store intermediate results and reuse them.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Grid with all identical elements where the max difference should be 0.
   - Small-sized grids, particularly 1x1.

## Time Complexity
- The BFS approach will have a time complexity in a worst-case scenario of \(O(m^2 \times n^2)\) due to visiting each cell multiple times in multiple paths.
- Space Complexity will be at least \(O(m \times n)\) for the grid itself and potentially more depending on the tracking mechanism used for states in BFS or DP.

## Code
Hereâ€™s an implementation using a DFS strategy combined with memoization:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int m, n;
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp;

    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, int maxVal, int minVal) {
        // Base case: Boundaries and revisiting
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || dp[i][j][1] != -1)
            return maxVal - minVal;

        // Update max and min values
        maxVal = max(maxVal, grid[i][j]);
        minVal = min(minVal, grid[i][j]);

        // Memoization
        dp[i][j][1] = maxVal;
        dp[i][j][0] = minVal;

        int maxScore = maxVal - minVal;
        for(auto& dir : directions) {
            int ni = i + dir[0], nj = j + dir[1];
            if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n) {
                maxScore = max(maxScore, dfs(grid, ni, nj, maxVal, minVal));
            }
        }

        return maxScore;
    }

    int maxDifferenceScore(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        m = grid.size();
        n = grid[0].size();
        int maxScore = 0;
        dp = vector<vector<vector<int>>>(m, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(2, -1)));

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                maxScore = max(maxScore, dfs(grid, i, j, grid[i][j], grid[i][j]));
            }
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
};
```
