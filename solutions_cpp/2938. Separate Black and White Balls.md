[Leetcode 2938. Separate Black and White Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2938)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of "B" and "W", where 'B' represents Black balls and 'W' represents White balls, separate all the black balls and white balls so that black balls appear first and white balls appear later. Your function should return the rearranged string.

### Example:
- **Input:** `s = "BWWBW"`
- **Output:** `"BBWW"`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can we assume the input string only contains the characters 'B' and 'W'?
   - **A:** Yes, the input string will only contain 'B' for black balls and 'W' for white balls.
2. **Q:** What should we return if the input string is empty?
   - **A:** Return an empty string.
3. **Q:** Is the order of the black or white balls important among themselves?
   - **A:** No, the order within black or white balls is not important as long as all black balls come before any white balls.

## Strategy
1. **Counting Approach:** 
   - Traverse the string to count the number of 'B's and 'W's.
   - Construct the new string by adding the counted number of 'B's followed by the counted number of 'W's.

2. **Two-pointer Approach:** 
   - This involves one pass to move all 'B's to the beginning and 'W's to the end.
   - This approach may be more space-efficient if done in-place.

In this solution, we will be using the **Counting Approach** for its simplicity and ease of implementation.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string separateBalls(string s) {
    int countB = 0;
    int countW = 0;
    
    // Count the number of 'B's and 'W's
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (ch == 'B') {
            countB++;
        } else if (ch == 'W') {
            countW++;
        }
    }
    
    // Create the new sorted string
    string result(countB, 'B');
    result.append(countW, 'W');
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "BWWBW";
    cout << "Output: " << separateBalls(s) << endl;  // Output should be "BBWW"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because both the counting and string construction operations each take linear time.

1. **Counting loop:** O(n)
2. **Constructing result string:** O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**. The space complexity is also **O(n)** because of the new string construction.
