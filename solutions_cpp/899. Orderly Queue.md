[Leetcode 899. Orderly Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l899)
Certainly! Let's break down the approach to solving the LeetCode problem 899: Orderly Queue in C++.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, we can choose one of the first `k` letters of `s` and append it to the end of the string. What is the lexicographically smallest string we could achieve after any number of moves?

### Example:
- Input: s = "cba", k = 1
- Output: "acb"

- Input: s = "baaca", k = 3
- Output: "aaabc"

## Clarification Questions

1. **Q:** Is the input string always non-empty?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem guarantees a non-empty string.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of `k` in relation to the length of the string `s`?
   - **A:** `k` will always be within the range `[1, s.length()]`.

3. **Q:** Can `k` be greater than the length of the string?
   - **A:** No, `k` will be at most equal to the length of the string.

## Strategy
The problem has two distinct cases based on the value of `k`:

1. If `k == 1`, we can only move the first character of `s` to the end of the string, so we should consider all possible rotations of the string and return the smallest one.
2. If `k > 1`, we can simulate the effect of having more freedom for sorting. In this case, having more than one slot to choose from means weâ€™re not constrained by the rotation approach alone; we can essentially sort the entire string to get the lexicographically smallest string.

### Simplified Steps:
- **Case 1:** k == 1
  - Generate all rotations of the string `s` and find the smallest rotation lexicographically.
  
- **Case 2:** k > 1
  - Sort the string `s` directly and return the sorted string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string orderlyQueue(string s, int k) {
    if (k == 1) {
        string smallest = s;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            string rotated = s.substr(i) + s.substr(0, i);
            if (rotated < smallest) {
                smallest = rotated;
            }
        }
        return smallest;
    } else {
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        return s;
    }
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    string s = "cba";
    int k = 1;
    cout << orderlyQueue(s, k) << endl;  // Output: "acb"
    
    s = "baaca";
    k = 3;
    cout << orderlyQueue(s, k) << endl;  // Output: "aaabc"

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Case 1 (k == 1):**
   - Generating and comparing all rotations: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Case 2 (k > 1):**
   - Sorting the string: O(n log n).

In summary, the algorithm handles different scenarios based on the value of `k` efficiently and provides the lexicographically smallest string as required.
