[Leetcode 684. Redundant Connection](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l684)
## Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from 1 to `n`, with one additional edge added. The extra edge can be any edge that connects two previously connected nodes in the tree, thus forming a cycle. Our task is to find and return the redundant edge that can be removed to make the graph a tree of `n` nodes.

Formally, the graph is represented by a 2D-array of edges. Each element of `edges` is a pair `[u, v]` that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes `u` and `v`.

We need to implement a function `vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges)` that returns the redundant edge that can be removed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can we assume that the input graph will indeed contain exactly one cycle due to one additional edge?
     - Yes, the problem guarantees one redundant connection will form one cycle.

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be the specific edge that when removed keeps the graph as a tree?
     - Yes, output the redundant edge.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we handle cases with the minimum input size, i.e., edges contain only three nodes and two edges?
     - Yes, the function needs to handle the minimal case gracefully.

## Strategy

To find the redundant connection, we use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure. This structure helps to efficiently manage and trace the connected components of the graph.

The approach involves:
1. **Union-Find Initialization:**
   - Creating a parent array to keep track of the representative (or parent) of each node.
   - Creating a rank array to keep the tree flat by attaching smaller trees under larger trees.

2. **Processing each edge:**
   - For each edge (u, v), check if `u` and `v` are already in the same connected component using `find`.
   - If they are in the same component (introduces a cycle), return the edge.
   - Otherwise, union the sets containing `u` and `v`.

3. **Union and Find Functions:**
   - `find(x)`: Recursively find the parent of `x` and perform path compression.
   - `union(x, y)`: Attach trees representing `x` and `y` by size/rank.

By using Union-Find, we efficiently manage the connectivity information and detect the redundant edge.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is nearly O(n), due to the almost constant time operations provided by the Union-Find with path compression and union by rank. Specifically, it is O(α(n)) per operation, where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> parent(n + 1);
        vector<int> rank(n + 1, 1);

        // Initialize parent array where each node is its own parent
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }

        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            if (find(parent, u) == find(parent, v)) {
                return {u, v};
            }
            unionSets(parent, rank, u, v);
        }

        // In a valid input according to problem statement, this line should never be reached.
        return {};
    }

private:
    int find(vector<int>& parent, int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x]);  // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unionSets(vector<int>& parent, vector<int>& rank, int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(parent, x);
        int rootY = find(parent, y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

This code uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently detect and return the redundant edge that introduces a cycle in the given graph.
