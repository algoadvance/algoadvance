[Leetcode 553. Optimal Division](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l553)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. The adjacent integers in `nums` will perform division operations following the order of appearance. For example, given the array `nums = [1000, 100, 10, 2]`, we have to find the optimal way to parenthesize the division to get the maximum result.

Return a string that describes the sequence of division operations that will yield the maximum result.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `nums` contain negative integers?
   - **A:** No, `nums` will contain only positive integers.

2. **Q:** What is the minimum length of `nums`?
   - **A:** The length of `nums` will be at least 1.

3. **Q:** How should we handle the case when `nums` has only one element?
   - **A:** Simply return the only element in string format as no division can be performed.

## Strategy

To maximize the result of the division, we need to minimize the denominator part by dividing the largest numerator by the smallest possible denominator. This means that we should divide the first number by the result of all subsequent numbers divided together. 

Given `nums = [a1, a2, ..., an]`:

The optimal division can be represented as:
```
a1 / (a2 / a3 / ... / an)
```

If the length of `nums` is 1, return `a1` directly.
If the length of `nums` is 2, return the result in the form of `a1 / a2`.

For any `n > 2`, return in the form of `a1 / (a2 / a3 / ... / an)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string optimalDivision(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 1) {
        return std::to_string(nums[0]);
    }
    if (n == 2) {
        return std::to_string(nums[0]) + "/" + std::to_string(nums[1]);
    }
    
    std::string result = std::to_string(nums[0]) + "/(" + std::to_string(nums[1]);
    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        result += "/" + std::to_string(nums[i]);
    }
    result += ")";
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once to construct the result string, which takes linear time.
