[Leetcode 2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2493)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list. Your goal is to divide the nodes into the maximum number of groups such that no two nodes in the same group are adjacent. Formally, you need to assign a group number to each node from 0 to k-1, where k is the number of groups, such that:
1. Each node is assigned to exactly one group.
2. No two adjacent nodes have the same group number.

Return the maximum number of such groups.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 
n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,4]]
Output: 
2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the number of nodes (n)?**
   - Generally, coding challenge problems have constraints like \(1 \le n \le 1000\) or \(1 \le n \le 10^5\).

2. **Can there be multiple connected components?**
   - This could affect if we need to handle each component separately.

3. **Are the edges guaranteed to not form cycles?**
   - This could determine if the graph is a tree, simplifying the problem.

### Code

We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to check if the graph is bipartite. If it is, the maximum number of groups is 2. If it is not bipartite, we need to consider the graph's chromatic number.

Here is the C++ code for determining the maximum number of groups:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

bool bfsCheckBipartite(int node, vector<int>& color, const vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(node);
    color[node] = 0; // color this node with 0

    while(!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            if (color[v] == -1) {
                // Color this node with opposite color
                color[v] = 1 - color[u];
                q.push(v);
            } else if (color[v] == color[u]) {
                // If neighboring node has the same color, it's not bipartite
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int maxNumberOfGroups(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
    
    // Create adjacency list
    for (const vector<int>& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    vector<int> color(n, -1); // -1 means no color
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (color[i] == -1) {
            // Check if the current component is bipartite
            if (!bfsCheckBipartite(i, color, adj)) {
                return 1; // If not bipartite, maximum groups we can form is 1
            }
        }
    }
    return 2; // If the graph is bipartite, we can form 2 groups
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {0, 4}};
    cout << maxNumberOfGroups(n, edges) << endl; // Output: 2
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Construct the Graph:** Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Check for Bipartiteness:** Use BFS to color the graph. If you can properly 2-color the graph without conflicts, it's bipartite.
3. **Determine the Result:**
   - If the graph is bipartite, return 2.
   - Otherwise, return 1.

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **BFS Coloring:** Each node is processed once, and each edge is checked once, so \(O(V + E)\).
- **Overall:** \(O(V + E)\), which is efficient for large graphs with up to \(10^5\) nodes and edges.
