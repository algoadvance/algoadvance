[Leetcode 2935. Maximum Strong Pair XOR II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2935)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A pair `(a, b)` is called **strong** if `a != b` and their XOR (`a ^ b`) is larger than all other pairs. We consider pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` to be different.

Write a function to find the maximum XOR of such pairs. The function signature should be:

```cpp
int findMaximumXOR(vector<int>& nums);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in `nums` always unique?**
   - No, the array `nums` can contain duplicate integers.
2. **What is the expected range of the array length?**
   - The array can be as long as needed, with a typical constraint in competitive programming being up to \(10^5\) or \(10^6\) in length.
3. **What is the expected range of integer values in `nums`?**
   - The integers are usually bounded by standard integer limits in programming languages, often between \(-2^{31}\) and \(2^{31}-1\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we employ a trie data structure combined with bit manipulation. The rationale is that a trie can efficiently store binary representations of numbers allowing us to quickly find the maximum XOR.

Here are the steps for the approach:

1. **Insert each number into a trie** while maintaining the trie structure.
2. Traverse the trie to find the number which, when XORed with the current number, yields the maximum value.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* left;  // 0
    TrieNode* right; // 1
    TrieNode() : left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Trie {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
public:
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(int num) {
        TrieNode* curr = root;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (bit == 0) {
                if (!curr->left) curr->left = new TrieNode();
                curr = curr->left;
            } else {
                if (!curr->right) curr->right = new TrieNode();
                curr = curr->right;
            }
        }
    }

    int findMaximumXOR(int num) {
        TrieNode* curr = root;
        int maxXor = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (bit == 0) {
                if (curr->right) {
                    maxXor = (maxXor << 1) | 1;
                    curr = curr->right;
                } else {
                    maxXor = maxXor << 1;
                    curr = curr->left;
                }
            } else {
                if (curr->left) {
                    maxXor = (maxXor << 1) | 1;
                    curr = curr->left;
                } else {
                    maxXor = maxXor << 1;
                    curr = curr->right;
                }
            }
        }
        return maxXor;
    }
};

int findMaximumXOR(vector<int>& nums) {
    Trie trie;
    int maxXor = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        trie.insert(num);
        int currentXor = trie.findMaximumXOR(num);
        maxXor = max(maxXor, currentXor);
    }
    
    return maxXor;
}

// Example Usage:
// int main() {
//     vector<int> nums = {3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8};
//     cout << findMaximumXOR(nums) << endl; // Output: 28
// }
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Building the Trie:** Each number is represented with 32 bits. So, for each insertion, it takes \(O(32) = O(1)\). In the worst case for `n` numbers, it takes \(O(n)\).
2. **Finding Maximum XOR:** For each number, finding the maximum XOR takes \(O(32) = O(1)\). So, in the worst case for `n` numbers, it takes \(O(n)\).

Together, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), which is highly efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the maximum XOR of any two unique pairs in the array `nums` using a Trie and bit manipulation, all within linear time complexity.
