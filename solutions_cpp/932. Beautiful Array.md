[Leetcode 932. Beautiful Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l932)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, you need to construct a `beautiful array` of size `n`. An array is considered beautiful if for every `i < j < k`, the following condition is satisfied:

```
A[k] * 2 != A[i] + A[j]
```

You need to output any beautiful array `A` of given size `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of `n`?
      - `1 <= n <= 1000`.
      
2. **Output:**
    - The output should be an array of integers that is considered "beautiful". There can be multiple valid beautiful arrays for a given `n`.

Is there any specific requirement on the elements of the array (like should they be within a specific range)?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a divide-and-conquer approach that exploits pattern properties can be used:
- Start with the base array `[1]` when `n = 1` which is trivially beautiful.
- For larger sizes, generate the array recursively by considering even-indexed and odd-indexed positions.

### Steps:
1. Base case: `A = [1]` when `n = 1`.
2. For a general case:
   - Separate the numbers into evens and odds:
     - Evens are obtained by taking the previous array and multiplying each element by `2`.
     - Odds are obtained by taking the previous array, multiplying each element by `2`, and decrementing the result by `1`.
3. Combine the `odds` and `evens` to form the next level array.

This approach ensures that elements are positioned such that the arithmetic condition is maintained.

### Code

Here is the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> beautifulArray(int n) {
        vector<int> res = {1};
        while (res.size() < n) {
            vector<int> temp;
            for (int i : res) {
                if (i * 2 - 1 <= n) temp.push_back(i * 2 - 1);
            }
            for (int i : res) {
                if (i * 2 <= n) temp.push_back(i * 2);
            }
            res = temp;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a value for n: ";
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> result = sol.beautifulArray(n);
    for (int x : result) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The divide-and-conquer approach ensures that:
- Each step effectively doubles the size of the generated array until it reaches `n`.
- The number of operations is `O(n log n)` since each level of recursion involves `O(n)` operations, and the number of levels is `O(log n)`.

### Explanation of Complexity:
- **Space Complexity:** Since we are storing intermediate arrays, the space complexity is also `O(n log n)` due to the merging steps.
  
This approach ensures that you construct a `beautiful array` satisfying the given conditions in an optimal way.
