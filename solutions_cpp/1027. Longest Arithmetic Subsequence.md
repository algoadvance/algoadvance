[Leetcode 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1027)
## Problem Statement

The problem "1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

Given an array `nums` of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `nums`.

Recall that a subsequence of an array is a list of elements that can be obtained from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

An arithmetic subsequence is a subsequence with a common difference between consecutive terms.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size and values of the elements in the input array `nums`?
   - Typically, `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 500`.

2. **Output Specification**: Should the output be only the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence?
   - Yes, only the length is required.

3. **Subsequence vs. Subarray**: Can we delete elements from the array to form the subsequence?
   - Yes, we can delete elements to form the subsequence whereas a subarray must consist of contiguous elements.

## Strategy

### Approach: Dynamic Programming with Hashing

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a vector of unordered maps (`vector<unordered_map<int, int>>`) to store the length of the arithmetic subsequence ending at each element of the array for all possible differences.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Initialize a vector `dp` where `dp[i]` is an unordered map.
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, compute the difference `diff = nums[j] - nums[i]`.
   - Update the length of the arithmetic subsequence for each difference in the map.

3. **State Transition**:
   - If the difference `diff` is already present in `dp[i]`, say `dp[i][diff] = length`, then set `dp[j][diff] = dp[i][diff] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, initialize it with 2 (as the minimum length of any arithmetic subsequence is 2).

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - The length of the longest arithmetic subsequence will be the maximum value in any map in the `dp` vector.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array, as we are considering all possible pairs of elements.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) in the worst-case scenario due to storage in hash maps for differences.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestArithSeqLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 1) return n;

        vector<unordered_map<int, int>> dp(n);
        int maxLength = 2;  // at least two elements are required to form an arithmetic sequence

        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int i = 0; i < j; ++i) {
                int diff = nums[j] - nums[i];
                if (dp[i].count(diff)) {
                    dp[j][diff] = dp[i][diff] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[j][diff] = 2;
                }
                maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[j][diff]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a member function `longestArithSeqLength` that implements the dynamic programming approach to find the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence. It iterates through all pairs of indices, calculates the differences, updates the dynamic programming table, and keeps track of the longest sequence found.
