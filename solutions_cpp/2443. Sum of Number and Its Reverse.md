[Leetcode 2443. Sum of Number and Its Reverse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2443)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return `true` if `num` can be expressed as the sum of any non-negative integer and its reverse, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input:**
   - What is the maximum value of `num`? 
   - Are there any special cases (like 0 or very large numbers) that we need to handle explicitly?

2. **Definition of Reverse:**
   - Can you confirm that reversing a number means reversing its digits? For example, the reverse of 123 is 321.

3. **Expected Time Complexity:**
   - Is there any specific time complexity requirement?

4. **Output format:**
   - Should the output be a boolean value or a string (e.g., "true" / "false")?

### Code

Based on typical constraints in similar problem statements, we'll assume that `num` can be up to some reasonably large value. Let's proceed with these reasonable assumptions and implement the function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Helper function to reverse a given integer.
int reverse(int x) {
    int rev = 0;
    while (x > 0) {
        rev = rev * 10 + x % 10;
        x /= 10;
    }
    return rev;
}

// Function to check if the given number can be expressed as the sum of a number and its reverse.
bool sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= num; ++i) {
        if (i + reverse(i) == num) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

// Test the function with example inputs.
int main() {
    int num1 = 443; // Example input 1
    int num2 = 63;  // Example input 2
    
    std::cout << "Result for " << num1 << ": " << std::boolalpha << sumOfNumberAndReverse(num1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Result for " << num2 << ": " << std::boolalpha << sumOfNumberAndReverse(num2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Reverse Function:**
   - Implement a helper function `reverse` that takes an integer and returns its reverse.
   - This involves repeatedly taking the last digit of the number and appending it to a new number to form the reverse.

2. **Main Function Logic:**
   - Iterate through all integers `i` from 0 to `num`.
   - For each integer, compute its reverse.
   - Check if the sum of the integer and its reverse equals `num`.
   - If such a pair is found, return `true`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any pair, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Reverse Function:** The time complexity for reversing a number is O(d), where d is the number of digits in the number. In the worst case, d = O(log10(num)).
  
- **Main Function:** The outer loop runs from 0 to `num`, so it will iterate `num + 1` times. Each iteration involves calculating the reverse of the current number, which takes O(log10(num)).

- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(num * log10(num)). Given num can be large, this is quite efficient for typical problem constraints. For example, for num up to 10^5, this complexity is manageable.

This code should work effectively under typical constraints for problems of this nature.
