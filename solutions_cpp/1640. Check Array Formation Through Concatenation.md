[Leetcode 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1640)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of distinct integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are distinct. Arrange the arrays in `pieces` in any order to form `arr`. However, you can only take pieces that form an exact subsequence of `arr`.

Return `true` if you can form the array `arr` from pieces. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
Output: true
```

```plaintext
Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
Output: true
```

```plaintext
Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of `arr` and `pieces`?**
    - Usually, this is defined in the problem description on LeetCode, but it is safe to assume that arrays are reasonably sized such that standard algorithms can process them within time limits.

2. **Are the integers in `arr` all distinct?**
    - Yes, the problem statement specifies that integers in `arr` and `pieces` are distinct.

3. **Can any piece in `pieces` be used more than once?**
    - No, each piece can only be used once.

4. **Is the order within each piece important?**
    - Yes, the order within each piece is important; they must maintain their order as specified in `pieces`.

### Strategy

1. **Map Elements to their Corresponding Pieces**
   - Create a hashmap (unordered_map) to quickly find the starting index of any piece by mapping the first element of each piece to its index in the `pieces` array.

2. **Reconstruct `arr` Using Pieces**
   - Iterate through `arr` using a while loop. For each element in `arr`, check if it is the start of any piece by consulting the hashmap.
   - If the element starts a piece, check if the subsequent elements in `arr` match the current piece.
   - If any element does not match or if an element does not start a piece, return `false`.

3. **Complete the Iteration**
   - If successfully complete iterating through `arr` and all elements are matched appropriately, return `true`.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

bool canFormArray(std::vector<int>& arr, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& pieces) {
    // Create a hashmap to map the first element of each piece to the piece itself
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> pieceMap;
    
    for (const auto& piece : pieces) {
        pieceMap[piece.front()] = piece;
    }
    
    // Iterate through the 'arr' array and verify if we can match pieces
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ) {
        if (pieceMap.find(arr[i]) == pieceMap.end()) {
            return false; // if arr[i] is not the start of any piece
        }
        
        const std::vector<int>& piece = pieceMap[arr[i]];
        for (int j = 0; j < piece.size(); ++j) {
            if (arr[i + j] != piece[j]) {
                return false; // mismatch in piece
            }
        }
        
        i += piece.size(); // move index by the size of the current piece
    }
    
    return true; // all pieces matched correctly
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `arr` and `m` is the total number of elements across all pieces in `pieces`, since each element in `arr` and every element in `pieces` are processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k), where `k` is the number of pieces since we store each piece in the map.
