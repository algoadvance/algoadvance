[Leetcode 2190. Most Frequent Number Following Key In an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2190)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `key`, in which `nums[i]` is preceded by `nums[i-1]` in the array. Your task is to find the most frequent number immediately following an occurrence of `key` in the array. If there are multiple answers, it is sufficient to return any one of the most frequent numbers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` can contain negative numbers.

2. **What should be returned if the `key` is not present in the array?**
   - The problem guarantees that there is always at least one occurrence of the `key` in the array.

3. **What if two numbers follow the key with the same highest frequency?**
   - If there are multiple numbers with the same highest frequency following the `key`, returning any one of them is acceptable.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through the Array**: Traverse the array to find occurrences of the `key`.
2. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash map (unordered_map) to keep track of the frequency of numbers that follow the `key`.
3. **Identify Most Frequent Follower**: Find the number with the highest frequency from the hash map.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the key occurs at the end of the array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int mostFrequentFollowingKey(vector<int>& nums, int key) {
    unordered_map<int, int> frequency_map;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == key) {
            int follower = nums[i + 1];
            frequency_map[follower]++;
        }
    }
    
    int most_frequent = -1;
    int max_count = 0;
    
    for (const auto& entry : frequency_map) {
        if (entry.second > max_count) {
            max_count = entry.second;
            most_frequent = entry.first;
        }
    }
    
    return most_frequent;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - We traverse the array once, which takes O(n) time.
    - We iterate through the hash map once to find the most frequent follower, which takes O(m) time where m is the number of unique followers. Since m is generally much smaller than n, we can consider this part as O(1) in the context of large n.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(m)
    - The space complexity is O(m) for the hash map, where m is the number of unique followers in `nums`.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints, ensuring minimal time and space overhead.
