## Problem Statement

1424. Diagonal Traverse II

Given a list of lists of integers, `nums`, return all elements of `nums` in diagonal order as described below.

A matrix `nums` is a 2D array of arrays where:
- `nums[i]` is a list of integers sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The input arrays are not necessarily the same length.

Diagonal order:
- Starting from the top-left corner of the `nums` matrix, progress diagonally to the bottom right corner.
- Traverse all elements in each diagonal, one by one, before moving to the next diagonal.

**Example:**

Input: 
```
nums = [
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]
]
```

Output: `[1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]`

**Example:**

Input: 
```
nums = [
    [1,2,3,4,5],
    [6,7],
    [8],
    [9,10,11],
    [12,13,14,15,16]
]
```

Output: `[1,6,2,8,7,3,9,4,12,10,5,13,11,14,15,16]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the integers in the sublists guaranteed to be unique?
2. Can the input have empty sublists?
3. For large input sizes, do we have any constraints on time or space complexity?

## Strategy

1. **Understand the Diagonal Indexing:**
   - For a given element `nums[i][j]`, its diagonal index is determined by the sum of its indices, `i + j`. All elements with the same diagonal index lie on the same diagonal.

2. **Data Structure:**
   - Use an ordered map (like `std::map` in C++) to store each diagonal. The key will be the diagonal index `i + j`, and the value will be a list of elements on that diagonal.

3. **Populating the Diagonals:**
   - Iterate over all elements of `nums`. For each element `nums[i][j]`, append it to the list corresponding to the key `i + j` in the map.

4. **Flatten Results:**
   - Once data is collected in the map, iterate over the map in order of the keys to produce the final output list.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>

std::vector<int> findDiagonalOrder(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& nums) {
    std::map<int, std::vector<int>> diagonals;
    std::vector<int> result;

    // Traverse through the nums array and populate the map
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < nums[i].size(); ++j) {
            diagonals[i + j].push_back(nums[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Flatten the map into the result vector
    for (auto& entry : diagonals) {
        result.insert(result.end(), entry.second.begin(), entry.second.end());
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Populating the Map:**
   - Each element is visited once, thus it takes \(O(N)\) time, where \(N\) is the total number of elements in `nums`.

2. **Flattening the Map:**
   - This also takes \(O(N)\) time since all elements are visited.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the total number of elements in `nums`.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(N)\) due to the storage needed for the ordered map and the result vector, where \(N\) is the number of elements in `nums`.

This solution efficiently manages both time and space complexities while fulfilling the problem requirements.
