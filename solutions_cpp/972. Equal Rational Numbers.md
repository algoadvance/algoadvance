### Problem Statement

972. Equal Rational Numbers

Given two strings `S` and `T`, each of which represents a rational number, return `True` if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may not have leading zeroes but may have trailing zeroes. 

- A rational number can be:
  - An integer (e.g., `"0"`, `"12"`)
  - A decimal number without a repeating part (e.g., `"0.5"`, `"-2.0"`)
  - A decimal number with a repeating part (e.g., `"0.(6)"` which represents `0.6666...`)
 
Return true if they represent the same number, otherwise return false.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **String Format**: Can the strings include leading or trailing spaces?
    - No, the problem guarantees no leading or trailing spaces.
2. **String Length**: How long can the string representations be?
    - The length of each string is less than 100.
3. **Range of Numbers**: What is the range of the numbers?
    - The numbers can be positive or negative, but the absolute value wouldn't exceed what a double can store.
4. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases like empty strings or invalid formats?
    - No, the problem guarantees valid inputs.

### Strategy

1. **Representation Conversion**:
    - Convert each string to a double using a custom parsing function. This ensures we correctly handle repeating decimals.
  
2. **Precision Management**:
    - Using a double to compare might not be precise due to floating-point arithmetic. Instead, string manipulation and normalization will be performed.
    
3. **Steps**:
    - Parse and normalize each part of the number (integer, non-repeating part, repeating part).
    - Convert the number into a common structure where comparison is straightforward.
    - Compare the normalized structures.
    
### Code

Here's a C++ function to determine if two rational number strings are equal:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <regex>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to compute greatest common divisor
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

// Helper function to normalize and compare rational numbers.
string convertToRationalString(const string& number) {
    // Regular expressions to capture different parts of the number
    regex pattern("([+-]?\\d*)(\\.\\d*)?(\\((\\d+)\\))?");
    smatch match;
    regex_match(number, match, pattern);

    string integerPart = match[1].str();
    string nonRepeating = match[2].str();
    string repeating = match[4].str();

    // Handling cases
    if (nonRepeating.empty()) {
        nonRepeating = ".0"; // Ensure there is always a decimal part
    }

    // If there's no repeating part, just return the normalized form
    if (repeating.empty()) {
        return integerPart + nonRepeating;
    }

    // Extend repeating part enough to avoid precision issues
    string extendedRepeatingPart;
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { // Extending it to a reasonable length
        extendedRepeatingPart += repeating;
    }

    string normalized = integerPart + nonRepeating + extendedRepeatingPart;
    return normalized.substr(0, number.length() + 20); // Trim to reasonable length
}

bool isRationalEqual(string S, string T) {
    return convertToRationalString(S) == convertToRationalString(T);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    string S = "0.(6)";
    string T = "0.66(6)";
    cout << (isRationalEqual(S, T) ? "Equal" : "Not Equal") << endl;

    S = "1.0(33)";
    T = "1.03(33)";
    cout << (isRationalEqual(S, T) ? "Equal" : "Not Equal") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) due to constant string length and operations; regex matching and string manipulations are all limited and predictable for this problem size.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) besides input storage, since operations don't use extra space proportional to input size. We cap the repeating extension to a constant length.

This code ensures rational numbers are correctly parsed and accurately compared, handling non-repeating and repeating parts efficiently.
