[Leetcode 2781. Length of the Longest Valid Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2781)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `word` and a list of strings `forbidden`. A valid substring is a substring that does not contain any of the strings in `forbidden` as a contiguous subsequence. Your task is to find the length of the longest valid substring in the input string `word`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected length of the input string `word`?**
   - The length of the input string can be large, potentially up to \(10^5\) characters.

2. **What is the expected size of the forbidden list?**
   - The forbidden list can contain multiple forbidden strings, summing up to \(10^5\) characters combined.

3. **Are all characters in the input string and forbidden list lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, you can assume all characters are lowercase English letters.

4. **What should be returned if there are no valid substrings?**
   - Return `0` if no valid substrings are found.

## Strategy
1. Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window of potential valid substrings.
2. Traverse through the string using two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `right` expands the window and `left` contracts it to remove forbidden substring violations.
3. Use a set to check if the current window contains any forbidden substring efficiently.
4. Keep track of the maximum length of valid substring found during the traversal.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int isValid(const unordered_set<string>& forbiddenSet, const string& s, int start, int end) {
    string sub = "";
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        sub += s[i];
        if (forbiddenSet.find(sub) != forbiddenSet.end()) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int lengthOfLongestValidSubstring(string word, vector<string>& forbidden) {
    unordered_set<string> forbiddenSet(forbidden.begin(), forbidden.end());
    int n = word.size();
    int maxLen = 0;
    int left = 0;
    
    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        while (left <= right && !isValid(forbiddenSet, word, left, right)) {
            ++left;
        }
        maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLen;
}

int main() {
    string word = "ababcc";
    vector<string> forbidden = {"ab", "b"};
    cout << lengthOfLongestValidSubstring(word, forbidden) << endl; // Output should be 2
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Construction of `forbiddenSet`:** \(O(f)\), where \(f\) is the total number of characters in the forbidden list.
- **Sliding window traversal:**
  - Each character in the string is processed once by the left and right pointers, leading to \(O(n)\) operations, where \(n\) is the length of the string `word`.
  - For each position of the window, substring validation (`isValid`) can take up to \(O(n)\) in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \cdot n)\) which is potentially high for large strings, and we may need further optimization using more efficient substring searching strategies (like suffix automaton or advanced string matching algorithms).

Should you need a more efficient solution, employing advanced data structures or suffix structures would be recommended.
