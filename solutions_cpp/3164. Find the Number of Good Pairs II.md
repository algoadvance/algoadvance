[Leetcode 3164. Find the Number of Good Pairs II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3164)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. A pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i] + rev(nums[j])` == `nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`, where `rev(nums[j])` is the integer obtained by reversing the decimal representation of `nums[j]`.

Your task is to find the number of good pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for the elements in the `nums` array?**
   - The values are within the range of typical 32-bit integers.

2. **What will be the length of the `nums` array?**
   - The length can be up to 10^5.

3. **Can the values in the `nums` array be negative?**
   - No, all the values are positive integers.

4. **How should we handle single-digit numbers?**
   - Single-digit numbers are their own reverse, so they can be considered trivially.

## Strategy

### High-Level Strategy
1. **Reversing the Numbers:** First, we need a helper function to reverse the integer.
2. **Calculate and Store:** For each number, calculate pairs with its reverse and compare as per the given condition.
3. **Use a HashMap:** To efficiently find pairs that meet the condition, we can use a hashmap to store the count of each transformed value.

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. **Reverse Function:** Implement a helper function to reverse a given integer.
2. **Transformation:** Transform each number `nums[i]` to `nums[i] - rev(nums[i])`.
3. **Count Pairs:** Use a hashmap to count occurrences of the transformed values. For each match, increase the good pairs count.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to reverse a number
int reverseNumber(int num) {
    int rev = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        rev = rev * 10 + (num % 10);
        num /= 10;
    }
    return rev;
}

int numGoodPairs(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> transformCount;
    int goodPairs = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        int transformedValue = num - reverseNumber(num);

        // Check if this transformed value is already in the map
        if (transformCount.find(transformedValue) != transformCount.end()) {
            goodPairs += transformCount[transformedValue];
        }
        
        // Add the transformed value to the hashmap
        transformCount[transformedValue]++;
    }

    return goodPairs;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {13, 31, 12, 21};
    cout << numGoodPairs(nums) << endl;  // Expected output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Reversing a Number:** `O(K)` where `K` is the number of digits, max 10 for 32-bit integers.
- **Overall:** 
  - Calculating the transformed value takes `O(N * K)` where `N` is the length of `nums`.
  - Storing in and accessing from the hashmap both take average `O(1)` time.

So, the total time complexity is `O(N)`, given `K` is constant (at most 10). Thus, the solution is efficient for large inputs up to 10^5.

## Space Complexity
- Using extra space for the hashmap to store the counts of transformed values, which is `O(N)` in the worst case.

This solution efficiently counts the number of good pairs while maintaining clear and reasonable complexity bounds.
