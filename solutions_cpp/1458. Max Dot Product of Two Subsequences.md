[Leetcode 1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1458)
### Problem Statement
Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `m` and `n` respectively, the task is to find the maximum dot product of non-empty subsequences of `nums1` and `nums2`. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by deleting some elements (including none) of the array. The dot product of two sequences is the sum of their element-wise products.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
Output: 18
Explanation: Take subsequence [2,5] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
Their dot product is (2*3) + (5*-6) = 6 - 30 = -24.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the subsequences allowed to be empty?
   - No, the subsequences should be non-empty.
2. Are there any constraints on the size of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - Typically, constraints will be given. Since it's not specified, we should handle up to the typical problem size comfortably, like `nums1` and `nums2` up to 500 elements.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. We'll use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum dot product of subsequences of `nums1[0..i]` and `nums2[0..j]`. 

**Steps:**
1. Initialize a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum dot product for subsequences of `nums1` up to index `i` and `nums2` up to index `j`.
2. Iterate through both arrays and update `dp[i][j]` by considering different choices:
   - Include `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` in the subsequence to pair them: add `nums1[i] * nums2[j]` to the best possible previous state.
   - Only take the maximum of the previous optimal states without pairing `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`.
3. Use a separate state in the DP table to manage non-initial comparisons to prevent empty subsequence consideration.
   
### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxDotProduct(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int m = nums1.size();
    int n = nums2.size();

    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MIN));

    dp[0][0] = nums1[0] * nums2[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], nums1[i] * nums2[0]);
    }

    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = max(dp[0][j-1], nums1[0] * nums2[j]);
    }

    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + nums1[i] * nums2[j], nums1[i] * nums2[j]});
        }
    }

    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`. This is due to the nested loops iterating over all pairs `(i, j)`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for storing the `dp` table.
