[Leetcode 2750. Ways to Split Array Into Good Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2750)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. You are asked to split the array into exactly `k` non-empty contiguous subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is at most a given integer `m`. Return the number of ways to split the array as described. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum length of the array?**
   - This helps determine the feasible approach in terms of computational complexity.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers within the array?**
   - This aids in understanding the need for optimizations.
3. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - This simplifies handling edge cases.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to split the array into `k` parts from the beginning up to the ith position with each subarray sum not exceeding `m`.
   - Iterate through the array and for each element, consider every possible split point that results in subarrays respecting the sum condition.
   - This approach ensures that we systematically check all possible splits without redundant calculations.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at appropriate steps to ensure that the numbers do not exceed the given limits and to comply with the problem requirements.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToSplitArray(vector<int>& nums, int k, int m) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
        vector<long long> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);

        // Calculate prefix sums
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }

        // Initializing first column
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
                for (int l = 0; l < i; ++l) {
                    if (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[l] <= m) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[l][j - 1]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - The nested loops result in an overall time complexity of \(O(n^2 k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(k\) is the number of required subarrays.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n k)\) due to the DP array.

This solution provides a systematic way to solve the problem using dynamic programming by iterating through possible splits and checking the sum condition efficiently.
