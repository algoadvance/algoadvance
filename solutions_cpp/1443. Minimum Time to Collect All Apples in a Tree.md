[Leetcode 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1443)
## Problem Statement
Given an undirected tree consisting of \( n \) vertices numbered from 0 to \( n-1 \), which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples from all the vertices and come back to the root node.

The tree is represented by a 2D array `edges` of size \( n-1 \) where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` means that there is an undirected edge between the nodes `from_i` and `to_i`. Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple` of size `n`, where `hasApple[i]` is `true` if node `i` has an apple, otherwise `false`.

### Example
**Input:**
```cpp
n = 7
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]]
hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
```
**Output:** 8

### Constraints
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `edges.length == n-1`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- \( 0 \leq from_i, to_i < n \)
- `from_i != to_i`
- `hasApple.length == n`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any guarantees that the tree edges form a valid tree structure without cycles?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the given input forms a valid tree.

2. **Should the tree be considered as rooted at node 0?**
   - Yes, we can assume the tree is rooted at node 0.

3. **Is it guaranteed that root node (0) can have an apple?**
   - Yes, the root node can have an apple just like any other node.

## Strategy
The main idea is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. From each node, we will explore its children and recursively calculate the time required to collect apples from subtrees. If we encounter a node with an apple or if any of its descendant nodes contain an apple, we take the cost of traversing to and from that node (which is 2 seconds per edge traversed, forward and backward).

### Steps:
1. Create an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. Implement a DFS function that will traverse the tree.
3. In the DFS function, recursively explore each child node.
4. Accumulate the time taken to collect apples from each subtree.
5. Return the total time needed to the parent call after considering the round trip time if apples exist in the subtree.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<bool>& hasApple) {
        // Create an adjacency list for the tree
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> tree;
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        // Helper function for DFS traversal
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int parent) -> int {
            int time = 0;
            // Explore all children (nodes connected to current node)
            for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
                if (neighbor != parent) { // Avoid revisiting the parent node
                    int childTime = dfs(neighbor, node);
                    // If we collected apples from the child subtree, add the time cost
                    if (childTime > 0 || hasApple[neighbor]) {
                        time += childTime + 2;
                    }
                }
            }
            return time;
        };

        // Start DFS from the root node 0, with no parent (-1)
        return dfs(0, -1);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(V + E) \) where \( V \) is the number of vertices (nodes) and \( E \) is the number of edges. Since it's a tree, \( E = V - 1 \), thus the complexity simplifies to \( O(n) \).
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for storing the adjacency list and the recursive call stack in the worst case.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum time required to collect all apples by leveraging DFS traversal on the tree structure.
