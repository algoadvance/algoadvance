[Leetcode 600. Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l600)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`:** What is the maximum value for `n`?
    - Leetcode constraints typically list that `n` can go up to \(10^9\).
    
2. **Efficiency:** Are we expected to find an optimal solution that is faster than checking every number up to `n`?
    - Since `n` can be very large, an optimal solution likely needs to avoid explicit checking of all numbers up to `n`.

3. **Return value:** Should the result be an integer count of valid numbers?
    - Yes, the result should be the count of numbers that meet the criteria.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Representation and Constraints:**
    - To solve this problem optimally, leverage the properties of binary numbers.
    - Any number with consecutive '1's is invalid.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Use dynamic programming to count valid sequences of binary digits.
    - State Transition: Define states that store counts of valid sequences of a given length that end in '0' or '1'.

3. **Precomputation:**
    - Precompute counts of valid sequences of lengths 0 to the bit length of `n`.

4. **Bitwise Analysis:**
    - Analyze the binary representation of `n` to count valid numbers up to `n` by dynamically building up the number from most significant bit down to least significant bit, while ensuring no consecutive '1's.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int findIntegers(int n) {
        // Generate a vector of Fibonacci numbers up to the 32nd number
        std::vector<int> fib(32, 0);
        fib[0] = 1;
        fib[1] = 2;
        for (int i = 2; i < 32; ++i) {
            fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2];
        }

        int prev_bit = 0;  // To store the previous bit in the binary representation of n
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 30; i >= 0; --i) {  // Checking all bits of `n` from the most significant bit down to the least
            if (n & (1 << i)) {  // Check if the i-th bit is set
                result += fib[i];
                if (prev_bit == 1) {  // Consecutive '1's found
                    return result;
                }
                prev_bit = 1;
            } else {
                prev_bit = 0;
            }
        }

        return result + 1; // +1 to include the number `n` itself if it's valid
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation Time Complexity:** \(O(1)\) for generating Fibonacci numbers up to 32 (a constant small number).
- **Main Algorithm Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\). This stems from iterating over the 30 bits of `n` (since \(n \leq 10^9\) which fits in 30 bits).

### Summary
The provided solution uses a combination of Fibonacci precomputation and bitwise manipulation to count all non-negative integer values up to `n` while avoiding consecutive '1's efficiently. The dynamic programming part (building and using the Fibonacci sequence) is quick, and the bitwise analysis ensures we check the conditions optimally.
