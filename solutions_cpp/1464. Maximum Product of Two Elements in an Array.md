[Leetcode 1464. Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1464)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. The goal is to find the maximum product of two elements in the array. To do this, you pick two different indices `i` and `j` such that the product \((nums[i] - 1) * (nums[j] - 1)\) is maximized, where \(i \neq j\).

Return the maximum value of \((nums[i] - 1) * (nums[j] - 1)\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of the input array size?
   - The array length can be between 2 and 500.
   
2. **Element Range**: What are the range of the elements in the array?
   - Each element in the array is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.

3. **Uniqueness**: Are all the elements in the array unique?
   - The problem does not specify that the elements are unique, so they may be repeated.

### Strategy

- The primary task is to find the two largest elements in the array, as they will contribute to the maximum product after decrementing each by 1.
- The product we are looking to maximize is \((nums[max\_1] - 1) \cdot (nums[max\_2] - 1)\), where `max_1` and `max_2` are the two largest numbers in the array.
  
#### Steps:
1. Initialize two variables `max1` and `max2` to store the largest and the second-largest elements in the array.
2. Iterate through the array and update `max1` and `max2` accordingly.
3. Calculate the product \((max1 - 1) \cdot (max2 - 1)\) and return the result.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxProduct(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > max1) {
            max2 = max1;
            max1 = num;
        } else if (num > max2) {
            max2 = num;
        }
    }
    return (max1 - 1) * (max2 - 1);
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We start with `max1` and `max2` initialized to zero.
2. **Iteration**: We iterate through each number in the array:
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `max1`, we update `max2` to be `max1` and then set `max1` to `num`.
   - Else if `num` is larger than `max2`, update `max2` to be `num`.
3. **Result Calculation**: Finally, we return the product of \((max1 - 1) \cdot (max2 - 1)\).

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This efficiency is because we only need a single pass through the array to determine the two largest elements. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
