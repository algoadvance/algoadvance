[Leetcode 2640. Find the Score of All Prefixes of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2640)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers.

The **score** of an array is defined as the sum of the values of all its elements.

Compute the **score** of every prefix of `nums`. The prefix of an array is any leading contiguous subarray comprising any number of elements up to the total number of elements in the array.

Return an array `result` where `result[i]` is the score of the prefix ending at index `i`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 3, 7, 5]
Output: [2, 5, 12, 17]
Explanation:
- The prefix ending at index 0 is [2]. The score is 2.
- The prefix ending at index 1 is [2, 3]. The score is 2 + 3 = 5.
- The prefix ending at index 2 is [2, 3, 7]. The score is 2 + 3 + 7 = 12.
- The prefix ending at index 3 is [2, 3, 7, 5]. The score is 2 + 3 + 7 + 5 = 17.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for the elements in the array `nums`? (This will help in understanding edge cases especially concerning potential large sums.)
2. What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
3. Can the elements in `nums` be negative?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a simple iteration to accumulate the sums of the prefixes.

1. Initialize an empty result array of the same length as `nums`.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array.
3. Keep a running total of the sum as we iterate through the array.
4. Store each running total in the corresponding index of the result array.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. Create an integer `current_sum` initialized to `0` which will keep track of the sum of the prefix.
2. Create a result array (vector) to store the prefix scores.
3. Iterate through each element `nums[i]`:
   - Add the value of `nums[i]` to `current_sum`.
   - Assign the `current_sum` to `result[i]`.
4. Return the `result` array.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`, since we only need to iterate through the array once.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> findPrefixScores(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int current_sum = 0;
    std::vector<int> result(nums.size());
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        current_sum += nums[i];
        result[i] = current_sum;
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- `current_sum` is initialized to `0` to start summing up the prefix elements.
- As we iterate over each element in `nums`:
  - We add the current element `nums[i]` to `current_sum`.
  - We store the updated `current_sum` in the result array at the same index `i`.
- Finally, we return the `result` array containing the sum of all prefixes.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we get the desired prefix sums in linear time.
