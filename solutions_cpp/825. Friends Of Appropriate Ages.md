## Problem Statement

825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the i-th person. 

Rules for making friends are that age A will not friend request age B if any of the following is true:

1. `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
2. `age[B] > age[A]`
3. `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Otherwise, `A` will friend request `B`.

Given the list of ages, return the total number of friend requests made.

### Example 1:
```
Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 3
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
```

### Note:
- `1 <= ages.length <= 20000`.
- `1 <= ages[i] <= 120`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we consider only one direction of friendship (A -> B) or both directions (A -> B and B -> A)? 
    - From the examples, it seems we consider each direction separately, thus each valid pair is counted once per valid direction.
  
2. Do ages include all values between 1 and 120 inclusively?
    - Yes, `ages[i]` where `1 <= ages[i] <= 120`.

## Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences of Each Age:** Use a frequency array to count occurrences of each age between 1 and 120.
2. **Traverse Pairs of Ages:** Traverse each pair of ages `(ageA, ageB)` using two nested loops. Use the criteria given to check if one can send a friend request to the other.
3. **Count Valid Friend Requests:** If ageA can send a friend request to ageB and vise-versa, count the total valid friend requests considering the frequency of each age.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numFriendRequests(vector<int>& ages) {
        int freq[121] = {0}; // Array to store frequency of ages from 1 to 120

        // Count the frequency of each age
        for (int age : ages) {
            freq[age]++;
        }

        int totalRequests = 0;

        // Check all pairs of possible ages
        for (int ageA = 1; ageA <= 120; ageA++) {
            for (int ageB = 1; ageB <= 120; ageB++) {
                if (freq[ageA] > 0 && freq[ageB] > 0) {  // if there are people of ageA and ageB
                    if (ageB <= 0.5 * ageA + 7 || ageB > ageA || (ageB > 100 && ageA < 100)) {
                        continue; // B cannot receive a friend request from A
                    }
                    if (ageA == ageB) {
                        totalRequests += freq[ageA] * (freq[ageB] - 1); // A cannot friend request itself
                    } else {
                        totalRequests += freq[ageA] * freq[ageB];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return totalRequests;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - Counting frequency takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of ages in the input.
   - Checking all pairs of ages in the nested loops takes \(O(120^2) \approx O(1)\) since 120 is a constant limit.
   - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), which is efficient given the problem constraints.
  
2. **Space Complexity:**
   - We use an additional array of fixed size (121), so the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

This solution efficiently counts the valid friend requests according to the given rules.
