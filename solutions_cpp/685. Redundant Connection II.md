[Leetcode 685. Redundant Connection II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l685)
### Problem Statement

In this problem, we are given a directed graph of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. We have an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a directed edge from node `ui` to node `vi`.

There are two possibilities for a given edge to be redundant:
1. Including the edge results in a node having two parents.
2. Including the edge creates a cycle in the graph.

We need to find an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the one that occurs later in the input.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Size and Constraints:**
   - Can I assume the nodes are labeled from 1 to n?
   - Are there duplicate edges or self-loops, or do we need to handle those cases?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should the output only be the last redundant edge or should it include the modified edges array too?

### Strategy:

This problem can be approached using the Union-Find data structure with an additional check for nodes having two parents.

Here is a high-level approach:
1. **Detect a node with two parents:**
   - Create an array `parent` where `parent[node]` stores the parent of the node.
   - If a node has more than one parent, note the two edges and label them `edge1` and `edge2`.
   
2. **Union-Find to detect a cycle:**
   - Use the Union-Find data structure to detect cycles in the graph while ignoring the `edge1`.
   
3. **Final Decision:**
   - If a cycle is found:
     - If the node with two parents has been detected:
       - The redundant edge is either `edge1` or `edge2`.
     - If the node with two parents has not been detected:
       - The redundant edge causing the cycle is the answer.
   - If no cycle is found:
     - The redundant edge is `edge2`, the second edge giving a node two parents.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findRedundantDirectedConnection(vector<int>& parents, vector<int>& ranks) {
        this->parents = parents;
        this->ranks = ranks;
    }

    vector<int> findRedundantDirectedConnection(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> parent(n + 1, 0), candA, candB;

        // Step 1, check whether there is a node with two parents
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            if (parent[v] == 0) {
                parent[v] = u;
            } else {
                candA = {parent[v], v};
                candB = {u, v};
                edge[1] = 0;  // Mark this edge invalid
            }
        }

        // Step 2, union find
        vector<int> root(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) root[i] = i;
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            if (v == 0) continue;  // Skip the marked edge
            int pu = find(root, u), pv = find(root, v);
            if (pu == pv) {
                return candA.empty() ? edge : candA;
            }
            root[pv] = pu;
        }

        return candB;
    }

private:
    int find(vector<int>& root, int u) {
        if (root[u] != u) root[u] = find(root, root[u]);
        return root[u];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of edges. Each operation in the Union-Find structure takes almost constant time due to path compression and union by rank.

### Explanation:

1. We first detect if any node has two parents by iterating through the edges.
2. If a node with two parents is found, we mark the second edge as invalid and remember both.
3. We then perform the union-find operation to detect cycles.
4. Depending on whether a cycle is detected or not, and if we previously found a node with two parents, we return the appropriate edge.

This solution ensures we adhere to the specified constraints and provides an efficient mechanism to solve the problem.
