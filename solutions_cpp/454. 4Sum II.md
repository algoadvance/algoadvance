[Leetcode 454. 4Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l454)
### Problem Statement
Given four lists A, B, C, and D of integer values, compute how many tuples (i, j, k, l) there are such that:
- A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] == 0

To clarify, you need to find the number of distinct tuples that sum up to zero where each element of the tuple comes from one of the four lists.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** What is the length of each list?
2. **Range of Elements:** What are the possible values for the elements in each list?
3. **Duplicates:** Are there duplicate values within each list, and can they be used multiple times in different tuples?
4. **Output Format:** Should we return the count of such tuples?

### Example
Given:
```
A = [1, 2]
B = [-2, -1]
C = [-1, 2]
D = [0, 2]
```
Output:
```
2
```
Explanation: The tuples are (0, 0, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0, 0).

### Strategy
We'll employ a hashmap (unordered_map) to count how often each sum of pairs from lists A and B appears. Then, we'll iterate over pairs from lists C and D to check how many pairs match with the required sum to reach zero.

1. **Create a hash map to store (A[i] + B[j]) and their counts.**
2. **Iterate through each pair from lists C and D and check if the negation of their sum exists in the hash map.**
3. **Sum the counts from the hash map for valid tuples.**

This way, rather than using a brute force algorithm which would be O(n^4), we reduce it to O(n^2) in terms of both time and space complexity.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int fourSumCount(std::vector<int>& A, std::vector<int>& B, std::vector<int>& C, std::vector<int>& D) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> sumAB;
        
        // Store sums of pairs from A and B
        for (int a : A) {
            for (int b : B) {
                sumAB[a + b]++;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        
        // Find complements in pairs from C and D
        for (int c : C) {
            for (int d : D) {
                int target = -(c + d);
                if (sumAB.find(target) != sumAB.end()) {
                    count += sumAB[target];
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Creation of the hash map (A + B pairs):** O(n^2)
- **Searching and counting (C + D pairs):** O(n^2)
- **Overall:** O(n^2) 

### Space Complexity
- Storing the sums of A and B pairs in the hashmap: O(n^2)

This approach effectively balances between time and space efficiency to handle the problem within reasonable limits.
