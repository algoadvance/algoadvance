[Leetcode 1306. Jump Game III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1306)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of non-negative integers `arr` and a starting index `start`. When you are at the index `i`, you can jump to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]`, check if you can reach any index with value 0.

Formally, there is a function:
```cpp
bool canReach(vector<int>& arr, int start);
```

The function should return `true` if you can reach any index with value `0`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `arr` size**: What is the maximum length of the `arr`?
2. **Values in `arr`**: Are all elements in `arr` guaranteed to be non-negative?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we handle cases where `start` is already 0 or out of the bounds?

*Assume the maximum length of `arr` can be `5 * 10^4`, all elements in `arr` are non-negative, and start will always be a valid index in `arr`.*

### Strategy

We'll approach the problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Both DFS and BFS are appropriate for exploring all possible paths from the starting index to find a zero.

Steps:
1. **DFS/BFS Initialization**: We'll use a stack for DFS or a queue for BFS to keep track of which indices we need to explore next.
2. **Visited Set**: We'll maintain a set of visited indices to avoid infinite loops.
3. **Exploration**: For each index, calculate the next possible indices (`i + arr[i]` and `i - arr[i]`).
4. **Check Boundaries and Conditions**: Ensure that the next indices are within bounds and haven't been visited before.
5. **Terminate Early**: If we find `arr[i]` is zero at any index, return true.
6. **End Case**: If the exploration completes without finding a zero, return false.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation using BFS for clarity and ease of understanding:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

bool canReach(vector<int>& arr, int start) {
    int n = arr.size();
    queue<int> toVisit;
    unordered_set<int> visited;

    toVisit.push(start);
    visited.insert(start);

    while (!toVisit.empty()) {
        int current = toVisit.front();
        toVisit.pop();

        // Check if we've reached an index with a value of 0
        if (arr[current] == 0) {
            return true;
        }

        // Calculate the next possible indices
        int forwardJump = current + arr[current];
        int backwardJump = current - arr[current];

        // Add the valid positions to the queue if they haven't been visited
        if (forwardJump < n && visited.find(forwardJump) == visited.end()) {
            toVisit.push(forwardJump);
            visited.insert(forwardJump);
        }

        if (backwardJump >= 0 && visited.find(backwardJump) == visited.end()) {
            toVisit.push(backwardJump);
            visited.insert(backwardJump);
        }
    }

    return false; // If we exhaust all possibilities and don't find 0
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. In the worst case, we might visit every index once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, for maintaining the queue and the visited set.

This solution efficiently explores all possible paths to check if we can reach any index with a value of `0`.
