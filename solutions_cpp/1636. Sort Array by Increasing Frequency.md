[Leetcode 1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1636)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
Explanation: '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted based on the decreasing order.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should negative numbers be handled any differently?
   - No, treat negative numbers the same as positive ones.
2. Should we modify the input array directly or return a new array?
   - We should return the new array that is sorted based on the above conditions.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can:
1. Count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Use a custom comparison to sort the elements:
   - Primary key: Frequency (in increasing order).
   - Secondary key: Value (in decreasing order if frequencies are the same).

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> frequencySort(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Step 1: Count frequencies
        unordered_map<int, int> frequencyMap;
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap[num]++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Sort with custom comparator
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [&frequencyMap](int a, int b) {
            if (frequencyMap[a] == frequencyMap[b])
                return a > b;
            return frequencyMap[a] < frequencyMap[b];
        });
        
        return nums;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Step 1**: We first count the occurrences/frequencies of each number using an `unordered_map`.
- **Step 2**: We then sort the array using `std::sort` with a lambda function as the custom comparator.
  - The lambda compares based on frequency first.
  - If frequencies are the same, it uses the actual value in descending order.

### Time Complexity
- Counting frequencies takes `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of elements in the array.
- Sorting takes `O(N log N)` due to the complexity of `std::sort`.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(N log N)`.

This solution is efficient given the constraints, and the use of `unordered_map` ensures that the frequency counting is optimal.
