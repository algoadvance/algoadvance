[Leetcode 2178. Maximum Split of Positive Even Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2178)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `finalSum`. You need to find the maximum number of unique positive even integers that sum up to `finalSum`. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `finalSum` be odd?**
   - If `finalSum` is odd, it's impossible to divide it into positive even integers, so we would return an empty array.

2. **Should we return the unique even integers in any specific order?**
   - No, the order doesnâ€™t matter as long as the solution is valid and consists of unique even integers.

3. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - The output should be an array of integers.

4. **Are there constraints on the value of `finalSum`?**
   - The problem should come with constraints, but for this discussion, we will assume that `finalSum` can be reasonably large, within standard computation limits.

### Strategy

Given that we need unique even integers to sum up to `finalSum`, the best approach is to start with the smallest even integer, 2, and incrementally add the next even integer (4, 6, etc.) until the remaining sum is either 0 or less than the next even integer to be added:

1. Initialize the starting even integer as `2`.
2. Keep a current sum starting at `0`.
3. Add the even integer to the current sum and store it in a result list if it does not exceed `finalSum`.
4. Continue this until the next even integer to add would exceed `finalSum`.
5. If there is any remaining difference that is non-zero and even, add it to the result list.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<long long> maximumEvenSplit(long long finalSum) {
    // If finalSum is odd, we cannot split it into even parts
    if (finalSum % 2 != 0) {
        return {};
    }

    std::vector<long long> result;
    long long currentEv = 2;
    while (finalSum >= currentEv) {
        result.push_back(currentEv);
        finalSum -= currentEv;
        currentEv += 2;
    }
    
    // If there's any leftover sum, add it as the last element
    if (finalSum > 0) {
        result.back() += finalSum;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: The loop runs as long as the series of even numbers is less than or equal to `finalSum`. This is an arithmetic series (2, 4, 6, ...), and the sum grows quadratically. The time complexity can be approximated as \(O(\sqrt{finalSum})\).
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(\sqrt{finalSum})\) since we store the unique even integers in a list.

This approach ensures we maximize the number of unique even integers and handles edge cases like an odd `finalSum` efficiently.
