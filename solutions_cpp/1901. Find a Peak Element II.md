[Leetcode 1901. Find a Peak Element II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1901)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `A` where no two adjacent cells are equal (i.e., for all cells `(i, j)`, `A[i][j] != A[i - 1][j]`, `A[i][j] != A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j] != A[i][j - 1]`, and `A[i][j] != A[i][j + 1]`). A peak element in `A` is an element that is strictly greater than all of its neighbors (left, right, top, bottom).

Find any peak element in `A` and return its position as a list `[r, c]`.

You may assume that the input always contains a peak element.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the matrix have multiple peak elements? 
    - Yes, you need to return the position of any one of them.
2. Are the boundary elements considered peaks if they are greater than their only neighbors?
    - Yes, boundary elements can be peaks too.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search on Columns**:
   - Begin by performing a binary search on the columns. For each mid-column, find the row that contains the peak in that column.
   - Compare this peak with its left and right neighbors to decide how to move the search space.
   - If the peak is greater than both of its horizontal neighbors, it’s a peak element.
   - Otherwise, move to the left half or the right half of the current column search space depending on the comparison results.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize `low` and `high` pointers to the first and last columns.
   - While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
     - Calculate the mid column.
     - Find the global maximum element in that column.
     - Compare this element with its left and right neighbors:
       - If it’s a peak, return the position.
       - Otherwise, move the `low` or `high` pointers.
   - This strategy ensures the solution finds a peak in `O(n log m)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the approach is `O(n log m)` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. This is efficient for matrices with large dimensions.

## C++ Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findPeakGrid(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int rows = mat.size();
        int cols = mat[0].size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = cols - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int maxRow = 0;
            
            // Find the row with the maximum element in the mid column
            for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
                if (mat[i][mid] > mat[maxRow][mid]) {
                    maxRow = i;
                }
            }
            
            bool leftIsBig = (mid - 1 >= 0 && mat[maxRow][mid - 1] > mat[maxRow][mid]);
            bool rightIsBig = (mid + 1 < cols && mat[maxRow][mid + 1] > mat[maxRow][mid]);
            
            // Check if the current element is a peak
            if (!leftIsBig && !rightIsBig) {
                return { maxRow, mid };
            }
            
            // If the left neighbor is greater, move search to the left half
            if (leftIsBig) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Since the input guarantees at least one peak, this line should never be reached
        return {-1, -1};
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {
        {1, 4, 3, 5},
        {14, 13, 12, 11},
        {15, 9, 7, 6},
        {16, 17, 18, 19}
    };
    
    vector<int> peak = sol.findPeakGrid(mat);
    cout << "Peak element found at position: [" << peak[0] << ", " << peak[1] << "]\n";
    return 0;
}
```

This solution efficiently locates a peak element in the 2D array by leveraging binary search principles, ensuring optimal performance for large matrices.
