[Leetcode 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1015)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `K`. Write a function to return the smallest positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit 1. If no such `N` exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq K \leq 10^5\)
2. **Output**:
   - Integer representing the smallest number consisting only of the digit 1 that is divisible by K, or -1 if no such number exists.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `K` is very large, what time complexity constraints need to be considered?
   - What should be outputted if `K` is even? (An even number can never be divisible by a number consisting solely of 1s)

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - Numbers consisting only of the digit 1 are in the form: 1, 11, 111, 1111, etc.
   - Represent these numbers as a series of modular calculations: `1 % K`, `11 % K`, `111 % K`, etc.

2. **Handling Remainders**:
   - Keep track of remainders obtained when progressively forming numbers consisting of only 1s.
   - Use a set to keep track of seen remainders to detect cycles (indicating that no such number exists).

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Use the formula to carry over the remainder: 
     \[
     \text{new remainder} = (\text{previous remainder} * 10 + 1) \% K
     \]
   - If any remainder is `0`, the corresponding number is divisible by `K`.

4. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If a remainder repeats without finding zero, return `-1` as it implies no valid number exists.

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm mainly runs a loop until the remainder of `1s` forms a cycle, which essentially can have at most `K` iterations.
- **Time Complexity**: O(K)
- **Space Complexity**: O(K) (for storing remainders in a set)

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
    if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) {
        return -1; // An even number or any number ending in 5 will never be divisible by a number consisting entirely of 1s.
    }
    
    std::unordered_set<int> seenRemainders;
    int remainder = 0;

    for (int length = 1; length <= K; length++) {
        // Calculate the new remainder
        remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % K;

        // Check if remainder is 0
        if (remainder == 0) {
            return length;
        }

        // If we have seen this remainder before, there is no such N
        if (seenRemainders.find(remainder) != seenRemainders.end()) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Add this remainder to the set of seen remainders
        seenRemainders.insert(remainder);
    }

    // If no valid N is found
    return -1;
}
```

This code checks for the smallest integer N consisting only of 1s that is divisible by K by leveraging modular arithmetic and cycle detection.
