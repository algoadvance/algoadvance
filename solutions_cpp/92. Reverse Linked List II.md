[Leetcode 92. Reverse Linked List II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l92)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`. Reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`.
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`.
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be returned if `left` is equal to `right`?
   **A:** If `left` is equal to `right`, the list remains unchanged since there's no range to reverse.

2. **Q:** Are the node values unique?
   **A:** Node values are not necessarily unique.

3. **Q:** Do we have to handle empty lists?
   **A:** No, according to the constraints we assume that the number of nodes is at least 1.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use pointers to traverse and manipulate the sublist that needs to be reversed.
   - Use a dummy node to facilitate edge cases where reversing includes the head of the linked list.

2. **Traverse to the Start Position:**
   - Use a pointer to traverse the list until the node just before the `left`-th node.

3. **Reverse the Sublist:**
   - Use another pointer to reverse the specified range of the linked list in-place.

4. **Reconnect the Reversed Sublist:**
   - Reconnect the start and end of the reversed sublist with the non-reversed parts of the list.

5. **Return the New Head:**
   - Return the new head, which might be different from the original head if the head was part of the reversed sublist.

### Code

```cpp
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseBetween(ListNode* head, int left, int right) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;

        // Create a dummy node to simplify operations
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* prev = dummy;
        
        // Move `prev` to the node just before the `left`-th node
        for (int i = 1; i < left; ++i) {
            prev = prev->next;
        }

        // `start` will point to the `left`-th node
        ListNode* start = prev->next;
        // `then` will point to the `left+1`-th node
        ListNode* then = start->next;

        // Reverse the sublist from `left` to `right`
        for (int i = 0; i < right - left; ++i) {
            start->next = then->next;
            then->next = prev->next;
            prev->next = then;
            then = start->next;
        }

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list to reach the `left`-th node and perform a constant amount of operations for each node in the sublist to be reversed.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we are reversing the linked list in place and only using a few auxiliary pointers.
