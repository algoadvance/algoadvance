[Leetcode 729. My Calendar I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l729)
## Problem Statement

You are implementing a program to help manage a calendar with the ability to book new events. Each new event you want to book can be represented as a pair of integers `(start, end)` which represents the start and end times of the event. For this problem, assume that the events are half-open intervals, i.e., `[start, end)`, where `start` is inclusive and `end` is exclusive. 

A new event can be added to the calendar if it does not overlap with any of the existing events in the calendar. An event `x` overlaps with another event `y` if `x`'s start time is less than `y`'s end time and `x`'s end time is greater than `y`'s start time.

Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

- `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.
- `bool book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar without causing a conflict. Otherwise, returns `false` and doesn't add the event to the calendar.

### Example:
```
MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar();
cal.book(10, 20); // returns true
cal.book(15, 25); // returns false
cal.book(20, 30); // returns true
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= start < end <= 10^9`
- At most `1000` calls will be made to `book`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the start and end times always given in increasing order within a specific `book` call?
2. Is there any restriction on how many events can be booked at most?
3. Should I consider edge cases like very large inputs regarding performance?

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
- We can use a list to store pairs of `(start, end)` representing the booked events.
- Each time an event is to be booked, iterate through the list and check for overlaps with the existing events.
- If no overlap is found, add the new event to the list and return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize the calendar with an empty list.
2. For each new booking request, check it against existing events in the list to ensure there is no overlap.
3. If thereâ€™s no conflict, append the new event to the list; otherwise, reject it.

The time complexity for each booking operation is O(n), where n is the number of events already booked.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class MyCalendar {
private:
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> calendar;

public:
    MyCalendar() { }
    
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for (const auto &event : calendar) {
            if (start < event.second && end > event.first) {
                return false; // There's an overlap
            }
        }
        calendar.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

Each call to `book` involves checking all previously booked events. In the worst case, this will be O(n), where n is the number of previously booked events. Given the constraint that there will be at most 1000 calls to `book`, this is manageable within the problem limits.
