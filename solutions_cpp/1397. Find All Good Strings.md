[Leetcode 1397. Find All Good Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1397)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, both representing the range of valid strings. You are also given a string `evil`. A "good" string is a string that lies between `s1` and `s2` in lexicographical order and does not contain `evil` as a substring.

You should return the number of "good" strings. Since the result can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s1 = "a", s2 = "b", evil = "c"
Output: 2
Explanation: Both "a" and "b" are good strings as none of them contain "evil" = "c".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What are the constraints on the lengths of `s1`, `s2`, and `evil`?**
   * A: `1 <= s1.length, s2.length, evil.length <= 50`. The strings are of the same length.

2. **Q: Are the characters in the strings limited to lowercase letters?**
   * A: Yes, the problem specifies the strings only contain lowercase English letters.

3. **Q: Should the result be taken modulo `10^9 + 7`?**
   * A: Yes, the final answer should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with the failure function concept from the KMP algorithm for substring searching. The approach involves:
1. **Recursive DFS with Memorization**: Define a recursive function that tries to build valid strings one character at a time while checking if the substring `evil` is formed.
2. **Trie/KMP Failure Function**: Use the failure function from KMP to manage and check the substring `evil` within the generated good strings dynamically.
3. **State Memorizations**: Use a 3D array for memorizing states to avoid redundant computations. The state can be defined by:
   * The current position in the generated string.
   * Boolean flags indicating if bounds defined by `s1` and `s2` have been breached.
   * The number of characters matched with the `evil` string.

### Code in C++
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

class Solution {
public:
    int dp[51][51][2][2];
    
    vector<int> buildLPS(const string &pattern) {
        int m = pattern.size();
        vector<int> lps(m);
        int len = 0;
        int i = 1;
        while (i < m) {
            if (pattern[i] == pattern[len]) {
                len++;
                lps[i] = len;
                i++;
            } else {
                if (len != 0) {
                    len = lps[len - 1];
                } else {
                    lps[i] = 0;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return lps;
    }
    
    int dfs(const string &s1, const string &s2, const string &evil, int pos, int evilMatched, bool isPrefix1, bool isPrefix2, const vector<int>& lps) {
        if (evilMatched == evil.size()) return 0;
        if (pos == s1.size()) return 1;
        
        if (dp[pos][evilMatched][isPrefix1][isPrefix2] >= 0) return dp[pos][evilMatched][isPrefix1][isPrefix2];
        
        char from = isPrefix1 ? s1[pos] : 'a';
        char to = isPrefix2 ? s2[pos] : 'z';
        int ans = 0;
        
        for (char ch = from; ch <= to; ++ch) {
            int nextMatched = evilMatched;
            while (nextMatched > 0 && evil[nextMatched] != ch) {
                nextMatched = lps[nextMatched - 1];
            }
            if (ch == evil[nextMatched]) ++nextMatched;
            ans = (ans + dfs(s1, s2, evil, pos + 1, nextMatched, isPrefix1 && (ch == from), isPrefix2 && (ch == to), lps)) % MOD;
        }
        
        return dp[pos][evilMatched][isPrefix1][isPrefix2] = ans;
    }
    
    int findGoodStrings(int n, string s1, string s2, string evil) {
        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
        vector<int> lps = buildLPS(evil);
        return dfs(s1, s2, evil, 0, 0, true, true, lps);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N \cdot M \cdot 2 \cdot 2)\), where \(N\) is the length of `s1` and `s2`, and \(M\) is the length of `evil`. Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible for \(1 \leq N, M \leq 50\).
