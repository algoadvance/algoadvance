[Leetcode 1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1658)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can remove the leftmost or rightmost element from the array `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this modifies the array for subsequent operations.

Return the minimum number of operations to reduce `x` to exactly 0 if it's possible, otherwise, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements of the array be negative?
   - No, the elements are non-negative integers.
   
2. Do we need to consider the empty array situation?
   - No, assume the input array will have at least one element.
   
3. If `x` is already 0, what should we return?
   - Return 0, as no operations are needed.

### Strategy

Instead of focusing on reducing `x` directly, we can look at this problem from a different perspective. If we need to remove a total of elements summing up to `x`, it is equivalent to the sum of the remaining elements being equal to `sum(nums) - x`. Therefore, our task is to find the maximum length of the subarray whose sum is equal to `sum(nums) - x`.

Steps to solve the problem:
1. Compute the target sum which is `sum(nums) - x`.
2. Use a sliding window (two-pointer technique) to find the longest subarray with sum equal to the target sum.
3. If such a subarray is found, the minimum operations are the total number of elements minus the length of this subarray. Otherwise, return -1 if no such subarray exists.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        total += num;
    }
    
    int target = total - x;
    if (target < 0) return -1;

    unordered_map<int, int> prefixSum;
    prefixSum[0] = -1;
    int currentSum = 0;
    int maxLength = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        currentSum += nums[i];
        if (prefixSum.find(currentSum - target) != prefixSum.end()) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, i - prefixSum[currentSum - target]);
        }
        if (prefixSum.find(currentSum) == prefixSum.end()) {
            prefixSum[currentSum] = i;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength == -1 ? -1 : nums.size() - maxLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 4, 2, 3};
    int x = 5;
    cout << minOperations(nums, x) << endl;  // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are using a single pass (loop) to find the prefix sum and another single pass for adjusting the sum and checking against the target with the use of a hashmap.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) due to the hashmap used to store the prefix sums.
