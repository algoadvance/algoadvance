[Leetcode 3049. Earliest Second to Mark Indices II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3049)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a string of size `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1' that evolve over time. On each second, every '0' that has at least one neighboring '1' (in the previous second) becomes a '1'. Your task is to return the earliest second at which all characters in the string are '1'. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can we modify the original string or do we need to maintain its immutability?
2. Is the input string guaranteed to have at least one '1' initially?
3. What is the maximum size of the string `n`?
4. Should we consider boundary conditions where the string length `n` is very small?

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int earliestSecond(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    if (n == 0) return -1;
    
    std::queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '1') {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    int time = 0;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int q_size = q.size();
        bool updated = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < q_size; ++i) {
            int idx = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (idx > 0 && s[idx - 1] == '0') {
                s[idx - 1] = '1';
                q.push(idx - 1);
                updated = true;
            }
            if (idx < n - 1 && s[idx + 1] == '0') {
                s[idx + 1] = '1';
                q.push(idx + 1);
                updated = true;
            }
        }
        if (!updated) {
            break; // No more '0' can be turned into '1'
        }
        ++time;
    }
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '0') {
            return -1; // If there's any '0' left, return -1
        }
    }
    
    return time;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "010101";
    int result = earliestSecond(s);
    std::cout << "Earliest second: " << result << std::endl; // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Sources**: Initialize a queue with indices of all '1's in the string.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use a BFS approach to simulate the process of converting '0's to '1's, which allows you to track the progression through the string over time.
3. **Update States**: For each '1', update neighboring '0's to '1' and push their indices to the queue.
4. **Track Time**: Increment a time counter at each level of BFS (each second).
5. **Check Completion**: After BFS completes, check if any '0' remains. If so, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the time counter.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. Each position in the string is processed at most once. The BFS ensures that the string is checked level by level based on the propagation of '1's to '0's. Given this approach leverages a queue to ensure each element is visited efficiently, it should be optimal for the problem constraints.
