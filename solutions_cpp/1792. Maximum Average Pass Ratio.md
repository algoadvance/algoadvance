[Leetcode 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1792)
## Problem Statement:

Given a list `classes` where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]` indicates there are `totali` students in the i-th class and `passi` number of students passed the exam. Additionally, you are provided an integer `extraStudents` representing the number of extra students you can add to any of the classes.

You need to find the maximum average pass ratio possible after distributing `extraStudents` optimally.

Note that the pass ratio of a class is defined as `passi / totali`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints on classes and extraStudents**:
   - What is the maximum number of classes (`n`) and `extraStudents`?
2. **Precision and output format**:
   - Should the final average be returned as a floating-point number?

### Sample Input/Output:

- **Example 1**:
  ```cpp
  Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2
  Output: 0.78333
  ```
- **Example 2**:
  ```cpp
  Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4
  Output: 0.53485
  ```

## Strategy:

1. **Determine Contribution**: Each student added to a class can increase the pass ratio, but some classes will benefit more than others from additional students. The goal is to maximize the overall benefit.
2. **Priority Queue**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always add the extra student to the class where it will have the maximum marginal increase in the pass ratio.
3. **Heap Initialization**: Initialize the priority queue with the initial states of the classes computed by their current pass ratio contribution and their potential increase.
4. **Distribute Students**: Iteratively allocate each extra student to the class that gives the best improvement in pass ratio until all students are allocated.
5. **Compute Max Average**: After distributing all extra students, compute the final average pass ratio.

### Code Example:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double maxAverageRatio(vector<vector<int>>& classes, int extraStudents) {
        auto gain = [](int pass, int total) {
            return (double)(pass + 1) / (total + 1) - (double)pass / total;
        };

        priority_queue<pair<double, pair<int, int>>> pq;

        for (auto& cls : classes) {
            int pass = cls[0], total = cls[1];
            pq.push({gain(pass, total), {pass, total}});
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < extraStudents; ++i) {
            auto [increase, p] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int pass = p.first + 1, total = p.second + 1;
            pq.push({gain(pass, total), {pass, total}});
        }

        double result = 0.0;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [increase, p] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int pass = p.first, total = p.second;
            result += (double) pass / total;
        }

        return result / classes.size();
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Initialization**: \(O(n \log n)\) for inserting each class into the priority queue.
- **Distribute Students**: For each of the `extraStudents`, we perform an extract-min and insert operation on the priority queue, making it \(O(extraStudents \log n)\).
- **Final Calculation**: Simple extraction in \(O(n \log n)\).

- **Overall**: \(O((n + extraStudents) \log n)\).

This strategy involves using a priority queue to dynamically select and update the classes which benefit the most from additional students, ensuring the optimal distribution of resources.
