[Leetcode 137. Single Number II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l137)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears exactly three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What is the size range of the input array?
   - The size of the array is not explicitly limited in the problem statement but generally, it can go up to millions.

2. **Data Range:** What is the range of integers in the input array?
   - The elements in the array can be any valid integer values.

3. **Constraints on Usage:**
   - You need to ensure the solution is of linear runtime complexity (`O(n)`) and uses only constant extra space (`O(1)`).

## Strategy

1. **Bitwise Operation Technique**:
    - We will count the number of times each bit appears in the numbers. If a bit appears three times, it contributes nothing to the unique number since every other number appears exactly three times.
    - Specifically, for each bit position `i` (from 0 to 31, considering the integer size), we'll count how many times it appears across all numbers.
    - If a bit appears not divisible by 3 times (for example, 1, 4, 7 times), it should be part of the single unique number.

2. **Steps**:
    - Initialize an array of 32 zeros to keep track of the count of each bit position.
    - For each number in the array, update the bit count array.
    - Finally, construct the unique number from the counts of each bit position.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int bitCount[32] = {0};

        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
                if (num & (1 << i)) {
                    bitCount[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
            if (bitCount[i] % 3) {
                result |= (1 << i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 2, 3, 2};
    Solution sol;
    int result = sol.singleNumber(nums);
    // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we iterate through the array once and for each element, we perform a constant amount of work by iterating through 32 possible bit positions (which is a constant).

The space complexity is `O(1)`, meaning it uses constant extra space, since our auxiliary space does not grow with the input size but remains fixed at 32 elements.
