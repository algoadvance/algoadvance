[Leetcode 3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3043)
Sure, let's break it down into sections.

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings, and your task is to write a function that finds the length of the longest common prefix among the strings in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
Before moving forward with the solution, it's important to clarify a few points:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the array of strings?
   - What is the maximum length of each string in the array?
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle an empty array of strings?
   - How should it handle an array with only one string?
   - Are the strings case-sensitive?

Let's assume:
- The array can be of any length.
- Each string in the array can be of any length.
- The function should return 0 for an empty array.
- The function should return the length of the entire string if only one string is present.
- The strings are case-sensitive.

### Strategy
The strategy to find the longest common prefix involves the following steps:
1. **Initial Checks:** If the array is empty, return 0. If it has only one string, return the length of that string.
2. **Sorting (Optional but Useful):** Sort the array of strings. This helps because the common prefix of the entire array lies between the first and last strings after sorting.
3. **Compare Characters:** Compare characters of the first and last strings until the characters match. The index at which they stop matching is the length of the longest common prefix.

### Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int longestCommonPrefixLength(vector<string>& strs) {
    // Return 0 for an empty array
    if (strs.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // If there is only one string, return its length
    if (strs.size() == 1) {
        return strs[0].length();
    }

    // Sort the list of strings
    sort(strs.begin(), strs.end());

    // Compare the first and the last string to find the common prefix
    string first = strs[0];
    string last = strs[strs.size() - 1];
    int commonPrefixLength = 0;

    // Compare characters one by one
    for (int i = 0; i < min(first.size(), last.size()); ++i) {
        if (first[i] == last[i]) {
            ++commonPrefixLength;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return commonPrefixLength;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<string> strs = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
    cout << "Length of the longest common prefix: " << longestCommonPrefixLength(strs) << endl; // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of strings.
- **Comparing Characters:** Character comparison takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the shortest string.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n + m)\).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space (excluding the space used for the input data).

Feel free to ask further clarifying questions or provide specific constraints if needed!
