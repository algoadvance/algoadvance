[Leetcode 1690. Stone Game VII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1690)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. Each stone has a positive integer value, which is the score of the stone. Alice and Bob take turns removing either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values on the row. The game ends when there are no stones left to remove. The person with the higher score wins.

Return the difference in Alice's and Bob's scores if they both play optimally.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: stones = [5,3,1,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- Alice removes 2 to get the score = 15 
- Bob removes 5 to get the score = 10 
- Alice removes 4 to get the score = 6 
- Bob removes 1 to get the score = 2 
- At the end of the game, Alice has 15 points, and Bob has 10 points.
- Difference = 15 - 10 = 5
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: stones = [7,90,5,1,100,10,10,2]
Output: 122
```
    
### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the output reflect the difference in points in favor of Alice?
2. Can the input list of stones be empty or have unequal lengths?

Since the problem assumes non-empty lists and highlights optimal play by both parties, we will avoid handling edge cases like empty lists here for simplicity.

### Strategy

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem optimally:
1. We will maintain a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score difference Alice can achieve over Bob starting with the sub-array from index `i` to `j` (inclusive).
2. The score difference after removing a stone would depend on the sum of the values of the remaining stones.
3. Calculate the `prefix_sum` to easily fetch sum of the sub-array.
4. Use the prefix sum to calculate the two possible outcomes (removing the left stone and removing the right stone) and recursively fill the `dp` table.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int stoneGameVII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int n = stones.size();
        vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);

        // Calculate prefix sums
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + stones[i];
        }

        // dp[i][j] represents the maximum score difference for the range [i, j]
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int length = 2; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                int sumIJ = prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]; // Sum of stones[i...j]
                
                dp[i][j] = max(sumIJ - stones[i] - dp[i + 1][j], sumIJ - stones[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops that iterate through all possible sub-arrays of the stones array. The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) to store the `dp` table. Calculating the prefix sum is \(O(n)\), which is negligible compared to the dynamic programming processing.

* **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
* **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
