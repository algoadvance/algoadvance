### 493. Reverse Pairs

#### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of reverse pairs in the array.

A reverse pair is defined as `(i, j)` where:
- `0 <= i < j < nums.length` and 
- `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]`.

#### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
    - Yes, the array can contain any integers, including negative numbers.
2. Is there any limitation on the size of the array?
    - The size of the array is not explicitly limited, but typical constraints for Leetcode problems would apply (usually up to \(10^5\) elements).

#### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The reason we choose merge sort is because it allows us to count inversions (or reverse pairs, in this context) in O(n log n) time, which is more efficient than a brute force approach (O(n^2) time).

Here's the detailed strategy:
1. **Divide the array** into two halves recursively until each part contains only one element.
2. **Merge the arrays back together** while counting the reverse pairs.
3. During the merge step, for every element in the left half:
   - Determine how many elements in the right half satisfy the condition `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]`.
   - Count these pairs and add to the result.

This approach takes advantage of the sorted properties of the arrays during the merge step to efficiently count the reverse pairs.

#### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int reversePairs(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        return mergeSort(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);
    }

private:
    int mergeSort(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left >= right) return 0;
        
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        int count = mergeSort(nums, left, mid) + mergeSort(nums, mid + 1, right);
        
        // Count reverse pairs
        int j = mid + 1;
        for (int i = left; i <= mid; i++) {
            while (j <= right && nums[i] > 2LL * nums[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            count += (j - (mid + 1));
        }
        
        // Merge step
        vector<int> temp;
        int i = left, k = mid + 1;
        while (i <= mid && k <= right) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[k]) {
                temp.push_back(nums[i++]);
            } else {
                temp.push_back(nums[k++]);
            }
        }
        while (i <= mid) temp.push_back(nums[i++]);
        while (k <= right) temp.push_back(nums[k++]);
        
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            nums[i] = temp[i - left];
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because:
- The merge sort divides the array into halves (log n splits).
- Each merge operation takes linear time (O(n)).

By counting the reverse pairs during the merge step, we efficiently keep track of pairs without re-scanning parts of the array multiple times.
