[Leetcode 2617. Minimum Number of Visited Cells in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2617)
## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` grid consisting only of integers 0, you need to determine the minimum number of visited cells to go from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. In one move, you can go to any 0-cell that is directly right or directly down from the current cell. Your task is to find the minimum number of cells visited to reach from the starting cell to the ending cell. If it’s impossible, return `-1`.

**Input:**
- `grid`: an `m x n` matrix of integers 0, where `1 <= m` and `1 <= n`.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the minimum number of visited cells required to get from the top-left to the bottom-right, or `-1` if it’s not possible.


## Clarifying Questions

1. Can you confirm that the grid always contains only integers 0?
   - **Yes**, the grid will only contain integers 0.

2. Do diagonal or leftward movements allowed?
   - **No**, movements are only allowed to the right and downward.

3. Are the dimensions of the grid (m and n) constrained within a particular range?
   - There is no specific range constraint mentioned, but typical constraints for such problems are usually up to 10^3 (1 <= m, n <= 10^3).

## Strategy

We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to navigate through the grid because BFS will help us find the shortest path in an unweighted grid. Here’s how we can implement the solution:

1. Use a queue to keep track of cells to be visited next.
2. Use a set or a 2D array to mark cells as visited after they are added to the queue to avoid reprocessing.
3. Start from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` and attempt to move to the right or downward cells.
4. Track the number of steps for each cell.
5. If we reach the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`, return the number of steps.
6. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the bottom-right cell, return `-1` indicating it's not possible.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy using C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int minVisitedCells(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    if (m == 0 || n == 0) return -1;
    if (grid[0][0] != 0 || grid[m-1][n-1] != 0) return -1;
    
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    q.push({0, 0});
    visited[0][0] = true;
    
    int steps = 0;
    
    int directions[2][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}};
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        steps++;
        while (size--) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for (auto d : directions) {
                int newX = x + d[0];
                int newY = y + d[1];
                
                if (newX == m-1 && newY == n-1) return steps + 1;
                
                if (newX < m && newY < n && grid[newX][newY] == 0 && !visited[newX][newY]) {
                    visited[newX][newY] = true;
                    q.push({newX, newY});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {
        {0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 0}
    };
    
    cout << minVisitedCells(grid) << endl; // Output should be the minimum number of visited cells.
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The BFS traversal ensures that we visit each cell at most once, therefore the time complexity is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the visited array and the storage required for the queue.
