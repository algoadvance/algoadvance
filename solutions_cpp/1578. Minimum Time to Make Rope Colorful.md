[Leetcode 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1578)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `colors` where `colors[i]` is a character representing the color of the `i-th` balloon. You are also given an integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time needed to remove the `i-th` balloon.

The goal is to make the rope colorful, meaning no two adjacent balloons have the same color. To achieve this, you can remove some balloons, and the cost of removing a balloon is equal to the time specified in `neededTime`.

Return the minimum total time needed to make the rope colorful.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of `colors` and `neededTime` always the same?**
   - Yes, both arrays have the same length `n`.

2. **Can the characters in `colors` be any alphabetic characters?**
   - Yes, the characters in `colors` can be any alphabetic characters.

3. **What is the maximum allowed size for the input arrays?**
   - The problem constraints typically allow for arrays up to the size of \(10^5\).

4. **Should the function handle edge cases like empty arrays or single-element arrays?**
   - Yes, but these cases inherently would require no removal time because they already meet the requirement.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem by iterating through the arrays and ensuring no two adjacent balloons have the same color. When we encounter consecutive balloons of the same color, we remove the one with the lesser removal time to minimize the total time spent.

Here's the step-by-step strategy:
1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total minimum time.
2. Iterate through the `colors` array.
3. Whenever two consecutive balloons have the same color, remove the one with the smaller `neededTime` and add this time to the total minimum time.
4. Continue this until the end of the array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(std::string colors, std::vector<int>& neededTime) {
        int totalMinTime = 0;
        int n = colors.size();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            // If two consecutive balloons have the same color
            if (colors[i] == colors[i - 1]) {
                // Remove the balloon with the smaller removal time
                totalMinTime += std::min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
                
                // Keep the larger removal time for the next comparison
                if (neededTime[i] < neededTime[i - 1]) {
                    neededTime[i] = neededTime[i - 1];
                } // Otherwise, neededTime[i] is already larger or equal
            }
        }
        
        return totalMinTime;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because we iterate through the `colors` array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of space aside from the input arrays.

This ensures that the solution is efficient, even for the maximum allowed input sizes.
