[Leetcode 1883. Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1883)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `dist` which represents the total distance between a starting point and a meeting point, an integer `speed` representing the speed at which you travel, and an integer `hoursBefore` which represents the maximum amount of time (in hours) you have to reach the meeting point from the starting point. Each time you travel for one hour, you have a fixed speed, and you can skip a break after an hour. Your goal is to calculate the minimum number of breaks you need to skip to arrive at the meeting point on time.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Behavior on Edge Cases**: What should the function return if it's impossible to reach on time, given the constraints?
   - Return `-1` if it's impossible to reach on time.
   
2. **Nature of Speed and Distance**: Are the speed and distance always positive integers?
   - Yes, assume they are positive integers for simplicity.

3. **Breaks**: Does a break tangibly affect traveling time, or is it just an intermediate stop?
   - Each break adds an additional hour of zero velocity, but can be skipped.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**: 
    - Without skips, breaks will happen after every `speed` hours.
    - The total time required without skipping any breaks would be the ceiling of distances/speed in hours.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum skips required to cover the `i`th distance segment with `j` skips used.
    - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` because no distance requires zero skips initially.
    - Traverse the distance and update DP table considering whether to skip or not.
    - At the end, check the minimal value in the last row of DP table that meets or exceeds the allowed hours.

3. **Implementation Considerations**:
    - Define the DP table where `dp[i][j]` holds large enough value initially.
    - Update the DP table iteratively.
    - Result is minimum value in the last row.

## Code

Here's an implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minSkips(vector<int>& dist, int speed, int hoursBefore) {
        int n = dist.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, INT_MAX / 2));

        dp[0][0] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int k = 0; k <= i; ++k) {
                // Do not skip the break
                long reachTimeNoSkip = dp[i][k] + ceil((double)dist[i] / speed);
                if (i + 1 < n) {
                    reachTimeNoSkip = ((reachTimeNoSkip + speed - 1) / speed) * speed;  // round up to next hour
                }
                dp[i + 1][k] = min(dp[i + 1][k], (int)reachTimeNoSkip);

                // Skip the break
                dp[i + 1][k + 1] = min(dp[i + 1][k + 1], dp[i][k] + (dist[i] + speed - 1) / speed);
            }
        }

        for (int k = 0; k <= n; ++k) {
            if (dp[n][k] <= hoursBefore * speed) {
                return k;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) where `n` is the number of distance segments. This is due to the nested loops for building the DP table and checking the minimum skips required.

2. **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the size of the DP table storing values for each segment and skips.

This solution efficiently builds the DP table and finds the minimal number of skips required to ensure timely arrival at the meeting.
