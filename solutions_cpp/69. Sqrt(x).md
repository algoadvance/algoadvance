[Leetcode 69. Sqrt(x)](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l69)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to implement the function `int mySqrt(int x)` that computes and returns the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. In other words, it returns the greatest integer `q` such that `q^2` is less than or equal to `x`.

For example:
- Input: `x = 4`, Output: `2`
- Input: `x = 8`, Output: `2`

The input `x` is a non-negative integer, and we need to ensure the solution handles edge cases such as `x = 0`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `x` be a negative number?**
   - No, according to the problem statement, `x` is a non-negative integer.

2. **What is the maximum value of `x`?**
   - The value of `x` can be as large as the maximum value for an integer (`2^31 - 1`).

3. **Should we consider any floating-point precision errors?**
   - No, the result should be an integer.

## Strategy

A simple way to solve this problem is by using binary search:
1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `x`.
2. Use binary search to find the largest integer `mid` such that `mid * mid <= x`.
3. Adjust `left` and `right` based on the comparison of `mid * mid` with `x`.

The binary search approach will ensure we have a time complexity of `O(log x)`, which is efficient for handling up to the maximum possible value of `x`.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) return 0; // Handle the edge case where x is 0

        int left = 1, right = x, ans = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mid <= x / mid) { // Avoiding overflow with mid*mid <= x
                ans = mid;
                left = mid + 1; // Try for a higher number
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // Try for a lower number
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(log x)` due to the binary search mechanism. This ensures that for very large values of `x` (up to `2^31 - 1`), the computation remains efficient. The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of space.
