[Leetcode 1529. Minimum Suffix Flips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1529)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `target`, a binary string consists only of characters '0' and '1'. You have another binary string `start` with the same length as `target` and initially all characters in `start` are '0'. In one operation you can pick a suffix of `start` (i.e., a substring which starts at a position `i` and goes to the end of `start`) and flip all characters in this substring. Your task is to make `start` equal to `target` with the minimum number of operations and return the minimum number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `target` string be empty?
   - No, `target` string will have at least one character.

2. Are the lengths of the `start` and `target` strings always the same?
   - Yes, the `start` string is of the same length as `target` and initialized to all '0's.

3. Can there be multiple ways to achieve `target`?
   - Yes, but the goal is to find the minimal number of operations.

4. Are there any constraints on the length of the `target` string?
   - The `target` string will be of reasonable length (e.g., 1 <= length <= 10^5).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the key observation is that you need to count the number of "flips" you need to perform to make `start` equal to `target`.

- Initialize `start` as a string of '0's initially.
- Traverse through the target string and observe changes in sequence from `0` -> `1` or `1` -> `0`.
- Every time you see a change from `target[i-1]` to `target[i]` (for `i > 0`), you know a flip needs to be performed.

Thus, the number of flips is equal to the number of transitions between subsequent characters ('0' -> '1' or '1' -> '0') plus possibly one additional flip if the first character of the `target` is '1'.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int minFlips(string target) {
    int flips = 0;
    char current_state = '0';
    
    for (char c : target) {
        if (c != current_state) {
            flips++;
            current_state = c;
        }
    }
    
    return flips;
}

int main() {
    string target = "10111";
    cout << "Minimum flips required: " << minFlips(target) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. Initialize `current_state` to '0' as the `start` string is all '0's initially.
2. Loop through each character in the `target` string.
3. If the current character is different from `current_state`, it means a transition is required, so increment the `flips` counter and update `current_state` to the current character.
4. Return the total count of `flips`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `target` string. This is because we only need to traverse the string once and perform a constant amount of work for each character. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few extra variables.
