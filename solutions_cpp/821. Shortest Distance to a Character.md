[Leetcode 821. Shortest Distance to a Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l821)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character `c` in the string.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = 'e'
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaab", c = 'b'
Output: [3,2,1,0]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` will be in the range [1, 10^4].

2. **Are all characters in the string `s` lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, all characters in `s` are lowercase English letters.

3. **Does the character `c` always appear in the string `s`?**
   - Yes, the character `c` always appears at least once in the string `s`.

4. **What should be returned if `s` contains only the character `c`?**
   - Return an array of zeros with the same length as `s`, since the distance to `c` is zero at every position.

## Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we will:

1. Initialize an array `result` of the same length as `s` with large values (like infinity).
2. Do a forward pass to fill out the shortest distances to `c` considering only the previous occurrences of `c`.
3. Do a backward pass to refine the distances using the next occurrences of `c`.

### Steps:
1. Iterate through the string from left to right:
   - Update the current distance when encountering the character `c`.
   - Update the `result` array with this distance for each position.
2. Iterate through the string from right to left:
   - Similarly, update the current distance when encountering the character `c`.
   - Update the `result` array to ensure the shortest distance is recorded for each position.

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, due to the two linear passes through the string.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

std::vector<int> shortestToChar(const std::string &s, char c) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n, INT_MAX);
    
    // Forward pass
    int prev = -INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == c) {
            prev = i;
        }
        result[i] = std::min(result[i], abs(i - prev));
    }
    
    // Backward pass
    prev = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (s[i] == c) {
            prev = i;
        }
        result[i] = std::min(result[i], abs(i - prev));
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

By structuring the solution in two passes, we ensure the correct shortest distance is captured for each position in the string.
