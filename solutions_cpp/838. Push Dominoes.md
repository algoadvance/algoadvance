[Leetcode 838. Push Dominoes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l838)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` dominoes in a line, and each domino is either upright (`'.'`), tilting to the left (`'L'`), or tilting to the right (`'R'`). Given a string `dominoes` representing the initial state, return a string representing the final state of the dominoes after pushing and toppling over.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can multiple `R` and `L` dominoes influence a single upright domino at the same time?
2. How do dominoes behave when they are influenced by both `L` and `R` forces at the same time?
3. Are the inputs guaranteed to be valid with only characters `'.'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`?

Assuming the answers:
1. Yes, each upright domino can be influenced by its neighbors.
2. If a domino is influenced by both `L` and `R` at the same time, it remains upright.
3. Yes, the inputs are guaranteed to be valid.

### Strategy

1. Traverse the domino string and look for segments of continuous upright dominoes (`'.'`) that are bounded by `L` and `R`.
2. Identify the influences on each segment:
    - If a segment is only affected by `R` on the left, the dominoes fall right.
    - If a segment is only affected by `L` on the right, the dominoes fall left.
    - If a segment is affected by both `R` and `L`, balance the forces:
        - Dominoes equidistant from `R` and `L` remain upright.
        - Dominoes closer to `R` fall to the right, and those closer to `L` fall to the left.
3. Construct the final string based on these influences.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string pushDominoes(std::string dominoes) {
    int n = dominoes.length();
    std::vector<int> forces(n, 0);
    
    int force = 0;
    // Traverse left to right to apply forces from 'R'
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (dominoes[i] == 'R') {
            force = n;  // start with the maximum force
        } else if (dominoes[i] == 'L') {
            force = 0;  // no force from right after an 'L'
        } else {
            force = std::max(force - 1, 0);  // decrease force gradually
        }
        forces[i] += force;
    }
    
    force = 0;
    // Traverse right to left to apply forces from 'L'
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (dominoes[i] == 'L') {
            force = n;  // start with the maximum force
        } else if (dominoes[i] == 'R') {
            force = 0;  // no force from left after an 'R'
        } else {
            force = std::max(force - 1, 0);  // decrease force gradually
        }
        forces[i] -= force;
    }
    
    // Determine the final state of the dominoes
    std::string result(n, '.');
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (forces[i] > 0) {
            result[i] = 'R';
        } else if (forces[i] < 0) {
            result[i] = 'L';
        } else {
            result[i] = '.';
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string dominoes = ".L.R...LR..L..";
    std::string result = pushDominoes(dominoes);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - We traverse the string a total of two times, once for each direction of force application.
   - Each traversal takes linear time O(n), making the total time complexity linear.

2. **Space Complexity**: O(n)
   - We use an additional array to store forces acting on each domino, which results in an O(n) space complexity.
