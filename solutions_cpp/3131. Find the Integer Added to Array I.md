[Leetcode 3131. Find the Integer Added to Array I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3131)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, find the integer that was added to the array. Initially, the array consists of the numbers from 1 to n, but one number has been added to the array. Return the integer that was added to the array. 

Example:
```
Input: nums = [4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 7, 8]
Output: 6
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range for the input array `nums`?**
   - The size is n + 1, where n represents the range from 1 to n.
   
2. **Are all elements in the input array unique besides the added one?**
   - Yes, besides the added integer, all elements are unique and within the range 1 to `n`.

3. **Can the added integer be from outside the range of 1 to `n`?**
   - No, the integer added will be one of the integers ranging from 1 to n.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. Calculate the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula:
   \[
   \text{sum}_\text{expected} = \frac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. Calculate the sum of all elements present in the `nums` array:
   \[
   \text{sum}_\text{actual}
   \]

3. The integer that was added will be the difference:
   \[
   \text{added\ integer} = \text{sum}_\text{actual} - \text{sum}_\text{expected}
   \]

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>  // for accumulate function

int findAddedInteger(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size() - 1;
    int sum_expected = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    int sum_actual = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    return sum_actual - sum_expected;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 7, 8};
    int result = findAddedInteger(nums);
    std::cout << "The added integer is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array minus 1. This is because:
- Computing the sum of elements in the array using `std::accumulate` takes linear time, i.e., **O(n + 1)**.

The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
