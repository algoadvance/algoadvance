[Leetcode 1776. Car Fleet II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1776)
### Problem Statement
You are given `n` cars numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a performance test. The `speed` and `position` of each car are represented by 1D arrays `speed` and `position` respectively: with `speed[i]` and `position[i]` being the speed and position of the `i-th` car. 

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same speed. If a car catches up to another car in front of it, they will form a fleet and the car behind will have the same speed as the car in front of it. It is possible to have a single car as a fleet.

Given `speed` and `position`, return an array answer where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `i-th` car catches up to the car in front of it, or -1 if the car does not catch up to the car in front during the test.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the speeds and positions guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   Yes, both the speeds and positions are non-negative.

2. **Is the length of `speed` and `position` always the same?**
   Yes, both arrays have the same length, `n`.

3. **Can there be multiple cars at the same initial position?**
   No, all positions are distinct.

4. **What should be returned for the last car in the list?**
   For the last car, you should return -1 as there is no car in front of it.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting Cars by Positions**:
   - First, determine the order of the cars by sorting them based on their positions since cars will only catch up to those in front of them.

2. **Stack to Determine Fleets**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of cars that are forming fleets.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of cars from the last car to the first car (right to left).
   - Determine the time it takes for each car to catch up to the fleet in front of it using the formula:
        - \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{position[j]} - \text{position[i]}}{\text{speed[i]} - \text{speed[j]}} \)
   - If the car in front (from back to front) can catch up, update the fleet accordingly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>
#include <utility>

std::vector<double> getCollisionTimes(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& cars) {
    int n = cars.size();
    std::vector<double> result(n, -1);
    std::stack<int> stack; // Stack to store indicies of cars

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int position = cars[i][0];
        int speed = cars[i][1];

        // Pop out all the cars that cannot be affected by current car `i`
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int j = stack.top();
            int position2 = cars[j][0];
            int speed2 = cars[j][1];
            if (speed <= speed2 || (position2 - position) / (speed - speed2) >= result[j] && result[j] > 0) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        // Calculate collision time with the car in front
        if (!stack.empty()) {
            int j = stack.top();
            result[i] = static_cast<double>(cars[j][0] - position) / static_cast<double>(speed - cars[j][1]);
        }

        // Push current car index onto the stack
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Iterate from the last car to the first**: This ensures that we are only considering cars that are ahead in the position.
2. **Using Stack**: The stack helps keep track of the cars in a decreasing manner of their positions.
3. **Collision Detection**: Calculate the time it takes for a car to collide with the next car in the stack. If the next car in the stack is already part of a fleet, recheck the timing accordingly.
4. **Update the Stack**: Only keep relevant cars in the stack to simplify collision detection.

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves iterating over the list of cars, and for each car, potential pop operations on the stack. Thus, the time complexity is \( O(n) \) amortized, due to each car being pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
