[Leetcode 920. Number of Music Playlists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l920)
Sure! Let's go through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement
You need to create `N` different songs for a special-purpose music playlist which contains exactly `L` songs. There are certain constraints:
1. Each song is played at least once.
2. A song cannot be played again until at least `K` other different songs have been played.

Given `N, L,` and `K`, determine the number of possible playlists you can create. Output the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are `N, L,` and `K` positive integers?
2. What is the range of `N, L,` and `K`? (Typical constraints like 1 <= K <= N <= L <= 100)

### Strategy
This is a combinatorial problem involving dynamic programming. We can define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
- `i` is the number of unique songs used so far.
- `j` is the length of the playlist constructed so far.

The main transitions are:
1. If we add a new song that's not yet in the playlist:
   - The number of ways to do this is `dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - (i-1))` since we choose one of the remaining `N - (i-1)` songs.
2. If we add a song that has been used before but respecting the `K` constraint:
   - The number of ways to do this is `dp[i][j-1] * (i - K)` where `i - K` gives the valid songs that can be reused.

The solution will be stored in `dp[N][L]` representing `N` unique songs in a playlist of length `L`.

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int numMusicPlaylists(int N, int L, int K) {
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(N+1, vector<long long>(L+1, 0));

    dp[0][0] = 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
        for(int j = 1; j <= L; ++j) {
            // Add a new song not in the playlist
            dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - (i-1)) % MOD;
            dp[i][j] %= MOD;
            
            // Reuse a song that we have already used 'i' songs (at least K apart)
            if(i > K) {
                dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1] * (i - K) % MOD;
                dp[i][j] %= MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[N][L];
}

int main() {
    int N, L, K;
    cout << "Enter N, L, K: ";
    cin >> N >> L >> K;
    cout << "Number of playlists: " << numMusicPlaylists(N, L, K) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. `dp[0][0] = 1` initializes the base case where a 0-length playlist with 0 songs is trivially achievable in one way.
2. We fill the DP table for all possible lengths up to `L` using a nested loop.
3. For each entry, we consider both adding a new song or reusing an old one as described in the strategy.

### Time Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(N*L)` because we maintain a DP table of size `(N+1) x (L+1)`.
- The time complexity is `O(N*L)` as well since we're filling up each entry of this table exactly once.

This ensures an efficient solution for the problem constraints described.
