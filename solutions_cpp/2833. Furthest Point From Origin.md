[Leetcode 2833. Furthest Point From Origin](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2833)
### Problem Statement

You're given a string `moves` consisting of characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`. Each character represents a move along a straight line:
- `'L'`: Move one step to the left.
- `'R'`: Move one step to the right.
- `'_'`: Move can either be `'L'` or `'R'`.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible distance from the origin after all the moves in the string `moves`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string be empty?**
    - No, the problem guarantees the string `moves` contains at least one character.
    
2. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `moves`?**
    - Typically in such problems, constraints could be up to `10^5` characters, but this will be coded in a generic way without assuming a specific limit.

3. **Does the order of moves matter?**
    - Yes, the characters in the string `moves` are sequential moves to be followed accordingly.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Definitions:**
   - `left_moves`: Count of movements to the left `'L'`.
   - `right_moves`: Count of movements to the right `'R'`.
   - `neutral_moves`: Count of movements which can be either `'L'` or `'R'` denoted by `'_'`.

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - If all neutral moves are considered as moves to the left, the resultant distance from origin is `left_moves + neutral_moves - right_moves`.
   - If all neutral moves are considered as moves to the right, the resultant distance from origin is `right_moves + neutral_moves - left_moves`.
   - The maximum distance is the greater of these two scenarios.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Loop through the string to count `left_moves`, `right_moves`, and `neutral_moves`.
   - Calculate the potential maximum distance by considering all neutral moves as either left or right and take the maximum of these potential distances.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

int furthestPointFromOrigin(const std::string &moves) {
    int left_moves = 0, right_moves = 0, neutral_moves = 0;
    
    for (char move : moves) {
        if (move == 'L') left_moves++;
        else if (move == 'R') right_moves++;
        else if (move == '_') neutral_moves++;
    }
    
    int max_distance = std::max(left_moves + neutral_moves - right_moves, right_moves + neutral_moves - left_moves);
    return max_distance;
}

int main() {
    std::string moves = "L__R_RL";
    std::cout << "Furthest Point From Origin: " << furthestPointFromOrigin(moves) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `moves`. This is because we iterate through the string once to count the moves.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we use a fixed amount of space for counting the moves (`left_moves`, `right_moves`, `neutral_moves`).

This approach effectively counts the different types of moves and computes the maximum possible distance from the origin by considering all possible choices for neutral moves.
