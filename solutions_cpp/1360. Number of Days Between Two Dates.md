[Leetcode 1360. Number of Days Between Two Dates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1360)
### Problem Statement
Given two dates `date1` and `date2`, each in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, return the number of days between the two dates. The dates are guaranteed to be valid dates and there will not be any time zone difference in the date values.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Each date will be in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. **Output Format**: Return an integer representing the absolute difference in days.
3. **Edge Cases**: Ensure to handle leap years correctly. The difference should be always non-negative.

### Strategy
1. **Date Conversion**: Convert both date strings into a date object or broken-down components (year, month, day).
2. **Days Calculation**: 
    - Calculate the total number of days from year 0 to each date.
    - Find the absolute difference between these two calculations.
3. **Helper Functions**:
    - A function to check if a year is a leap year.
    - A function to convert a date to the number of days from year 0.
    
### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Check if a given year is leap year
bool isLeapYear(int year) {
    return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0);
}

// Get the number of days in a month
int daysInMonth(int year, int month) {
    static const int daysInMonths[12] = {
        31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31
    };
    if (month == 2 && isLeapYear(year)) {
        return 29;
    }
    return daysInMonths[month - 1];
}

// Convert the date string to number of days from year 0
int dateToDays(const string& date) {
    int year = stoi(date.substr(0, 4));
    int month = stoi(date.substr(5, 2));
    int day = stoi(date.substr(8, 2));

    int days = day;
    // Adding days for the months in the current year
    for (int m = 1; m < month; ++m) {
        days += daysInMonth(year, m);
    }
    // Adding days for the years before the current year
    for (int y = 0; y < year; ++y) {
        days += isLeapYear(y) ? 366 : 365;
    }

    return days;
}

// Main function to calculate the number of days between two dates
int daysBetweenDates(const string& date1, const string& date2) {
    int days1 = dateToDays(date1);
    int days2 = dateToDays(date2);
    return abs(days1 - days2);
}

int main() {
    string date1 = "2020-01-15";
    string date2 = "2019-12-31";
    cout << "Number of days between " << date1 << " and " << date2 << ": " << daysBetweenDates(date1, date2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since it involves a fixed number of operations regardless of the specific input dates. Specifically:
- Converting a date string to days involves a fixed number of arithmetic and logical operations.
- There are no loops dependent on the length of the input.

The operations involve:
- Parsing the date strings to integers (year, month, day) — O(1).
- Calculating the number of days by iterating through months and years in a fixed manner — O(1).

Thus, the algorithm is very efficient for this problem.
