[Leetcode 1023. Camelcase Matching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1023)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of queries `queries` and a string `pattern`. For each query in `queries`, return a boolean whether the query matches the `pattern`.

A query matches the `pattern` if we can insert lowercase English letters into `pattern` to match the query.

- The query should not contain uppercase letters that are not present in the pattern's uppercase letters in the same order.
- Substrings that are inserted must be made up of lowercase letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the length range for the queries and pattern?**
   - A: Both the queries and pattern have lengths ranging from 1 to 100.

2. **Q: Will there be any special characters in the queries or pattern?**
   - A: No, all characters will be English letters (both lowercase and uppercase).

3. **Q: Is the comparison required to be case-sensitive?**
   - A: Yes, uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct and need to be matched exactly.

4. **Q: How many queries do we need to process?**
   - A: We need to process up to 1000 queries.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each query**:
    - For each query, use two pointers: one pointing to the characters of the query and another to the characters of the pattern.

2. **Compare characters**:
    - Traverse through the query, and try to match it with the pattern while ensuring the uppercase characters in the query appear in the same order and match exactly with those in the pattern.
    - If a character in the query is lowercase, it can either be part of an inserted sequence or part of the matching sequence.
    - If a character is uppercase and doesnâ€™t match the current character in the pattern, or if the relative order is incorrect, mark this query as not matching.

3. **Check remaining characters**:
    - After processing all characters in the query, ensure all characters in the pattern have been matched.

4. **Store results**:
    - Store a boolean result for each query, indicating whether it matches the pattern or not.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

vector<bool> camelMatch(vector<string>& queries, string pattern) {
    // Helper function to check if a query matches the pattern
    auto match = [&](const string& query, const string& pattern) -> bool {
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < query.size(); ++i) {
            if (j < pattern.size() && query[i] == pattern[j]) {
                ++j;
            } else if (isupper(query[i])) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return j == pattern.size();
    };

    vector<bool> results;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        results.push_back(match(query, pattern));
    }
    return results;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pattern Matching Function (`match`) Complexity**:
    - For each character in the query, we compare it with the pattern character or check if it's uppercase.
    - This is O(m) where m is the length of the query.

- **Overall Complexity**:
    - Given `n` queries each of maximum length `m`, the total complexity is O(n * m).

### Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    vector<string> queries = {"FooBar", "FooBarTest", "FootBall", "FrameBuffer", "ForceFeedBack"};
    string pattern = "FB";

    vector<bool> results = camelMatch(queries, pattern);

    for (bool result : results) {
        cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet will output whether each query matches the pattern "FB" following the CamelCase matching rules.
