[Leetcode 2201. Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2201)
### Problem Statement
You are given an n x n grid and a 0-indexed integer array `artifacts` describing the positions of some artifacts on the grid, and a 0-indexed 2D integer array `dig` where each `dig[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that you have dug at the cell `(ri, ci)`.

The artifacts array is such that `artifacts[i]` contains four integers `[r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i]`, where:
- `(r1i, c1i)` represents the top-left cell of the ith artifact.
- `(r2i, c2i)` represents the bottom-right cell of the ith artifact.

You can extract an artifact if, and only if, you have dug out every cell that it occupies.

Return the number of artifacts that you can extract.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `artifacts` array contain potentially overlapping artifacts?
2. Is it necessary to return the indices of the artifacts or just the count?
3. What are the constraints on the size of the grid `n` and the length of the `artifacts` and `dig` arrays?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The grid size `n` is between 1 and 1000.
- The size of `artifacts` and `dig` arrays is at most `5000`.
- Artifacts do not overlap.

### Strategy
1. **Mark Dug Cells**: We create a grid of the same size and mark cells for all positions in `dig`.
2. **Check Artifacts**: For each artifact, iterate through the cells it covers and check if all those cells have been dug.
3. **Count Artifacts**: Increment the count of artifacts that can be fully extracted based on the dug cells.

### Code
Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int countArtifacts(int n, vector<vector<int>>& artifacts, vector<vector<int>>& dig) {
    // Step 1: Create a dig grid to mark all dug positions
    vector<vector<bool>> dugGrid(n, vector<bool>(n, false));
    for (const vector<int>& d : dig) {
        dugGrid[d[0]][d[1]] = true;
    }

    // Step 2: Count the number of artifacts that can be fully extracted
    int extractableArtifacts = 0;

    for (const vector<int>& artifact : artifacts) {
        int r1 = artifact[0], c1 = artifact[1], r2 = artifact[2], c2 = artifact[3];
        bool canBeExtracted = true;

        for (int r = r1; r <= r2 && canBeExtracted; ++r) {
            for (int c = c1; c <= c2 && canBeExtracted; ++c) {
                if (!dugGrid[r][c]) {
                    canBeExtracted = false;
                }
            }
        }

        if (canBeExtracted) {
            ++extractableArtifacts;
        }
    }

    return extractableArtifacts;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(K + L + M)** where `K` is the size of `dig`, `L` is the number of artifacts, and `M` is the average number of cells covered by each artifact.
  - **O(K)** to mark all dug positions in the grid.
  - **O(L * M)** to check if each artifact can be fully extracted, where \(M\) is dependent on the size of the artifacts.

This ensures that our solution is efficient given the constraints provided.
