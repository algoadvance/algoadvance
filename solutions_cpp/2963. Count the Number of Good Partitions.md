[Leetcode 2963. Count the Number of Good Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2963)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, `nums`, and an integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of good partitions of the array. A partition is defined as good if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. The length of the partition is exactly `k`.
2. The sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the partition is at most a given value `k` (inclusive).

We need to write a function that returns the count of such good partitions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array `nums` contain negative numbers?
2. What should be the range of values for `nums` and `k`?
3. Is there any constraint on the size of the array `nums`?
4. Should the partitions be contiguous subarrays, or can they be non-contiguous?

For the purpose of this problem, let's assume:
- `nums` can contain both positive and negative numbers.
- The values in `nums` can be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
- The size of `nums` can go up to \(10^4\).
- The partitions should be contiguous subarrays of size exactly `k`.

### Strategy

1. Iterate over the array `nums` using a sliding window approach to consider each subarray of length `k`.
2. For each subarray, calculate the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements.
3. Check if this sum is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, count this partition as good.
4. Return the total count of good partitions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib> // for abs()

using namespace std;

int countGoodPartitions(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (k <= 0 || k > n) {
        return 0; // If k is invalid, return 0 immediately.
    }
    
    int good_count = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each possible starting point for a subarray of length k.
    for (int start = 0; start <= n - k; ++start) {
        int abs_sum = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of absolute differences for this subarray.
        for (int i = start; i < start + k - 1; ++i) {
            abs_sum += abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]);
        }

        // Check if this sum is <= k.
        if (abs_sum <= k) {
            ++good_count;
        }
    }
    
    return good_count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm iterates over the array with a sliding window of size `k`, and for each window position, it calculates the sum of absolute differences using another loop of size `k`. Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(nk)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using only a fixed amount of extra space to store variables for counting and summing differences.

This algorithm should work efficiently for arrays where \(n\) is up to \(10^4\). If `k` is small, the time complexity will be manageable even for large arrays.
