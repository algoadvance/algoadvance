[Leetcode 1362. Closest Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1362)
Certainly! Below is a sectioned breakdown for solving the LeetCode problem 1362 (Closest Divisors) in C++.

### Problem Statement
The problem is as follows:
Given an integer `num`, find the closest two integers in absolute difference such that the product of these two integers is either `num + 1` or `num + 2`. Return these two integers in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**: 
    - What is the range of the input value `num`?
    - Is there a guaranteed solution for every input `num`?

    *Response*:
    - The range of `num` is typically given as \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) in LeetCode problems.
    - Yes, there is always a solution because every integer has at least two divisors: 1 and itself.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Target Numbers**: 
    - We need to consider `num + 1` and `num + 2`.

2. **Finding Closest Pair of Divisors**:
    - For each of these target numbers, find pairs `(a, b)` such that `a * b = target`.
    - The goal is to find the pair with the smallest absolute difference `|a - b|`.

3. **Efficient Search**:
    - Iterate from the square root of the target down to 1:
      - If `i` divides the target perfectly, then `target / i` gives the corresponding pair.
      - Check if this pair has the smallest absolute difference encountered so far.

### Code
Here’s how this can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdlib> // For abs

using namespace std;

vector<int> closestDivisors(int num) {
    // Helper function to find closest divisors for a given target
    auto getClosestDivisors = [](int target) -> vector<int> {
        for (int i = int(sqrt(target)); i > 0; --i) {
            if (target % i == 0) {
                return {i, target / i};
            }
        }
        return {}; // This line is never reached because 1 and the number itself are always divisors
    };
    
    vector<int> closest1 = getClosestDivisors(num + 1);
    vector<int> closest2 = getClosestDivisors(num + 2);
    
    // Compare which pair has a smaller absolute difference
    if (abs(closest1[0] - closest1[1]) < abs(closest2[0] - closest2[1])) {
        return closest1;
    } else {
        return closest2;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Calculation of Divisors**: For each target number (`num + 1` and `num + 2`), the loop runs from the square root of the target down to 1. This gives us O(√n) time complexity for each target number, where `n` is the target number.
- **Overall Complexity**: Since we perform the divisor search for two numbers (`num + 1` and `num + 2`), the total time complexity is O(√n).

This solution ensures that we find the closest pair of divisors efficiently, leveraging the mathematical property that divisors are found more quickly by iterating downwards from the square root.
