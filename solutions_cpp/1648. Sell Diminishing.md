[Leetcode 1648. Sell Diminishing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1648)
## Problem Statement

You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants to buy `orders` balls. The `i-th` ball has a value equal to `inventory[i]` (meaning that there are `inventory[i]` balls of the `i-th` color). These balls will be sold one by one.

The value of a ball decreases by 1 each time a customer buys a ball. For example, a ball of value `v` will cost the customer `v` dollars initially, then `v-1` dollars the next time it is bought, and so on until it reaches 1 dollar. After that, the ball may no longer be sold.

You want to maximize the total value that you can obtain from selling `orders` balls.

Write a function `maxProfit` to solve the problem. 

```cpp
int maxProfit(vector<int>& inventory, int orders);
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory), 10^9)`
- The answer can be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the inventory or orders be empty?
   **A**: No, based on the problem constraints, the length of the inventory is at least 1 and orders is at least 1.

2. **Q**: Are the values in the inventory guaranteed to be positive?
   **A**: Yes, each element in the inventory is at least 1 as per constraints.

3. **Q**: What should be returned if the number of orders is greater than possible balls to sell?
   **A**: This is handled by the constraints - the number of `orders` will not exceed `sum(inventory)`.

## Strategy

The main idea is to always sell the highest valued balls available to maximize the profit. A greedy approach should work well here. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Sort the Inventory**:
    - Sort the inventory in descending order to access the highest valued balls first.

2. **Utilize a Priority Queue**:
    - Use a max-heap to keep track of the highest available values and their frequencies.

3. **Selling the Balls**:
    - Continuously sell the balls with the current highest value.
    - Decrease the value each time a ball is sold.
    - Track the total profit and adhere to the given number of orders.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**:
    - Since the result can be large, perform all arithmetic operations under modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the inventory takes `O(n log n)`.
- Popping from and pushing into a heap each take `O(log n)`.
- In the worst case, each ball might be processed individually, so effectively we have `O(n log n)` for sorting and operations that depend on number of orders, resulting in a feasible time complexity given the constraints.

## Code

Here is the C++ function to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& inventory, int orders) {
        long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
        priority_queue<int> pq(inventory.begin(), inventory.end());
        
        long long totalProfit = 0;
        
        while (orders > 0) {
            int highestValue = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            
            // Find the next lower value in the inventory or 0 if empty
            int nextValue = pq.empty() ? 0 : pq.top();
            // Number of current balls to be sold
            int numBallsToSell = highestValue - nextValue;
            // The count of balls we can sell at the range of highestValue to nextValue+1
            int totalSellableBalls = numBallsToSell;
            
            if (orders >= totalSellableBalls) {
                // Sum of arithmetic series: Sum(n) = n * (first + last) / 2
                totalProfit += static_cast<long long>(numBallsToSell) * (highestValue + nextValue + 1) / 2;
                orders -= totalSellableBalls;
            } else {
                int fullRows = orders / 1; 
                int remainder = orders % 1;
                totalProfit += static_cast<long long>(fullRows) * (highestValue + (highestValue - fullRows + 1)) / 2;
                totalProfit += static_cast<long long>(remainder) * (highestValue - fullRows);
                orders = 0;
            }
            
            totalProfit %= mod;
            
            if (nextValue < highestValue - 1) {
                pq.push(nextValue + 1); // Push back next value incrementally adjusted
            }
        }
        
        return totalProfit % mod;
    }
};
```

This code efficiently calculates the maximum profit by selling the highest valued balls first and handling the arithmetic series to quickly sum profits.
