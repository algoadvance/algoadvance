[Leetcode 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l958)
### Problem Statement

A binary tree is considered complete if all levels except the last are completely filled, and all nodes are left-aligned. This means that in the last level, the nodes must fill from the leftmost side onwards without any gaps in between.

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the tree be empty?** 
   - Yes, an empty tree is considered complete by definition.
   
2. **What are the data constraints?**
   - The binary tree node values don't affect whether the tree is complete or not.

3. **Is it valid to assume that the node count fits within a typical integer constraint?**
   - Yes, you can assume the number of nodes in the tree is within integer limits.

### Strategy

To check if the binary tree is complete, we can perform a level order traversal (BFS). During the traversal, we should follow these steps:

1. Use a queue to facilitate the level order traversal.
2. Once a `nullptr` is encountered, ensure that no additional non-null nodes are found beyond this point.
3. If any non-null node is found after a `nullptr`, the tree is not complete.

### Algorithm
1. Initialize an empty queue and push the root node into it.
2. While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue an element from the queue.
    - If `nullptr` is encountered, set a flag indicating that all following nodes must also be `nullptr`.
    - If a node is not `nullptr` after encountering a `nullptr`, return `false`.
    - Otherwise, enqueue the left and right children of the node if they are not `nullptr`.
3. If the traversal finishes without issue, return `true`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree because each node is visited exactly once.
- The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the queue data structure holding all nodes at the last level.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true;

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        bool encounteredNull = false;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* current = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (current == nullptr) {
                encounteredNull = true;
            } else {
                if (encounteredNull) {
                    return false;
                }
                q.push(current->left);
                q.push(current->right);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    // Building a tree for demonstration
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    
    bool isComplete = solution.isCompleteTree(root);
    cout << (isComplete ? "The binary tree is complete." : "The binary tree is not complete.") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code should be sufficient to check if a binary tree is complete, following the guidelines provided.
