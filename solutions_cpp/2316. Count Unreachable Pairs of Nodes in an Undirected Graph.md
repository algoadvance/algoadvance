[Leetcode 2316. Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2316)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given a 2D array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes a bidirectional edge between node `u_i` and node `v_i`.

Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the graph guaranteed to be sparse?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically we work under the assumption that the graph can have any density.

2. **Can the graph have self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically for simplicity, we assume no self-loops and no multiple edges.

3. **Are the nodes guaranteed to be connected?**
   - No, the graph can be disconnected; that's the crux of finding unreachable pairs.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** 
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph since it's typically easier to traverse.

2. **Component Identification:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components of the graph.
   
3. **Counting Nodes in Components:**
   - For each connected component, count the number of nodes.

4. **Counting Unreachable Pairs:**
   - For each component with `size = sz`, the nodes in this component are unreachable from the nodes in all other components. The number of pairs of unreachable nodes involving this component and another component of size `rest` is `sz * rest`.
   - To efficiently calculate the number of unreachable pairs, maintain a running sum of the sizes of the components traversed so far.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long countPairs(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Graph representation: adjacency list
        vector<vector<int>> adjList(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adjList[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adjList[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Visited array to keep track of visited nodes
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        
        // Function to perform DFS and return the size of the component
        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int node) {
            visited[node] = true;
            int size = 1;
            for (int neighbor : adjList[node]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    size += dfs(neighbor);
                }
            }
            return size;
        };
        
        // Component sizes and total number of unreachable pairs calculation
        long long unreachablePairs = 0;
        long long sumComponentSizes = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int componentSize = dfs(i);
                unreachablePairs += sumComponentSizes * componentSize;
                sumComponentSizes += componentSize;
            }
        }
        
        return unreachablePairs;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Adjacency List Creation:** O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **DFS Traversal:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Each node and each edge is processed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(V + E).

### Conclusion

The solution effectively counts the unreachable pairs by identifying connected components and leveraging their sizes. By maintaining a running sum of the sizes of components processed so far, we can efficiently compute the number of unreachable pairs for each new component found during the traversal.
