[Leetcode 1476. Subrectangle Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1476)
## Problem Statement

The problem "1476. Subrectangle Queries" from LeetCode requires designing a class `SubrectangleQueries` with the following responsibilities:
1. Initialize the object with a given rectangle.
2. Update the subrectangle with given values.
3. Fetch the value from a given coordinate.

Here are the functions you need to implement:
1. `SubrectangleQueries(vector<vector<int>>& rectangle)` - Initializes the object with the given rectangle.
2. `void updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)` - Updates all values from `(row1, col1)` to `(row2, col2)` to `newValue`.
3. `int getValue(int row, int col)` - Returns the current value of the cell at `(row, col)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the inputs? How large can the rectangle be, and what are the potential ranges for the row and column indices?
2. **Update Frequency:** How frequently should we expect to update subrectangles vs. querying values? This is to understand if there is a need for optimization for either operation.

## Strategy

We'll start by defining the class `SubrectangleQueries`. The class will include:
- A constructor to initialize the class with the given rectangle.
- A method to update the values in the specified subrectangle.
- A method to fetch the value at a specified cell.

### Method Breakdown
1. **Constructor:** The constructor will simply store the initial 2D vector representing the rectangle.
2. **Update Method:** The update method will iterate through the specified subrectangle and set each value to `newValue`.
3. **GetValue Method:** The getValue method will return the value at the specified cell in the rectangle.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the object: **O(1)** if we just store the reference to the input rectangle, or **O(n*m)** if we need to copy it.
- Update operation: **O((row2-row1+1) * (col2-col1+1))** which is linear relative to the number of elements updated.
- Get value operation: **O(1)** since it's a direct access.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class SubrectangleQueries {
public:
    // Member variable to store the rectangle
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> rectangle;

    // Constructor to initialize the object with the given rectangle
    SubrectangleQueries(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& rectangle) {
        this->rectangle = rectangle;
    }

    // Method to update the subrectangle with given values
    void updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue) {
        for (int r = row1; r <= row2; ++r) {
            for (int c = col1; c <= col2; ++c) {
                rectangle[r][c] = newValue;
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to fetch the value from a given coordinate
    int getValue(int row, int col) {
        return rectangle[row][col];
    }
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Constructor:** 
   - We simply copy the input rectangle to the class member variable.

2. **UpdateSubrectangle:**
   - We use two nested loops to iterate through every element in the specified subrectangle and set each element to the new value.

3. **GetValue:**
   - We directly access and return the value at the specified (row, col) index in the rectangle.

This strategy ensures that the code is straightforward and easy to understand, while also being efficient enough for typical constraints expected in interview problems.
