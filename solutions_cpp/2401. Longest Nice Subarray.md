[Leetcode 2401. Longest Nice Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2401)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. You need to find the length of the longest subarray where the bitwise AND of every pair of elements is zero.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 3, 8, 48, 10]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subarray with bitwise AND equal to 0 is [3, 8, 48]. Each bitwise AND of the pair is zero.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 1, 5, 11, 13]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest subarray is any single element (all elements have a non-zero bitwise AND with any other element).
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?** 
   - The array will typically have a constraint range as per LeetCode problems (e.g., 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5).
  
2. **What is the range of individual elements within the `nums` array?**
   - Each integer will typically be within a certain range, often 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9.
  
3. **Is the required subarray always guaranteed to exist?**
   - Since every array has at least a subarray of length 1 consisting of the element itself, the result is always defined.

## Strategy
The main strategy for this problem involves using a sliding window (two-pointer) technique to find the longest subarray. Specifically, we will:
1. Maintain a window with two pointers `left` and `right` that define the subarray.
2. Keep a variable `current_and` to hold the cumulative bitwise AND of all elements within the window.
3. Expand the window by moving `right` and updating `current_and`.
4. If at any point `current_and` becomes non-zero (i.e., the subarray is invalid), shrink the window from the left until `current_and` becomes zero again.
5. Track the maximum length of valid subarrays during this process.

## Code
Here's how we can implement the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestNiceSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;
        int current_and = 0;
        
        while (right < nums.size()) {
            // Expand the window from the right
            current_and |= nums[right];
            
            // When the window becomes invalid (non-zero AND)
            while (current_and & (current_and - 1)) {
                current_and &= ~nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            // Calculate the length of the valid subarray
            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 3, 8, 48, 10};
    cout << "Example 1: " << sol.longestNiceSubarray(nums1) << endl; // Output: 3
    
    vector<int> nums2 = {3, 1, 5, 11, 13};
    cout << "Example 2: " << sol.longestNiceSubarray(nums2) << endl; // Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and at most once by the left pointer).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we use a constant amount of extra space.

This efficiently solves the problem while ensuring the constraints are met.
