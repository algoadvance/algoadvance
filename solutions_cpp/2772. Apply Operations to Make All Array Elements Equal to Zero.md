[Leetcode 2772. Apply Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2772)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers. You need to apply operations to make all elements equal to zero. In each operation, you can do the following:
1. Select any `i` where `1 <= i < n` and `nums[i]` is non-zero.
2. Apply the operation `nums[i] -= nums[i-1]` if `nums[i-1]` is non-zero, or `nums[i] -= nums[i+1]` if `nums[i-1]` is zero.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the `nums` array equal to zero.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can elements be negative?** 
   - No, as the problem specifies non-negative integers.
2. **Is modifying `nums[i]` allowed during processing?**
   - The problem doesn't restrict us from modifying `nums[i]`.
3. **Can we assume array will always have more than one element?**
   - Let's assume yes, as the problem mentions `1 <= i < n`.

### Strategy:
1. Traverse the array from the end to the start.
2. For each element `nums[i]` from the second last element to the first:
    - If `nums[i]` is non-zero, subtract `nums[i-1]` from it.
    - This can be visualized as "pushing" the problem towards the start of the array.
3. After this process, `nums[0]` will have collected all the necessary operations, and this will determine the total number of operations needed.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int operations = 0;

        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                operations += nums[i];
                nums[i-1] = std::max(0, nums[i-1] - nums[i]);
                nums[i] = 0;
            }
        }
        // Handle the first element separately
        operations += nums[0];

        return operations;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {3, 2, 0, 4};
    std::cout << "Operations needed: " << solution.minOperations(nums1) << std::endl; // Output should be 7
    
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {2, 2};
    std::cout << "Operations needed: " << solution.minOperations(nums2) << std::endl; // Output should be 2
    
    std::vector<int> nums3 = {0, 2, 3, 1};
    std::cout << "Operations needed: " << solution.minOperations(nums3) << std::endl; // Output should be 6

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We only perform a single pass through the array. The actual operations inside the loop (condition checks and assignments) cost constant time. This makes the overall time complexity linear with respect to the size of the input array `nums`.

### Explanation:
This solution ensures that you handle the problem in a reverse manner, gathering all needed operations towards the start of the array, ensuring that each array position is processed only once, leading to an efficient and clear solution.
