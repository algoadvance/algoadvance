[Leetcode 3040. Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3040)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of `n` elements. Your task is to perform operations on these elements to maximize the score. In each operation, you can pick any two elements (`a` and `b`) such that `a <= b`, remove both from the list, and add the value `a + b`. The score of each operation is `a * b` and you need to maximize the number of operations with the maximum score.

Implement a function:
```cpp
int maxOperationsWithMaxScore(vector<int>& nums);
```

### Inputs
- `nums`: A list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 10^5` and each integer `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

### Output
- Returns an integer representing the maximum numbers of operations with the maximum score possible.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed to have an even number of elements?** 
   - No, but if there's an odd number of elements, one will remain unpaired.
   
2. **Can elements be reused after an operation?**
   - No, elements are removed from the list after each operation.

3. **Should we consider the largest possible score or maximum number of operations with any maximum score?**
   - We aim to maximize the number of operations with the maximum score, prioritizing operations producing the largest possible scores.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the List:** Sort the list of numbers to facilitate picking the largest pairs.
2. **Use Maximum Pairing:** Always pick the largest possible pair from sorted list to get maximum scores.
3. **Priority Queue (Heap):** Use a max-heap to always access the largest numbers easily.

By focusing on always combining the largest numbers, we guarantee the highest possible scores for each operation. The use of a max-heap ensures we can efficiently get the largest elements.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int maxOperationsWithMaxScore(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() < 2) return 0;  // No operation possible with less than 2 elements

    // Max-heap to get the largest elements efficiently
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int maxScore = 0;
    int operationCount = 0;

    while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
        int a = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        int b = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        
        // Calculate the score of this operation
        int score = a * b;
        
        // Update max score if necessary
        if (score > maxScore) {
            maxScore = score;      // Found a new max score
            operationCount = 1;    // Reset operation count for this new max score
        } else if (score == maxScore) {
            operationCount++;      // Increment the count for the existing max score
        }
        
        // Add the sum of these two back into the heap if we can still perform more operations
        if (maxHeap.size() > 0) {
            maxHeap.push(a + b);
        }
    }

    return operationCount;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    cout << maxOperationsWithMaxScore(nums) << endl;  // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** O(n log n) for initial sorting of the list.
- **Heap Operations:** O(n log n) where in worst case, each operation involves heap insertion and extraction.
- **Total:** O(n log n)

This complexity ensures that the solution can handle the upper constraint efficiently.
