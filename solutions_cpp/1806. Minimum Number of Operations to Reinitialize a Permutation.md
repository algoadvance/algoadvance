[Leetcode 1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1806)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, there is a permutation `perm` of `n` integers (0-indexed). The permutation starts as an array where `perm[i] = i` (i.e., `perm` = `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`).

You will perform the following operations on `perm`:
- Let `arr` be a new array where `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]` if `i` is even.
- `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]` if `i` is odd.
- Assign `arr` to `perm`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to reinitialize the permutation `perm`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always a power of 2?**
   - Yes, per the problem constraints, `n` will be a power of 2.

2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem constraints suggest typical competitive programming limits, possibly up to `10^4`.

3. **Are there any edge cases (e.g., n=2)?**
   - Yes, we should handle edge cases where `n` is the smallest power of 2, which is 2.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the initial permutation `perm` where `perm[i] = i`.

2. **Array Transformation**:
   - Use the given rules to transform `perm` into `arr`.

3. **Count Operations**:
   - Apply the transformation repeatedly and check if the `perm` array is reinitialized to the initial state `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - Keep a count of the number of operations performed.

4. **Termination**:
   - Stop and return the count once `perm` is reinitialized to the initial state.

### Solution Code in C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        // Initialize the perm array
        vector<int> perm(n), original(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            perm[i] = i;
            original[i] = i;
        }

        int operations = 0;
        while (true) {
            vector<int> arr(n);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (i % 2 == 0) {
                    arr[i] = perm[i / 2];
                } else {
                    arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2];
                }
            }
            perm = arr;
            ++operations;

            // Check if perm is reinitialized to the original state
            if (perm == original) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n) for setting up the initial `perm` array.
- **Transformation**: Each transformation and comparison is O(n).
- **Iteration**: The worst-case scenario might involve iterating a logarithmic number of times relative to `n`.

Given the constraints, the time complexity should be manageable for typical limits up to `n=10^4`.

The total complexity can be approximated as `O(k * n)`, where `k` is the number of iterations (operations) needed to reset the permutation.
