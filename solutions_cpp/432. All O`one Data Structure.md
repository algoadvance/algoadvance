[Leetcode 432. All O`one Data Structure](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l432)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode problem 432 involves implementing a data structure called `AllOne` that supports the following operations:

1. `inc(String key)`: Inserts a new key with value 1. Or increments the existing value by 1.
2. `dec(String key)`: Decrements an existing key by 1. If the value of the key is 1, remove it. If the key doesn't exist, this operation should be ignored.
3. `getMaxKey()`: Returns one of the keys with the maximal value. If no keys exist, return an empty string "".
4. `getMinKey()`: Returns one of the keys with the minimal value. If no keys exist, return an empty string "".

You need to implement the `AllOne` data structure to perform all these operations in `O(1)` time complexity.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the keys are always strings and the values are always integers? 
   - Assuming yes.
   
2. Should we handle large numbers of operations, and should our solution be optimized for both time and space?
   - Yes, optimizations are needed for both as we need `O(1)` time complexity for all operations.

3. In case of multiple keys having the same maximal or minimal value, do we return any one of them?
   - Yes, any one key with the maximal or minimal value can be returned.

## Strategy

To achieve `O(1)` time complexity for all operations, we can make use of the following data structures:

1. **Hashmaps** to store:
    - A map from key to its frequency value.
    - A map from frequency value to a doubly linked list which stores all keys having the same frequency.
    
2. **Doubly Linked List** to store:
    - Keys having the same frequency in the order of their insertion. This helps in getting and updating max/min keys quickly.

### Data Structures

- `unordered_map<string, int> keyCount` to store the frequency of each key.
- `unordered_map<int, list<string>> countKeys` to store keys for each frequency. 
- `unordered_map<string, list<string>::iterator> keyIter` to store the iterator of each key in the `countKeys` list for easy access and removal.
- Variables to store current minimum and maximum frequencies.

## Implementation

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <list>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class AllOne {
private:
    unordered_map<string, int> keyCount;
    unordered_map<int, list<string>> countKeys;
    unordered_map<string, list<string>::iterator> keyIter;
    int minCount;
    int maxCount;

public:
    AllOne() : minCount(INT_MAX), maxCount(0) {}

    void inc(string key) {
        if (keyCount.find(key) != keyCount.end()) {
            int count = keyCount[key];
            keyCount[key]++;
            countKeys[count].erase(keyIter[key]);
            if (countKeys[count].empty()) countKeys.erase(count);
            countKeys[count + 1].push_front(key);
            keyIter[key] = countKeys[count + 1].begin();
            if (minCount == count && countKeys[minCount].empty()) minCount++;
            if (keyCount[key] > maxCount) maxCount = keyCount[key];
        } else {
            keyCount[key] = 1;
            countKeys[1].push_front(key);
            keyIter[key] = countKeys[1].begin();
            minCount = 1;
            if (maxCount < 1) maxCount = 1;
        }
    }

    void dec(string key) {
        if (keyCount.find(key) != keyCount.end()) {
            int count = keyCount[key];
            countKeys[count].erase(keyIter[key]);
            if (countKeys[count].empty()) countKeys.erase(count);
            if (count == minCount && countKeys[minCount].empty()) minCount++;
            if (count == maxCount && countKeys[maxCount].empty()) maxCount--;
            if (count > 1) {
                keyCount[key]--;
                countKeys[count - 1].push_front(key);
                keyIter[key] = countKeys[count - 1].begin();
                if (minCount > count - 1) minCount = count - 1;
            } else {
                keyCount.erase(key);
                keyIter.erase(key);
                if (keyCount.empty()) minCount = INT_MAX;
            }
        }
    }

    string getMaxKey() {
        if (keyCount.empty()) return "";
        return countKeys[maxCount].front();
    }

    string getMinKey() {
        if (keyCount.empty()) return "";
        return countKeys[minCount].front();
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- `inc(key)`: O(1) - Hashmap operations and list insertions/removals are O(1).
- `dec(key)`: O(1) - Similar reasoning as `inc`.
- `getMaxKey()`: O(1) - Direct access to the max count’s list.
- `getMinKey(): O(1) - Direct access to the min count’s list.

Here, the combination of hashmaps and doubly linked lists guarantees we meet the `O(1)` requirement for all operations.
