[Leetcode 3021. Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3021)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a game on a flowerbed. The flowerbed is represented by a string consisting of `'A'`, `'B'`, and dots `'.'` where:
- `'A'` means a flower that Alice likes.
- `'B'` means a flower that Bob likes.
- `'.'` means an empty spot in the flowerbed.

The game rules are:
1. Alice and Bob take turns alternatingly, and Alice starts first.
2. On their turn, if there's an empty spot adjacent to a flower they like, they can place another flower of their liking in that spot.
3. The game ends when there are no more moves left for both players.

The task is to determine the final appearance of the flowerbed after the game ends.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Do Alice and Bob alternate turns indefinitely?** Yes, until there are no valid moves left for either player.
2. **How do we define adjacent spots?** Any spot directly to the left or right of a flower.
3. **Is the final output a transformation of the flowerbed when neither can make a move?** Yes, we should simulate the game until no moves can be made.

## Strategy

1. Use a loop to simulate the game:
   - Track whether a move was made in the current turn.
   - Alice will try to place 'A' adjacent to existing 'A's.
   - Bob will try to place 'B' adjacent to existing 'B's.
2. Continue looping until no moves can be made.
3. Return the final state of the flowerbed.

## Code

Here's how you can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

std::string flowerGame(std::string flowerbed) {
    bool moved;
    int n = flowerbed.size();

    do {
        moved = false;
        std::vector<int> to_be_added; // To track where we will place flowers after each complete pass
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 'A' || flowerbed[i] == 'B') {
                if (flowerbed[i] == 'A') {
                    if (i > 0 && flowerbed[i-1] == '.') {
                        to_be_added.push_back(i - 1);
                        moved = true;
                    }
                    if (i < n - 1 && flowerbed[i+1] == '.') {
                        to_be_added.push_back(i + 1);
                        moved = true;
                    }
                } else if (flowerbed[i] == 'B') {
                    if (i > 0 && flowerbed[i-1] == '.') {
                        to_be_added.push_back(i - 1);
                        moved = true;
                    }
                    if (i < n - 1 && flowerbed[i+1] == '.') {
                        to_be_added.push_back(i + 1);
                        moved = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // Apply changes
        for (int pos : to_be_added) {
            flowerbed[pos] = (flowerbed[pos - 1] == 'A' || (pos + 1 < n && flowerbed[pos + 1] == 'A')) ? 'A' : 'B';
        }
    } while (moved);

    return flowerbed;
}

int main() {
    std::string flowerbed = "A..B...A";
    std::cout << flowerGame(flowerbed) << std::endl;  // Output should be the final state of the flowerbed
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initial Loop**: Each iteration of placing flowers involves scanning the entire flowerbed which takes O(n) time.
2. **Loop until Convergence**: In the worst case, each spot could get filled in separate iterations but since each move progresses the fill, it would be O(n) iterations.

Total time complexity approximates to O(n^2) in the worst case. This approach ensures we correctly simulate alternating moves and mutually exclusive completions of flowerbed spots.
