[Leetcode 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2000)
## Problem Statement
**2000. Reverse Prefix of Word**

Given a 0-indexed string `word` and a character `ch`, reverse the segment of `word` that starts at the start of the string and ends at the first occurrence of `ch` (inclusive). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing.

Return the resulting string.

### Example
1. Input: `word = "abcdefd"`, `ch = 'd'`
   Output: `"dcbaefd"`

2. Input: `word = "xyxzxe"`, `ch = 'z'`
   Output: `"zxyxxe"`

3. Input: `word = "abcd"`, `ch = 'z'`
   Output: `"abcd"`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Is the character comparison case-sensitive?
   - Yes, it is case-sensitive.
   
2. **Length of Input**: Are there any constraints on the length of the `word` string?
   - The length of `word` is in the range `[1, 250]`.

3. **Character Existence**: What should the function return if the character does not exist in the `word`?
   - The function should return the `word` unchanged.

## Strategy
1. **Find the Index**: Locate the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `word`.
2. **Reverse the Prefix**: If the character is found, reverse the substring from the beginning of `word` to the index of `ch`.
3. **Concatenate**: Concatenate the reversed prefix with the remainder of the string and return.

### Steps:
1. Use `find` to locate the index of `ch` in `word`.
2. If `ch` is not found, return `word` as is.
3. If `ch` is found, reverse the substring from the beginning of `word` to the index (inclusive).
4. Concatenate the reversed prefix with the rest of the string and return the result.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // For std::reverse

std::string reversePrefix(std::string word, char ch) {
    // Find the first occurrence of ch
    size_t index = word.find(ch);
    
    // If ch is found, reverse the prefix
    if (index != std::string::npos) {
        // Reverse the substring from the beginning to the index, inclusive
        std::reverse(word.begin(), word.begin() + index + 1);
    }
    
    // Return the modified word (or the original word if ch was not found)
    return word;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string word = "abcdefd";
    char ch = 'd';
    std::cout << reversePrefix(word, ch) << std::endl; // Output: "dcbaefd"

    word = "xyxzxe";
    ch = 'z';
    std::cout << reversePrefix(word, ch) << std::endl; // Output: "zxyxxe"

    word = "abcd";
    ch = 'z';
    std::cout << reversePrefix(word, ch) << std::endl; // Output: "abcd"

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding the Index**: The `find` function runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string `word`.
- **Reversing the Substring**: The `reverse` function also runs in O(k) time, where k is the length of the prefix being reversed. In the worst case, k = n.

Combining both, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) extra space since only a few indexing variables are used, and operations are done in place. The input object `word` is modified and returned, but no additional data structures proportional to the input size are utilized.
