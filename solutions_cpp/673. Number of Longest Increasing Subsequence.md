[Leetcode 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l673)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. Return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

**Example:**

```cpp
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 5, 7] and [1, 3, 4, 7].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input size `n`?**
   - The input size can range from 1 to 2000.

2. **Can the elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - The problem statement does not specify restrictions on `nums` values, so we assume they can be any integers.

3. **What should we return if `nums` is empty?**
   - Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `nums` will not be empty.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**:
   - `length[i]` will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in `nums[i]`.
   - `count[i]` will store the number of longest increasing subsequences that end in `nums[i]`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize both `length` and `count` arrays with 1s, since every element can be a subsequence of length 1 by itself.

3. **Iterate and Update**:
   - Use nested loops to update the `length` and `count` arrays.
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i > j` and `nums[i] > nums[j]`:
     - If `length[j] + 1 > length[i]`, update `length[i]` and set `count[i] = count[j]`.
     - If `length[j] + 1 == length[i]`, increment `count[i]` by `count[j]`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The maximum value in `length` array indicates the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
   - Sum up the values in the `count` array for indices where the `length` matches the maximum length.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of `nums`, due to the nested loops iterating over each pair `(i, j)`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findNumberOfLIS(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    
    std::vector<int> length(n, 1); // length[i] -> length of LIS ending at index i
    std::vector<int> count(n, 1); // count[i] -> number of LIS ending at index i
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                if (length[j] + 1 > length[i]) {
                    length[i] = length[j] + 1;
                    count[i] = count[j];
                } else if (length[j] + 1 == length[i]) {
                    count[i] += count[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    int longest = *std::max_element(length.begin(), length.end());
    int result = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (length[i] == longest) {
            result += count[i];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This code correctly finds the number of longest increasing subsequences in a given array `nums` using a dynamic programming approach. Make sure to test it with various edge cases to ensure its correctness and efficiency.
