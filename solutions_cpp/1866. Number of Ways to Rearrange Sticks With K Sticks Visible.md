[Leetcode 1866. Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1866)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` sticks of distinct lengths, where `n` >= 1. The sticks are arranged in a line from left to right. Each stick has a certain height, and you can see a stick if and only if all of the previous sticks (to the left) are shorter than it. 

You need to rearrange the sticks such that exactly `k` sticks are visible. Given `n` and `k`, return the number of such possible arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any limit on `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, constraints might be mentioned, e.g., 1 <= k <= n <= 1000.

2. **Is there a specific range for the heights of the sticks?**
   - The sticks have distinct heights, so their distinctiveness ensures we don't deal with duplicate heights.

3. **Should the result be returned modulo 10^9 + 7?**
   - Yes, use modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Let's define `dp[n][k]` as the number of ways to arrange `n` sticks such that exactly `k` sticks are visible.

#### Base Cases
1. `dp[0][0] = 1`: No sticks and no visible sticks; there's exactly one way (`the empty arrangement`).
2. `dp[n][0] = 0` for `n > 0`: It's impossible to see zero sticks if we have at least one stick.
3. `dp[0][k] = 0` for `k > 0`: It's impossible to see any sticks if we have none.

#### Recurrence Relation
Consider the placement of the largest stick (the stick of height `n`). There are two cases:
1. If the stick is visible, it will be placed as the last stick, increasing the visible count by 1.
2. If the stick is not visible, it can be placed in any of the `n-1` positions among the first `n-1` sticks without affecting the count of visible sticks.

So, the recurrence relation will be:
\[ dp[n][k] = dp[n-1][k-1] + (n-1) * dp[n-1][k] \]

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k) {
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(n + 1, vector<long long>(k + 1, 0));
    
    dp[0][0] = 1; // Base Case

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-1][j] % MOD) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k];
}

int main() {
    int n = 5, k = 3; // Example input
    cout << rearrangeSticks(n, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times k)\). We iterate through the range 1 to `n` and 1 to `k` filling up the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times k)\). We use a 2D vector of size `n+1` by `k+1`.

This solution efficiently computes the number of ways to rearrange the sticks with exactly `k` visible sticks using dynamic programming.
