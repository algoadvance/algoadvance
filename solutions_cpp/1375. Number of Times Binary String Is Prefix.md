[Leetcode 1375. Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1375)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. The string is **prefix-aligned** if every `1` in the string is at an index `i` such that all the characters before index `i` are also `1`.

A prefix-aligned string doesn't have to be all `1`s; it just should not contain `0` after a `1`.

Return the number of times the string `s` is prefix-aligned from `1` through `n`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraint do the indices follow in this problem?**
   - Indices are 1-based in terms of the alignment check (i.e., from index 1 to index n).

2. **Should we consider the string `s` immutable?**
   - Yes, we analyze it as an immutable string from left to right.

3. **Is there any specific character length `n` boundary defined?**
   - Usually, constraints can be assumed to follow a standard limit, e.g., \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

4. **Are there any assumptions or edge cases like all `0`s or all `1`s?**
   - Yes, we must handle all typical cases, including strings that are entirely '0's or entirely '1's.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an integer counter to keep track of the maximum index encountered of `1` and a prefix-aligned counter to count the number of times the string was prefix-aligned.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Traverse the string from the start to the end.
   - For each character in string `s[i]`:
     - If it's `1`, update the maximum index.
     - If the maximum index thus far is equal to the current index, increment the prefix-aligned counter.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, return the prefix-aligned counter as the result.

By following this strategy, we achieve an O(n) time complexity, only making a single pass through the string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int numTimesPrefixAligned(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int maxIndex = 0; // Maximum index of '1' seen so far
    int prefixAlignedCount = 0; // Counter for prefix-aligned instances

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '1') {
            maxIndex = max(maxIndex, i + 1); // Update the max index (1-based)
        }
        
        if (maxIndex == i + 1) {
            prefixAlignedCount++;
        }
    }

    return prefixAlignedCount;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. A single traversal through the string ensures linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we're using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
