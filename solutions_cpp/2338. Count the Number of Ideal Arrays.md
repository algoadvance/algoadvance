[Leetcode 2338. Count the Number of Ideal Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2338)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `maxValue`, you need to find the number of ideal arrays of length `n` where every element is between `1` and `maxValue` (inclusive) and every pair of adjacent elements has at most a difference of `1`.

Return the number of such ideal arrays. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Ideal Array Definition:** Can the elements in the array only differ by 1 or can they be the same?
   - *Answer:* Every pair of adjacent elements can either be the same or differ by at most 1.
   
2. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the values of `n` and `maxValue`?
   - *Answer:* Typical constraint ranges in competitive programming. Assume moderate to high values, e.g., `1 <= n <= 10^4` and `1 <= maxValue <= 10^4`.

3. **Array Values:** Must the array start and end with a specific value, or is any value between 1 and `maxValue` allowed?
   - *Answer:* Any value between 1 and `maxValue` is allowed for any position in the array.

## Strategy

1. **DP Array Definition:** 
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of ideal arrays of length `i` that end with the value `j`.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - For length `1`, `dp[1][j] = 1` for all `1 <= j <= maxValue` because each value can be a single-element ideal array.

3. **Transition:**
   - For each length from `2` to `n`, and each potential end value `j`, consider the possible previous values:
     - If previous value was `j-1`, `j`, or `j+1`.

   - Therefore,
     \[
     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j+1]
     \]

4. **Out of Bounds Handling:**
   - Ensure that when addressing `dp[i-1][j-1]` or `dp[i-1][j+1]`, the indices are valid.

5. **Result Computation:**
   - The final result is the sum of `dp[n][j]` for all `1 <= j <= maxValue`.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure results are manageable.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

int idealArrays(int n, int maxValue) {
    // Initialize DP table
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(maxValue + 1, 0));
    
    // Base case
    for (int j = 1; j <= maxValue; ++j) {
        dp[1][j] = 1;
    }
    
    // Fill DP table
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= maxValue; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
            if (j > 1) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD;
            }
            if (j < maxValue) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j+1]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Sum up the result
    int result = 0;
    for (int j = 1; j <= maxValue; ++j) {
        result = (result + dp[n][j]) % MOD;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n, maxValue;
    cin >> n >> maxValue;
    cout << idealArrays(n, maxValue) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \times \text{maxValue})\) because we have two nested loops:
1. One loop runs from `1` to `n` (for lengths).
2. Another loop runs from `1` to `maxValue` (for values of the array elements).

This complexity should be manageable within typical constraint ranges provided earlier.
