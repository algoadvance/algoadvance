[Leetcode 1923. Longest Common Subpath](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1923)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` representing the number of cities in a country, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given `m` integer arrays, `paths`, where `paths[i]` is an integer array representing the path taken by the `i-th` person in the form of a list of cities.

A subpath is a contiguous subsequence of a path.

* Example: If the path is `1, 2, 3`, then `1, 2` and `2, 3` are subpaths.
  
Return the length of the longest common subpath that is present in each individual's path.

Here's the function signature:
```cpp
int longestCommonSubpath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& paths);
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum number of paths (`m`)?
    - What is the maximum length of any individual path?
    - Can cities be revisited in a single path?

2. **Output Constraints**:
    - Is the function guaranteed to always find a subpath (including possibly no common subpath)?

3. **Path Characteristics**:
    - Can paths contain duplicate city numbers?

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubpath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
        int left = 0, right = INT_MAX; 
        for (const auto& path : paths) {
            right = min(right, (int)path.size());
        }
        
        auto check = [&](int length) -> bool {
            unordered_set<string> commonSet;
            bool isFirst = true;
            
            for (const auto& path : paths) {
                unordered_set<string> currentSet;
                
                if (length > path.size()) return false;
                
                string hash = "";
                for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
                    hash += to_string(path[i]) + ",";
                }
                currentSet.insert(hash);
                
                int base = path.size();
                int exponent = length - 1;
                
                for (int i = length; i < path.size(); ++i) {
                    hash.erase(0, to_string(path[i - length]).size() + 1);
                    hash += to_string(path[i]) + ",";
                    currentSet.insert(hash);
                }
                
                if (isFirst) {
                    commonSet = move(currentSet);
                    isFirst = false;
                } else {
                    unordered_set<string> intersection;
                    for (const auto& h : currentSet) {
                        if (commonSet.count(h)) {
                            intersection.insert(h);
                        }
                    }
                    commonSet = move(intersection);
                }
                
                if (commonSet.empty()) return false;
            }
            return !commonSet.empty();
        };
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left + 1) / 2;
            if (check(mid)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Binary Search on Subpath Length**:
    - Binary search on the possible length of the longest subpath. The maximum possible length of the common subpath is restricted by the smallest path length since a subpath can't be longer than the shortest path in the paths vector.

2. **Rolling Hash Technique for Efficient Subpath Checking**:
    - Use rolling hash to compare subpaths efficiently. This reduces the complexity of checking if different subpaths are the same.

3. **Set Intersection for Common Subpaths**:
    - At each stage of the binary search, validate using sets to ensure a subpath of the current length exists in all paths by checking intersections of potential candidate sets.

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: `O(log(min_path_length))`
- **Hashing and Checking Each Path**: For each binary search step:
    - Generate subpaths of length `k` in each path: O(`m * p`), where `m` is the number of paths and `p` is the average length of each path.
    - Compare using sets: O(`m * k`)
    
    Overall, time complexity is approximately `O(m * p * log(min_path_length))` where `p` is the average path length.

This approach balances searching for subpaths efficiently with binary search and ensuring accuracy using rolling hash and set operations.
