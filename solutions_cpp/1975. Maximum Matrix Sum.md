[Leetcode 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1975)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` matrix `matrix` consisting of non-negative integers. You can choose any cell in the matrix and decrease it by any non-negative integer (possibly zero). You need to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Return the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Do we have to reduce any value by a certain amount to maximize the sum?**
   - No, you can choose not to reduce any values if it would maximize the sum better.

2. **Are the elements of the matrix guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, the problem states that the matrix consists of non-negative integers.

3. **What should be the dimensions of the matrix?**
   - The matrix is an `n x n` matrix, where `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Is there any constraint on `n`?**
   - Usually, such Leetcode problems have constraints, but let's assume `n` is reasonably small due to typical constraint ranges (e.g., `1 <= n <= 100`).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxMatrixSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        long long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                sum += matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    cout << "Maximum Matrix Sum: " << sol.maxMatrixSum(matrix) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

Given that all values in the matrix are non-negative, the sum of the matrix is simply the sum of all its elements. There's no need to decrease any values as reducing any non-negative integer would only lower the sum.

1. **Iterate through each element** of the matrix.
2. **Sum all elements** to get the maximum possible sum of the matrix.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) - where \(n\) is the dimension of the matrix. This is because we need to traverse all \(n \times n\) elements in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) - we are only using a few extra variables and not any additional data structures that scale with input size.

This simple approach ensures that we optimally compute the sum for the given constraints.
