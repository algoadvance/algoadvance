[Leetcode 962. Maximum Width Ramp](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l962)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums`, a ramp is a tuple `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. The width of a ramp is defined as `j - i`. Find the maximum width of a ramp in `nums`. If no ramp exists, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the elements in `nums`?**
   - `nums` can have values that fit within normal integer ranges.
   
2. **What is the length range of `nums`?**
   - `nums` can have lengths from 1 to 5 * 10^4.
   
3. **Can `nums` contain negative elements?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative as well as non-negative integers.

4. **Is the input always valid?**
   - Yes, assume that the input array `nums` is always valid although it might be empty.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxWidthRamp(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        stack<int> st;
        
        // Build a decreasing stack of indices
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (st.empty() || nums[st.top()] >= nums[i]) {
                st.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        int maxWidth = 0;
        
        // Traverse the array from the end and try to maximize ramp width
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
            while (!st.empty() && nums[st.top()] <= nums[j]) {
                maxWidth = max(maxWidth, j - st.top());
                st.pop();
            }
        }
        
        return maxWidth;
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Decreasing Stack**: Start by building a stack of indices such that the values at those indices form a decreasing sequence when traversing from left to right. This helps in identifying potential `i` values for which `nums[i] <= nums[j]` for some `j > i`.

2. **Traverse from the End**: Once the stack is built, traverse the array from the end to find `j` such that `nums[st.top()] <= nums[j]`. Every time a valid `j` is found, calculate the width `j - st.top()`, and keep track of the maximum width.

3. **Pop Stack Elements**: Whenever a valid `j` is found, pop from the stack to potentially increase the width with subsequent elements.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because each element is processed at most twice â€“ once for the initial stack creation and once during the traversal from the end.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case due to the stack usage.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum width ramp in linear time while maintaining clarity and simplicity in the logic.
