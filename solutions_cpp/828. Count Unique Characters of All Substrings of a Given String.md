[Leetcode 828. Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l828)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, we need to calculate the sum of the counts of unique characters of all the substrings of `s`. In other words, for each substring of `s`, we need to count how many characters are unique (appear exactly once in the substring) and then sum these counts across all substrings.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected range of input size?**
    - Typically, the input size can vary, but it's practical to assume it could go up to 10^5.
    
2. **How should the result be returned?**
    - The result should be returned as an integer.

3. **Are there any constraints on the character set of the string?**
    - The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, brute force methods that consider all substrings are impractical due to the potentially large input size, which would lead to a time complexity of O(n^2). 

Instead, we will use an optimized approach based on the index of each character and how its contribution to the unique character count changes as we extend substrings.

### Optimized Approach
1. Define `lastPos[c]` as the last position of character `c`.
2. Define `contribution[c]` as the contributions of character `c` in substrings where it is unique up to the current index `i`.
3. Traverse the string and update contributions based on previous and current positions of the characters.

### Steps
- For each character `c` at position `i`:
  - Update the count of substrings where `c` is unique by considering its last contribution.
  - Update the last position for character `c`.

### Example
For a given string `s = "ABC"`, the substrings are: "A", "B", "C", "AB", "BC", "ABC". Calculate the unique characters for each:
- "A": 1
- "B": 1
- "C": 1
- "AB": 2
- "BC": 2
- "ABC": 3
Total: 10

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int uniqueLetterString(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> lastPos(26, -1);
        vector<int> prevPos(26, -1);
        vector<int> contribution(26, 0);
        
        int result = 0, curr = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int index = s[i] - 'A';
            
            // Update contribution of current character
            curr -= contribution[index];
            contribution[index] = (i - lastPos[index]) - (lastPos[index] - prevPos[index]);
            curr += contribution[index];
            
            // Update result
            result += curr;
            
            // Update positions
            prevPos[index] = lastPos[index];
            lastPos[index] = i;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. The string is traversed once, and updates to arrays require constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space, since the size of the arrays is constant (26 for all lowercase English letters).

This approach ensures efficiency even for large strings and avoids the pitfalls of brute-force methods by leveraging the positions and contributions of characters directly.
