[Leetcode 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2483)
### Problem Statement

You are given the daily log of a shop's customer visits in the form of a string `customers` where:
- The shop is open from time `0` to `customers.length`.
- Each character of the string `customers` is either 'Y' (a customer visited) or 'N' (no customer visited).

A penalty is incurred for each hour the shop is open where:
- If the shop is open and there's no customer (`N`), you incur a penalty of 1.
- If the shop is closed and there's a customer (`Y`), you incur a penalty of 1.

Your task is to find the earliest hour where the penalty is minimized. The shop can potentially close at any hour from `0` to `customers.length` inclusive.

Return the hour that minimizes the penalty.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Palindrome Perspective:** Should we consider penalties for both when the shop is open and closed separately?
   - Yes. The penalty applies differently for open ('N') and closed ('Y') times.
   
2. **Character Constraints:** Is the input guaranteed to only contain 'Y' and 'N'?
   - Yes, the input string consists only of 'Y' and 'N' characters.

3. **Output:** Are there multiple solutions allowed?
   - Return the earliest hour with minimal penalty.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Calculate the total number of customers `Y` and non-customers `N` in the entire duration.
   
2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - Traverse the string `customers` from hour 0 to the end.
   - Maintain two prefixes: count of 'Y's seen (`prefixY`) and 'N's seen (`prefixN`).
   - Calculate penalties for closing at each hour:
     - Penalty for current hour closing as number of remaining 'Y' + number of 'N' seen so far.
   - Track the minimum penalty and the corresponding hour.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
    int n = customers.size();
    int totalY = 0, totalN = 0;
    
    // Count total number of 'Y' and 'N' in the entire string
    for (char c : customers) {
        if (c == 'Y') totalY++;
        else totalN++;
    }
    
    int prefixY = 0, prefixN = 0;
    int minPenalty = INT_MAX;
    int bestHour = 0;
    
    // Traverse each hour to calculate the potential penalty
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        int penalty;
        if (i < n && customers[i] == 'Y') prefixY++;
        if (i < n && customers[i] == 'N') prefixN++;
        
        penalty = (prefixN) + (totalY - prefixY);
        
        if (penalty < minPenalty) {
            minPenalty = penalty;
            bestHour = i;
        }
    }
    
    return bestHour;
}

int main() {
    string customers = "YYNY";
    int result = bestClosingTime(customers);
    cout << "Best closing hour: " << result << endl; // Expected: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Counts:** Calculate the total number of 'Y' (customers) and 'N' (no customers).
2. **Prefix Counts:** Use prefix sums for 'Y' and 'N' to dynamically calculate penalties as the string is traversed.
3. **Penalty Calculation:** For each closing hour, use the formula `(prefixN) + (totalY - prefixY)` to compute the penalty.
4. **Tracking Minimum:** Track the minimum penalty and corresponding hour to determine the optimal closing time.

### Time Complexity

The solution involves a single traversal of the input string to compute total counts and another for calculating the penalty dynamically. Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `customers` string. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as only a fixed amount of extra space is needed.
