[Leetcode 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l34)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value. If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array always sorted?**
   - Yes, the array is always sorted in non-decreasing order.
  
2. **What should be returned if the target is not found?**
   - Return `[-1, -1]`
  
3. **Can we assume the array will contain only integers?**
   - Yes.

4. **What are the constraints on the input size?**
   - The array can have a size from 0 to 100,000, and the integers can be from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

With these clarifications, we can move to our strategy.

## Strategy
We can use binary search to find the positions efficiently:
1. **Finding the first occurrence:** 
   Use binary search to find the leftmost index of the target.
   
2. **Finding the last occurrence:**
   Use binary search to find the rightmost index of the target.

- **First Occurrence**: Modify the binary search to continue searching towards the left half even if `target` is found.
- **Last Occurrence**: Modify binary search to continue searching towards the right half even if `target` is found.

Using binary search will help us achieve this in `O(log n)` time complexity for both operations.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> searchRange(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int> result(2, -1);
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        // Find the first occurrence
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] >= target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        // Check if the target is found
        if (left < nums.size() && nums[left] == target) {
            result[0] = left;
        }
        
        left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1; // reset for finding last occurrence
        
        // Find the last occurrence
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        // Check if the target is found
        if (right >= 0 && nums[right] == target) {
            result[1] = right;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example Usage
int main() {
    Solution solver;
    vector<int> nums = {5,7,7,8,8,10};
    int target = 8;
    vector<int> result = solver.searchRange(nums, target);
    cout << "[" << result[0] << ", " << result[1] << "]" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The solution involves performing a binary search twice:
- **Finding the first occurrence**: `O(log n)`
- **Finding the last occurrence**: `O(log n)`

Since each binary search is logarithmic with respect to the size of the array `n`, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`. This ensures an efficient search even for the largest possible input sizes.
