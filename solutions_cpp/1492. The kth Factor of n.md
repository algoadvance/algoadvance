[Leetcode 1492. The kth Factor of n](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1492)
## Problem Statement
Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, return the `kth` factor of `n`. If there are fewer than `k` factors, return `-1`.

A factor of an integer `n` is defined as an integer `i` where `1 <= i <= n` and `n % i == 0`.

### Examples:
- Example 1:
  - `Input`: n = 12, k = 3
  - `Output`: 3
  - `Explanation`: The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. The 3rd factor is 3.

- Example 2:
  - `Input`: n = 7, k = 2
  - `Output`: 7
  - `Explanation`: The factors of 7 are 1, 7. The 2nd factor is 7.

- Example 3:
  - `Input`: n = 4, k = 4
  - `Output`: -1
  - `Explanation`: The factors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. There is no 4th factor.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input**: What are the typical ranges for `n` and `k`?
   - Usually, to clarify understanding and edge cases.
2. **Output**: Should the function return the `kth` factor directly or print it somewhere?
   - Function return is typically preferred.
3. **Negative and Zero Values for k**: Is it always guaranteed that both `n` and `k` are positive integers (`n, k >= 1`)?
   - This ensures there is no need to handle unexpected inputs such as `n <= 0` or `k <= 0`.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Factors**: Loop through numbers from 1 to `n`, identifying all factors of `n`.
2. **Count Factors**: Maintain a count of factors as they are identified.
3. **kth Factor**: If we find the `kth` factor within the loop, return it. Otherwise, return `-1` if fewer than `k` factors are found.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a counter for factors.
2. Loop from 1 to `n` and check each number if it is a factor of `n`.
3. Increment the counter for each factor found.
4. When the counter matches `k`, return the current factor.
5. If the loop completes without finding `k` factors, return `-1`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                --k;
                if (k == 0) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};

// Test cases
int main() {
    Solution sol;

    cout << "Test Case 1: " << sol.kthFactor(12, 3) << endl; // Expected output: 3
    cout << "Test Case 2: " << sol.kthFactor(7, 2) << endl; // Expected output: 7
    cout << "Test Case 3: " << sol.kthFactor(4, 4) << endl; // Expected output: -1

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the input number. This is because in the worst case, we may need to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` to count the factors.

- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently solves the problem within reasonable constraints for typical inputs on coding platforms like LeetCode.
