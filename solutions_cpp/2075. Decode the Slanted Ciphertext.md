[Leetcode 2075. Decode the Slanted Ciphertext](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2075)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a string `ciphertext` encoded using a slanted transposition cipher. The string was initially written by filling a 2D array with characters from left to right and then top to bottom, but slanted diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. Given the number of rows `rows`, decode the `ciphertext` back to its original form by reading diagonally top-left to bottom-right and concatenating the characters.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are the characters in the `ciphertext` only lowercase letters?
2. Do we have constraints on the sizes of rows or the length of the `ciphertext`?
3. Should we consider any whitespace or special characters in the `ciphertext`?

Assuming general case:
- `ciphertext` contains lowercase letters only.
- `rows` and `ciphertext` length are within reasonable limits.

### Strategy:

1. **Determine Columns:** Calculate the number of columns in the original grid by `columns = ceil(len(ciphertext) / rows)`.
2. **Initialize the 2D Array:** Create a 2D array and fill it with characters from the `ciphertext` sequentially in a row-wise manner.
3. **Read Diagonally:** Collect characters by reading diagonally from the top-left to bottom-right.
4. **Concatenate and Return:** Combine the diagonal characters in the correct order to form the decoded string.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

std::string decodeCiphertext(const std::string& ciphertext, int rows) {
    if (rows == 0 || ciphertext.empty()) return "";

    // Calculate columns using ceiling division
    int len = ciphertext.size();
    int cols = (len + rows - 1) / rows;

    // Fill the 2D array
    std::vector<std::vector<char>> grid(rows, std::vector<char>(cols, ' '));
    int k = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < rows && k < len; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols && k < len; ++j) {
            grid[i][j] = ciphertext[k++];
        }
    }

    // Read diagonally
    std::string result;
    for (int start_col = 0; start_col < cols; ++start_col) {
        int i = 0, j = start_col;
        while (i < rows && j < cols) {
            result += grid[i][j];
            ++i;
            ++j;
        }
    }

    // Trim trailing spaces from the result
    while (!result.empty() && result.back() == ' ') {
        result.pop_back();
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string ciphertext = "ch   ie   pr";
    int rows = 3;
    std::string decoded = decodeCiphertext(ciphertext, rows);
    std::cout << "Decoded text: \"" << decoded << "\"" << std::endl; 
    // Output should be "cipher"
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Filling the grid: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `ciphertext`.
- Reading diagonally: \(O(n)\) in worst-case scenario since each diagonal read covers all characters.
  
Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\). This ensures that the solution is efficient and scales linearly with the size of the input.

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the temporary use of the 2D grid to store characters, which is appropriate for this approach.
