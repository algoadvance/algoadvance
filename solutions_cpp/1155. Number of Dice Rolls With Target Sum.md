[Leetcode 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1155)
## Problem Statement

You have `d` dice, and each die has `f` faces numbered from `1` to `f`.

Given three integers `d`, `f`, and `target`, return the number of possible ways (out of \( f^d \) total ways) to roll the dice so the sum of the face-up numbers equals `target`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces. There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: You throw two dice each with 6 faces. There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: You throw two dice each with 5 faces. There is only one way to get a sum of 10.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: d = 1, f = 2, target = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: You throw one die with 2 faces. There is no way to get a sum of 3.
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: d = 30, f = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: You throw 30 dice each with 30 faces. There are 222616187 ways to get a sum of 500.
```

## Strategy

This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming. We'll use a DP table to keep track of the number of ways to achieve each possible sum with a given number of dice.

The state `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of ways to have a sum `j` using `i` dice.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is the number of ways to get sum `j` with `i` dice.
2. **Base Case**:
    - `dp[0][0] = 1` â€” There's one way to get a sum of 0 with 0 dice.
3. **DP Transition**:
    - For each dice count `i`, from 1 to `d`:
      - For each possible sum `j`, from 1 to `target`:
        - Calculate `dp[i][j]` as the sum of `dp[i-1][j-k]` for `k` ranging from 1 to `f`, as long as `k <= j`.
4. **Result**: The value `dp[d][target]` will be our answer.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(d * target * f)`, and space complexity is `O(d * target)`.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int numRollsToTarget(int d, int f, int target) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        // Initialize a 2D dp array with (d+1) x (target+1) size
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(d + 1, std::vector<int>(target + 1, 0));
        
        // Base case: One way to get sum 0 with 0 dice
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= d; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= target; ++j) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= f; ++k) {
                    if (j >= k) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-k]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[d][target];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::cout << sol.numRollsToTarget(1, 6, 3) << std::endl;  // Example 1
    std::cout << sol.numRollsToTarget(2, 6, 7) << std::endl;  // Example 2
    std::cout << sol.numRollsToTarget(2, 5, 10) << std::endl; // Example 3
    std::cout << sol.numRollsToTarget(1, 2, 3) << std::endl;  // Example 4
    std::cout << sol.numRollsToTarget(30, 30, 500) << std::endl; // Example 5
    return 0;
}
```

The provided code defines a solution to the problem using the dynamic programming approach discussed. The inner loop ensures that the sum of the ways is calculated efficiently while taking care of the constraints through modular arithmetic.
