[Leetcode 41. First Missing Positive](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l41)
## Problem Statement
Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

### Example:
- Input: nums = [1,2,0]
  Output: 3
- Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
  Output: 2
- Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
  Output: 1

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates.
2. **Can the array contain negative numbers and zero?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers and zero.
3. **What is the size range of the input array `nums`?**
   - There are no constraints explicitly provided, but it's generally assumed to be within typical memory limits for a coding interview problem, so around `10^5` elements.
4. **What are the bounds for the numbers in the array?**
   - There is no explicit bound, but you can assume typical integer limits like `-2^31` to `2^31-1`.

## Strategy
1. The problem can be solved optimally by rearranging the array values such that we place each value at its "correct" index if possible where the value `i` should be placed at index `i-1`.
2. Then we traverse the array and the first index `i` that does not have the value `i+1` will be our answer.
3. This approach ensures we achieve the constant space requirement and run in linear time.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();

    // Rearrange values to their correct positions
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        while (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]) {
            swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]);
        }
    }

    // Find the first position where the index does not match the value
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] != i + 1) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }

    // If all positions are correct, the next missing positive is n + 1
    return n + 1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 0};
    vector<int> nums2 = {3, 4, -1, 1};
    vector<int> nums3 = {7, 8, 9, 11, 12};

    cout << "First missing positive in nums1: " << firstMissingPositive(nums1) << endl; // Output: 3
    cout << "First missing positive in nums2: " << firstMissingPositive(nums2) << endl; // Output: 2
    cout << "First missing positive in nums3: " << firstMissingPositive(nums3) << endl; // Output: 1

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**
  - Each number is placed into its correct position at most once, and there is a single pass through the array to check the positions.
- Space Complexity: **O(1)** 
  - Only a constant amount of extra space is used, aside from the input array.
