[Leetcode 3081. Replace Question Marks in String to Minimize Its Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3081)
### Problem Statement

Given a string containing only lowercase English letters and question mark characters '?', replace each '?' by an lowercase English letter such that the lexicographic value of the resulting string is minimized. The lexicographic value of a string is a measure of its order according to standard dictionary order, i.e., less lexicographically valued for a string means it is smaller in dictionary order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - Typically, coding platforms like LeetCode specify constraints, so let's assume the string length is up to \(10^5\) characters.
   
2. **Should the replacement characters ensure that no two adjacent characters are the same?**
   - Yes, usually to avoid consecutive duplicates and achieve the smallest lexicographic order substitution.

3. **Can the string be empty? If yes, what should be the output?**
   - If it's empty, the simplest approach would be to return an empty string.

### Strategy

To tackle this problem, follow these steps:
1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. For each '?', replace it with the smallest possible letter such that:
   - It does not match the previous character.
   - It does not match the next character (if there exists a character at the next position).

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string replaceQuestionMarks(std::string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '?') {
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                if ((i > 0 && s[i - 1] == c) || (i < n - 1 && s[i + 1] == c)) {
                    continue;
                }
                s[i] = c;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return s;
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "a?b?c";
    std::cout << replaceQuestionMarks(input) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. The algorithm checks each character once and makes constant time operations (checking and replacing).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are modifying the string in place and using a fixed amount of additional space.

This approach ensures each question mark is replaced by the smallest possible letter while avoiding duplicate neighbors, thus minimizing the lexicographic value.
