## Problem Statement

Leetcode problem "1124. Longest Well-Performing Interval" asks us to find the length of the longest well-performing interval. An interval is considered well-performing if the number of working days in said interval is strictly greater than the number of non-working days.

Given an integer array `hours` where:

- Hours[i] represents the number of hours the employee worked on the `i-th` day.

A day is considered a well-performing day if the number of hours worked is greater than 8.

The goal is to find the length of the longest well-performing interval.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a working day and a non-working day?**
   - A working day is when hours > 8. 
   - Non-working day is when hours <= 8.

2. **What is the expected input size?**
   - It is up to the problem constraints, typically the length isn't mentioned, but let's assume standard constraint size for performance evaluation.

## Strategy

The general strategy involves transforming the problem in such a way that it becomes easier to solve using algorithms/tools we've seen before. Here is the plan:

1. **Transform Hours to Temperatures:**
   Map the working hours to a boolean array where:
   - Working day (hours > 8): +1
   - Non-working day (hours <= 8): -1

2. **Prefix Sum and HashMap:**
   To find the longest interval with more +1 than -1, we employ a prefix sum array and use a hash table (or unordered_map in C++) to store first occurrences of these prefix sums.

3. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Iterate through the array to convert hours into the boolean "temperatures".
   - Use a prefix sum to analyze these boolean values.
   - Utilize a hash table to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - Calculate the maximum interval length where the sum of values remains positive.

## Code

Hereâ€™s an implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int longestWPI(std::vector<int>& hours) {
        int n = hours.size();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int prefixSum = 0;
        std::unordered_map<int, int> firstOccurrence;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum += (hours[i] > 8) ? 1 : -1;
            
            if (prefixSum > 0) {
                maxLength = i + 1;  // Whole array from 0 to i is well-performing
            } else {
                if (firstOccurrence.find(prefixSum) == firstOccurrence.end()) {
                    firstOccurrence[prefixSum] = i;
                }
                
                if (firstOccurrence.find(prefixSum - 1) != firstOccurrence.end()) {
                    maxLength = std::max(maxLength, i - firstOccurrence[prefixSum - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the `hours` array. Each element is visited once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the hash map storing prefix sums and their occurrences.

This approach ensures that we make a single pass through the data, maintaining optimal performance while keeping auxiliary storage to a manageable level.
