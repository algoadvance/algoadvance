[Leetcode 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1653)
### Problem Statement
1653: Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced

You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'. A string is considered balanced if there is no pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] = 'b'` and `s[j] = 'a'`. In other words, all the 'a's in the string should appear before any 'b's.

You are allowed to delete characters from the string to make it balanced. Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?  
   **A:** The length of the string `s` will be between 1 and 10^5.

2. **Q:** Is the string always non-empty?  
   **A:** Yes, based on the constraints, the string is always non-empty.

### Strategy
The main idea is to maintain a count of 'a's and 'b's in the string to make optimal deletions:

1. Traverse the string from left to right:
   - Count the number of 'b's encountered so far.
   - Treat the current character position as a split point where all characters before it (inclusive) should be 'b'.
   
2. For each split point, calculate the number of deletions required to make the string balanced:
   - All characters to the left should be 'b' (requires deleting all 'a's seen so far).
   - All characters to the right should be 'a' (requires deleting all 'b's remaining).
   
3. Track the minimum deletions required among all possible split points.

### Code Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumDeletions(std::string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count_a = 0, count_b = 0;
    int min_deletions = n;
    
    // Count total number of 'a's in the string
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == 'a') count_a++;
    }

    // Traverse the string while maintaining counts of 'a' to the left and 'b' to the right
    int left_b_count = 0;
    int right_a_count = count_a;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        // Required deletions will be all 'b's to the left + all 'a's to the right
        min_deletions = std::min(min_deletions, left_b_count + right_a_count);
        
        // Process the current character
        if (i < n) {
            if (s[i] == 'b') {
                left_b_count++;
            } else {
                right_a_count--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return min_deletions;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "aababbab";
    std::cout << "Minimum deletions to make the string balanced: " << minimumDeletions(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** since we are traversing the string a constant number of times.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a few extra variables.

This efficient solution ensures the string is traversed optimally to compute the minimum deletions required, making it feasible for large inputs up to the constraint limits.
