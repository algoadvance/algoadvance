[Leetcode 1649. Create Sorted Array through Instructions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1649)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `instructions`, you are asked to create a sorted array from the elements `instructions[i]`. You start with an empty array `arr`. For each element `instructions[i]`, insert it into `arr` and count the cost of the insertion. The cost of each insertion is the minimum of the number of elements currently in `arr` that are strictly less than `instructions[i]` and the number of elements currently in `arr` that are strictly greater than `instructions[i]`.

Return the total cost modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Example
```
Input: instructions = [1,5,6,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Begin with arr = []. Insert 1 with cost min(0, 0) = 0, now arr = [1].
Insert 5 with cost min(1, 0) = 0, now arr = [1,5].
Insert 6 with cost min(2, 0) = 0, now arr = [1,5,6].
Insert 2 with cost min(1, 2) = 1, now arr = [1,2,5,6].
The total cost is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the instructions array contain negative numbers?
2. What is the range of the integers inside the `instructions` array?
3. Is the input constrained by a specific size for the `instructions` array?
4. Should duplicates within the array be considered separately for their costs?

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree), which allows us to efficiently query prefix sums and update frequencies. We will:
1. Normalization of input: Transform instructions to rank compressed values.
2. Utilize a Fenwick Tree to keep track of counts of elements.
3. For each element, calculate the count of elements in the current array that are less than or greater than the element.
4. Sum up the costs for all insertions.

## Code

Here is a C++ implementation using a Binary Indexed Tree:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

class FenwickTree {
    vector<int> tree;
public:
    FenwickTree(int n) : tree(n + 1, 0) {}
    
    void update(int i, int delta) {
        while (i < tree.size()) {
            tree[i] += delta;
            i += (i & -i);
        }
    }
    
    int query(int i) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (i > 0) {
            sum += tree[i];
            i -= (i & -i);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};

int createSortedArray(vector<int>& instructions) {
    int n = instructions.size();
    vector<int> sorted_instr(instructions);
    sort(sorted_instr.begin(), sorted_instr.end());
    
    // Rank compression
    unordered_map<int, int> rank;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        rank[sorted_instr[i]] = i + 1; // ranks start from 1
    }
    
    FenwickTree fenwick(n);
    int cost = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int rank_val = rank[instructions[i]];
        int less = fenwick.query(rank_val - 1);
        int greater = i - fenwick.query(rank_val);
        cost = (cost + min(less, greater)) % MOD;
        fenwick.update(rank_val, 1);
    }
    
    return cost;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> instructions = {1, 5, 6, 2};
    cout << createSortedArray(instructions) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is:
- Sorting the instructions array: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Processing each element in the instructions array with Fenwick Tree operations: \(O(n \log n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given problem constraints.

This solution also has a space complexity of \(O(n)\) due to the Fenwick Tree and auxiliary storage for the rank map.
