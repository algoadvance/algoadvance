[Leetcode 2360. Longest Cycle in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2360)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented by a given 0-indexed integer array `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates the node `i` has an outgoing edge to node `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from node `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the graph have multiple disconnected components?**
   - Yes, the graph can have multiple disconnected components.
   
2. **Will the graph always have at least one cycle?**
   - No, the graph might not contain any cycles. In such cases, the function should return `-1`.
   
3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the `edges` array?**
   - The length of `edges` array `n` will be in the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a vector `visited` to keep track of the visit status of nodes (`0` for unvisited, `1` for visiting, and `2` for visited).
   - Track the longest cycle length found.

2. **DFS to Detect Cycles**:
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on each unvisited node.
   - Use a stack to keep track of the current path and a map (`entry_time`) to record the entry time of each node in the path.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If while traversing we encounter a node that is already in the current path (i.e., node marked as `1`), calculate the length of this cycle using the entry times and update the longest cycle length.

4. **Mark Nodes**:
   - Once the DFS from a node is complete, mark nodes appropriately to avoid revisiting.

### Time Complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(n) because each node is processed a finite number of times.
- **Space complexity**: O(n) due to the storage required for `visited`, `entry_time`, and the recursion stack.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestCycle(vector<int>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size();
        vector<int> visited(n, 0);
        int longest_cycle_length = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (visited[i] == 0) {
                unordered_map<int, int> entry_time;
                int cycle_length = dfs(i, edges, visited, entry_time, 0);
                if (cycle_length > longest_cycle_length) {
                    longest_cycle_length = cycle_length;
                }
            }
        }

        return longest_cycle_length;
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(int node, const vector<int>& edges, vector<int>& visited, 
            unordered_map<int, int>& entry_time, int depth) {
        if (node == -1) return -1;
        if (visited[node] == 1) return depth - entry_time[node];
        if (visited[node] == 2) return -1;

        visited[node] = 1;
        entry_time[node] = depth;

        int next_node = edges[node];
        int cycle_length = dfs(next_node, edges, visited, entry_time, depth + 1);
        
        visited[node] = 2;
        return cycle_length;
    }
};
```

This code handles the detection of the longest cycle in the given directed graph using DFS and marks nodes to track their states effectively. It ensures optimal performance with O(n) complexity suitable for very large graphs.
