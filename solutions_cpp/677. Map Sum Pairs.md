[Leetcode 677. Map Sum Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l677)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 677: **Map Sum Pairs**

Implement the `MapSum` class that supports two operations:

1. `void insert(string key, int val)`: Inserts the key-value pair into the map. If the key already existed, the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one.
2. `int sum(string prefix)`: Returns the sum of all the pairs' values whose keys start with the given prefix.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be the behavior if the same key is inserted multiple times with different values?
   - **A:** The later value should override the existing value.

2. **Q:** Is it allowed for keys to contain non-alphabetical characters?
   - **A:** Yes, keys can contain any valid string characters.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the length of keys and values?
   - **A:** There are no explicit constraints on key lengths or values, but they should fit within reasonable usage parameters in a typical application.

4. **Q:** How frequent are the sum queries compared to insert operations?
   - **A:** This might affect the choice of data structure. Typically, a prefix tree (Trie) could be beneficial for fast prefix-based queries.

### Strategy
To efficiently support both operations, we will use a combination of a HashMap and a Trie (prefix tree):

1. **HashMap (for storing key-value pairs):**
   - This will ensure O(1) time complexity for insertions and updates.

2. **Trie (for prefix sum computation):**
   - Each node in the Trie will keep track of the sum of all values of keys that share the prefix represented by the node.
   - Insertion will update both the HashMap and the Trie. 
   - When inserting, if a key already exists, we'll update the Trie nodes to reflect the change in value.

### Time Complexity:
- Insert Operation: O(L), where L is the length of the key.
- Sum Operation: O(P), where P is the length of the prefix.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    int valueSum;
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    TrieNode() : valueSum(0) {}
};

class MapSum {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
    unordered_map<string, int> keyValueMap;
    
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MapSum() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(string key, int val) {
        int delta = val;
        if (keyValueMap.find(key) != keyValueMap.end()) {
            delta -= keyValueMap[key];
        }
        keyValueMap[key] = val;
        
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : key) {
            if (node->children.find(c) == node->children.end()) {
                node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[c];
            node->valueSum += delta;
        }
    }
    
    int sum(string prefix) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : prefix) {
            if (node->children.find(c) == node->children.end()) {
                return 0;
            }
            node = node->children[c];
        }
        return node->valueSum;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Insert Operation:**
   - Compute the delta value: the difference between the new value and the old value if the key existed.
   - Traverse the Trie node by node, updating the `valueSum` by the delta at each node corresponding to characters of the key.

2. **Sum Operation:**
   - Traverse the Trie node by node corresponding to characters of the prefix.
   - If the Trie lacks nodes for some characters in the prefix, return 0 (indicates no keys with such prefix).
   - Otherwise, return the `valueSum` at the final node which represents the sum of all values of keys sharing the given prefix.
