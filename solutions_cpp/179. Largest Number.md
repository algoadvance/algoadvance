[Leetcode 179. Largest Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l179)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it. Since the result may be very large, you need to return a string representation of this largest number.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [10, 2]`
- Output: `"210"`

- Input: `nums = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]`
- Output: `"9534330"`

### Clarification Questions:
1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array?  
   **A**: The length of `nums` is between `1` and `10^4`, and each number in `nums` is between `0` and `10^9`.

2. **Q**: Can the result contain leading zeros?  
   **A**: No, the result should not contain leading zeros unless the number itself is zero.

3. **Q**: Should the output always be a non-negative number?  
   **A**: Yes, since the input only contains non-negative numbers.

### Strategy

The main challenge is to order the numbers such that they form the largest concatenated result. Here's our approach:

1. **Custom Comparison**:
   - To decide which number should come first, compare two numbers by concatenating them in both possible orders.
   - For example, to compare `num1` and `num2`, we compare `num1+num2` with `num2+num1`. If `num1+num2` is greater, `num1` should come before `num2`.

2. **Sort**:
   - Sort the numbers based on the custom comparison function defined above.

3. **Concatenate**:
   - After sorting, concatenate the numbers to form the largest number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the highest value after sorting is `0`, return `"0"` (handles cases with multiple zeros).

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

string largestNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Convert all integers to strings for comparison
    vector<string> numStrs;
    for (int num : nums) {
        numStrs.push_back(to_string(num));
    }

    // Sort based on the custom comparator
    sort(numStrs.begin(), numStrs.end(), [](string& s1, string& s2) {
        return s1 + s2 > s2 + s1;
    });

    // Handle edge case where all numbers are zeros
    if (numStrs[0] == "0") {
        return "0";
    }

    // Concatenate the results
    string largestNum;
    for (string& numStr : numStrs) {
        largestNum += numStr;
    }

    return largestNum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {10, 2};
    vector<int> nums2 = {3, 30, 34, 5, 9};

    cout << "Largest Number from {10, 2}: " << largestNumber(nums1) << endl;
    cout << "Largest Number from {3, 30, 34, 5, 9}: " << largestNumber(nums2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion from int to string**: O(n)
- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **String concatenation**: O(n), as there is only one loop to concatenate all the strings.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, which is efficient given the constraints.
