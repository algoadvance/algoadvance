[Leetcode 1314. Matrix Block Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1314)
## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `k`, return a matrix answer where each answer[i][j] is the sum of all elements mat[r][c] for:

`i - k <= r <= i + k`, `j - k <= c <= j + k`, and `(r, c)` is a valid position in the matrix.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints for the input matrix `mat`?**
   - (e.g., size constraints, element value ranges)
   - Typical constraints: dimensions of the matrix (m, n) can vary possibly up to 100 in size, and values within the matrix elements can be within a reasonable range such as [-10^4, 10^4].

2. **Can `k` be larger than the dimensions of the matrix?**
   - Usually, no. `k` will typically be reasonably small compared to the dimensions of the matrix.

3. **What should be returned if `k` is 0?**
   - In this case, each element in the resulting matrix should be the same as the element at the corresponding position in the input matrix since the sum would just be the element itself.

## Strategy

The problem involves calculating block sums efficiently. Directly computing the sum for every block by iterating over each possible position would result in an inefficient solution. 

Instead, an optimal approach can be achieved using a **prefix sum array**. This technique will allow the computation of the sum of any sub-matrix in constant time after an initial preprocessing step.

### Steps:

1. **Create a prefix sum matrix** to store sums of sub-matrices of `mat`.
2. Use the prefix sum matrix to compute the sum of elements within any block specified by `k` in constant time.
3. Construct the result matrix using these sums.

The prefix sum matrix (`prefixSum[i][j]`) for an element (i, j) of matrix `mat` can be defined as:
- `prefixSum[i][j]` = sum of all elements from `mat[0][0]` to `mat[i][j]`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> matrixBlockSum(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
    int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> prefixSum(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    
    // Compute prefix sum
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            prefixSum[i][j] = mat[i - 1][j - 1]
                            + prefixSum[i - 1][j]
                            + prefixSum[i][j - 1]
                            - prefixSum[i - 1][j - 1];
        }
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    // Compute the sum of the block for each element in the result matrix
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            int r1 = max(0, i - k), c1 = max(0, j - k);
            int r2 = min(m - 1, i + k), c2 = min(n - 1, j + k);
            r2++; c2++;
            result[i][j] = prefixSum[r2][c2]
                          - (r1 > 0 ? prefixSum[r1 - 1][c2] : 0)
                          - (c1 > 0 ? prefixSum[r2][c1 - 1] : 0)
                          + (r1 > 0 && c1 > 0 ? prefixSum[r1 - 1][c1 - 1] : 0);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: This takes `O(m * n)` time as we compute the prefix sums for the entire matrix elements once.
2. **Result Matrix Construction**: This also takes `O(m * n)` time as we iterate through each element and use the prefix sums to compute the required block sum.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

This approach is efficient and ensures that the solution is derived in linear time relative to the size of the input matrix.
