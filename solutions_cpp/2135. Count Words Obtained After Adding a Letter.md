[Leetcode 2135. Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2135)
## Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string in `startWords` consists of lowercase English letters only. 

For each string in `targetWords`, you want to know if there is a string in `startWords` such that after adding exactly one letter to it (appears anywhere in the resulting string), you can form a string that is exactly the same (but sorted in lexicographical order) as the target word. 

Return *the number of strings in `targetWords` that can be formed from adding a letter to some string in* `startWords`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: startWords = ["ant","act","tack"], targetWords = ["tack","act","acti"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Adding 'k' to "ant" gives "tank" which sorts to "tack", matching "tack".
- Adding 'i' to "act" gives "acti" which sorts to "acti".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: startWords = ["ab","a"], targetWords = ["abc","abcd"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Adding 'c' to "ab" gives "abc" which sorts to "abc".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the length of strings in both `startWords` and `targetWords` ranges between 1 to 1000?
2. Can a string appear more than once in either `startWords` or `targetWords`?
3. Is it correct that strings should be checked after sorting them lexicographically?

If those assumptions hold, let's move on to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting and Representation**: 
   - For each string in `startWords`, sort its characters. This offers a standardized form since inserting characters can be disruptive unless in sorted form.
   - Store sorted versions of the strings in a hash set for `startWords`.

2. **Checking the `targetWords`**:
   - For each target string, sort its characters.
   - Generate all possible strings that could result if we remove exactly one letter from this sorted target string.
   - Check if any of these generated strings are present in the `startWords` hash set.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int wordCount(vector<string>& startWords, vector<string>& targetWords) {
    unordered_set<string> startSet;
    
    // Preprocess startWords: sort each word and insert into set
    for (string& word : startWords) {
        sort(word.begin(), word.end());
        startSet.insert(word);
    }

    int count = 0;
    
    // Check each target word
    for (string& target : targetWords) {
        sort(target.begin(), target.end());
        int n = target.size();
        
        // Check by removing each character one by one
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            string candidate = target.substr(0, i) + target.substr(i+1);
            if (startSet.find(candidate) != startSet.end()) {
                count++;
                break; // No need to check further if we already found a match
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> startWords = {"ant", "act", "tack"};
    vector<string> targetWords = {"tack", "act", "acti"};
    cout << wordCount(startWords, targetWords) << endl;  // Output: 2

    startWords = {"ab", "a"};
    targetWords = {"abc", "abcd"};
    cout << wordCount(startWords, targetWords) << endl;  // Output: 1

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution:
- Sorting each word in startWords: O(n * m log m)
- Sorting each target word: O(k * t log t)
- Generating candidates and checking set membership: O(k * t * m)

Where:
- `n` is the number of words in `startWords`
- `m` is the average length of words in `startWords`
- `k` is the number of words in `targetWords`
- `t` is the average length of words in `targetWords`

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O((n + k) * m log m), assuming `m` and `t` are of similar size.
