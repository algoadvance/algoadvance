[Leetcode 2967. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equalindromic](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2967)
## Problem Statement:

Given two integer arrays `nums` and `cost`, both of size `n`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
- Decrease or increase any element of the array `nums` by `1`.

The cost of each operation on the `i-th` element is `cost[i]`.

Your goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. Return the minimum total cost required to make all the elements equal.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2], cost = [2,1,2,1]
Output: 8
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == nums.length == cost.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i], cost[i] <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the output be the exact integer value of the minimum cost?
    - Yes.

2. Can elements of the `nums` array be modified beyond the initial provided values through the operations?
    - Yes, elements can be increased or decreased to any value.

3. Is it possible to encounter negative values or larger-than-usual integers in the `nums` or `cost` arrays?
    - No, both `nums` and `cost` consist of positive integers within the specified constraints.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to decide on a strategy to minimize the cost of making all elements in the `nums` array equal. A reasonable approach to tackle this type of problem is to use the concept of median. When trying to minimize the sum of absolute differences, the median of a list of numbers is a good candidate. However, we also have weights (costs) associated, so we need a weighted median.

Steps:
1. Sort the elements by their values.
2. Calculate the weighted median which minimizes the total cost (where the weight is given by the `cost` array).
3. Compute the total cost based on the calculated weighted median.

### Weighted Median Calculation:

A weighted median would be the value that omits the same total weight (cost) when considering the elements before and after it. In simple terms, we find the point where the accumulated cost on either side of an element would be as balanced as possible.

### Implementation:

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

long long minCost(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& cost) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> numCostPair(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        numCostPair[i] = {nums[i], cost[i]};
    
    // Sort based on the value in nums
    sort(numCostPair.begin(), numCostPair.end());
    
    // Get total cost
    long long totalCost = accumulate(cost.begin(), cost.end(), 0LL);
    long long accumulatedCost = 0;
    
    // Find the weighted median
    int medianValue = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        accumulatedCost += numCostPair[i].second;
        if (accumulatedCost >= (totalCost + 1) / 2) {
            medianValue = numCostPair[i].first;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the minimal cost to make all values equal to medianValue
    long long minTotalCost = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        minTotalCost += 1LL * abs(nums[i] - medianValue) * cost[i];
    }
    
    return minTotalCost;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 5, 2};
    vector<int> cost = {2, 1, 2, 1};
    cout << minCost(nums, cost) << endl; // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We combine the `nums` and `cost` arrays into a single array of pairs and sort this array based on the values.
2. **Finding Weighted Median**: We compute the total sum of costs and use this to find the median in a weighted context by accumulating the cost until we reach the middle of the total cost.
3. **Calculate Minimal Cost**: Using this weighted median value, we compute the total cost needed to change every element in `nums` to this median value.

### Time Complexity:

- Sorting the element pairs: \( O(n \log n) \)
- Calculating total weighted median and minimum cost: \( O(n) \)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).
