[Leetcode 2860. Happy Students](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2860)
### Problem Statement

A school is organizing a special program for its students, and it wants to make as many students as happy as possible. A student `i` is happy if they receive a prize, and for each student `j` that is happier than student `i` and received a prize, the happiness of student `i` decreases by `1`.

You are given an array `happiness` where `happiness[i]` represents the initial happiness of the ith student. The school can distribute at most `m` prizes.

Return the maximum number of happy students after distributing the prizes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the number of students?**
   - Number of students `n` and `m` can be relatively large.
   
2. **Does each student's happiness change linearly based on how many others are happier and have received a prize?**
   - Yes, each studentâ€™s happiness decreases by 1 for every happier student who received a prize.

3. **Any specific constraints for `happiness[i]` values?**
   - No specific constraints provided. Assume it's within typical integer range.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Students by Happiness:**
   - If we start by distributing prizes to the happiest students, the decrease in the happiness of less happy students can be minimized.

2. **Simulate the Distribution of Prizes:**
   - To determine the optimal distribution, we can use a greedy approach by calculating potential unhappiness and comparing it:
     - Iterate over the sorted list and assign prizes ensuring the maximum number of happy students.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int maxHappyStudents(std::vector<int>& happiness, int m) {
    // Sort the happiness in descending order
    std::sort(happiness.begin(), happiness.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    // Initialize the count of happy students
    int happyStudents = 0;
    
    // Iterate over the sorted list and distribute prizes to the first m students
    for (int i = 0; i < happiness.size(); i++) {
        if (i < m) {
            // If within the first m, the student gets a prize
            if (happiness[i] - i > 0) {
                happyStudents++;
            }
        } else {
            // After the first m, no prize can be given anymore
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return happyStudents;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> happiness = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6};
    int m = 3;
    std::cout << "Maximum number of happy students: " << maxHappyStudents(happiness, m) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Step:**
   - The sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of students.

2. **Linear Scan and Calculation:**
   - The subsequent iteration through the sorted list takes \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
