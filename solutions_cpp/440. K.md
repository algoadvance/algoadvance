[Leetcode 440. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l440)
### Problem Statement:
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k-th` smallest number in lexicographical order from `1` to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What are the constraints on `n` and `k`?
   - `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`
   
2. Is it guaranteed that `k` is always a valid number for the given `n`?
   - Yes.

3. Should the result be an integer or a string?
   - The result should be an integer.

### Strategy:

To find the k-th smallest number in lexicographical order efficiently, we can use a greedy algorithm based on prefix traversal. The idea is to start from `1` and descend lexicographically, calculating the number of values within any given prefix. This helps in skipping large groups of numbers without enumerating all of them.

Here are the steps:
1. Start with the current prefix as `1`.
2. Calculate the number of steps (or numbers) from the current prefix to the next prefix in lexicographical order.
3. If the number of steps is less than or equal to `k`, it means the k-th smallest number must be in a different prefix set. Decrease `k` by the number of steps and increment the current prefix.
4. If the number of steps is greater than `k`, descend into the current prefix (i.e., move to the next digit within the same prefix).
5. Repeat until `k` becomes zero.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthNumber(int n, int k) {
        int curr = 1;
        --k;  // We start with 1 so we need the next k elements
        
        while (k > 0) {
            int steps = calculateSteps(n, curr, curr + 1);
            if (steps <= k) {
                // Skip the whole subtree rooted at curr
                curr += 1;
                k -= steps;
            } else {
                // Descend to the next level
                curr *= 10;
                k -= 1;
            }
        }
        
        return curr;
    }

private:
    int calculateSteps(int n, long long first, long long last) {
        int steps = 0;
        while (first <= n) {
            steps += std::min(n + 1, last) - first;
            first *= 10;
            last *= 10;
        }
        return steps;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     int n = 13, k = 2;
//     int result = sol.findKthNumber(n, k);
//     std::cout << "The " << k << "-th smallest number in lexicographical order is: " << result << std::endl;
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Time Complexity:
- Calculating steps takes `O(log n)` time because each level of lexicographical tree decreases the number of steps by a factor of 10.
- The while loop runs a maximum of `log n` times because each time we either move to the next prefix or go one level deeper.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O((log n)^2)`.

This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of `n` (up to `10^9`).
