[Leetcode 2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2074)
### Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the linked list in groups of increasing lengths where the length of each group grows from 1, 2, 3, and so on. Specifically, reverse the nodes within the group if the length of the group is even. For example, the first group has a length of 1, the second group has a length of 2, the third group has a length of 3, the fourth group has a length of 4, etc.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we do if the list has fewer nodes than the next group size?**
   - If the remaining nodes are fewer than the upcoming group's size, then consider the entire remaining nodes as the final group.
   
2. **Should we modify the linked list in place or is it okay to create a new list?**
   - Generally, the modification should be done in place to avoid using extra space.

3. **What should we do if the group size is larger than the remaining nodes?**
   - Only reverse if the group as there's no limitation on the group size to be larger than the remaining nodes.

### Strategy
1. Traverse the linked list and group nodes based on increasing lengths starting from 1.
2. For each group, check if its size is even.
    - If even, reverse the nodes within the group.
    - If odd, keep the nodes in their original order.
3. Reconstruct the linked list with the modified groups.

### Code
Here's a solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

// Helper function to reverse a linked list
ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head, ListNode* tail) {
    ListNode* prev = tail;
    while (head != tail) {
        ListNode* next = head->next;
        head->next = prev;
        prev = head;
        head = next;
    }
    return prev; // New head of the reversed list
}

ListNode* reverseEvenLengthGroups(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return head;

    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(-1, head);
    ListNode* prev = dummy;
    ListNode *start = head, *end;

    // Variable to maintain track of group sizes
    int groupSize = 1;
    
    while (start) {
        // Determine the end of the current group
        int count = 0;
        end = start;
        while (end && count < groupSize) {
            end = end->next;
            count++;
        }
        
        // Reverse the group if size is even
        if (count % 2 == 0) {
            prev->next = reverseList(start, end);
            prev = start;     // prev should point to the tail of the reversed segment
        } else {
            prev = start;     // prev should just move to the end of the current group
        }
        
        prev->next = end;     // Connect the end of the current group to the rest of the list
        start = end;          // Move to the next group
        groupSize++;          // Increase the group size
    }

    return dummy->next;
}

// Helper function to print the list for testing
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head) {
        cout << head->val << " -> ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << "null" << endl;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(3, new ListNode(4, new ListNode(5, new ListNode(6))))));
    head = reverseEvenLengthGroups(head);
    printList(head);
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because each node is visited and processed exactly once. The space complexity is O(1) excluding the space for the input and output, as the reversal of nodes is done in place.
