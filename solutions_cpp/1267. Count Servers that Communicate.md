[Leetcode 1267. Count Servers that Communicate](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1267)
### Problem Statement

You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where `grid[i][j] = 1` means that there is a server at position `(i, j)`, and `grid[i][j] = 0` means that there is no server at position `(i, j)`.

Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that can communicate with at least one other server.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size Limits:**
   - What is the maximum size for the `grid`?
     - Assume that `1 <= m, n <= 250`.

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be the number of servers that can communicate?
     - Yes.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if all entries in the grid are `0`?
     - If there are no servers, the output should be `0`.
   - Can there be disconnected servers?
     - Yes, if a server has no other server in its row or column, it does not count as communicating.

### Strategy

1. **Count Servers in Rows and Columns:**
   - First, traverse the grid to count the number of servers in each row and each column.
   
2. **Second Pass to Identify Communicating Servers:**
   - Traverse the grid again and count the servers that have at least one other server in the same row or column.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<int> rowCount(m, 0);     // Count of servers in each row
        vector<int> colCount(n, 0);     // Count of servers in each column
        
        // First pass to count servers in each row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    rowCount[i]++;
                    colCount[j]++;
                }
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        // Second pass to determine communicating servers
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && (rowCount[i] > 1 || colCount[j] > 1)) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **First Pass:**
   - Traverse the `grid` to build `rowCount` and `colCount` arrays that keep track of the number of servers in each row and each column respectively.

2. **Second Pass:**
   - Traverse the `grid` again to count the number of servers that can communicate. A server can communicate if there is more than one server in its row (`rowCount[i] > 1`) or in its column (`colCount[j] > 1`).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
  - We traverse the grid twice: once to build the counts and another to determine communicating servers.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m + n)` to store the `rowCount` and `colCount` arrays. 

This solution is efficient and fits within the problem constraints.
