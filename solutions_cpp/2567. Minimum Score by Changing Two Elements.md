[Leetcode 2567. Minimum Score by Changing Two Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2567)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`.

- The `width` of a subarray of `nums` is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the subarray.
- The `score` of `nums` is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of `nums`.

Return the minimum score of `nums` after changing **exactly** two elements.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of values for `nums`:**
   - Are the integers in `nums` bounded by any specific limits?
2. **Size of `nums`:**
   - What is the size range for `nums`? Could it be very large or always small?
3. **Allowed modifications:**
   - Can the same element be modified twice, or do the two modifications have to be on distinct elements?
  
(Note: Based on LeetCode problem formatting, typical constraints can be inferred, but asking can ease ambiguity during interviews.)

## Strategy
1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The score of `nums` is defined by its maximum and minimum elements.
   - Changing two elements to minimize their difference implies focusing on reducing the gap between the maximum and minimum values found in `nums`.
   
2. **Considerations:**
   - Changing the maximum and minimum values seem logical, but it might also be useful to consider the next highest or lowest values.
   - Special cases when the size of `nums` is comparatively small, as reducing the gap might be trivial in such scenarios.

3. **Approach:**
   - Sort the array `nums` and analyze the smallest possible values after altering two elements.
   - There are a few possible strategies:
     - Change the 1st and 2nd maximum elements.
     - Change the 1st and 2nd minimum elements.
     - Change both the maximum and minimum elements directly and compare results.
     
By considering different combinations, the smallest difference can be acquired.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the array will take `O(n log n)`.
- Analyzing different pair changes will take constant time `O(1)` since it involves only comparing a few values post sorting.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

int minScoreByChangingTwoElements(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() <= 4) {
        return 0; // Changing two elements can make the array have zero width
    }

    // Sort the array
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Compute the possible minimum scores by changing two elements
    int n = nums.size();
    int minScore = INT_MAX;
    
    minScore = std::min(minScore, nums[n - 2] - nums[2]);  // Change two maximum elements
    minScore = std::min(minScore, nums[n - 1] - nums[3]);  // Change one max and one next-min element
    minScore = std::min(minScore, nums[n - 3] - nums[1]);  // Change one min and one next-max element
    minScore = std::min(minScore, nums[n - 4] - nums[0]);  // Change both minimum elements
    
    return minScore;
}
```

This implementation:
1. Sorts the array which is efficient for moderately sized for standard constraints.
2. Considers changes of both ends effectively.
3. Returns the smallest difference after the potential required changes, ensuring minimal "score".
