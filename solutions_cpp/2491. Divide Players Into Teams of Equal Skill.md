[Leetcode 2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2491)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `skill` where each integer represents the skill level of a player. You need to divide the players into pairs of size 2 such that the sum of skill levels in each pair is the same.

Return the *minimum* product sum of skills in all pairs if you can successfully divide the players into such pairs, otherwise return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the array length and the skill values?
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if the array length is odd?
   - Can we assume the array length to always be even since it needs to be divided into pairs?

Assumptions for this problem:
- The array length is guaranteed to be even.
  
### Strategy

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - Sorting the array will help in easily pairing up the smallest skill with the largest skill, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
   
2. **Check for a Valid Sum:**
   - Calculate the target sum for each pair from the first and last element in the sorted array. All these pairs should have the same sum.
   
3. **Pairing and Summing the Product:**
   - While verifying that all pairs have the same sum, calculate the product of skills in each pair and add it to the total.

4. **Handle Edge Case:**
   - If at any point the pairs do not have the same sum, return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    long long dividePlayers(std::vector<int>& skill) {
        // Step 1: Sort the skill array
        std::sort(skill.begin(), skill.end());
        
        int n = skill.size();
        int targetSum = skill[0] + skill[n - 1];
        long long productSum = 0;
        
        // Step 2: Pair and check the sums
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
            if (skill[i] + skill[n - 1 - i] != targetSum) {
                return -1; // Invalid pairing
            }
            productSum += skill[i] * skill[n - 1 - i];
        }
        
        return productSum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for the implemented solution is primarily determined by the sort operation:
- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Pairing and Summing:** \(O(n/2) = O(n)\)

Overall, the solution runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints.
