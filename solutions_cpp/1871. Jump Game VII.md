[Leetcode 1871. Jump Game VII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1871)
Certainly! Let's go through the problem statement and work through a solution in C++ step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. You are also given two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`.

In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, and at every step, you can move from index `i` to index `i + x` where `minJump <= x <= maxJump` and `s[i + x] == '0'`.

Return `true` if you can reach index `n - 1` in `s`, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we dive into the solution, let's clarify some aspects of the problem:

1. **Constraints**
   - What is the length of the string `s`? Are there any constraints on the size?
     - This will help us understand if our approach will be efficient within the problem constraints.

2. **Edge Cases**
   - What are some edge cases to consider? For instance, what if `n == 1`, or all characters are '1'?
   - What are `minJump` and `maxJump` values, and how do they relate to `n`?

3. **Input Validation**
   - Do we need to validate the input, or can we assume the input will always be valid per the problem's constraints?

### Strategy

Given the problem description, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach could be optimal. Essentially, we simulate the jumps and use a queue to maintain the indices we can reach.

To optimize our BFS and avoid checking some indices multiple times, we can maintain a boolean array `visited` to store indices that have been visited.

### Time Complexity

Our approach involves iterating over the string and using a queue to manage the BFS process. The overall complexity should be O(n) since every index is processed once.

### Code

Let's implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

bool canReach(std::string s, int minJump, int maxJump) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (s[n - 1] == '1') return false;
    
    std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    std::queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);
    visited[0] = true;
    int farthest = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int index = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (int i = std::max(index + minJump, farthest); i <= std::min(index + maxJump, n - 1); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == '0' && !visited[i]) {
                if (i == n - 1) return true;
                q.push(i);
                visited[i] = true;
            }
        }

        farthest = std::min(index + maxJump + 1, n - 1);
    }

    return false;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "011010"; // Example string
    int minJump = 2, maxJump = 3;
    bool result = canReach(s, minJump, maxJump);
    std::cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We initialize a queue and a `visited` array to track the indices we have processed.
- **BFS Process**: We use BFS to simulate the jumps. For each index, we try to jump to indices within the range `[index + minJump, index + maxJump]`.
- **Optimization**: `farthest` is used to avoid redundant checks and limit repeated processing of the same indices.
- **Early Termination**: If we reach the last index during the BFS process, we return true. If the loop completes and we haven't reached it, we return false.

This approach ensures we efficiently explore possible jumps while avoiding redundant checks, yielding a solution with a linear time complexity O(n).
