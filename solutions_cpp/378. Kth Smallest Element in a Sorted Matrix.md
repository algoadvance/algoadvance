[Leetcode 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l378)
## Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

### Example:
```python
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
]
k = 8
```
Output: 13

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Matrix dimensions and constraints:**
   - What is the size range for `n` (the dimensions of the matrix)?
   - Constraints on values within the matrix and the range of `k`.

2. **Input properties:**
   - Can there be duplicate elements in the matrix?

3. **Output requirements:**
   - Should the function return the element itself or some indicator like an index?

## Strategy

### Approach:
1. **Min-Heap Method:** Utilize a heap to keep track of the smallest elements efficiently.
   - Insert the first element of each row into the heap with its coordinates.
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap and push the next element of the same row into the heap.
   - Repeat the above process until we pop the kth element.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize the Min-Heap:** Insert the first element of each row into a min-heap.
2. **Pop and Push:** Pop the smallest element from the heap and push the next element from the same row into the heap.
3. **Repeat:** Continue the above step `k` times.
4. **Return the kth Element:** The element popped on the kth iteration is the kth smallest element.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        // Min-heap to store elements as (value, row, col)
        auto comp = [](const tuple<int, int, int>& a, const tuple<int, int, int>& b) {
            return get<0>(a) > get<0>(b);
        };
        
        priority_queue<tuple<int, int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, decltype(comp)> minHeap(comp);
        
        int n = matrix.size();
        
        // Initialize the heap with first element of each row.
        for (int r = 0; r < min(n, k); ++r) {
            minHeap.push({matrix[r][0], r, 0});
        }
        
        int value = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            auto [val, r, c] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            value = val;
            
            if (c + 1 < n) {
                // Push the next element in the row into the heap.
                minHeap.push({matrix[r][c + 1], r, c + 1});
            }
        }
        
        return value;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** `O(min(k, n))` to push the first elements of each row into the heap.
- **Heap Operations:** `O(k log(min(k, n)))` for `k` operations (pop and push). 
  - Each operation on the heap takes `O(log min(k, n))` time.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(k log(min(k, n)))`.

This method ensures efficiency by leveraging the properties of a heap to manage a dynamic set of elements efficiently.
