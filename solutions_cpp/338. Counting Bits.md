[Leetcode 338. Counting Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l338)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. For every number `i` in the range 0 to `n` inclusive, you need to count the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

The function signature is:
```cpp
vector<int> countBits(int n);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the range of the integer `n`?
   - **A**: The constraint typically lies within 0 <= n <= 10^5.

2. **Q**: Should the solution be optimized in terms of time and space complexity?
   - **A**: Yes, ideally an O(n) time complexity solution is expected.

3. **Q**: Can we assume that the input `n` will always be a non-negative integer?
   - **A**: Yes, `n` is guaranteed to be non-negative.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach. The main idea is to use previously computed values to build up the result array.

1. **Observation**: For any number `i`, the number of 1's in its binary representation can be derived from the number of 1's in the binary representation of `i/2` plus the least significant bit of `i`.
   - If `i` is even, the number of 1s in `i` is the same as in `i/2`.
   - If `i` is odd, it has one more `1` than `i-1` (which is even).

2. **Formula**:
   - `countBits[i] = countBits[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`
     - `i >> 1` effectively performs integer division by 2.
     - `i & 1` extracts the least significant bit (0 if `i` is even, 1 if `i` is odd).

### Code

Here is the efficient C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> countBits(int n) {
    vector<int> result(n+1);
    result[0] = 0; // Base case: The number of 1's in the binary representation of 0 is 0

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        result[i] = result[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time because each computation for `i` from 1 to `n` takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the result for each integer from 0 to `n`.

This method efficiently computes the number of 1's in the binary representations of all numbers from 0 to `n` using dynamic programming.
