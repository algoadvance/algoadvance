[Leetcode 2858. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2858)
### Problem Statement
You are given a directed graph represented by `n` nodes and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates a directed edge from node `u` to node `v`. Your task is to find the *minimum number of edge reversals* needed such that there is a directed path from every node to every other node.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Graph Constraints**: Is the graph connected initially? If not, should we consider connected components separately?
2. **Edge Cases**: Are there any special cases such as self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
3. **Node Indexing**: Are nodes zero-indexed or one-indexed in the given graph representation?

For this solution, I'll assume the graph is connected and nodes are zero-indexed.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need a strategy that makes it possible to reach any node from any other node with the minimum reversals of edges.

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We can use BFS from each node to count the necessary reversals.
2. **Edge Reversal Tracking**: We use a queue to handle the current front, and use two counters to distinguish between original edges and reversed edges.
3. **Distance Array**: Use an array to maintain the minimum number of reversals required to reach each node starting from each node.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

vector<int> minimumEdgeReversals(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n); // {neighbor, original(0)/reversed(1)}
    
    // Populate the adjacency list
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
        adj[u].push_back({v, 0}); // Original edge
        adj[v].push_back({u, 1}); // Reversed edge
    }
    
    auto bfs_min_reversals = [&](int src) {
        vector<int> reversals(n, INT_MAX);
        queue<pair<int, int>> q; // {node, reversal_count}
        
        q.push({src, 0});
        reversals[src] = 0;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [u, reversal_count] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for (auto& [v, is_reversed] : adj[u]) {
                int new_reversal_count = reversal_count + is_reversed;
                if (new_reversal_count < reversals[v]) {
                    reversals[v] = new_reversal_count;
                    q.push({v, new_reversal_count});
                }
            }
        }
        
        return reversals;
    };
    
    vector<int> answer(n, INT_MAX);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        auto reversals_from_i = bfs_min_reversals(i);
        int max_reversals_from_i = *max_element(reversals_from_i.begin(), reversals_from_i.end());
        answer[i] = max_reversals_from_i;
    }
    
    return answer;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0, 1}, {2, 0}, {3, 2}, {4, 3}, {5, 4}};
    int n = 6;
    vector<int> result = minimumEdgeReversals(n, edges);

    for(int r : result) {
        cout << r << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the adjacency list: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of edges.
- BFS from each node: \(O(n(m + n))\), since we perform BFS from each of the \(n\) nodes.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n^2 (m + n))\), which can be optimized further, but provides a functional solution based on the BFS traversal.
