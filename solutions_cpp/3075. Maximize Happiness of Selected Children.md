[Leetcode 3075. Maximize Happiness of Selected Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3075)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `candies` where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies in the `i-th` box. The maximum number of children you can select is `k`, and each child can receive only one box of candies. Your goal is to maximize the total happiness of selected children by distributing the maximum possible candies to exactly `k` children.

**Example:**
- Input: `candies = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3`
- Output: `12`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can `k` ever be 0 or larger than the length of `candies`?**
   - A: No, `k` will always be a positive integer and `k <= len(candies)`.
 
2. **Q: Are there any constraints on the number of candies in each box?**
   - A: There are no specified constraints, so we can assume that any non-negative integer value is valid.

3. **Q: Should we consider cases with negative numbers of candies in input?**
   - A: No, based on the usual context of the problem, the number of candies in each box should be non-negative.

## Strategy
To maximize the happiness, we should select the `k` largest values from the `candies` array. By choosing the boxes with the largest candies, we ensure the maximum sum of distributed candies.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Sum the first `k` elements of the sorted array.
3. Return the sum.

This approach ensures that the `k` largest elements are selected and summed up.

## Code
Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maximizeHappiness(vector<int>& candies, int k) {
    // Sort the array in descending order
    sort(candies.begin(), candies.end(), greater<int>());
    
    // Sum the first k elements
    int totalHappiness = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        totalHappiness += candies[i];
    }
    
    return totalHappiness;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> candies = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 3;
    cout << "Maximum happiness: " << maximizeHappiness(candies, k) << endl; // Output: 12
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `candies` array.
- **Summing the first `k` elements**: \(O(k)\), which in the worst case is \(O(n)\) if \(k\) is very close to \(n\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\). This is dominated by the sorting operation. The sum operation is linear and generally much faster.

This approach is efficient and ensures that the solution is optimal based on the problem constraints.
