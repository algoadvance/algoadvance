[Leetcode 3002. Maximum Size of a Set After Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3002)
### Problem Statement
Suppose you are given an integer array `nums`, and you perform the following operation until the array is empty:
1. Select the smallest unique number from the array and remove it.
2. Select the largest unique number from the array and remove it.

You need to find the maximum size of the array that you can get after performing the above operations any number of times.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the input array?
   - Are all the elements of the array guaranteed to be integers?
  
2. **Uniqueness:**
   - Can elements repeat in the array? 
   
3. **Output:**
   - Are we returning the size of the array after all valid operations or some intermediate state?

### Answers to Clarifying Questions:
1. Assume a reasonably large array, up to `10^5` elements.
2. Yes, all elements are integers.
3. Yes, the elements can repeat in the array, and we return the maximum size of the resultant array after all valid operations.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, observe that:
1. If you are removing pairs (smallest unique and largest unique) each time, we are essentially reducing the array size by these unique elements.
2. The operation allows you to remove unique elements in pairs, so the core task boils down to counting the unique elements in the array.
3. Each pair removes two elements; hence the maximum size after removals is based on maintaining as many unique pairs as possible.

Steps:
1. Count the frequencies of every element in the array.
2. Identify the unique elements by their counts.
3. Calculate the size of the resultant array by considering pairs of unique elements.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumSizeOfSet(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        std::unordered_set<int> uniqueNumbers;
        
        // Calculate frequency of each element
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }
        
        // Identify unique elements
        for (auto it : freq) {
            if (it.second == 1) {
                uniqueNumbers.insert(it.first);
            }
        }

        // Maximum size considering pairs
        int maxSize = uniqueNumbers.size();
        return maxSize;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9};

    int result = sol.maximumSizeOfSet(nums);
    std::cout << "Maximum Size of Set After Removals: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Frequency count: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
- Identifying unique numbers: `O(n)` â€” essentially a single pass through the elements.
- Overall complexity: `O(n)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum size of the resultant array after the described removals.
