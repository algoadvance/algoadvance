[Leetcode 2435. Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2435)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix `grid` of integers with dimensions `m x n` and an integer `k`. You need to determine the number of paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix such that the sum of the elements along the path is divisible by `k`. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements of the matrix be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements can be negative, zero, or positive.

2. **What is the expected range for the dimensions `m` and `n` of the matrix?**
   - Generally, the dimensions can vary, but for complexity estimates, typical constraints are assumed to be reasonable for dynamic programming solutions, often up to around 100 for each dimension.

3. **Are there any constraints on the value of `k`?**
   - `k` is a positive integer.

4. **Should we return the count modulo some number?**
   - This problem may usually require returning results modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow issues, but let's confirm this from the problem statement.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). The key idea is to maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j][r]` represents the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)` with a sum modulo `k` equal to `r`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the DP table with zero values.
   - Set `dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1` because there's one way to start at the top-left corner with the initial value's modulo `k` value.

2. **Transition**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the new sum modulo `k` after moving from both the top cell `(i-1, j)` and the left cell `(i, j-1)`.
   - Update the DP table accordingly by summing up the number of ways from these two cells.

3. **Result**:
   - The desired result is in `dp[m-1][n-1][0]`, as we want paths where the total sum modulo `k` is zero.

### Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n \times k)\)
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n \times k)\)

The dynamic programming approach will iterate through each cell and process each possible modulo `k` state, providing a feasible solution given reasonable constraints.

### Code

Here's the C++ code implementation for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int numberOfPaths(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int k) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    // DP table
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(m, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(k, 0)));
    
    // Initialize the starting point
    dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1;
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            for (int r = 0; r < k; ++r) {
                if (dp[i][j][r] > 0) {
                    int newSum = (r + grid[i][j]) % k;
                    if (i + 1 < m)
                        dp[i + 1][j][newSum] = (dp[i + 1][j][newSum] + dp[i][j][r]) % MOD;
                    if (j + 1 < n)
                        dp[i][j + 1][newSum] = (dp[i][j + 1][newSum] + dp[i][j][r]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Result
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1][0];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = \{\{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    int k = 3;
    cout << numberOfPaths(grid, k) << endl; // Example Function Call
    return 0;
}
```

This code reads a 2D vector `grid` and an integer `k`, and calculates the number of valid paths with the sum of elements divisible by `k`, using the dynamic programming approach as outlined.
