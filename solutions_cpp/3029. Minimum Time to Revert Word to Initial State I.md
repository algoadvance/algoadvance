[Leetcode 3029. Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3029)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, you are allowed to perform the following operations on it:
1. Reverse any substring of `s`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the entire string equal to the initial string.

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding to the solution, let's clarify some questions to ensure we understand the problem statement correctly:

1. **What is the initial state of the string?**
   - The initial state of the string is the given string `s`.

2. **Is there any restriction on the length of the substring we can reverse?**
   - No, you can reverse any substring of any length.

3. **Do we need to consider the string is already in its initial state:**
   - If the string `s` is already the same as its initial state, the minimum number of operations required is 0.

4. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   - Clarify the constraints of the problem. However, most string processing problems have constraints like up to \(10^5\). 

## Strategy

The operations described allow us to reverse any part of the string. Hence, to revert the string to its initial state, we need to know if the string is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, no operations are needed because reversing any part of it will still yield the same string.

Steps to solve the problem:
1. Check if the string `s` is a palindrome.
2. If `s` is a palindrome, return 0 because it is already in its initial state.
3. If `s` is not a palindrome, it always requires 1 operation to revert any non-palindromic string by reversing the entire string.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for checking if a string is a palindrome is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isPalindrome(const string& s) {
    int left = 0, right = s.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

int minOperationsToRevert(const string& s) {
    if (isPalindrome(s)) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    cout << minOperationsToRevert(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **isPalindrome Function**: This function checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center.
2. **minOperationsToRevert Function**: This function checks if the string is a palindrome using the `isPalindrome` function. If it is, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1.
3. **main Function**: Reads the input string and prints the result of `minOperationsToRevert`.

Feel free to provide any additional constraints or changes in the requirements if needed!
