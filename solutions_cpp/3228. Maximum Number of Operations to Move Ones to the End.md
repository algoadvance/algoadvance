[Leetcode 3228. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3228)
### Problem Statement

Let's define the problem statement as follows:

You are given a binary array (an array consisting of only 0s and 1s). Your task is to perform several operations to move all the ones to the end of the array. In one operation, you can choose any two adjacent elements, and if they are in the wrong order (i.e., a one followed by a zero), you can swap them.

You need to determine the maximum number of operations needed to move all the ones to the end of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the array?
2. **Array Contents**: Are there any other constraints on the input, like initial ordering or number of 0s and 1s?

For the sake of providing a solution, let's assume:
1. The maximum length of the array is within typical constraints (e.g., 1 ≤ length ≤ 10^5).
2. The array consists strictly of 0s and 1s.

### Strategy

The strategy for this problem involves the following steps:

1. Traverse the array and count the number of zeros.
2. For each one encountered, add the number of preceding zeros to the operation count.
3. The total number of operations will give us the desired result.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. Traverse the array from left to right.
2. Keep a count of zeros encountered.
3. For each one encountered, add the current count of zeros to the total operations count.
4. Continue this until the end of the array.

This method makes sure that every time a one is encountered, all preceding zeros are counted as possible movements to the end of the array.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)**, where *n* is the length of the binary array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int maximumOperationsToMoveOnes(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int zeroCount = 0;
    int operations = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        } else {
            operations += zeroCount;
        }
    }

    return operations;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1};
    int result = maximumOperationsToMoveOnes(nums);
    std::cout << "Maximum Operations: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
    - `zeroCount` keeps track of how many zeros have been encountered so far.
    - `operations` keeps track of the total operations needed.

2. **Traversal**:
    - As we traverse each element of the array:
      - If we encounter a zero (`nums[i] == 0`), we increment the `zeroCount`.
      - If we encounter a one (`nums[i] == 1`), we add the `zeroCount` to the `operations`, since each zero before this one can potentially swap positions with this one, moving it closer to the end.

3. **Output**:
    - Finally, we return the total number of operations required.

This approach ensures that we count the maximum possible operations required to move all ones to the end of the array effectively.
