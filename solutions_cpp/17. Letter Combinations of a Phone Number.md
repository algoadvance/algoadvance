[Leetcode 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l17)
### Problem Statement

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. The digit-to-letters mapping is given by the standard telephone number pads as follows:

```
2 -> "abc"
3 -> "def"
4 -> "ghi"
5 -> "jkl"
6 -> "mno"
7 -> "pqrs"
8 -> "tuv"
9 -> "wxyz"
```

**Example:**
```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= digits.length <= 4
- digits[i] is a digit in the range ['2', '9'].

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Q: Can the input string contain any non-digit characters, or is it guaranteed to only contain digits from `2-9`?
    - A: It is guaranteed to only contain digits from `2-9`.

2. **Empty Input:**
    - Q: What should be returned if the input string is empty?
    - A: An empty list should be returned if the input string is empty.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach:
1. Create a mapping of digits to their corresponding letters.
2. Define a recursive function that builds the combinations.
3. Use this recursive function to explore all possible combinations by appending letters corresponding to the current digit and moving to the next digit.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(4^n * n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. This takes into account the maximum branching factor of 4 (in the worst-case scenario, digit '7' or '9' which maps to 4 letters) and the height of the recursion tree, which is `n`.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::string> letterCombinations(std::string digits) {
        if (digits.empty()) {
            return {};
        }

        // Mapping of digits to letters
        const std::vector<std::string> digitToChar = {
            "", "", "abc", "def", "ghi", "jkl", "mno", "pqrs", "tuv", "wxyz"
        };

        std::vector<std::string> result;
        std::string current;
        backtrack(digits, 0, current, result, digitToChar);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void backtrack(const std::string &digits, int index, std::string &current, std::vector<std::string> &result, const std::vector<std::string> &digitToChar) {
        if (index == digits.size()) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }

        const std::string &letters = digitToChar[digits[index] - '0'];
        for (char letter : letters) {
            current.push_back(letter);
            backtrack(digits, index + 1, current, result, digitToChar);
            current.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Mapping:** We create a mapping `digitToChar` that maps each digit from `2-9` to its corresponding string of letters.
2. **Base Case:** If the input `digits` is empty, we return an empty vector.
3. **Recursive Backtracking Function:**
    - We pass the current combination being built, the index of the current digit in the input string, and the result vector.
    - If we've processed all digits (`index == digits.size()`), we add the current combination to the result.
    - Otherwise, we iterate through the letters corresponding to the current digit, append each letter to the current combination, and recursively build the subsequent combinations.
    - After returning from the recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last appended character and try the next letter.

This approach ensures that every possible combination is explored efficiently.
