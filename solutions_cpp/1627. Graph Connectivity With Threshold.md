[Leetcode 1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1627)
## Problem Statement

We are given `n` nodes and a threshold value. We need to determine if two nodes are connected within the graph where direct edges between nodes exist if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the nodes' values is greater than the threshold.

You are given an integer `n` and an integer `threshold`. A graph is constructed with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. There is an edge between pairs of nodes `(i, j)` if the `gcd(i, j) > threshold`. 

We need to process a list of queries. Each query asks if two nodes `u` and `v` are connected. Two nodes are considered connected if there is a path from `u` to `v`.

*Example Input:*

```cpp
int n = 6;
int threshold = 2;
vector<vector<int>> queries = {{1, 4}, {2, 5}, {3, 6}};
```

*Example Output:*

```cpp
vector<bool> result = {false, false, true};
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be very large, and how should that impact the algorithm's performance?**
    - Typically, `n` can be large, so we need an efficient way to determine connectivity. Using Union Find (Disjoint Set Union) can help in this case.

2. **What is the range of values for `n` and `threshold`?**
    - `n` and `threshold` can vary greatly, but let's assume `1 <= n <= 10^4` and `0 <= threshold <= 10^4`.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
    - Use the Union-Find data structure to manage connectivity.

2. **Building Graph:**
    - For each `i` from `threshold + 1` to `n`, connect `i` to all `i*k` (where `k*i <= n`).

3. **Processing Queries:**
    - For each query, check if the nodes belong to the same connected component using Union-Find.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for gcd
using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n+1), rank(n+1, 0) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;
};

vector<bool> areConnected(int n, int threshold, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    UnionFind uf(n);

    for (int i = threshold + 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int multiple = 2 * i; multiple <= n; multiple += i) {
            uf.unite(i, multiple);
        }
    }

    vector<bool> result;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int u = query[0];
        int v = query[1];
        if (uf.find(u) == uf.find(v)) {
            result.push_back(true);
        } else {
            result.push_back(false);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Initialization:** O(n) 
- **Union-Find Operations (amortized):** O(α(n)), where α is the Inverse Ackermann function.
- **Building Graph:** 
  - The inner loop runs for multiples of `i`, so it iterates about `n/i`, resulting in an overall O(n log n). This is because the Harmonic series diverges logarithmically.
- **Processing Queries:** O(q * α(n)), where `q` is the number of queries.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n log n + q α(n))`.
