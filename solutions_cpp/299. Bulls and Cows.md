[Leetcode 299. Bulls and Cows](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l299)
## Problem Statement

You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:
- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position.

Given the secret number and your friend's guess, return the hint in the format `xAyB` where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows.

**Note:**

- You may assume that the secret number and the friend's guess have the same length and both contain only digits (0-9).

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Should we check for any invalid input or can we consider the inputs are always valid?
   - Assume the inputs are always valid.
2. What should be the format of the output string?
   - The format should be `xAyB` where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows.

## Strategy:

1. Initialize two counters - one for bulls, one for cows.
2. Use two arrays (or hash maps) to keep track of the frequency of digits in the secret and the guess that are not bulls.
3. Iterate through both strings simultaneously:
    - If the characters match, increment the bulls counter.
    - If the characters don't match, update the frequency counts for both secret and guess.
4. After the first pass through the strings, for each digit (0-9), the potential cows can be determined by the minimum of the frequency counts in secret and guess.
5. Construct the result string in the format `xAyB`.

## Time Complexity:

- One pass to count bulls and record frequencies (O(n)).
- One additional pass through the 10 possible digits for cows calculation (O(1)).
- Total time complexity is O(n).

## Code:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::string getHint(std::string secret, std::string guess) {
    int bulls = 0, cows = 0;
    std::vector<int> secretFrequency(10, 0), guessFrequency(10, 0);

    // First pass to count bulls and record frequencies
    for (int i = 0; i < secret.size(); ++i) {
        if (secret[i] == guess[i]) {
            ++bulls;
        } else {
            ++secretFrequency[secret[i] - '0'];
            ++guessFrequency[guess[i] - '0'];
        }
    }

    // Count cows
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        cows += std::min(secretFrequency[i], guessFrequency[i]);
    }

    return std::to_string(bulls) + "A" + std::to_string(cows) + "B";
}
```

In the code:
- We use two arrays `secretFrequency` and `guessFrequency` to count occurrences of digits that are not in the correct position.
- The `std::min(secretFrequency[i], guessFrequency[i])` gives us the number of cows for each digit.
- Finally, the result string is constructed and returned.
