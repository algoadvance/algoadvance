[Leetcode 3069. Distribute Elements Into Two Arrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3069)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, your task is to distribute the `nums` array's elements into two arrays `a` and `b` such that:

1. Each array contains exactly `k` elements.
2. Maximize the sum of absolute differences between the elements of `a` and the elements of `b`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the elements of `nums`**
    - Are the elements of `nums` negative, non-negative, or can they be both?
    - If `nums` array length is less than `2k`, how should we handle it? (assuming input constraint)

2. **Output Format**
    - Should the function return the two arrays `a` and `b`, or just the maximum sum of absolute differences?

3. **Input Constraints**
    - Maximum possible size of `nums`?
    - Range of values for `nums` and `k`?

Assuming that elements can be positive or negative, the size of `nums` is guaranteed to be at least `2k`, and we need to return exactly two arrays `a` and `b`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the `nums` array** in descending order to simplify the selection of the largest differences.
2. **Select elements for arrays `a` and `b`**:
    - One way to potentially maximize the sum of absolute differences is to place the `k` largest elements in one array (`a`) and the next `k` largest elements in another array (`b`). This will maximize the differences because we are pairing large numbers against the next set of smaller numbers.
3. **Compute the sum of absolute differences**:
    - Having selected the elements for `a` and `b`, iterate through both arrays and sum the absolute differences.

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation based on the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::pair<std::vector<int>, std::vector<int>> distributeElements(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Sort the array in descending order
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), std::greater<int>());

    std::vector<int> a(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
    std::vector<int> b(nums.begin() + k, nums.begin() + 2 * k);

    return {a, b};
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 7, 8, 1, 9, 10, 6};
    int k = 3;

    auto result = distributeElements(nums, k);
    std::vector<int> a = result.first;
    std::vector<int> b = result.second;

    std::cout << "Array a: ";
    for (const auto& num : a) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\nArray b: ";
    for (const auto& num : b) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the `nums` array. The selection of elements takes linear time, i.e., \(O(n)\). Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space if not counting the storage for the arrays `a` and `b`, making it essentially \(O(n)\) accounting for the inputs and outputs together.
