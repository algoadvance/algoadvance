[Leetcode 3030. Find the Grid of Region Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3030)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D integer grid `matrix`, you need to calculate and return a new 2D grid `result` where each element at `result[i][j]` is the average of the elements of the region in the grid `matrix` centered at `(i, j)` and stretching `k` units in all four directions. 

In other words, for each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, you need to consider all cells within `k` distance in up, down, left, and right directions from `(i, j)`, and compute the average (sum of elements divided by the number of elements).

If the region extends beyond the boundaries of the matrix, consider only the valid elements that fall within the matrix boundaries.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can `k` be zero? (Yes, if `k` is zero, the average would just be the element itself).
   - Are the dimensions of the `matrix` bounded? (Typically, interview problems assume reasonable input sizes to fit in memory).
   - Can the `matrix` contain negative numbers? (Yes, handle negative numbers appropriately).

2. **Output:**
   - Should the result grid have the same dimensions as the input `matrix`? (Yes).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Very small matrices, such as 1x1 or 2x2.
   - Large values of `k`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a prefix sum along with a sliding window approach:
1. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Compute a prefix sum matrix where `prefixSum[i][j]` contains the sum of elements in the rectangular region from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)`.

2. **Query the Sum Efficiently:**
   - Use the prefix sum matrix to compute the sum of any subrectangle `(i1, j1)` to `(i2, j2)` efficiently.
   - The sum of a subrectangle can be found in constant time using the relation:
     \[
     \text{sum}(i1, j1, i2, j2) = \text{prefixSum}[i2][j2] - \text{prefixSum}[i1-1][j2] - \text{prefixSum}[i2][j1-1] + \text{prefixSum}[i1-1][j1-1]
     \]
   
3. **Sliding Window for each (i, j):**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, define the boundaries of the subrectangle to be averaged.
   - Use the prefix sum array to compute the sum within these boundaries.
   - Compute the average and store it in the result grid.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<double>> matrixRegionAverage(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        
        // Step 1: Construct the prefix sum array        
        vector<vector<int>> prefixSum(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                prefixSum[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1]
                                + prefixSum[i-1][j]
                                + prefixSum[i][j-1]
                                - prefixSum[i-1][j-1];
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Create the result array with the appropriate averages
        vector<vector<double>> result(m, vector<double>(n, 0.0));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int r1 = max(0, i - k), c1 = max(0, j - k);
                int r2 = min(m - 1, i + k), c2 = min(n - 1, j + k);
                
                int totalElements = (r2 - r1 + 1) * (c2 - c1 + 1);
                int totalSum = prefixSum[r2 + 1][c2 + 1]
                             - prefixSum[r1][c2 + 1]
                             - prefixSum[r2 + 1][c1]
                             + prefixSum[r1][c1];
                
                result[i][j] = static_cast<double>(totalSum) / totalElements;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {4, 5, 6},
        {7, 8, 9}
    };
    int k = 1;
    vector<vector<double>> result = sol.matrixRegionAverage(matrix, k);
    
    for (const auto& row : result) {
        for (double val : row) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is \(O(m \cdot n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the dimensions of the matrix. This is because:
- Constructing the prefix sum matrix takes \(O(m \cdot n)\).
- Computing the sum for each region using the prefix sum takes \(O(1)\) per query, resulting in \(O(m \cdot n)\) queries.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \cdot n)\).
