[Leetcode 2249. Count Lattice Points Inside a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2249)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `circles` where `circles[i] = [x_i, y_i, r_i]` represents a circle centered at `(x_i, y_i)` with a radius of `r_i`. A lattice point is a point `(x, y)` where both `x` and `y` are integers. Return the number of lattice points that are present inside **at least one** circle.

### Example:
```
Input: circles = [[2, 2, 1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The five lattice points present inside the circle are (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 2).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Coordinates and Radii:** What are the constraints on the values of `x_i`, `y_i`, and `r_i`?
2. **Circle Overlaps:** Are we looking for unique lattice points across all circles, regardless of overlapping areas?
3. **Number of Circles:** What is the maximum number of circles we can expect?

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:** Since a lattice point is defined as a point with integer coordinates, we can brute force the problem.
    - For each circle, iterate over the range of possible integer values for `x` and `y` that might fall within the circle.
    - Use the equation of a circle `(x - x_i)² + (y - y_i)² <= r_i²` to check if a lattice point `(x, y)` lies within the circle.
    - Use a set to store unique lattice points.

2. **Range Calculation:** For each circle with center `(x_i, y_i)` and radius `r_i`:
    - Iterate `x` from `x_i - r_i` to `x_i + r_i`.
    - For each `x`, iterate `y` from `y_i - r_i` to `y_i + r_i`.
    - Check if `(x, y)` is within the bounds of the circle using the circle equation.

3. **Data Structure:** Use a set to track lattice points because sets do not allow duplicate entries.

## Code
```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countLatticePoints(vector<vector<int>>& circles) {
        unordered_set<string> points;
        
        for (const auto& circle : circles) {
            int x_center = circle[0];
            int y_center = circle[1];
            int radius = circle[2];
            
            for (int x = x_center - radius; x <= x_center + radius; ++x) {
                for (int y = y_center - radius; y <= y_center + radius; ++y) {
                    if ((x - x_center) * (x - x_center) + (y - y_center) * (y - y_center) <= radius * radius) {
                        points.insert(to_string(x) + "," + to_string(y));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return points.size();
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **For each Circle:** We iterate from `(x_center - radius)` to `(x_center + radius)` and similarly for `y`. 
    - This gives us `(2 * radius + 1) * (2 * radius + 1)` iterations per circle in the worst case.
    - If `n` is the number of circles and `r` is the maximum radius among all circles, the worst-case time complexity is `O(n * r^2)`.
   
2. **Overall:** The space complexity is primarily determined by the number of unique lattice points, which in the worst case can be coarsely bounded by `O(r^2)` for each circle.

In summary, our approach should correctly handle up to the provided constraints and find the count of unique lattice points lying inside at least one circle with a moderate complexity.
