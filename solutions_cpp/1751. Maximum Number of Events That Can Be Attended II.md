[Leetcode 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1751)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode 1751: Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. 

You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You need to find and return the maximum sum of values that you can achieve by attending at most `k` events.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **How is the value of each event defined?**
   - Each event has a defined value provided in the input.

2. **Can events overlap?**
   - Yes, events can overlap, but you can only attend one event at any moment.

3. **Can events occur on the same days?**
   - Yes, multiple events can happen on the same days.

4. **What is the range of the values for `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, for LeetCode problems, `n` (number of events) can go up to `10^5` and `k` is generally limited by practical constraints like `10^4`.

### Strategy

**Dynamic Programming Approach**:
1. **Sort Events**: First, sort the events by their end day. This helps because once you attend an event, you'll always look at future events only.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a DP table (`dp[i][j]`) where `i` represents the number of events considered, and `j` represents the maximum number of events attended so far.
3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Event**: Maintain a sorted list of end times and use binary search to find the last non-overlapping event for efficient updating.
4. **State Transition**:
    - Either you attend the ith event or you don't.
    - If you attend the ith event, find the last event that ended before the start day of the ith event using binary search.
    - Use a DP table to store intermediate results in a bottom-up manner.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
    int n = events.size();

    // Sort events by endDay
    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });

    // dp[i][j] will be the max value by attending at most j events from the first i events
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0));

    // To store the end times to do binary search
    vector<int> endTimes(n);
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        endTimes[i] = events[i][1];
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int startDay = events[i-1][0];
        int endDay = events[i-1][1];
        int value = events[i-1][2];

        // Find the last event which ends before the current one starts
        int prev_event_index = lower_bound(endTimes.begin(), endTimes.end(), startDay) - endTimes.begin();
        
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
            // Do not attend the current event
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j]);
            
            // Attend the current event
            if (prev_event_index > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[prev_event_index][j-1] + value);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], value);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting of events.
- **DP Table Population**: `O(n * k)` to fill the DP table.
- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)` for each event during the transition which is nested within the DP population.

Overall time complexity is: `O(n log n + n * k * log n)`

By breaking the steps and clearly defining the transitions, this ensures the solution is both efficient and easy to understand.
