[Leetcode 1962. Remove Stones to Minimize the Total](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1962)
### Problem Statement

You are given a pile of `n` stones and an integer array `piles` where `piles[i]` represents the number of stones in the ith pile. You can remove stones in the following way:

1. Pick any pile of stones and reduce the number of stones in it by half (integer division).

The objective is to minimize the total number of stones after exactly `k` operations.

Return the minimum possible total number of stones after `k` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done if there are multiple piles with the same number of stones?**
   - You can choose any pile but usually the one reduced first will be the largest.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and the elements in `piles`?**
   - The problem usually constrains these within manageable limits for typical computational problems.

### Strategy

1. **Using a Max-Heap**:
   - Since we want to minimize the total number of stones, we should always reduce the largest pile (as reducing it will have the most significant impact).
   - Using a max-heap (or priority queue) allows us to efficiently retrieve the largest element.
   
2. **Steps**:
   - Create a max-heap from the `piles` array.
   - Perform `k` operations where, in each operation:
     - Extract the largest element from the heap.
     - Reduce the number of stones in this pile by half (using integer division).
     - Re-insert the modified value back into the heap.
   - After `k` operations, sum all the elements remaining in the heap to get the total number of stones.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minStoneSum(vector<int>& piles, int k) {
        // Create a max-heap using priority queue
        priority_queue<int> maxHeap(piles.begin(), piles.end());
        
        // Perform k operations
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            int top = maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
            top = top - top / 2;  // Reduce by half
            maxHeap.push(top);
        }
        
        // Calculate the total remaining stones
        int total = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            total += maxHeap.top();
            maxHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return total;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> piles = {5, 4, 9};
    int k = 2;
    
    int result = solution.minStoneSum(piles, k);
    cout << "Minimum possible total stones after " << k << " operations: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Construction**:
  - Building the initial max-heap takes \(O(n)\).

- **Operations**:
  - Each operation involves extracting the maximum element and reinserting it after modification, both of which take \(O(\log n)\).
  - For `k` operations: \(O(k \log n)\).

- **Total Time Complexity**:
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n + k \log n)\).

This ensures that the solution is efficient even for a reasonably large number of piles and operations.
