[Leetcode 1952. Three Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1952)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1952: **Three Divisors**

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   **A:** You can assume that `n` is a positive integer within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

2. **Q:** Can `n` be a composite number?
   **A:** Yes, `n` can be any number within the given range, including prime and composite numbers.

3. **Q:** Should we handle negative numbers or zero?
   **A:** No, `n` is assumed to be a positive integer.

### Strategy

To determine if a number `n` has exactly three divisors, we can make use of the following mathematical insight:

1. A number `n` has exactly three divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number.
   
   - If `n = p^2` where `p` is a prime number, the divisors of `n` will be: 1, `p`, and `p^2`.

Given this, we can follow these steps:
1. First, find the integer square root of `n`. Let's call it `sqrtN`.
2. Check if `sqrtN * sqrtN` equals `n`. If not, `n` cannot have exactly three divisors.
3. Check if `sqrtN` is a prime number. If `sqrtN` is prime, then `n` has exactly three divisors.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isThree(int n) {
        // Step 1: Calculate the integer square root of n
        int sqrtN = static_cast<int>(sqrt(n));
        
        // Step 2: Check if square of sqrtN equals n
        if (sqrtN * sqrtN != n) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Check if sqrtN is a prime number
        return isPrime(sqrtN);
    }
    
private:
    bool isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) return false;
        if (num == 2 || num == 3) return true;
        if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) return false;
        
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
            if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Step 1 (Finding the integer square root)**: This is a constant time operation, `O(1)` because `sqrt` is a mathematical function that operates in constant time.
- **Step 2 (Checking if the square equals `n`)**: This is also a constant time operation, `O(1)`.
- **Step 3 (Checking if the number is prime)**: The time complexity of checking if a number is prime is `O(sqrt(n))` because the loop runs up to `sqrt(n)`.

So the overall time complexity is `O(sqrt(n))`. Given the constraints (n up to 10,000), this is efficient and should perform well within the given limits.
