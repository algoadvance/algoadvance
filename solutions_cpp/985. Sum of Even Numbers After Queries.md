[Leetcode 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l985)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `A` and an array of queries `queries`.

For the `i-th` query `queries[i] = [val, index]`, add `val` to `A[index]`. Then, the answer to the `i-th` query is the sum of the even values in `A`.

Return an array of answers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the `A` array or `queries` array be empty?**
    - Yes, it's possible, return an empty array in such a case.

2. **Are there negative numbers in both `A` and `queries`?**
    - Yes, all integers including negative ones can be present in both `A` and `queries`.

3. **Is the length of `queries` always the same?**
    - Not necessarily, `queries` can vary in size.

4. **Can the value at the index of `A` go out of the integer range?**
    - For the sake of this question, assume the modifications always result in values that fit within the standard integer range.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Even Sum Calculation**: First, calculate the initial sum of even numbers in the array `A`.
2. **Process Queries**: Iterate over each query and:
    - Add the given value to the specified index in `A`.
    - Update the sum of even numbers accordingly:
        - If the original value at the index was even, subtract it from the even sum.
        - Add the value from the query.
        - Check if the updated value at the index is even; if it is, add it to the even sum.
3. **Store Results**: Store the result after processing each query.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumEvenAfterQueries(vector<int>& A, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> result;
        int evenSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate initial sum of even numbers in A
        for (int num : A) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                evenSum += num;
            }
        }
        
        // Process each query
        for (const auto& query : queries) {
            int val = query[0];
            int index = query[1];
            
            // If the original value at A[index] is even, subtract it from evenSum
            if (A[index] % 2 == 0) {
                evenSum -= A[index];
            }
            
            // Add the value from the query to A[index]
            A[index] += val;
            
            // If the updated value at A[index] is even, add it to evenSum
            if (A[index] % 2 == 0) {
                evenSum += A[index];
            }
            
            // Store the current even sum in the result
            result.push_back(evenSum);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Even Sum Calculation**: O(n) where n is the size of `A`.
- **Processing Each Query**: O(1) per query.
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(n + m) where m is the number of queries. This is because we iterate through `A` once to calculate the initial even sum and then process each query in constant time.
