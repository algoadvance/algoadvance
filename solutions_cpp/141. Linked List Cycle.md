[Leetcode 141. Linked List Cycle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l141)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to determine if a linked list has a cycle in it.

Specifically, we need to implement a function:
```cpp
bool hasCycle(ListNode *head);
```

where `ListNode` is defined as:
```cpp
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};
```

The function should return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Should we expect very large linked lists, or could there be edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single node?
2. **Node Values**: Do the values stored in the nodes have any significance for detecting the cycle? Or is it purely about the structure (i.e., the next pointers)?
3. **Modification**: Are we allowed to modify the list nodes (for instance, marking nodes)?

### Strategy

The most efficient way to detect a cycle in a linked list is by using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm), which uses two pointers:

1. **Slow Pointer**: Moves one step at a time.
2. **Fast Pointer**: Moves two steps at a time.

The idea is that if there isn't a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end of the list. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer within the cycle.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the `hasCycle` function using Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return false;

    ListNode *slow = head;
    ListNode *fast = head->next;

    while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;
        }
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, every node is visited once by each of the two pointers.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are not using any extra space that scales with input size, just a constant amount of space for the pointers.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently detects a cycle using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, which is optimal for this type of problem. It ensures that both time and space complexities are adequately managed, making it suitable for large linked lists.
