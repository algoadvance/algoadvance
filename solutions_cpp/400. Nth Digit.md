[Leetcode 400. Nth Digit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l400)
### Problem Statement

Find the `n`th digit of the infinite integer sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of `n`?**
   - `n` is a positive integer and can be very large, within the range `[1, 2^31 - 1]`.

2. **Is there any built-in function usage restriction?**
   - Typically, no specific restriction on built-in functions unless mentioned.

3. **Should the output be a digit (0-9)?**
   - Yes, the result for `n`th digit will always be a single digit from 0 to 9.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the distribution of digits:**
    - Numbers 1-9 contribute 9 digits.
    - Numbers 10-99 contribute 180 digits.
    - Numbers 100-999 contribute 2700 digits.
    - In general, numbers with `d` digits contribute `d * 9 * (10^(d-1))` digits.

2. **Break the Problem in Steps:**
    - Determine the range of numbers where the `n`th digit falls.
    - Find the exact number and digit position within that number.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int findNthDigit(int n) {
        long long len = 1; // number of digits in the current number range
        long long count = 9;
        long long start = 1;

        // Determine the range where the nth digit is
        while (n > len * count) {
            n -= len * count;
            len++;
            count *= 10;
            start *= 10;
        }
        
        // Find the exact number and the digit position
        start += (n - 1) / len;
        std::string num = std::to_string(start);
        return num[(n - 1) % len] - '0'; // Access the exact digit and convert to integer
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 400;
    std::cout << solution.findNthDigit(n) << std::endl; // Output for the given example
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
    - The loop where we determine the length of digits takes logarithmic time because for each digit length increase, the range increases by a factor of 10.
    - Converting a number to string and accessing a digit takes constant time because we are only performing a few operations for each individual length.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
    - Only a few extra variables are used regardless of the size of `n`. The space used for conversion to a string and accessing a character is also constant.
