[Leetcode 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1026)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode's Problem 1026: "Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor" states:

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist different nodes `a` and `b` where `a` is an ancestor of `b` such that `v = |a.val - b.val|`.

A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either `a` is equal to `b` or `a` is in the path from the root to `b`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What constitutes an ancestor?**
   - An ancestor of a node includes all nodes in the path from the root to that node, including the node itself.

2. **Do we consider negative values in nodes?**
   - Yes, nodes can have any integer value.

3. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - According to the problem, the `root` is guaranteed to be a non-null binary tree.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree, maintaining the minimum and maximum values encountered from the root to the current node. At each node, we calculate the potential maximum difference by comparing the current nodeâ€™s value with the minimum and maximum values seen so far.

### Steps:
1. Create a helper function to traverse the tree that receives the current node along with the minimum and maximum values from the root to the current node.
2. At each node, update the minimum and maximum values.
3. Compute the potential maximum difference for the current node as `max_val - min_val`.
4. Recur down the left and right children while passing along the updated minimum and maximum values.
5. Keep track of and return the maximum difference found.

### Time Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree since we visit each node exactly once.
- Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursive call stack. This would be O(log N) for a balanced tree and O(N) for a degenerate (unbalanced) tree.

## Code

```cpp
#include <algorithm> // for std::max, std::min
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, root->val, root->val);
    }

private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int min_val, int max_val) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return max_val - min_val;
        }
        
        min_val = min(min_val, node->val);
        max_val = max(max_val, node->val);
        
        int leftDiff = dfs(node->left, min_val, max_val);
        int rightDiff = dfs(node->right, min_val, max_val);
        
        return max(leftDiff, rightDiff);
    }
};
```

This solution ensures that we traverse each node in the binary tree while keeping track of the minimum and maximum values encountered along the path from the root to the current node, thus finding the maximum difference between an ancestor and a node efficiently.
