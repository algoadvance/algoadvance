[Leetcode 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1770)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are 1-indexed.

You begin with a score of 0. You want to perform precisely `m` operations. On the `i-th` operation (1-indexed), you will:

- Choose one integer `x` from either the start or the end of the array `nums`.
- Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
- Remove `x` from the array `nums`.

Return the maximum score after performing `m` operations.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]
Output: 14
Explanation: An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose `nums[0]`, `multipliers[0]`, score = 3 * 1 = 3.
- Choose `nums[2]`, `multipliers[1]`, score = 3 + 2 * 3 = 9.
- Choose `nums[1]`, `multipliers[2]`, score = 9 + 1 * 2 = 11.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements of `nums` or `multipliers` be negative?
    - Yes, they can be negative.

2. Will the sizes of `nums` and `multipliers` always conform to `n >= m`?
    - Yes, this is guaranteed in the problem statement.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of `n` and `m` (e.g., upper limit)?
    - Typically, LeetCode problems have constraints around size limits, but unless specified otherwise, we can expect `n` and `m` to be within reasonable bounds for typical computational capacity.

4. Can the output be negative?
    - Yes, if the operations result in a negative score, the output can be negative.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score after `i + j` operations, with `i` operations choosing elements from the start of the `nums` array and `j` operations choosing elements from the end of the `nums` array.
   - Initialize the DP table with dimensions `(m+1) x (m+1)`.
   - The state transition will consider choosing the next element either from the start or the end and do the following:
     ```cpp
     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j] + multipliers[i+j-1] * nums[i-1], dp[i][j-1] + multipliers[i+j-1] * nums[n-j]);
     ```

2. **Backtracking**:
   - We could use a recursive function with memoization to handle the choice between the start and the end for each operation.

For this solution, we'll implement a dynamic programming approach which is generally more efficient than a brute-force recursive backtracking with memoization for this kind of problem.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumScore(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& multipliers) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = multipliers.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));
        
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int left = i; left >= 0; --left) {
                int right = i - left;
                dp[left][right] = max(
                    dp[left+1][right] + multipliers[i] * nums[left],
                    dp[left][right+1] + multipliers[i] * nums[n-right-1]
                );
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(m^2)`, as we're filling a DP table of size `m x m`.
- The space complexity is `O(m^2)` for storing the DP table.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum score by considering all possible ways to perform the operations with dynamic programming.
