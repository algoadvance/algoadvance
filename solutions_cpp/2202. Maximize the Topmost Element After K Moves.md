[Leetcode 2202. Maximize the Topmost Element After K Moves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2202)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` representing a stack, where `nums[0]` is the topmost element of the stack.

In one move, you can do one of the following:
- Remove the topmost element of the stack.
- Insert any element from another container on top of the stack.

You are given an integer `k`, the total number of moves to be made.

Return the **maximum** possible value of the topmost element of the stack after exactly `k` moves. In case it is not possible to achieve a valid configuration, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `k` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can the `nums` array be empty?**
   - No, `nums` will have at least one element.

3. **What are the constraints on the length of `nums` and the value of elements in `nums`?**
   - Typically, the length `n` of `nums` will be within a reasonable limit (e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`), and the elements will be within standard integer limits.

### Strategy

The main idea is to consider the following:
1. If `k == 0`, no moves can be done, so the topmost element remains `nums[0]`.
2. If `k == 1`, we can only remove the topmost element, and if `nums` has only one element, the topmost element becomes `undefined` (or -1 in this context).
3. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `nums`, we can consider any element from `nums` since we could potentially remove all elements and possibly reinsert the largest obtainable element.
4. For intermediate values of `k`, we need to consider the possibilities within the first `k` elements (removal operations) and reinsertion.

The goal is to determine the best possible value for the topmost element after exactly `k` moves, considering the mentioned conditions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumTop(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // k == 0: No moves, return the topmost element
        if (k == 0) return nums[0];
        
        // k == 1: Remove the topmost element
        if (k == 1) return (n == 1) ? -1 : nums[1];
        
        if (n == 1) {
            // If k is odd and we have only one element, we can't reach a valid state
            return (k % 2 == 0) ? nums[0] : -1;
        }
        
        int max_val = 0;

        // If k is more than the size of the stack, we can take the maximum of the entire stack
        if (k >= n) {
            max_val = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        } else {
            // Calculate the maximum within the first k-1 elements
            for (int i = 0; i < k-1; ++i) {
                max_val = max(max_val, nums[i]);
            }
            // Also consider the k-th element which will become the topmost after k moves
            if (k < n) {
                max_val = max(max_val, nums[k]);
            }
        }
        return max_val;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is `O(min(k, n))`, where `k` is the number of moves and `n` is the size of the `nums` array. This is because, in the worst case, we only need to traverse up to `k-1` elements of the array and find the maximum among them and the `k`-th element if it exists.
