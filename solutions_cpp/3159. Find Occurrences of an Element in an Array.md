[Leetcode 3159. Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3159)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Write a function `occurrences` that returns the number of times `target` appears in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of values for `nums` and `target`?
   - What is the length of the array `nums`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the result be returned as an integer indicating the number of occurrences of `target` in `nums`?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should the function handle an empty array, i.e., `nums` is `[]`?
   - What if `target` is not present in `nums`?

Assuming the array can contain negative, zero, and positive integers, and the length of the array can vary from 0 to 100,000.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we simply need to iterate through the array and count the number of times `target` appears. 

1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Traverse through each element in the array `nums`.
3. Increment the counter each time the current element equals `target`.
4. Return the counter after the loop finishes.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we need to traverse the entire array once.

## Code

Here's the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int occurrences(const vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5};
//     int target = 2;
//     int result = occurrences(nums, target);
//     // Output should be 3
//     return 0;
// }
```

This function takes a vector of integers `nums` and an integer `target` and returns the number of times `target` appears in `nums`. The main function is provided as an example, demonstrating how to use the `occurrences` function.
