[Leetcode 1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1361)
### Problem Statement
Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and two integer arrays `leftChild` and `rightChild`, where `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]` denote the left and right child of the `i-th` node in the tree, respectively, you need to determine if the nodes form a valid binary tree.

A binary tree is a tree data structure (without cycles) where one node is the root node and all other nodes are its descendants.

- `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- `leftChild` and `rightChild` are arrays of size `n`.
- `leftChild[i]` will be equal to `-1` if there is no left child.
- `rightChild[i]` will be equal to `-1` if there is no right child.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the arrays `leftChild` and `rightChild` contain values other than `-1` and indices from `0` to `n-1`?**
   No, they will contain only these values.
   
2. **Is `n` guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   Yes, `n` is non-negative.

3. **Is the input tree guaranteed to be a binary tree (node has at most two children)?**
   Yes, the problem guarantees a binary tree structure with the given constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Check for Cycles and Multiple Parents**:
   - For a binary tree to be valid, each node except the root must have exactly one parent and must not form cycles.

2. **Determine Root**:
   - In a valid tree, there must be exactly one root node (the node with no parent).
   
3. **Validate Connectivity**:
   - Ensure that all nodes are reachable starting from the root node.

### Validation Steps
1. **Parent Count Array**:
   - Maintain a parent count array to ensure each node has at most one parent.
   
2. **Root Determination**:
   - A valid tree must have exactly one node with zero parents.
   
3. **DFS/BFS from Root**:
   - Check if all nodes can be visited starting from the root.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The algorithm traverses each node once and performs constant-time operations for each node (such as updating arrays and visiting nodes).

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

class Solution {
public:
    bool validateBinaryTreeNodes(int n, std::vector<int>& leftChild, std::vector<int>& rightChild) {
        std::vector<int> parentCount(n, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (leftChild[i] != -1) {
                parentCount[leftChild[i]]++;
            }
            if (rightChild[i] != -1) {
                parentCount[rightChild[i]]++;
            }
        }

        // Find the root (node with 0 parents)
        int rootCount = 0;
        int root = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (parentCount[i] == 0) {
                rootCount++;
                root = i;
            }
        }

        // It must have exactly one root
        if (rootCount != 1) return false;

        // Check if there are any cycles and all nodes are connected
        std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        std::queue<int> q;
        q.push(root);
        visited[root] = true;

        int visitedCount = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            visitedCount++;

            if (leftChild[node] != -1) {
                if (visited[leftChild[node]]) {
                    return false;
                }
                visited[leftChild[node]] = true;
                q.push(leftChild[node]);
            }

            if (rightChild[node] != -1) {
                if (visited[rightChild[node]]) {
                    return false;
                }
                visited[rightChild[node]] = true;
                q.push(rightChild[node]);
            }
        }

        // All nodes should be visited
        return visitedCount == n;
    }
};
```

This code follows the outlined strategy closely, ensuring that it validates the binary tree according to the given criteria.
