[Leetcode 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l990)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `equations` that represent relationships between variables, where each string `equations[i]` is of length 4 and takes one of two possible forms: `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`. Here, `"a==b"` means that `a` is equal to `b`, and `"a!=b"` means that `a` is not equal to `b`. Each `equations[i]` consists of lowercase letters (a-z), and the variables `a` and `b` are single lowercase letters.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to assign values to the variables such that all the given equations are satisfied.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Scope of Characters**:
   - Are variable names limited to single lowercase English letters?
     - Yes, the variables `a` and `b` are single lowercase letters, so there are only 26 possible variables.

2. **Length of Input**:
   - Is there a specified maximum number of equations?
     - The problem does not specify a particular maximum, but the constraints will generally be manageable within a standard competitive programming context, such as a few thousand relations.

### Strategy

#### Union-Find Algorithm
We will use the Union-Find (or Disjoint Set Union - DSU) data structure to determine the satisfiability of the equations. The key idea is to:

1. **Union Operation for "==" Equations**:
   - For each equation of the form `"a==b"`, perform a union operation to merge the sets containing `a` and `b`.

2. **Find/Check Operation for "!=" Equations**:
   - For each equation of the form `"a!=b"`, check if `a` and `b` belong to the same set. If they do, it's impossible to satisfy the equation, and we return `False`.

3. **Components Handling**:
   - Initially, each variable is its own set.
   - Use path compression and union by rank to optimize the union-find operations.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    bool equationsPossible(std::vector<std::string>& equations) {
        std::vector<int> parent(26);
        // Initialize each parent to itself
        std::iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
        
        // Helper function to find the root of a variable
        auto find = [&](int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
            }
            return parent[x];
        };
        
        // Union operation
        auto unite = [&](int x, int y) {
            parent[find(x)] = find(y);
        };
        
        // First pass: process all "==" equations
        for (const auto& eq : equations) {
            if (eq[1] == '=') {
                int var1 = eq[0] - 'a';
                int var2 = eq[3] - 'a';
                unite(var1, var2);
            }
        }
        
        // Second pass: check all "!=" equations
        for (const auto& eq : equations) {
            if (eq[1] == '!') {
                int var1 = eq[0] - 'a';
                int var2 = eq[3] - 'a';
                if (find(var1) == find(var2)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-find Operations**: The union-find operations are very efficient with the use of path compression and union by rank. Each operation is nearly constant time, i.e., O(α(N)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very slow-growing.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity for processing all the equations remains efficient at O(N), where N is the number of equations.

### Explanation

1. **Initialize the Union-Find Structure**: Each variable is initially its own representative.
2. **Handle "==" Equations**: For each equality equation, perform the union operation on the involved variables.
3. **Handle "!=" Equations**: For each inequality equation, check if the variables are in the same set. If they are, return `false`.

By using this approach, we ensure that both types of constraints are efficiently processed and verified.
