[Leetcode 125. Valid Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l125)
### Problem Statement:
The given problem is from LeetCode, and it's numbered 125. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example:
- Input: `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
- Output: `true`

- Input: `s = "race a car"`
- Output: `false`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, an empty string or a string with only non-alphanumeric characters should be considered a valid palindrome.

2. **Is the case of the characters important when checking for a palindrome?**
   - No, the case is not important. We should treat 'A' and 'a' as the same character.

3. **Should spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters be ignored?**
   - Yes, we should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters.

### Strategy:
1. **Clean the string:**
   - Iterate through the given string and build a new string that consists only of alphanumeric characters, converting them to lowercase.

2. **Check for palindrome:**
   - Use two-pointer technique to check if the cleaned string is a palindrome. One pointer will start from the beginning (`left`) and the other from the end (`right`).
   - Compare characters at `left` and `right` indices, and move the pointers towards the center.
   - If at any point characters at `left` and `right` indices do not match, return `false`.
   - If the loop completes without mismatches, return `true`.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>  // for isalnum and tolower

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(std::string s) {
        std::string cleaned;
        
        // Build the cleaned version of the string
        for (char c : s) {
            if (std::isalnum(c)) {
                cleaned += std::tolower(c);
            }
        }
        
        // Use two-pointer technique to check palindrome
        int left = 0, right = cleaned.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (cleaned[left] != cleaned[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            ++left;
            --right;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::string test1 = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama";
    std::string test2 = "race a car";
    
    std::cout << std::boolalpha;
    std::cout << "Test 1: " << solution.isPalindrome(test1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Test 2: " << solution.isPalindrome(test2) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Cleaning the string:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string once to build the cleaned string.
- **Checking for palindrome:** O(m), where m is the length of the cleaned string (m â‰¤ n). We use two pointers to check the cleaned string.

Overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
