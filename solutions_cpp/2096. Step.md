[Leetcode 2096. Step](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2096)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node is uniquely numbered from `1` to `n`. Additionally, you are given two integers, `startValue` and `destValue`, which represent the values of two different nodes present in the tree.

Find the directions from the node with value `startValue` to the node with value `destValue`. The directions should be represented using the characters 'L' (left) and 'R' (right), where 'L' means to go left and 'R' means to go right.

Return the string representing the directions from the node with value `startValue` to the node with value `destValue`.

### Example:
- Given a binary tree with nodes [5, 1, 2, 3, null, 6, 4], `startValue` = 3, `destValue` = 6.
- The directions should be "UURL".

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that `startValue` and `destValue` both exist in the tree?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, they both are present in the tree.
   
2. **What should be the output if `startValue` is the same as `destValue`?**
   - The output should be an empty string since no movement is required.
   
3. **Can there be duplicate values in the tree?**
   - No, the values are unique as stated in the problem.

## Strategy

1. **Locate the Nodes**: We need to first find the paths from the root to both `startValue` and `destValue`.
2. **Common Ancestor**: Determine the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the nodes containing `startValue` and `destValue`.
3. **Construct Paths**:
    - Construct the path from `startValue` to the LCA.
    - Construct the path from the LCA to `destValue`.
4. **Convert to Directions**: Convert the resultant paths:
    - From `startValue` node to the LCA, the path must be reversed and each step converted to 'U' (up).
    - From LCA to `destValue`, just convert the path to directions ('L', 'R').

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

// Util function to find the path from root to the given node.
bool findPath(TreeNode* root, int value, string& path) {
    if (!root) return false;
    if (root->val == value) return true;
    path.push_back('L');
    if (findPath(root->left, value, path)) return true;
    path.pop_back();
    path.push_back('R');
    if (findPath(root->right, value, path)) return true;
    path.pop_back();
    return false;
}

string getDirections(TreeNode* root, int startValue, int destValue) {
    string pathToStart, pathToDest;

    // Find path from root to startValue
    findPath(root, startValue, pathToStart);
    // Find path from root to destValue
    findPath(root, destValue, pathToDest);

    // Find the common part of the path (i.e., until the LCA node)
    int i = 0;
    while (i < pathToStart.size() && i < pathToDest.size() && pathToStart[i] == pathToDest[i]) {
        i++;
    }
    
    // Steps to move up from startValue to LCA
    string moveUp(pathToStart.size() - i, 'U');
    // Steps to move down from LCA to destValue
    string moveDown = pathToDest.substr(i);
    
    return moveUp + moveDown;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(4);
    
    int startValue = 3;
    int destValue = 6;
    
    string result = getDirections(root, startValue, destValue);
    cout << "Directions: " << result << endl; // Should print "UURL"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding paths**: Each path finding operation takes O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- **Total Complexity**: O(n) for finding both paths (path to `startValue` and path to `destValue`) and then comparing them.

The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n).
