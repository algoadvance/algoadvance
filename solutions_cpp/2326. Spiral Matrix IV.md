[Leetcode 2326. Spiral Matrix IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2326)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2326: Spiral Matrix IV

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing the size of an `m x n` matrix, two integers `head` representing the head of a linked list, where `head` is the first node in a singly-linked list containing `m*n` nodes.

You need to fill an `m x n` matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner, following the sequence of the linked list. Return the 2D matrix.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should I do if the linked list has more or fewer nodes than `m * n`?**
   - **Clarification:** The length of the linked list is exactly `m * n`.

2. **Do we need to handle any special edge cases (e.g., `m` or `n` being zero)?**
   - **Clarification:** You can assume `m` and `n` are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a 2D vector `matrix` of size `m x n` initialized with `0`.
   - Define boundaries for the spiral traversal (top, bottom, left, right).

2. **Traverse Linked List:**
   - Using a pointer, traverse the linked list, inserting each node's value into the `matrix` in spiral order.

3. **Spiral Order Insertion:**
   - Start from `(0, 0)` and keep moving in the right, down, left, and up directions.
   - Adjust the boundaries after completing each direction.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

std::vector<std::vector<int>> spiralMatrix(int m, int n, ListNode* head) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix(m, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
    int top = 0, bottom = m - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    ListNode* current = head;
    
    while (current != nullptr) {
        // Traverse from left to right.
        for (int j = left; j <= right && current != nullptr; ++j) {
            matrix[top][j] = current->val;
            current = current->next;
        }
        ++top;
        
        // Traverse from top to bottom.
        for (int i = top; i <= bottom && current != nullptr; ++i) {
            matrix[i][right] = current->val;
            current = current->next;
        }
        --right;
        
        // Traverse from right to left.
        for (int j = right; j >= left && current != nullptr; --j) {
            matrix[bottom][j] = current->val;
            current = current->next;
        }
        --bottom;
        
        // Traverse from bottom to top.
        for (int i = bottom; i >= top && current != nullptr; --i) {
            matrix[i][left] = current->val;
            current = current->next;
        }
        ++left;
    }
    
    return matrix;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)**, as we process each node of the linked list exactly once and each cell of the matrix exactly once.

- **Initialization**: Creating a matrix of size `m x n` takes **O(m*n)**.
- **Traversal and Insertion**: Processing `m*n` elements in spiral order takes **O(m*n)**.

Thus, the combined time complexity is **O(m*n)**.
