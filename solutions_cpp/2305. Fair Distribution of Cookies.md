[Leetcode 2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2305)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the i-th bag. There are `k` children that you need to distribute all the bags of cookies to such that the unfairness is minimized. 

Unfairness is defined as the maximum total cookies obtained by any child. Return the minimum possible unfairness.

**Example:**
```
Input: cookies = [8, 15, 10, 20, 8], k = 2
Output: 31
Explanation: 
There are multiple ways to distribute the cookies to 2 children.
In this case, the minimum unfairness is achieved by distributing as follows:
- 1st child gets [15, 8] → 15 + 8 = 23
- 2nd child gets [10, 20, 8] → 10 + 20 + 8 = 38
The maximum cookies obtained by any child is 38. Thus, the unfairness is 38.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the number of cookies in each bag be zero or negative?**
   - No, the number of cookies in each bag will be a positive integer.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that `k` is always less than or equal to the length of `cookies` array?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that `k` ≤ `cookies.length`.

3. **Is it possible to distribute cookies unevenly among children?**
   - Yes, the distribution does not need to be even as long as it minimizes the unfairness.

### Strategy
1. **Generate all possible distributions:** We can use a recursive backtracking approach to generate all possible ways to distribute the cookies among the `k` children.
2. **Evaluate each distribution:** For each distribution, compute the "unfairness" by finding the maximum number of cookies any child gets.
3. **Track minimum unfairness:** Keep track of the minimum unfairness observed during the exploration of all possible distributions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCookies(vector<int>& cookies, int k) {
        // Initialize children buckets 
        vector<int> children(k, 0);
        int minUnfair = INT_MAX; // Initialize to a large value

        // Recursively distribute cookies
        distribute(cookies, children, 0, minUnfair);
        
        return minUnfair;
    }

private:
    void distribute(const vector<int>& cookies, vector<int>& children, int bag, int& minUnfair) {
        // If we have assigned all bags, check the maximum allocation among children
        if (bag == cookies.size()) {
            int currentUnfair = *max_element(children.begin(), children.end());
            minUnfair = min(minUnfair, currentUnfair);
            return;
        }

        // Try giving the current bag to each child
        for (int i = 0; i < children.size(); i++) {
            children[i] += cookies[bag];
            distribute(cookies, children, bag + 1, minUnfair);
            children[i] -= cookies[bag]; // Backtrack
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The recursive approach tries every possible distribution of bags among children, which gives a complexity of \(O(k^n)\), where `n` is the number of bags (`cookies.size()`) and `k` is the number of children.
- In the worst-case scenario, this can be very slow for large values of `n` and `k`. However, given the constraints this kind of brute force approach will work effectively for smaller input sizes, which are common in competitive programming problems.
