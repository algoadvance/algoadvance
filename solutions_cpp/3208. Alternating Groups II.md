[Leetcode 3208. Alternating Groups II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3208)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of `n` integers, the task is to rearrange the elements in such a way that every positive odd number is followed by an even number (if it exists) and all the positive even numbers are grouped together at the end of the array, maintaining their relative order. For example, if the input array is `[3, 6, 8, 9, 7, 2]`, the output should be `[3, 6, 9, 2, 8, 7]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Nature of Input**:
   - Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - Are the input numbers guaranteed to be integers?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the new order preserve the relative order of odd and even numbers?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should we handle an array with all odd numbers or all even numbers?
   - What is expected if the array is empty?

Typically, unless otherwise specified, it's reasonable to assume that:
- The array can contain both positive and negative integers.
- The order of numbers should be preserved as much as possible within the constraints provided.
- The array may be empty or contain all odd or even numbers.

## Strategy

Once the requirements are clarified, the following strategy can be applied:

1. **Filtering and Separation**:
   - Separate the odd and even numbers.
   - Store the odds and evens in different vectors.

2. **Reorganizing**:
   - Iterate over the odd numbers and attempt to pair each odd number with the next even number.
   - If there are more odd numbers than even ones, place the remaining odd numbers following all pairs.
   - Append any remaining even numbers that were not paired.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> alternatingGroupsIIOut(vector<int> &arr) {
    vector<int> odds;
    vector<int> evens;
    
    // Separate the array into odds and evens
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            evens.push_back(num);
        } else {
            odds.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> result;
    size_t i = 0, j = 0;
    
    // Pair odd and even numbers
    while (i < odds.size() && j < evens.size()) {
        result.push_back(odds[i++]);
        result.push_back(evens[j++]);
    }
    
    // Add remaining odd numbers if any
    while (i < odds.size()) {
        result.push_back(odds[i++]);
    }
    
    // Add remaining even numbers if any
    while (j < evens.size()) {
        result.push_back(evens[j++]);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {3, 6, 8, 9, 7, 2};
    vector<int> result = alternatingGroupsIIOut(arr);
    for (int num : result) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Separating the Numbers**: O(n), where n is the size of the array, since we are doing a single pass to classify each number as odd or even.
- **Reorganizing the Numbers**: O(n), since both merging the odd and even numbers back into the result and the subsequent insertion of remaining odds or evens are linear operations.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n) with respect to the number of elements in the input array.
