[Leetcode 1793. Maximum Score of a Good Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1793)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` (0-indexed) and an integer `k`, where `0 <= k < nums.length`.

A **good subarray** is a subarray that contains the index `k`.

Return the maximum possible score of a good subarray. The score of a subarray `(i, j)` is defined as `min(nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[j]) * (j - i + 1)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What guarantees are there regarding the array size?**
   - The array size is denoted by `n`, where `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

2. **What are the constraints on the array elements?**
   - The elements in the array `nums` are integers in the range `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^4`.

3. **Are there any particular edge cases we should consider?**
   - The smallest possible array (n=1).
   - The scenarios where the array has uniform values.
   
### Strategy

We need a strategy to explore subarrays that contain the element at index `k`. Let's break down the algorithm:

1. **Initialize the starting point:**
   - Start with a window containing only the element at index `k`. Initialize the minimum element within this window to `nums[k]` and calculate the initial score, which is `nums[k]`.

2. **Expand the window outward:**
   - Use two pointers (left and right) starting at index `k`.
   - Gradually widen the window by either decrementing `left` or incrementing `right`, based on which side has a higher element to maximize the score.
   - Update the minimum element within the current window.
   - Continuously calculate the score (`current_min * (right - left + 1)`) and keep track of the maximum score observed.

3. **Termination:**
   - Stop expanding when the window encompasses the entire array.
   
### Code

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumScore(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int left = k, right = k;
    int current_min = nums[k];
    int max_score = current_min;

    while (left > 0 || right < n - 1) {
        // Expand the window by choosing the side with the larger element
        if (left > 0 && (right == n - 1 || nums[left - 1] > nums[right + 1])) {
            left--;
            current_min = std::min(current_min, nums[left]);
        } else {
            right++;
            current_min = std::min(current_min, nums[right]);
        }
        max_score = std::max(max_score, current_min * (right - left + 1));
    }
    
    return max_score;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` array. This is because each element is considered at most twice (once for extending to the left and once for extending to the right).
  
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, O(1), as it only uses a few additional variables regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the maximum score while maintaining acceptable performance for large input sizes.
