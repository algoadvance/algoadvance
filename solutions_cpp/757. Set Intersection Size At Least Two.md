[Leetcode 757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l757)
### Problem Statement

Given a set of intervals, find an integer S such that for every interval [a, b], there are at least two elements from S that lie within the interval. The goal is to find the smallest possible size for set S.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can intervals be negative, and will they always be integers?
   - Is it safe to assume that the given intervals are valid (i.e., the start of the interval is always less than or equal to its end)?
   - How large can the input size be (both the number of intervals and the range of values within the intervals)?

2. **Output Format**:
   - Are we required to return the actual set S, or just its size?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be the result if there are no intervals?
   - What if an interval spans only one point (i.e., [a, a])?

### Strategy

To tackle this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm with the following approach:

1. **Sort Intervals**: 
   - First, sort the intervals by their end points. If two intervals have the same end point, use the start point to decide the order (sort by end point first and start point second).

2. **Initialize Set S**:
   - We'll keep two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, to keep track of the two largest elements in our set that are part of the intervals.

3. **Iteratively Build the Set**:
   - Iterate through each interval:
     - If both `p1` and `p2` (the largest two elements so far) do not satisfy the new interval, add the two largest possible numbers within the interval.
     - If only one number (`p2`) is in the interval, add one more number to extend the set S.

The target is to make sure that for each interval, we have at least two elements from S that lie within the interval.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int intersectionSizeTwo(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& intervals) {
    // Sort intervals by their end points, and by their start points if the end points are the same
    std::sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] == b[1] ? a[0] > b[0] : a[1] < b[1];
    });
    
    int n = intervals.size();
    int p1 = intervals[0][1] - 1;
    int p2 = intervals[0][1];
    int result = 2;  // Start with two elements for the first interval
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        bool p1_in = intervals[i][0] <= p1;
        bool p2_in = intervals[i][0] <= p2;
        
        if (p1_in && p2_in) continue;            // Both p1 and p2 are valid, do nothing
        else if (p1_in) {                        // Only p1 is valid, we need one more element
            p2 = intervals[i][1];
            result += 1;
        } else {                                 // Both p1 and p2 are not valid, we need two more elements
            p1 = intervals[i][1] - 1;
            p2 = intervals[i][1];
            result += 2;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where n is the number of intervals.
- **Iteration**: `O(n)`, as we are iterating through the intervals once.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity

- Given that we are mainly using a constant amount of additional space (apart from the space needed to store the input), the space complexity is `O(1)`.
