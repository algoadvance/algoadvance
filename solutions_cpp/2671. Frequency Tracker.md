[Leetcode 2671. Frequency Tracker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2671)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` which contains lowercase letters only. You need to implement a class `FrequencyTracker` that supports the following methods:

1. `add(char c)`: Adds the character `c` to the string.
2. `deleteOne(char c)`: Deletes one occurrence of the character `c` from the string, if it exists.
3. `hasFrequency(int frequency)`: Checks if there is any character in the string that appears exactly `frequency` times.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the string or the number of operations?
   **A:** The length of the string and the number of operations can be up to 100,000.
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned by the method `hasFrequency`?
   **A:** The method should return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

3. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that the `char c` in `add` and `deleteOne` methods are always lowercase letters?
   **A:** Yes, only lowercase letters are used.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a `unordered_map<char, int>` to keep track of frequencies of each character.
   - Use another `unordered_map<int, int>` to keep track of the number of characters that appear exactly `k` times.

2. **Methods**:
   - **add(c)**: Increment the frequency of `c` in the first map and update the second map accordingly.
   - **deleteOne(c)**: Decrement the frequency of `c` if it is greater than 0 and update the second map accordingly.
   - **hasFrequency(k)**: Directly check in the second map if any character has the frequency `k`.

### Code
Let's implement the `FrequencyTracker` class in C++:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>

class FrequencyTracker {
private:
    std::unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
    std::unordered_map<int, int> freqCount;

public:
    FrequencyTracker() {}
    
    void add(char c) {
        if (charCount.find(c) != charCount.end()) {
            int oldFreq = charCount[c];
            freqCount[oldFreq]--;
            if (freqCount[oldFreq] == 0) {
                freqCount.erase(oldFreq);
            }
            charCount[c]++;
            freqCount[charCount[c]]++;
        } else {
            charCount[c] = 1;
            freqCount[1]++;
        }
    }
    
    void deleteOne(char c) {
        if (charCount.find(c) != charCount.end()) {
            int oldFreq = charCount[c];
            freqCount[oldFreq]--;
            if (freqCount[oldFreq] == 0) {
                freqCount.erase(oldFreq);
            }
            if (oldFreq == 1) {
                charCount.erase(c);
            } else {
                charCount[c]--;
                freqCount[charCount[c]]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    bool hasFrequency(int frequency) {
        return freqCount.find(frequency) != freqCount.end();
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. `add(char c)`: O(1)
   - Access and update the maps take constant time.
   
2. `deleteOne(char c)`: O(1)
   - Access and update the maps take constant time.
   
3. `hasFrequency(int frequency)`: O(1)
   - Accessing the map to check if the frequency exists takes constant time.

This approach ensures all operations (`add`, `deleteOne`, and `hasFrequency`) perform in constant time, making the solution efficient and suitable for large inputs.
