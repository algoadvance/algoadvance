[Leetcode 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1317)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1317: Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No-Zero Integers

Given an integer `n`. You need to find two integers `a` and `b` such that:

1. `a` + `b` == `n`
2. `a` * `b` > 0 (both `a` and `b` must be positive)
3. Neither `a` nor `b` contains any zero digits.

Return the two integers in the form of an array `[a, b]`. There may be multiple valid solutions. You can return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be negative?**
   - The problem statement implies `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Are there constraints on `n`?**
   - Constraints are typically present in the full problem statement on LeetCode but are usually positive integers up to a given limit.

3. **What should we do if no valid pair exists?**
   - In this problem, there will always be at least one valid pair for positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Incremental Search**:
   - Start with the smallest possible pairs.
   - Increment one of the numbers while decrementing the other to keep the sum constant.

2. **No-Zero Check**:
   - A utility function to check if a number contains any zero digits.

### Time Complexity

The algorithm will primarily involve iterating through the numbers up to `n`, making the time complexity approximately O(n), but since we find a solution quickly, it is often much faster.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Function to check if a number contains any zero digits
bool hasZero(int num) {
    while (num > 0) {
        if (num % 10 == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        num /= 10;
    }
    return false;
}

std::vector<int> getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
    for (int a = 1; a < n; ++a) {
        int b = n - a;
        if (!hasZero(a) && !hasZero(b)) {
            return {a, b};
        }
    }
    return {}; // Should never reach here for valid positive n.
}
```

### Explanation

1. **hasZero Function**:
   - We define a utility function, `hasZero`, to check if a given integer contains the digit '0'.

2. **getNoZeroIntegers Function**:
   - We loop through all values of `a` starting from `1` to `n-1`.
   - For each value of `a`, compute `b` as `n - a`.
   - We then check if both `a` and `b` do not contain the digit '0' using the `hasZero` function.
   - If both numbers are valid, we return them as a vector.

This approach ensures that we find a valid pair `{a, b}` that meet the criteria, with reasonable efficiency given the constraints of the problem.
