[Leetcode 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1000)
## Problem Statement
**1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones**

There are `N` piles of stones arranged in a row. The `i-th` pile has `stones[i]` stones. A move consists of merging `K` consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `K` piles.

Find the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 2
Output: 20
Explanation:
We start with [3, 2, 4, 1].
We merge [3, 2] for a cost of 5, and we are left with [5, 4, 1].
We merge [5, 4] for a cost of 9, and we are left with [9, 1].
We merge [9, 1] for a cost of 10, and we are left with [10].
The total cost was 5 + 9 + 10 = 24.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: stones = [3,2,4,1], K = 3
Output: -1
Explanation:
After any merge, we will be left with [9, 1, 4] or some other permutation where the number of piles is outside the multiple of 3 and thus not possible to merge further.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
- `2 <= K <= 30`
- `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed that it's always possible to merge all the stones?**
   - No, it is not guaranteed. We need to check if the merging process is feasible.
 
2. **Should we also consider partially merging if the total merging of K piles is not possible throughout the entire process?**
   - No, the problem statement requires us to merge until only one pile is left.

3. **Do we need to return the minimal possible cost, or just if it is possible to merge?**
   - We need to return the minimal possible cost or `-1` if it's not possible to merge into one pile.

## Strategy
We'll use dynamic programming to solve the problem. To do so, we would:
1. Determine the feasibility of merging the stones entirely into one pile.
2. Use a DP table `dp[i][j]` representing the minimal cost to merge stones from pile `i` to `j`.
3. Define another DP table `prefix_sum` to store the prefix sums to easily calculate the sum of any subarray.

The dynamic programming recurrence relation can be stated as:
- `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][m] + dp[m+1][j]) + sum(stones[i] to stones[j])` over all valid partitions `m`.

The goal is to fill this DP table and obtain the value at `dp[0][n-1]` where `n` is the length of the stones array.

We'll also need a complexity check:
- Time Complexity: O(n^3) (due to three nested loops for filling up the DP table)
- Space Complexity: O(n^2) (storing the DP table)

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int mergeStones(vector<int>& stones, int K) {
        int n = stones.size();

        if ((n - 1) % (K - 1) != 0) return -1;

        vector<int> prefix_sum(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + stones[i];
        }

        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int length = K; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                for (int mid = i; mid < j; mid += (K - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][mid] + dp[mid + 1][j]);
                }
                if ((j - i) % (K - 1) == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] += prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(n^3) due to the three nested loops for determining the minimum cost for each dynamic programming state.
- Space Complexity: O(n^2) for storing the DP table and prefix sums.
