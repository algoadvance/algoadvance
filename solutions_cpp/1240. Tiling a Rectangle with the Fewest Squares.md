[Leetcode 1240. Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1240)
### Problem Statement

Given a rectangle with dimensions `n x m`, the task is to tile the entire rectangle using the fewest number of square tiles. The sizes of these square tiles can vary, but they must be of integer dimensions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are `n` and `m` guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Should we handle the case when `n` equals `m` as a special case?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the program return the minimum number of square tiles, or do you need the tiles' dimensions as well?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function behave if one of the dimensions is much larger than the other (e.g., `n` is significantly larger than `m`)?

For now, I'll assume `n` and `m` are always positive integers and that we only need to return the minimum number of squares.

### Strategy

This is a classic problem that might be optimally solved using dynamic programming and/or backtracking approaches:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of squares needed to tile a rectangle of dimensions `i x j`.
   - Base Case: If the rectangle is actually a square (`i == j`), then only one square is needed, so `dp[i][i] = 1`.
   - Recurrence Relation: For each rectangle `i x j`, consider every possible square size `k x k` where `k` is the length of the biggest square fitting in `i x j`. Evaluate the configurations formed by placing the square in different positions and recursively solve for the resulting smaller rectangles.

2. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - A brute-force way of trying every possible placement of the squares and counting the number of squares used. However, this might not be efficient for larger inputs.

### Code

Here's an implementation using the dynamic programming approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int tilingRectangle(int n, int m) {
        if (n == m) return 1;
        
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(m + 1, INT_MAX));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
                if (i == j) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                    continue;
                }
                
                for (int k = 1; k <= std::min(i, j); ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i - k][j] + dp[k][j - k] + dp[i - k][k]);
                    dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - k] + dp[i - k][k] + dp[k][j - k]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][m];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this dynamic programming solution is \(O(n^2 \times m^2)\), as we are potentially evaluating each subproblem multiple times within nested loops.

### Explanation & Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D vector `dp` of size `(n+1) x (m+1)` to store the minimum number of squares for each subproblem.
   - Initialize with `INT_MAX` to signify that the value needs computation.
   
2. **Base Case:**
   - If the dimensions are a square (`i == j`), only one square is needed (`dp[i][i] = 1`).

3. **Filling DP Table:**
   - For each rectangle dimension `i x j`, try all possible square sizes `k x k` that can fit within `i x j`.
   - Use recurrence relations to compute `dp[i][j]` by considering optimal placements and subproblems.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return `dp[n][m]` which holds the minimum squares needed for the entire rectangle.

This is an efficient approach for the given problem constraints and effectively reduces the complexity through dynamic programming.
