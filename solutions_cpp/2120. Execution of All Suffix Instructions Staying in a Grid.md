[Leetcode 2120. Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2120)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a game with a grid of size `n x n` and an initial starting position `startPos` (given as `[startPosRow, startPosCol]`). You have a series of instructions represented by a string `s` where each character corresponds to a move in the grid (`'L'`, `'R'`, `'U'`, or `'D'` which stand for left, right, up, and down respectively).

You need to determine how many moves can be executed starting from each instruction in the string such that the player will not move out of the grid boundaries. Return an array of the number of executed instructions for each suffix of the string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Boundaries:** What are the boundaries of the grid? 
   - The grid is 0-indexed with boundaries ranging from 0 to n-1 both inclusive.

2. **Instructions:** What do the instructions look like?
   - 'L' means move left (column decreases)
   - 'R' means move right (column increases)
   - 'U' means move up (row decreases)
   - 'D' means move down (row increases)

3. **Starting Position:** What is the format of the starting position?
   - The starting position is given as `[startPosRow, startPosCol]`. This is always within the grid bounds.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each suffix of `s`:** For each starting point in the string `s`, simulate the movement to count how many steps can be taken without going out of the grid boundaries.
2. **Simulate Movements:** For each instruction, update the position accordingly, and if it goes outside the grid, break the loop. 
3. **Aggregate Results:** Collect results for each suffix and return them as an array.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> executeInstructions(int n, std::vector<int>& startPos, std::string s) {
    std::vector<int> result(s.size(), 0);
    int row, col;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        row = startPos[0];
        col = startPos[1];
        int steps = 0;
        
        for (int j = i; j < s.size(); ++j) {
            if (s[j] == 'L') {
                --col;
            } else if (s[j] == 'R') {
                ++col;
            } else if (s[j] == 'U') {
                --row;
            } else if (s[j] == 'D') {
                ++row;
            }
            
            if (row < 0 || row >= n || col < 0 || col >= n) {
                break;
            }
            
            ++steps;
        }
        
        result[i] = steps;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m^2)\), where \(m\) is the length of the instruction string `s`.

- **Outer Loop:** Iterates over each starting position in the instruction string, i.e., \(m\) iterations.
- **Inner Loop:** For each starting position, potentially iterates through the remaining instructions in the string, leading to roughly \(O(m + (m-1) + (m-2) + ... + 1) = O(m(m+1)/2) = O(m^2)\).

While there might be more optimal solutions using memoization or other advanced techniques, this solution is straightforward and easy to understand for interview settings.
