[Leetcode 706. Design HashMap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l706)
### Problem Statement
Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries. Implement the following functions:
- `MyHashMap()`: Initializes the object.
- `void put(int key, int value)`: Inserts a key-value pair into the HashMap. If the key already exists in the HashMap, update the corresponding value.
- `int get(int key)`: Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
- `void remove(int key)`: Removes the key and its corresponding value if the map contains the mapping for the key.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of keys and values:** What are the possible ranges for keys and values?
   - Typically, we consider the range as `0 <= key, value <= 1,000,000` for this problem.

2. **Collision handling:** How should we handle collisions?
   - We can use separate chaining (linked lists) to resolve collisions.

3. **Capacity and Space complexity:** Do we need to handle dynamic resizing of the underlying storage?
   - For simplicity, a fixed size of the array (e.g., `10000`) can be used, assuming it as reasonably large enough and not requiring dynamic resizing.

### Strategy
1. **Hash Function:** Use a simple modulo operation for the hash function: `hash = key % capacity`.
2. **Storing Collisions:** Use linked lists to handle collisions. Each bucket (index of the array) will hold a linked list of key-value pairs.
3. **Operations:**
   - **put:** Calculate the hash and store the key-value pair in the corresponding bucket, handling updates if the key already exists.
   - **get:** Calculate the hash and search the linked list in the corresponding bucket to find the value for the key.
   - **remove:** Calculate the hash and remove the key-value pair from the linked list in the corresponding bucket.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <utility>

class MyHashMap {
private:
    static const int capacity = 10000;  // Capacity of the HashMap
    std::vector<std::list<std::pair<int, int>>> data;

    int hash(int key) {
        return key % capacity;  // Simple hash function
    }
    
public:
    MyHashMap() : data(capacity) {}

    void put(int key, int value) {
        int hashedKey = hash(key);
        for (auto& [k, v] : data[hashedKey]) {
            if (k == key) {
                v = value;
                return;
            }
        }
        data[hashedKey].emplace_back(key, value);
    }
    
    int get(int key) {
        int hashedKey = hash(key);
        for (const auto& [k, v] : data[hashedKey]) {
            if (k == key) return v;
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    void remove(int key) {
        int hashedKey = hash(key);
        auto& list = data[hashedKey];
        for (auto it = list.begin(); it != list.end(); ++it) {
            if (it->first == key) {
                list.erase(it);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization (`MyHashMap()`):** O(1) - Initializing the vector with a fixed capacity.
2. **put(key, value):** O(1) on average; O(n) in the worst-case scenario if all keys hash to the same bucket.
3. **get(key):** O(1) on average; O(n) in the worst-case scenario.
4. **remove(key):** O(1) on average; O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

Here, `n` refers to the number of key-value pairs in a single bucket (linked list), but typically due to the hash function, operations should be average O(1) if the keys are distributed uniformly.
