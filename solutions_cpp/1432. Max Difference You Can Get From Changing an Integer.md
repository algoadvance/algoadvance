[Leetcode 1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1432)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `num`, you are allowed to change **at most** one digit in the integer to any other digit (0-9) to create the maximum possible integer and the minimum possible integer. Return the difference between the maximum and minimum integers you can obtain by changing at most one digit.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is `num` guaranteed to be a positive integer?
   - **A:** Yes, `num` is a positive integer.
2. **Q:** Can `num` have leading zeros?
   - **A:** No, integers do not have leading zeros except for the number `0` itself.
3. **Q:** What is the range of the input values?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify, but typically integers will fit within the regular integer range in C++.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer `num` to a string for easier manipulation of digits.
2. Calculate the maximum possible value by replacing one digit:
   - Find the first digit that is not '9' and replace all its occurrences with '9'.
3. Calculate the minimum possible value by replacing one digit:
   - If the first digit is not '1', replace the first digit with '1'.
   - If the first digit is '1', find the first digit (other than '1') and replace all its occurrences with '0'.
4. Convert the modified string back to integer.
5. Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int maxDifference(int num) {
    string numStr = to_string(num);
    string maxNumStr = numStr;
    string minNumStr = numStr;

    // Calculate maxNumStr by replacing one digit to get the maximum possible value
    for (char& c : maxNumStr) {
        if (c != '9') {
            char toReplace = c;
            for (char& x : maxNumStr) {
                if (x == toReplace) {
                    x = '9';
                }
            }
            break;
        }
    }

    // Calculate minNumStr by replacing one digit to get the minimum possible value
    if (minNumStr[0] != '1') {
        char toReplace = minNumStr[0];
        for (char& x : minNumStr) {
            if (x == toReplace) {
                x = '1';
            }
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = 1; i < minNumStr.size(); ++i) {
            if (minNumStr[i] != '0' && minNumStr[i] != '1') {
                char toReplace = minNumStr[i];
                for (char& x : minNumStr) {
                    if (x == toReplace) {
                        x = '0';
                    }
                }
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    int maxNum = stoi(maxNumStr);
    int minNum = stoi(minNumStr);

    return maxNum - minNum;
}

int main() {
    int num = 555;  // Example input, you can change to test different cases
    cout << "Max difference: " << maxDifference(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of digits in the integer `num`. This is due to:
- Converting the integer to a string: `O(n)`
- Iterating over the string and modifying it: `O(n)`
- Converting the string back to an integer: `O(n)`

Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the number of digits in the input number.
