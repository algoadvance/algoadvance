[Leetcode 139. Word Break](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l139)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse dictionary words.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the function need to handle empty strings?**
   - If `s` is an empty string, should we return `true` as it can be seen as being segmented into zero words?

2. **Can the `wordDict` contain duplicate words?**
   - Yes, but they should be considered as unique.

3. **Should we consider case sensitivity?**
   - Yes, both `s` and words in `wordDict` are case-sensitive.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll maintain a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` will be `true` if the substring `s[0..i-1]` can be segmented into words found in `wordDict`.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize `dp[0]` to `true` since the empty string can always be segmented trivially.
2. Iterate through the string `s` with an outer loop, and for each character position, use an inner loop to check all substrings ending at that position.
3. If a valid substring is found, update the corresponding dp array element.
4. The answer will be in `dp[s.length()]`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(std::string s, std::vector<std::string>& wordDict) {
        std::unordered_set<std::string> wordSet(wordDict.begin(), wordDict.end());
        std::vector<bool> dp(s.size() + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true; // Empty string is a valid segmentation

        for (int i = 1; i <= s.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (dp[j] && wordSet.find(s.substr(j, i - j)) != wordSet.end()) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[s.size()];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2 * m)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the maximum length of the words in `wordDict`. The nested loops imply `O(n^2)` and checking each substring against the set takes `O(m)` time in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the dp array of size `n+1`, along with the space required for the `unordered_set`.

The provided implementation efficiently uses dynamic programming to determine whether the input string `s` can be segmented according to the provided word dictionary.
