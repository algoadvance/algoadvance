[Leetcode 1381. Design a Stack With Increment Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1381)
## Problem Statement

Design a stack which supports the following operations:

- `push(int x)` – Push `x` onto the stack.
- `pop()` – Remove the element on the top of the stack and return it. If the stack is empty, return `-1`.
- `inc(int k, int val)` – Increment the bottom `k` elements of the stack by `val`. If there are less than `k` elements in the stack, just increment all the elements in the stack.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= 1000`
- `1 <= val <= 100`
- `1 <= x <= 100`
- The total number of operations won't exceed `1000`.
- The total number of elements in the stack won't exceed `1000`.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we dive into the implementation, let’s ensure we understand the requirements and constraints clearly.

1. **Clarification on Overflow**: 
    - Should we consider integer overflow scenarios? Are we constrained within 32-bit integer limits?
    
2. **Behavior for Empty Pop Operation**:
    - Is returning `-1` for an empty stack on `pop()` acceptable as per problem constraints?
    
3. **Initial Stack State**:
    - The stack should be initialized as empty, correct?

## Strategy

### Operations
1. **Push operation**: We will simply add the element to the end of the list representing our stack.
2. **Pop operation**: We will remove the last element from the list and return it, or return `-1` if the stack is empty.
3. **Increment operation**: We will iterate through the first `k` elements of the stack (or all if less than `k` elements) and increment each by `val`.

### Data Structures
- We'll use a vector to represent the stack, which provides efficient operations for both push and pop. 

### Implementation
We will design a class `CustomStack` which will encapsulate these operations.

## Time Complexity
- **Push operation**: O(1)
- **Pop operation**: O(1)
- **Increment operation**: O(k) where k is the number of elements to increment

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class CustomStack {
private:
    std::vector<int> stack;
    int maxSize;

public:
    CustomStack(int maxSize) {
        this->maxSize = maxSize;
    }

    void push(int x) {
        if (stack.size() < maxSize) {
            stack.push_back(x);
        }
    }

    int pop() {
        if (stack.empty()) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            int topElement = stack.back();
            stack.pop_back();
            return topElement;
        }
    }

    void increment(int k, int val) {
        int limit = std::min(k, static_cast<int>(stack.size()));
        for (int i = 0; i < limit; ++i) {
            stack[i] += val;
        }
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    CustomStack customStack = CustomStack(3);
    customStack.push(1);
    customStack.push(2);
    std::cout << customStack.pop() << std::endl;    // returns 2
    customStack.push(2);
    customStack.push(3);
    customStack.push(4);
    customStack.increment(5, 100);                 // Stack becomes [101, 102, 103]
    customStack.increment(2, 100);                 // Stack becomes [201, 202, 103]
    std::cout << customStack.pop() << std::endl;    // returns 103
    std::cout << customStack.pop() << std::endl;    // returns 202
    std::cout << customStack.pop() << std::endl;    // returns 201
    std::cout << customStack.pop() << std::endl;    // returns -1
    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a fully functional implementation of the CustomStack class as per the problem requirements.
