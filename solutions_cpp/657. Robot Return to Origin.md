[Leetcode 657. Robot Return to Origin](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l657)
## Problem Statement

The problem is taken from LeetCode:

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves represented by a string, return `true` if the robot returns to the origin after completing all of its moves, or `false` otherwise.

The input string moves contains characters that represent the robot's movement:
- `'U'` (Up)
- `'D'` (Down)
- `'R'` (Right)
- `'L'` (Left)

The robot makes one move per character in the string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Length Constraints?** 
   - The length of the input string `moves` can range from 1 to 10,000.
   
2. **Input Validity?**
   - It is guaranteed that the input string only contains characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`.

## Strategy

To determine if the robot ends up at the origin `(0, 0)` after executing all moves, consider the net effect of each type of move:

- Each `'U'` (Up) increases the y-coordinate by 1.
- Each `'D'` (Down) decreases the y-coordinate by 1.
- Each `'R'` (Right) increases the x-coordinate by 1.
- Each `'L'` (Left) decreases the x-coordinate by 1.

To solve the problem:
1. Initialize coordinates `(x, y)` to `(0, 0)`.
2. Iterate through the `moves` string and adjust the coordinates based on the type of move.
3. After processing all moves, check if `(x, y)` is `(0, 0)`.

If `(x, y)` is `(0, 0)`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `moves` string, as we iterate through the string once.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we use only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeCircle(string moves) {
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        
        for (char move : moves) {
            if (move == 'U') {
                y++;
            } else if (move == 'D') {
                y--;
            } else if (move == 'R') {
                x++;
            } else if (move == 'L') {
                x--;
            }
        }
        
        return (x == 0) && (y == 0);
    }
};
```
This code solves the problem by simply iterating through the `moves` string, updating the x and y coordinates, and finally checking if the coordinates return to the origin.
