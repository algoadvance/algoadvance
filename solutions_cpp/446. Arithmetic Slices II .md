[Leetcode 446. Arithmetic Slices II ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l446)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** of `nums`.

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

#### Example:
- Input: `nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
- Output: `7`

#### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 1000.
   - The elements of `nums` are between -10^6 and 10^6.

2. **Output:**
   - Return the total number of arithmetic subsequences of at least length 3.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming combined with a hashmap to store the number of valid arithmetic subsequences ending at each index. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define a DP Table:**
   - Create a DP array where `dp[i]` is a hashmap. `dp[i][d]` will store the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at `i` with a common difference of `d`.

2. **Iterate Through Pairs:**
   - For every pair of indices \( (i, j) \) with \( i < j \):
     - Calculate the difference \( d = nums[j] - nums[i] \).
     - Use `dp[i]` to find the count of subsequences ending at \( i \) with difference \( d \).
     - If such sequences exist, add those sequences to `dp[j][d]`.

3. **Count Subsequences:**
   - Convert the subsequences of length 2 (found in the previous step) to valid subsequence of length 3 by adding the counts.
   - Sum up the results from the DP table.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<unordered_map<long, int>> dp(n);
        int total_slices = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                long long diff = (long long)nums[i] - (long long)nums[j];
                
                // Number of subsequences ending at `j` with difference `diff`
                int count_j = dp[j][diff];
                
                // Increment count for `i` by count found on `j` + 1 for the pair (i, j)
                dp[i][diff] += count_j + 1;
                
                // Add to total slices only the subsequences extended beyond the initial pair (length of 3 or more)
                total_slices += count_j;
            }
        }
        
        return total_slices;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)
  - The two nested loops run in \( O(n^2) \).
  - Each operation inside the loop is \( O(1) \) due to average time complexity of hashmap operations (insert and lookup).
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \)
  - In the worst case, each `dp[i]` hashmap might store \( O(n) \) differences, leading to \( O(n^2) \) space complexity in total.
