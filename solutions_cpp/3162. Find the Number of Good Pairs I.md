[Leetcode 3162. Find the Number of Good Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3162)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs:
- (0,3): nums[0] == nums[3] -> 1 == 1
- (0,4): nums[0] == nums[4] -> 1 == 1
- (3,4): nums[3] == nums[4] -> 1 == 1
- (2,5): nums[2] == nums[5] -> 3 == 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair (i,j) with i < j is a good pair.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume the array always has at least one element?
   **A:** Yes, based on the constraint `1 <= nums.length`.

2. **Q:** Can the elements be negative or only positive integers?
   **A:** Based on the constraint `1 <= nums[i]`, all elements are positive integers.

3. **Q:** Should the pairs `(i, j)` be counted only once even if multiple valid pairs exist?
   **A:** Yes, each pair should be counted once as long as `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate through each pair `(i, j)` in a nested loop where `i < j`.
   - Check if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.
   - Keep a counter for the good pairs found.

2. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each number as we iterate through the array.
   - For each number, if it has been seen before, increment the count of good pairs by its current frequency.
   - Update the frequency of the current number.

This optimal approach reduces the need for the nested loop and provides a more efficient solution.

## Time Complexity

- **Brute Force Approach:** O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the array. This is due to the nested iteration through all pairs.
- **Optimal Approach:** O(n), since we only iterate through the array once and perform constant-time operations for each element using a hash map.

## Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the optimal approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int numIdenticalPairs(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
    int goodPairs = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        // If num has been encountered before, number of good pairs
        // increases by the count of num seen so far
        if (countMap.find(num) != countMap.end()){
            goodPairs += countMap[num];
        }
        // Increment the frequency of num
        countMap[num]++;
    }
    
    return goodPairs;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3};
    std::cout << "Number of good pairs: " << numIdenticalPairs(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code uses the optimal approach with a hash map, traversing the array only once to count the good pairs efficiently.
