[Leetcode 2409. Count Days Spent Together](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2409)
### Problem Statement
You are given four strings `arriveAlice`, `leaveAlice`, `arriveBob`, and `leaveBob`, representing the arrival and departure dates of Alice and Bob respectively. All dates are in the format `MM-DD`. You need to find the number of days Alice and Bob spend together.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Date Format and Year Consideration**: All dates are within the same year, and the year is non-leap.
2. **Guaranteed Valid Dates**: No need to check for invalid dates; assume all provided dates are valid.
3. **Time Constraints**: What is the maximum length of strings? Usually given constraints are reasonable for standard library date operations.

### Strategy
1. **Convert Dates to Days**:
    - Use a function that converts a `MM-DD` string to the number of days from the start of the year. This avoids dealing with month boundaries repeatedly.
2. **Intersection of Date Ranges**:
    - Calculate the intersection of the date ranges for Alice and Bob.
    - Use the maximum of starting dates as the start of the overlap.
    - Use the minimum of ending dates as the end of the overlap.
3. **Calculate Duration**:
   - If the start of the overlap is before or the same as the end, calculate the number of days in between and include both end days.

### C++ Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Convert date from MM-DD to the day of the year
int convertToDayOfYear(const string& date) {
    int month = stoi(date.substr(0, 2));
    int day = stoi(date.substr(3, 2));
    
    // Non-leap year days till each month end
    static const int daysTillMonthEnd[13] = {
        0,   // dummy month (0)
        31,  // Jan
        59,  // Feb
        90,  // Mar
        120, // Apr
        151, // May
        181, // Jun
        212, // Jul
        243, // Aug
        273, // Sep
        304, // Oct
        334, // Nov
        365  // Dec
    };
    
    return daysTillMonthEnd[month - 1] + day;
}

int countDaysTogether(string arriveAlice, string leaveAlice, string arriveBob, string leaveBob) {
    int aliceStart = convertToDayOfYear(arriveAlice);
    int aliceEnd = convertToDayOfYear(leaveAlice);
    int bobStart = convertToDayOfYear(arriveBob);
    int bobEnd = convertToDayOfYear(leaveBob);
    
    // Calculate intersection period
    int startOverlap = max(aliceStart, bobStart);
    int endOverlap = min(aliceEnd, bobEnd);
    
    // Calculate number of overlap days
    if (startOverlap > endOverlap) {
        return 0; // No overlap
    } else {
        return endOverlap - startOverlap + 1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Date Conversion**: O(1) for each date conversion (constant time due to fixed number of months).
- **Overall**: O(1) since the operations performed are constant time calculations and comparisons.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of overlapping days between two date ranges within a given year.
