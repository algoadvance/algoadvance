[Leetcode 1487. Making File Names Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1487)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `names` where each name is a file name that is to be created. Your task is to ensure that there are no duplicate names, and if a duplicate name exists, you add a suffix "(k)" to the name, where k is the smallest positive integer such that the name is unique.

For example:
- Input: `names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)","pes"]`
- Output: `["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)","pes(1)"]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Are the names always lowercase?**
   - **A: Yes, according to the problem statement, we can assume that all names are lowercase.**

2. **Q: Can the input have very large sizes?**
   - **A: Yes, the input array can be quite large, so we need to make sure our solution is efficient.**

3. **Q: Should we handle cases where the added suffix makes another conflict?**
   - **A: Yes, the suffix added should ensure the generated name is unique in the entire list up to that point.**

## Strategy
We can use a hash map (or unordered_map in C++) to store the count of each name. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Create an unordered map `mp` to keep track of how many times each name has appeared.**
2. **Iterate over the `names` array:**
   - **If the name is not in the map, add it with a count of 1 and add it to the result list.**
   - **If the name is in the map, find the smallest suffix that makes it unique by incrementing the suffix value `k` starting from 1. Add this unique name to the result list and update the map with this new name.**

This approach ensures we efficiently generate unique names without ambiguities.

## Code
Here is the C++ code implementing the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

vector<string> getFolderNames(vector<string>& names) {
    unordered_map<string, int> mp;
    vector<string> result;
    
    for (const string& name : names) {
        if (mp.find(name) == mp.end()) {
            // If the name does not exist in the map
            result.push_back(name);
            mp[name] = 1;
        } else {
            // If the name is already in the map
            int k = mp[name];
            string newName;
            do {
                newName = name + "(" + to_string(k) + ")";
                k++;
            } while (mp.find(newName) != mp.end());
            
            result.push_back(newName);
            mp[name] = k;      // Update suffix number for the next occurrence
            mp[newName] = 1;   // Add new unique name to the map
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> names = {"pes", "fifa", "gta", "pes(2019)", "pes"};
    vector<string> uniqueNames = getFolderNames(names);
    
    for (const string& name : uniqueNames) {
        cout << name << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where:
- `n` is the number of names in the input list.
- `m` is the average length of the strings in the input list.

This is because for each name, in the worst case, we might have to search or update the map possibly multiple times with different suffixes until finding a unique name, but these operations are still within O(m) due to efficient hashing mechanisms.

This solution should be efficient enough for most reasonable input sizes in practice.
