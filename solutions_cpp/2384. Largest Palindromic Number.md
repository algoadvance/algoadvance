[Leetcode 2384. Largest Palindromic Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2384)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `num` consisting of digits, return the largest palindromic number (as a string) that can be formed using the digits of `num`. It is not necessary to use all the digits of `num`, and the resulting palindrome must not have any leading zeros, unless the only digit is `0`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string contain non-numeric characters or will it always be numeric?**
   - The input is guaranteed to be a string, and we assume it will always be numeric.

2. **What is the length range of the input string `num`?**
   - This detail is not mentioned, but we can assume it to be reasonably large (up to \(10^4\) for algorithm considerations).

3. **Are there any constraints on time and space complexity?**
   - Typically, we aim for a solution as efficient as possible. An \(O(n)\) solution in terms of time complexity should be acceptable here.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

std::string largestPalindromic(std::string num) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> freq;

    for (char c : num) {
        freq[c]++;
    }

    std::string half = "";
    char oddChar = 0;
    
    for (char c = '9'; c >= '0'; --c) {
        if (freq[c] % 2 == 1) {
            if (oddChar == 0 || c > oddChar) {
                oddChar = c;
            }
        }
        half.append(freq[c] / 2, c);
    }

    if (half[0] == '0') {
        return oddChar != 0 ? std::string(1, oddChar) : "0";
    }

    std::string reverseHalf = half;
    std::reverse(reverseHalf.begin(), reverseHalf.end());

    return half + (oddChar ? std::string(1, oddChar) : "") + reverseHalf;
}

int main() {
    std::string s;
    std::cin >> s;
    std::cout << largestPalindromic(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**: First, we count the frequency of each digit (0-9) in the string. This will allow us to determine how many times each digit can be used to form the palindrome.
2. **Forming Half of the Palindrome**: To form the palindrome, we need to create half of the palindrome by taking half of the count of each digit and arranging it in descending order. This ensures that our final number is the largest possible.
3. **Handling Odd Frequency Digit**: If there's a digit with an odd frequency, it can be placed in the middle of the palindrome (if it's the largest among possible candidates).
4. **Checking for Leading Zero**: We must ensure that the palindrome doesn't have leading zeros unless the resulting number is "0".
5. **Combining to Form the Palindrome**: Finally, we append the reverse of the formed half to complete the palindrome.

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string. This is primarily because we count the frequency of each digit in a single pass and then form the result palindrome in a linear pass.

**Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), assuming the frequency array and other used spaces are constants relative to the size of the input digits (0-9).
