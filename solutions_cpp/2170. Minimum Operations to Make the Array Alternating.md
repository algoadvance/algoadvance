[Leetcode 2170. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Alternating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2170)
## Problem Statement
Given a zero-indexed array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers, return the minimum number of operations required to make the array alternating. An array is considered alternating if no two adjacent elements are equal. An operation involves changing any element of the array to any other positive integer.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** Can the array have a minimum length of 1?
    - Yes, the array length can be as small as 1, but since it's already alternating, no operations are needed.

2. **Element Range:** Is it guaranteed that elements are positive integers up to `10^5`?
    - Yes, the elements are positive integers and can be up to `10^5`.

3. **Adjacent Elements:** Does the operation allow changing any element to any positive integer?
    - Yes, the operation allows changing any element to any other positive integer.

## Strategy
1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Calculate the frequencies of values at even indices and odd indices separately.
   
2. **Find Most Frequent Values:**
   - Identify the most frequent and the second most frequent values in both even and odd indexed positions.
   
3. **Handling the Top Frequencies:**
   - If the most frequent value in the even indices position is different from the most frequent value in the odd indices, select those values.
   - If they are the same, choose the highest frequency among second most frequent values to ensure alternation.
   
4. **Compute Minimum Operations:**
   - Calculate the number of changes needed to achieve the alternating array by subtracting the most frequent and second most frequent values from the length of the respective indices.

## Code 

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        if (n == 1) return 0; // Already alternating
        
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq_even, freq_odd;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) ++freq_even[nums[i]];
            else ++freq_odd[nums[i]];
        }
        
        auto getTopTwoFreq = [](const std::unordered_map<int, int>& freq) {
            std::pair<int, int> top1 = {-1, 0}, top2 = {-1, 0}; // {value, count}
            for (const auto& [num, count] : freq) {
                if (count > top1.second) {
                    top2 = top1;
                    top1 = {num, count};
                } else if (count > top2.second) {
                    top2 = {num, count};
                }
            }
            return std::make_pair(top1, top2);
        };
        
        auto [evenTop1, evenTop2] = getTopTwoFreq(freq_even);
        auto [oddTop1, oddTop2] = getTopTwoFreq(freq_odd);
        
        int min_operations;
        if (evenTop1.first != oddTop1.first) {
            min_operations = (n / 2 - evenTop1.second) + (n - n / 2 - oddTop1.second);
        } else {
            int option1 = (n / 2 - evenTop1.second) + (n - n / 2 - oddTop2.second);
            int option2 = (n / 2 - evenTop2.second) + (n - n / 2 - oddTop1.second);
            min_operations = std::min(option1, option2);
        }
        
        return min_operations;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(n):** We iterate through the array to build the frequency maps.
- **O(m):** We find the top two frequent elements in the maps, where `m` is a constant upper bound, i.e., `1-100,000`.
The overall time complexity is therefore O(n). The space complexity is O(m) due to the frequency maps, which is also bounded and manageable within the given constraints.
