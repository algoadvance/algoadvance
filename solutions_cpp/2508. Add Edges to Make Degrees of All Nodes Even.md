[Leetcode 2508. Add Edges to Make Degrees of All Nodes Even](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2508)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v`. The graph contains `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. Your task is to determine if you can add at most two edges to this graph so that all the nodes in the graph have an even degree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Values:** How large can `n` and the number of edges be?
2. **Edge Cases:** Are there any special edge cases to consider, such as graphs with no edges or fully connected graphs?
3. **Node Labels:** Are node labels guaranteed to be between 1 and n?

Assumptions based on typical constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- Node labels are within the range `[1, n]`.

### Strategy

1. **Count Degrees:** First, compute the degree of each node in the graph.
2. **Identify Odd Degrees:** Identify nodes with odd degrees.
3. **Cases to Handle:**
   - **0 Odd Degree Nodes:** No additional edges are needed.
   - **2 Odd Degree Nodes:** Check whether they can be connected directly or through another node.
   - **4 Odd Degree Nodes:** Check if there is a way to add edges to make all degrees even.
   - **More than 4 Odd Degree Nodes:** It is impossible to solve since we are limited to adding at most two edges.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

bool canAddEdgesToMakeEvenDegrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    // Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
    vector<int> degree(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> adj;
    
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];
        degree[u]++;
        degree[v]++;
        adj[u].insert(v);
        adj[v].insert(u);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Identify nodes with odd degree
    vector<int> odd_degree_nodes;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (degree[i] % 2 != 0) {
            odd_degree_nodes.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    int odd_count = odd_degree_nodes.size();
    
    if (odd_count == 0) {
        return true;
    } else if (odd_count == 2) {
        int a = odd_degree_nodes[0];
        int b = odd_degree_nodes[1];
        
        // Connect a and b directly if no existing edge between them
        if (adj[a].find(b) == adj[a].end()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Try to find an intermediary node
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i != a && i != b && adj[a].find(i) == adj[a].end() && adj[b].find(i) == adj[b].end()) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    } else if (odd_count == 4) {
        int a = odd_degree_nodes[0];
        int b = odd_degree_nodes[1];
        int c = odd_degree_nodes[2];
        int d = odd_degree_nodes[3];
        
        // Check all combination pairs
        if ((adj[a].find(b) == adj[a].end() && adj[c].find(d) == adj[c].end()) ||
            (adj[a].find(c) == adj[a].end() && adj[b].find(d) == adj[b].end()) ||
            (adj[a].find(d) == adj[a].end() && adj[b].find(c) == adj[b].end())) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // More than 4 odd-degree nodes cannot be fixed by adding at most 2 edges
    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 1}};
    int n = 4;
    
    bool result = canAddEdgesToMakeEvenDegrees(n, edges);
    cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << endl; // Expected: True
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges, due to the need to process all edges and compute the degrees.
- The space complexity is `O(V + E)` primarily due to the storage used for adjacency lists and degree tracking.
