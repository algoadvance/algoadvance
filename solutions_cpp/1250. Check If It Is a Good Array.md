[Leetcode 1250. Check If It Is a Good Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1250)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of positive integers, return `true` if it is possible to choose a set of integers from the array that sums up to `1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements of the array be used more than once?**
   - No, each element can be used only once.
   
2. **Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, all elements in `nums` are positive integers.

3. **What is the expected size of the array?**
   - The constraint is typically up to 10^4 elements.

4. **What if the array contains only one element?**
   - If the array contains only one element, return `true` if that element is `1`, otherwise return `false`.

## Strategy
To determine if it is possible to sum any subset of the array to reach the number `1`, we can use the mathematical concept based on the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD). If the GCD of the array is `1`, it means that we can express `1` as a linear combination of the array elements using the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.

### Steps:
1. Compute the GCD of all elements in the array.
2. If the GCD is `1`, return `true`.
3. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Why This Works:
The problem reduces to finding if the smallest number that can be formed from the sum of any subset of given numbers is `1`. Using the GCD, if `GCD(nums) = 1`, then there exist integers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
\[ x_1 \cdot a_1 + x_2 \cdot a_2 + \ldots + x_n \cdot a_n = 1 \]
Thus, determining the GCD is sufficient.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

bool isGoodArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Initial GCD is the first element
    int gcd = nums[0];
    // Compute GCD of all elements in the array
    for (int num : nums) {
        gcd = std::gcd(gcd, num);
        // If at any step GCD becomes 1, we can return true
        if (gcd == 1) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    // Final check if the GCD of all elements is 1
    return gcd == 1;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {6, 10, 15};
    bool result = isGoodArray(nums);
    std::cout << "Is it a good array? " << (result ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time complexity:** \(O(n \log (\min(nums)))\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This involves computing the GCD of two numbers, which is logarithmic with respect to the smaller number.
- **Space complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we only use a few integer variables.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine whether any subset of the array can sum up to `1` using the properties of GCD.
