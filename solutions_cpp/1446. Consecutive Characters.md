[Leetcode 1446. Consecutive Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1446)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, the task is to find the length of the longest substring containing only one unique character.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the string `s` composed only of lowercase/uppercase English letters?
   - Can the string be empty?

2. **Output Constraints**:
   - Should the function return 0 for an empty string?
   - Are there any specific edge cases we should consider, such as strings with all similar characters?

### Strategy

The problem requires finding the length of the longest contiguous substring that contains the same character. Here's a step-by-step strategy to solve this problem:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a variable `maxLength` to keep track of the maximum length found.
   - Use a variable `currentChar` to track the current character being considered.
   - Use a variable `currentLength` to track the length of the current sequence of identical characters.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Traverse the string character by character.
   - If the current character is the same as the `currentChar`, increase the `currentLength`.
   - If the current character is different, update `maxLength` if `currentLength` is greater, and then reset `currentChar` and `currentLength`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, there might be a case where the longest sequence is at the end of the string, so perform a final update to `maxLength`.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPower(std::string s) {
        if (s.empty()) return 0;
        
        int maxLength = 1;  // At least one character long sequence exists
        int currentLength = 1;
        char currentChar = s[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] == currentChar) {
                currentLength++;
            } else {
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
                currentChar = s[i];
                currentLength = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Final comparison to catch sequences at the end of the string
        maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we only need to pass through the string once, performing constant-time operations at each step.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
