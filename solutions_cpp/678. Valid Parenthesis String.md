[Leetcode 678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l678)
## Problem Statement
678. Valid Parenthesis String:
    
Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'`, and `'*'`, write a function to check whether the string is valid. The string is valid if:
1. Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
2. Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
3. Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
4. `'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string be empty?
   - Yes, an empty string should be considered valid.
2. What should be returned?
   - Return `true` if the string is valid, otherwise return `false`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a greedy technique to keep track of the minimum and maximum possible number of open brackets at any point in the string.

- We will use two counters:
  - `min_open`: Tracks the minimum number of unmatched '(' considering '*' can potentially act as ')'.
  - `max_open`: Tracks the maximum number of unmatched '(' considering '*' can potentially act as '('.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidString(std::string s) {
        int min_open = 0;  // Minimum possible open brackets
        int max_open = 0;  // Maximum possible open brackets

        for (auto &ch : s) {
            if (ch == '(') {
                min_open++;
                max_open++;
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                min_open = std::max(min_open - 1, 0);
                max_open--;
            } else {  // '*' can be '(' or ')' or empty
                min_open = std::max(min_open - 1, 0);
                max_open++;
            }

            if (max_open < 0) {
                // This means the string can't be valid because we have more closing brackets than opening ones.
                return false;
            }
        }

        // At the end of the string, min_open must be zero for the string to be valid.
        return min_open == 0;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string s = "(*))";
    bool result = sol.checkValidString(s);
    std::cout << (result ? "Valid" : "Invalid") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation & Time Complexity

### Explanation:
1. Loop through each character in the string:
   - If it is '(', increment both `min_open` and `max_open`.
   - If it is ')', decrement `max_open` and increment `min_open` unless `min_open` is already zero.
   - If it is '*', decrement `min_open` (unless it's zero) and increment `max_open`.

2. If `max_open` becomes less than 0 at any point, return `false` because it means there are unmatched closing brackets.
3. After processing the entire string, `min_open` must be zero to ensure all open brackets are matched properly. Return `min_open == 0`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once.
- The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a few integer variables to keep track of the state.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the validity of the string in linear time with constant space.
