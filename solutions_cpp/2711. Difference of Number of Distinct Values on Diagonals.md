[Leetcode 2711. Difference of Number of Distinct Values on Diagonals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2711)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed 2D grid with `m` rows and `n` columns, where each cell contains a positive integer.

We define the _difference of the number of distinct values on the diagonals_ of the grid.

Formally, the difference of the number of distinct values on the diagonals for each cell `(i, j)` in the grid is computed as the absolute difference between:
1. The number of distinct values in the diagonal beginning from the top-left to the current cell `(i, j)`.
2. The number of distinct values in the diagonal beginning from the current cell `(i, j)` to the bottom-right. 

Return a 2D grid `difference` where `difference[i][j]` is the difference of the number of distinct values on the diagonals for cell `(i, j)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the grid have duplicate values?
2. What is the range of the dimensions of the grid (m, n)?
3. Are all values positive integers within the grid?
   
(Assume positive answers for these.)

## Strategy

1. Initialize a 2D vector `difference` with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the diagonals:
    - Top-left to `(i, j)` by traversing backward from `(i, j)` to the top-left corner.
    - `(i, j)` to bottom-right by traversing forward from `(i, j)` to the bottom-right corner.
3. Use `std::set` to keep track of distinct values in each diagonal to facilitate distinct count.
4. Compute the absolute difference of distinct values counts for each cell `(i, j)` and store it in the `difference` grid.
5. Return the `difference` grid.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> differenceOfDistinctValues(const vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> difference(m, vector<int>(n, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            set<int> topLeftDiagonal;
            set<int> bottomRightDiagonal;

            // Traverse the top-left diagonal
            for (int x = i, y = j; x >= 0 && y >= 0; --x, --y) {
                topLeftDiagonal.insert(grid[x][y]);
            }

            // Traverse the bottom-right diagonal
            for (int x = i, y = j; x < m && y < n; ++x, ++y) {
                bottomRightDiagonal.insert(grid[x][y]);
            }

            // Calculate the absolute difference
            difference[i][j] = abs((int)topLeftDiagonal.size() - (int)bottomRightDiagonal.size());
        }
    }

    return difference;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Traversing each diagonal from a cell `(i, j)` is `O(min(m, n))`.
- For each cell in the grid, we do this traversal twice, which is `O(2 * min(m, n))`.
- As we perform this operation for all cells `(m * n)` in the grid, the total time complexity is:

  \[
  O(m * n * min(m, n))
  \]

This might be inefficient for larger grids. We may need an optimized approach for large `m` and `n`.
