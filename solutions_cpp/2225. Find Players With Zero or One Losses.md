[Leetcode 2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2225)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winneri, loseri]` indicates that the player `winneri` defeated the player `loseri` in a match.

Return a list `answer` of size 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.

The lists in `answer` should be in ascending order.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the number of players be inferred from the `matches` array, or is it given separately?
   - The number of players can be inferred from the `matches` array.
   
2. Can a player be mentioned in `matches` without winning or losing any game?
   - Yes, it's possible for a player to be mentioned only as a winner or only as a loser.

3. Should we consider players with no games played at all?
   - No, only consider players mentioned in the `matches` array.

## Strategy:

1. Use a `map` (or `unordered_map` in C++) to keep track of the number of losses for each player.
2. Iterate through each match:
   - Record the winner with 0 losses if the winner is not already tracked.
   - Increment the count of losses for the loser.
3. After processing all matches, iterate through the map to categorize players into those with 0 losses and those with exactly 1 loss.
4. Sort the resulting lists and return them.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> findWinners(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matches) {
    std::map<int, int> lossCount;
    std::set<int> winners;

    // Process each match
    for (const auto& match : matches) {
        int winner = match[0];
        int loser = match[1];

        // Include the winner in the set of players with 0 losses if it appears for the first time
        if (lossCount.find(winner) == lossCount.end()) {
            lossCount[winner] = 0;
        }
        // Increment the loss count for the loser
        lossCount[loser]++;
    }

    std::vector<int> noLossPlayers;
    std::vector<int> oneLossPlayers;

    // Separate players based on their loss count
    for (const auto& entry : lossCount) {
        int player = entry.first;
        int losses = entry.second;

        if (losses == 0) {
            noLossPlayers.push_back(player);
        } else if (losses == 1) {
            oneLossPlayers.push_back(player);
        }
    }

    // Sort the lists
    std::sort(noLossPlayers.begin(), noLossPlayers.end());
    std::sort(oneLossPlayers.begin(), oneLossPlayers.end());

    return {noLossPlayers, oneLossPlayers};
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- Parsing the `matches` array and updating loss counts: **O(N)**, where N is the number of matches.
- Sorting the resultant vectors: **O(P log P)**, where P is the number of distinct players.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N + P log P)**.

This solution efficiently tracks the number of losses per player and separates them into the required categories, ensuring a logical and straightforward implementation.
