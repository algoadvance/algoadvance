[Leetcode 940. Distinct Subsequences II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l940)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The constraints usually fall within reasonable limits for dynamic programming solutions, typically up to a few thousand characters. 

2. **Can the string `s` contain duplicate characters?**
   - Yes, the string can contain duplicate characters. The challenge is to count distinct subsequences.

3. **Can the string include spaces or special characters?**
   - No restriction is typically mentioned in LeetCode problems unless explicitly stated. Assume `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

With these clarifications, let's move to the coding strategy.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array:**
   - Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of distinct subsequences of the substring `s[0:i]`.

2. **Base Case Initialization:**
   - Start with `dp[0] = 1` as the empty string has exactly one subsequence, which is itself (though this "subsequence" isn't counted ultimately, it serves in the dp transformation).

3. **Transition/Recurrence:**
   - Iterate through the string and update `dp[i+1]` using the information of previous states.
   - If a character `s[i]` repeats, we need to account for previous subsequences that include this character, avoiding double counting.

4. **Last Occurrence Tracking:**
   - Maintain an array `last` of size `26` to keep track of the last occurrence index for each character to manage duplicates.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the number of subsequences can be large, take modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.

6. **Final Result:**
   - The result will be `dp[n] - 1` where `n` is the length of the string `s` (we subtract 1 to exclude the empty subsequence).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int distinctSubseqII(string s) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = s.length();
        vector<long> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;  // Base case: empty string has one subsequence (itself, we subtract this later).
        
        vector<int> last(26, -1);  // To track last occurrence of each character.
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i + 1] = (2 * dp[i]) % MOD;
            if (last[s[i] - 'a'] != -1) {
                dp[i + 1] = (dp[i + 1] - dp[last[s[i] - 'a']]) % MOD;
            }
            last[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        
        dp[n]--;
        if (dp[n] < 0) dp[n] += MOD;  // Ensure positive result.
        return dp[n];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string s = "abc";
    cout << sol.distinctSubseqII(s) << endl;  // Output should be 7.
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\):

- Iterating through the string once takes \(O(n)\).
- Each character lookup and update in the `last` array take constant time \(O(1)\).

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the `dp` array and another \(O(1)\) for the `last` array, making total auxiliary space \(O(n)\).

This solution efficiently counts distinct subsequences using dynamic programming with tracking mechanisms for last occurrence, ensuring no duplicity errors and handling large results with modulo operations.
