[Leetcode 1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1368)
### Problem Statement
Given a grid of size `m x n`, each cell contains a directional arrow (`'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`, `'4'`) which corresponds to moving right, left, down, or up respectively. Your task is to determine the minimum cost required to make at least one valid path from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1,n-1) with the option to change the direction of any cell, where each change incurs a cost of 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Grid Size Constraints:** What are the constraints for the dimensions of the grid?
   - Typical constraints for such problems including m and n up to 100, but simpler cases may have lower bounds to consider.

2. **Directional Arrows Interpretation:**
   - `'1'` corresponds to moving right (`→`)
   - `'2'` corresponds to moving left (`←`)
   - `'3'` corresponds to moving down (`↓`)
   - `'4'` corresponds to moving up (`↑`)

3. **Initial Valid Path:** Are we allowed to start if the initial arrow directions form a valid path?
   - This typically is the goal, minimizing the cost implies possibly using some initial directions if advantageous.

### Strategy
1. **Representation:** Use a deque for BFS since it effectively handles the scenario of weighted edges, treating cost-free moves and costly changes optimally.
2. **Exploration:** Each cell's direction will be checked and determine if moving in the indicated direction maintains a minimal cost. If a change is necessary, the new direction is added with increased cost.
3. **Goal:** The algorithm terminates upon reaching the bottom-right corner, returning the accumulated cost.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    vector<vector<int>> cost(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    deque<pair<int, int>> dq;
    
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
    
    dq.push_front({0, 0});
    cost[0][0] = 0;

    while (!dq.empty()) {
        auto [x, y] = dq.front();
        dq.pop_front();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            int nx = x + directions[i][0];
            int ny = y + directions[i][1];
            int current_cost = cost[x][y] + (grid[x][y] != i + 1);

            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && current_cost < cost[nx][ny]) {
                cost[nx][ny] = current_cost;
                if (grid[x][y] == i + 1) {
                    dq.push_front({nx, ny});
                } else {
                    dq.push_back({nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return cost[m-1][n-1];
}
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize the cost grid with maximum values (`INT_MAX`), and a deque starting from (0,0) with a cost of 0. 
2. Use BFS with a deque to handle the minimum cost path search, pushing valid or changed direction paths at the front or back respectively.
3. At each step, respect the directionality given by the grid and update paths by minimizing the accumulated cost.
4. The algorithm completes once the bottom-right cell is reachable, returning the minimal path cost.

### Time Complexity
This solution primarily relies on the dimensions of the grid:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, given each cell is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, for the cost grid and deque. The auxiliary space usage is manageable within problem constraints.

This approach ensures an efficient pathfinding strategy optimizing differential costs effectively within given constraints.
