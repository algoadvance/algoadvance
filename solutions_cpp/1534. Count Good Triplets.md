[Leetcode 1534. Count Good Triplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1534)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, and three integers `a`, `b` and `c`. You need to return the number of good triplets.

A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is a good triplet if the following conditions are true:
- `0 <= i < j < k < len(arr)`
- `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
- `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
- `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the input array and integers `a`, `b`, and `c`?
     - *`arr` will have 3 to 100 elements. Each element in `arr` will be between `0` and `1000`. `a`, `b`, and `c` will be between `0` and `1000`.*

2. **Output:**
   - What should be returned?
     - *Return a single integer denoting the number of good triplets.*

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Are there specific edge cases we should be aware of?
     - *Handle the smallest array size (3 elements), maximum values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and varying values within `arr`.*

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` where `i < j < k` and check if they satisfy the given conditions. Given the constraints (length of array up to 100), a triple nested loop solution will be feasible and simple to implement.

1. Use three nested loops to iterate over the indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.
2. For each triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])`, check the conditions:
   - `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
   - `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
   - `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`
3. If all conditions are met, increment the count of good triplets.
4. Return the count of good triplets.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath> // for abs

class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodTriplets(std::vector<int>& arr, int a, int b, int c) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = arr.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (std::abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a &&
                        std::abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b &&
                        std::abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c) {
                        ++count;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in `O(n^3)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are using three nested loops to iterate over all possible triplets.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are only using a few extra variables (the count and loop indices).

Given the constraints (with `n` up to 100), this time complexity is acceptable and should run efficiently within those limits.
