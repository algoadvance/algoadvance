[Leetcode 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l950)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `deck` where `deck[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` card. We need to rearrange the values in the `deck` such that when we reveal the cards in increasing order, the sequence appears as an increasing sequence. 

To elaborate, in the "reveal in increasing order" process:

1. We start with the deck of cards facing downwards.
2. We reveal the top card of the deck, then put the next top card at the bottom of the deck. 
3. We repeat step 2 until all the cards are revealed.

Thus, we need to return a permutation of the deck such that it appears in increasing order once the cards are revealed as described.

**Example:**

```
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the values in the deck guaranteed to be unique?
2. Can the size of the deck be zero?
3. Is the expected output unique for every input?

## Strategy

1. Sort the deck in ascending order.
2. Use a queue to simulate the revealing process:
    - Initialize an empty queue.
    - Iterate through the sorted deck and simulate the steps:
        - Place the current smallest card from the sorted deck into its rightful position.
        - Rotate the queue (if necessary) to simulate the "put the next top card at the bottom" step.

## Code

Here's how we can implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> deckRevealedIncreasing(std::vector<int>& deck) {
    std::sort(deck.begin(), deck.end());  // Sort the deck in increasing order
    
    std::queue<int> indexQueue;
    int n = deck.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        indexQueue.push(i);  // Initialize queue with indices 0 to n-1
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[indexQueue.front()] = deck[i];  // Place the next smallest card
        indexQueue.pop();  // Remove the front element
        if (!indexQueue.empty()) {
            indexQueue.push(indexQueue.front());  // Move the new top to the bottom
            indexQueue.pop();  // Remove it from the top
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage
/*
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> deck = {17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7};
    std::vector<int> result = deckRevealedIncreasing(deck);
    for (int card : result) {
        std::cout << card << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
*/
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N \log N + N)\):

- Sorting the deck takes \(O(N \log N)\) time.
- The queue operations take \(O(N)\) time, since each card is pushed and popped from the queue a constant number of times.

Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in \(O(N \log N)\).
