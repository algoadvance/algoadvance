[Leetcode 2167. Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2167)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` where each character is either '0' (representing a car without illegal goods) or '1' (representing a car with illegal goods). You can perform the following operations any number of times:
1. Remove a '0' from the beginning of the string (cost 0).
2. Remove a '0' from the end of the string (cost 0).
3. Remove a '1' from anywhere in the string (cost 1).

Your task is to determine the minimum cost to remove all cars containing illegal goods ('1') from the string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the string `s` be empty?
2. Is it guaranteed that the string will contain at least one '1'?
3. Can we assume that all inputs are valid (i.e., the string consists only of '0's and '1's)?

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the following strategy:

1. **Two-pointer technique** - Use two pointers to find the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string:
    - `left` pointer starting from the beginning of the string.
    - `right` pointer starting from the end of the string.
  
2. **Cost Calculation**:
    - The fundamental operations have costs associated with removing '1's efficiently.
    - Calculate the cost required to remove all '1's by tracking indices of '1's.

### Code
Here's how you can implement this solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumTimeToRemoveAllCars(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;
    
    // Calculate the minimum cost to remove all '1's
    int cost = 0;
    while (left < n && s[left] == '0') left++;
    while (right >= 0 && s[right] == '0') right--;
    
    if (left > right) return 0;  // No '1's to remove
    
    int minCost = right - left + 1;  // Remove all '1's between the first and last '1'
    int removeLeftCost = 0;
    for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '1') removeLeftCost++;
        minCost = std::min(minCost, removeLeftCost + (right - i));
    }
    
    int removeRightCost = 0;
    for (int i = right; i >= left; --i) {
        if (s[i] == '1') removeRightCost++;
        minCost = std::min(minCost, removeRightCost + (i - left));
    }

    return minCost;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "1101000";
    std::string s2 = "10001";
    std::cout << "Minimum cost to remove all '1's in '" << s1 << "': " << minimumTimeToRemoveAllCars(s1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Minimum cost to remove all '1's in '" << s2 << "': " << minimumTimeToRemoveAllCars(s2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. We are scanning the string a few times in linear time to find the first '1', last '1', and to calculate the costs.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space apart from the input string.
