[Leetcode 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1639)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of words (the dictionary) and a target string, you need to determine the number of ways to form the target string by choosing a character from a corresponding position in each of the given words. The order in which characters are picked to form the target string must follow the order of characters in the target string.

Each word in the dictionary is of the same length, and you can pick characters from the same position in different words to match characters in the target string.

You need to compute the number of distinct ways modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size and Constraints:**
   - How large can the dictionary (number of words and length of words) be?
   - What are the constraints on the target string length?

   **Response:**
   - You can assume the dictionary will have a size up to \(5000 \times 1000\) (number of words times length of each word).
   - The length of the target string can be up to 1000.

2. **Character Constraints:**
   - Are the characters in the words and the target string limited to lowercase English letters?

   **Response:**
   - Yes, characters are limited to lowercase English letters (a-z).

### Strategy

We will break down the problem into manageable steps and use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to form each prefix of the target string using prefixes of the dictionary.

1. **Frequency Count:** First, we count the frequency of each character at each position in the dictionary.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table:** We'll set up a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form the first `j` characters of the target string using the first `i` positions of the dictionary words.
3. **Initialization:** Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` as there's one way to form an empty string from an empty set.
4. **Transition:** For each position `i` in the dictionary and each position `j` in the target, update `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i+1][j+1]` using current counts.
5. **Modular Arithmetic:** Use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the results fit within standard integer limits.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(std::vector<std::string>& words, std::string target) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int m = words[0].length(), n = target.length();
        std::vector<std::vector<long>> dp(m+1, std::vector<long>(n+1, 0));
        
        // Initialize dp
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        
        // Frequency of each character at each position
        std::vector<std::unordered_map<char, int>> charCount(m);
        for (const auto& word : words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                charCount[i][word[i]]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Fill dp table
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (dp[i][j] == 0) continue;

                // Carry forward the ways without selecting a character from current position
                dp[i+1][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j]) % MOD;

                if (j < n && charCount[i].count(target[j])) {
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = (dp[i+1][j+1] + dp[i][j] * charCount[i][target[j]]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing (Frequency Count):** 
  \[
  O(m \times k) \quad \text{where } m \text{ is the length of each word and } k \text{ is the number of words}
  \]
- **DP Table Fill:**
  \[
  O(m \times n)
  \]
  
Overall time complexity is \(O(m \times k + m \times n)\).

This approach utilizes dynamic programming to handle overlapping subproblems efficiently, with the overall complexity being feasible within the given constraints.
