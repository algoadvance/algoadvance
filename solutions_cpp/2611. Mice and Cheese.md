# Problem Statement

2611. Mice and Cheese

We have a row of cheese blocks, some of which have holes containing mice. Each cheese block is denoted by a `0` or a `1` where `1` means there is a cheese block and `0` means there is not. A mouse can travel from one cheese block to any other cheese block that's adjacent (i.e., left or right neighbor). Once a mouse moves out of a cheese block, the cheese block becomes unavailable (turns into a `0`).

Write a function to count the minimum number of moves each mouse needs to get out of the cheese row.

# Clarifying Questions:

To ensure comprehensive understanding, letâ€™s ask some clarifying questions:

1. Can mice only move to cheese blocks, or can they move through empty spaces (`0`) as well?
2. Are the moves considered only in terms of adjacent positions?
3. Are we given the initial positions of all the mice?

# Strategy:

Given a string comprised of `0`s and `1`s, where `1` represents cheese blocks and `0` represents empty spaces, we have to calculate the minimum number of moves required for each mouse inside the cheese to exit the cheese row. 

Steps:
1. Iterate through the row and for each `1` found, compute the minimum distance to the nearest `0`.
2. We need an efficient way to find the nearest exit for each `1`.
3. We can maintain two arrays. One array to keep track of the distance to the nearest `0` on the left and another for the distance to the nearest `0` on the right. Combine these arrays to get the minimum distance for each `1`.
4. Finally, output the minimum distances for each `1` in the cheese row.

# Code:

Here's how we can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

std::vector<int> minimumMovesToExit(const std::string &cheeseRow) {
    int n = cheeseRow.size();
    std::vector<int> left(n, INT_MAX);
    std::vector<int> right(n, INT_MAX);
    
    // Fill left distance array
    if (cheeseRow[0] == '0') {
        left[0] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (cheeseRow[i] == '0') {
            left[i] = 0;
        } else {
            if (left[i - 1] != INT_MAX) {
                left[i] = left[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Fill right distance array
    if (cheeseRow[n - 1] == '0') {
        right[n - 1] = 0;
    }
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (cheeseRow[i] == '0') {
            right[i] = 0;
        } else {
            if (right[i + 1] != INT_MAX) {
                right[i] = right[i + 1] + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the minimum distances for each '1' block
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (cheeseRow[i] == '1') {
            int minDistance = std::min(left[i], right[i]);
            result.push_back(minDistance);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string cheeseRow = "010001010";
    std::vector<int> moves = minimumMovesToExit(cheeseRow);
    
    for (int move : moves) {
        std::cout << move << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

# Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the cheese row. This is because we iterate through the cheese row three times sequentially (to fill the left distances, right distances, and finally to calculate the minimum distances for each '1' block). Each pass is linear in complexity.

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional storage used for the left and right distance arrays.
