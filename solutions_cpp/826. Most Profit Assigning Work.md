[Leetcode 826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l826)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three input arrays `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` represents the difficulty of the `i`-th job
- `profit[i]` represents the profit of the `i`-th job
- `worker[j]` represents the ability of the `j`-th worker (max difficulty the worker can do)

Each worker can be assigned at most one job, but only if the job's difficulty is at most the worker's ability. Each worker wants to maximize their profit by doing a job with the highest profit for which they can handle the difficulty.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How is the input size?**
   - `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` are all integer arrays where `1 <= difficulty.length == profit.length <= 10^4` and `1 <= worker.length <= 10^4`.

2. **Are the values in `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` constrained?**
   - Yes, each value (difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[j]) is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

3. **Can there be multiple jobs with the same difficulty and different profits?**
   - Yes, it can happen, which means each job is distinct.

4. **What should be returned?**
   - The total profit sum we can achieve by assigning jobs to workers optimally.

### Strategy

1. **Pair Sorting:**
   - Combine the `difficulty` and `profit` arrays and sort the pairs by difficulty.
  
2. **Prefix Maximum Array:**
   - Create a prefix maximum array such that `maxProfit[i]` stores the maximum profit achievable up to the `i`-th job when sorted by difficulty.

3. **Worker Assignment:**
   - Sort the `worker` array.
   - For each worker, use binary search (or two-pointer technique) to find the most difficult job they can handle and use the `maxProfit` array to get the maximum profit for that difficulty.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
    int n = difficulty.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> jobs;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        jobs.push_back({difficulty[i], profit[i]});
    }
    
    // Sort jobs by difficulty
    sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end());
    
    // Prefix maximum profit array
    vector<int> maxProfits(n);
    maxProfits[0] = jobs[0].second;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        maxProfits[i] = max(maxProfits[i - 1], jobs[i].second);
    }
    
    // Sort worker by their ability
    sort(worker.begin(), worker.end());
    
    int maxTotalProfit = 0;
    int j = 0; // To track the current job index
    
    for (int ability : worker) {
        while (j < n && jobs[j].first <= ability) {
            ++j;
        }
        if (j > 0) {
            maxTotalProfit += maxProfits[j - 1];
        }
    }
    
    return maxTotalProfit;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `jobs` array takes `O(n log n)`.
- Creating the `maxProfits` array takes `O(n)`.
- Sorting the `worker` array takes `O(m log m)`.
- The while loop iterates through the `worker` array and potentially scans all jobs, leading to `O(n + m)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n + m \log m + n + m) \approx O((n + m) \log (n + m)) \]

This is efficient for the given constraints.
