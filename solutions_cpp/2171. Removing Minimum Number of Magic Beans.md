[Leetcode 2171. Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2171)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `beans`, where each integer represents the number of magic beans in one of the jars. You have to remove beans such that the number of beans in each non-empty jar is the same. After performing the operation, return the minimum number of beans you need to remove.

**Constraints:**
1. `1 <= beans.length <= 10^5`
2. `1 <= beans[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q. Do we need to consider jars with zero beans after removal?**
   A. No, jars that end up with zero beans are considered "removed" or emptied, and they don't need to be made equal to the other jars anymore.
   
2. **Q. Can the input array have duplicates?**
   A. Yes, the input array can have duplicate values, and each value represents a distinct jar with that number of beans.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, consider the following strategy:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Start by sorting the array. This will allow us to make calculations easier as we can incrementally check different potential target values (i.e., different values of beans to maintain in all jars).

2. **Calculate Total Beans**:
   - Compute the total number of beans initially in the given jars.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Target Values**:
   - For each unique number of beans in the sorted array, calculate the minimum number of beans to be removed if every jar is to have at least as many beans as this target value.
   - This can be done by fixing each jar to use the corresponding sorted value and removing any excess beans above this level from jars above it, along with removing all beans from jars below this level.

4. **Compute and Compare**:
   - Compute the total number of beans to be removed for each potential target and track the minimum removal across all possibilities.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric> // for accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumRemoval(std::vector<int>& beans) {
        // Sort the array first
        std::sort(beans.begin(), beans.end());
        
        long long totalBeans = std::accumulate(beans.begin(), beans.end(), 0LL);
        long long minRemoval = LLONG_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < beans.size(); ++i) {
            // Calculate the potential number of beans after removals if aiming for beans[i]
            long long currentTarget = beans[i];
            long long removeForCurrentTarget = totalBeans - (currentTarget * (beans.size() - i));
            minRemoval = std::min(minRemoval, removeForCurrentTarget);
        }
        
        return minRemoval;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array takes O(n log n).**
- **Summing the elements takes O(n).**
- **Iterating over the sorted array also takes O(n).**

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which is efficient given the constraints.
