[Leetcode 1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1481)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, find the least number of unique integers after removing exactly `k` elements from the array.

### Example 1
**Input**: `arr = [5, 5, 4]`, `k = 1`  
**Output**: `1`  
**Explanation**: Remove one 5 to get `[5, 4]` which has 2 different integers.

### Example 2
**Input**: `arr = [4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2]`, `k = 3`  
**Output**: `2`  
**Explanation**: Remove three 1's to get `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` which has 4 different integers.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain any integers.
2. **What if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array?**
   - The result would be `0` since we can remove all elements.
3. **What is the range of values for `k` and the size of the array `arr`?**
   - You can assume `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= k <= arr.length`.

## Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Use a hash map or unordered map to count the frequency of each integer in the array.
2. **Sort by Frequency**:
   - Sort the frequencies in ascending order.
3. **Remove Elements**:
   - Iterate through the sorted frequency list and remove elements starting from those with the lowest frequency, decrementing `k` accordingly.
   - Keep track of the number of unique integers.
4. **Return the Count**:
   - Once `k` reach zero or all possible elements are removed in the minimal frequency order, return the count of the remaining unique integers.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    
    // Count the frequency of each integer in the array
    for (int num : arr) {
        ++frequency[num];
    }
    
    // Store the frequencies in a vector
    std::vector<int> freelist;
    for (const auto &entry : frequency) {
        freelist.push_back(entry.second);
    }
    
    // Sort frequencies in ascending order
    std::sort(freelist.begin(), freelist.end());
    
    int uniqueCount = freelist.size();
    
    // Remove k elements starting from the least frequent
    for (int freq : freelist) {
        if (k >= freq) {
            k -= freq;
            --uniqueCount;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return uniqueCount;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {5, 5, 4};
    int k1 = 1;
    std::cout << "Expected Output: 1, Actual Output: " << findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(arr1, k1) << std::endl;

    std::vector<int> arr2 = {4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2};
    int k2 = 3;
    std::cout << "Expected Output: 2, Actual Output: " << findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(arr2, k2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Frequency Counting**: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
2. **Sorting Frequencies**: O(m log m), where m is the number of unique integers.
3. **Element Removal**: O(m), where m is the number of unique integers.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m log m), which is efficient for the given constraints.
