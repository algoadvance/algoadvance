[Leetcode 2972. Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2972)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers and you need to determine the number of "incremovable" subarrays in the given array. An "incremovable" subarray is defined as a subarray that follows certain constraints or properties which typically need to be adhered to. Unfortunately, the detailed constraints that define an "incremovable" subarray are not given, so we'll make reasonable assumptions for this exercise.

### Clarifying Questions
To better understand the problem requirements, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. What specifically constitutes an "incremovable" subarray?
2. Are there any length constraints on valid subarrays?
3. Should the elements in the subarray be distinct?
4. Are we looking for subarrays where the sum/length/frequency of certain elements meet a specific condition?
5. Can negative integers be part of the array?

Since these details are not available, I'll proceed with a common assumption for the problem â€” "incremovable" subarrays could be subarrays that cannot be reordered to achieve lexicographical order. This can be true, for example, if each valid subarray has at least one adjacent pair where the first element is greater than the second.

### Code

Based on our assumptions, here's how we can write a C++ function to count the number of such "incremovable" subarrays.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countIncremovableSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;

        // Iterate over all possible subarray starting points
        for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
            bool found = false;

            // Iterate over all possible subarray ending points
            for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
                // Check if there is at least one pair (nums[i], nums[i+1]) where nums[i] > nums[i+1]
                if (end > start && nums[end - 1] > nums[end]) {
                    found = true;
                }

                // If we found such a pair, the subarray is "incremovable"
                if (found) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1};
    cout << sol.countIncremovableSubarrays(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize the counters to track the number of such valid subarrays.

2. **Iterate Over All Subarrays**: Use nested loops to traverse every possible subarray. The outer loop sets the start of the subarray, and the inner loop extends the subarray to the end.

3. **Check the Condition**: Within the inner loop, check if there is at least one adjacent pair within the current subarray where the left element is greater than the right element. If such a pair is found, consider this subarray as "incremovable".

4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Increment the counter whenever the subarray meets the condition.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we use nested loops to generate all possible subarrays and for each subarray, we perform a constant amount of work (checking adjacent pairs).

### Conclusion

Given a lack of specific definitions, our assumptions might define "incremovable" differently than intended. However, this is a general approach to identify subarrays that can't be simply rearranged to a more ordered state based on an adjacent element comparison. If more specific details about "incremovable" subarrays are provided, the solution might need adjustments accordingly.
