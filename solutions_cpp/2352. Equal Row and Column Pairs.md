[Leetcode 2352. Equal Row and Column Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2352)
## Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the number of pairs `(r, c)` such that row `r` and column `c` are equal.

A row and column are considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the size of the matrix?**
   - The matrix size `n` can range from 1 to 200.
   
2. **What are the possible values for the elements in the matrix?**
   - The elements are integers and could be positive, negative, or zero.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the input will always be a square matrix?**
   - Yes, the input matrix is `n x n`.

4. **Can we assume there will be at least one element in the matrix?**
   - Yes, as `n` ranges from 1 to 200.

Considering these points, let's move to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Extract Rows and Columns Separately:**
   - Create vectors to represent each row and each column of the matrix.
   
2. **Compare Rows and Columns:**
   - For each row, compare it with every column to check if they are identical.

3. **Count Matches:**
   - If a row matches a column exactly, increment the count.

4. **Use Efficient Storage:**
   - Use vectors to store rows and columns as this will facilitate easy comparison.
   
Let's outline the code for this approach step-by-step.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int equalPairs(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        unordered_map<string, int> rowMap;

        // Transform each row to a string and count its occurrences
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            string rowString = vectorToString(grid[i]);
            ++rowMap[rowString];
        }

        int count = 0;

        // Compare each column transformed to a string with the rowMap
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            string colString = "";
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                colString += to_string(grid[i][j]) + ",";
            }
            if (rowMap.find(colString) != rowMap.end()) {
                count += rowMap[colString];
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

private:
    string vectorToString(const vector<int>& vec) {
        string result = "";
        for (int num : vec) {
            result += to_string(num) + ",";
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Transform Rows to String:** O(n^2) because we process each element once while transforming each row and each column.
- **Insert and Lookup in Map:** O(1) on average for each operation due to hashing.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n^2), given that we have operations involving O(n) transformations and comparisons for n rows and columns each.

This complexity is efficient and feasible given the constraints (n up to 200).
