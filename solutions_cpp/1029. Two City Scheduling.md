[Leetcode 1029. Two City Scheduling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1029)
## Problem Statement

The problem "1029. Two City Scheduling" on LeetCode is as follows:

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCost, bCost]`, the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `A` is `aCost`, and the cost of flying the `i`-th person to city `B` is `bCost`.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**:
    - How large can `2n` be?
    - Constraints are provided to be 1 <= n <= 100, meaning `2n` can go up to 200.
  
2. **Cost Constraints**:
    - What are the constraints on the values of `aCost` and `bCost`?
    - Each cost is in the range [1, 1000].

3. **Output**:
    - We need the minimum total cost ensuring that exactly `n` people go to city `A`, and `n` people go to city `B`.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting Strategy**:
    - We need to balance the preference to each city such that total cost is minimized.
    - Idea is to use the difference between costs of flying to city `A` and city `B`. 

2. **Implementation Steps**:
    - Calculate the difference `diff = aCost - bCost` for each person.
    - Sort the array `costs` based on the difference `diff`.
    - This way, those with the smallest difference (most beneficial to go to city `A`) come first and those with the largest negative difference (most beneficial to go to city `B`) come last.
    - Send the first `n` people in the sorted list to city `A` and the other `n` to city `B`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int twoCitySchedCost(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& costs) {
        // Sort the costs based on the difference between costs for city A and city B
        std::sort(costs.begin(), costs.end(), [](std::vector<int>& a, std::vector<int>& b) {
            return (a[0] - a[1]) < (b[0] - b[1]);
        });
        
        int totalCost = 0;
        int n = costs.size() / 2;
        
        // Sum the costs for the first n people to go to city A
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            totalCost += costs[i][0];
        }
        
        // Sum the costs for the remaining n people to go to city B
        for (int i = n; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
            totalCost += costs[i][1];
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Summing Costs**: The time complexity for iterating through and summing the costs is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

This efficient sorting-based approach ensures we achieve the minimum cost by optimally distributing the costs of flying to both cities A and B.
