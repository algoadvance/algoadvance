[Leetcode 636. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l636)
## Problem Statement

636. Exclusive Time of Functions

On a single-threaded CPU, we have a set of `n` functions that are to be executed. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and `n-1`.

Function calls are stored in a *log* stack in the order they were called. The log array is given in the following format:

 - `log[i] = "function_id:start_or_end:timestamp"`, for example: `"0:start:0"` or `"1:end:4"`.
 
Each function has two entries, one with `start` and one with `end`. When a function starts or ends, it does not overlap with any other function.

The `exclusive time` of a function is the time spent running that function, excluding the time spent running other functions called within.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time of the function with the ID `i`.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the `start` and `end` log entries be in any particular order?**
   - No. The entries come in chronological order.

2. **How are nested function calls handled?**
   - When a function is called within another, the time spent on the nested function is not counted towards the parent functionâ€™s execution time.

3. **What does a log `entry` look like?**
   - Each entry is a string in the format `"function_id:start_or_end:timestamp"`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> exclusiveTime(int n, vector<string>& logs) {
    vector<int> result(n, 0);
    stack<int> callStack;
    int prevTime = 0;
    
    for (const string& log : logs) {
        istringstream iss(log);
        string idStr, type, timeStr;
        getline(iss, idStr, ':');
        getline(iss, type, ':');
        getline(iss, timeStr, ':');
        
        int id = stoi(idStr);
        int time = stoi(timeStr);
        
        if (type == "start") {
            if (!callStack.empty()) {
                result[callStack.top()] += time - prevTime;
            }
            callStack.push(id);
            prevTime = time;
        } else {
            result[callStack.top()] += time - prevTime + 1;
            callStack.pop();
            prevTime = time + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Helper function to print vector of integers
void printVector(const vector<int>& v) {
    for (int num : v) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
 
int main() {
    vector<string> logs = {
        "0:start:0",
        "1:start:2",
        "1:end:5",
        "0:end:6"
    };
    int n = 2;
    vector<int> result = exclusiveTime(n, logs);
    
    printVector(result); // Output: [3, 4]
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `result` vector initialized to 0 to store exclusive times.
   - Initialize a `stack` to keep track of function calls.
   - Track `prevTime` to manage the previous timestamp.

2. **Process Each Log Entry**:
   - Parse the current log entry to get `id`, `type`, and `timestamp`.
   - If it's a `"start"` type:
     - Update the exclusive time for the function at the top of the stack.
     - Push the new function `id` onto the stack.
     - Update `prevTime`.
   - If it's an `"end"` type:
     - Calculate and update the exclusive time for the current function.
     - Pop the function from the stack.
     - Update `prevTime`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the `result` vector containing exclusive times for each function.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m) where `m` is the number of log entries. This is because we process each log entry exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the result vector and O(n) for the call stack, where `n` is the number of functions.
