[Leetcode 1425. Constrained Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1425)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of that array such that for every two consecutive integers in the subsequence, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, where `i < j`, the condition `j - i <= k` is satisfied.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input Values:**
   - What is the range of values for the length of `nums` and the values within `nums`?
   - What is the range of the integer `k`?

   **Clarification:** 
   - `nums` will have a length between 1 and 10^5.
   - Each element in `nums` will be between -10^4 and 10^4.
   - `k` will be between 1 and the length of `nums`.

2. **Definition of Subsequence:**
   - Can the subsequence have non-consecutive elements within `nums`?
  
   **Clarification:**
   - Yes, but the distance between any two consecutive elements in the subsequence must be less than or equal to `k`.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming with Deque Optimization:**
   - We utilize dynamic programming (DP) where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum we can obtain ending at index `i`.
   - We will use a deque to keep track of the maximum values in a sliding window of width `k`.
   - This helps efficiently track the largest DP values within the window to compute new DP values.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int constrainedSubsetSum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> dp(n);  // dp[i] will hold the maximum sum ending at index i
    
    deque<int> deq;  // Deque to keep indexes of 'dp' values
    int max_sum = nums[0];
    
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    deq.push_back(0);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        // Remove elements from deque when they are out of 'k' range
        if (!deq.empty() && deq.front() < i - k) {
            deq.pop_front();
        }
        
        // The max value in the current window
        dp[i] = nums[i] + (deq.empty() ? 0 : max(0, dp[deq.front()]));
        
        // Maintain the decreasing order in the deque for efficient max finding
        while (!deq.empty() && dp[i] >= dp[deq.back()]) {
            deq.pop_back();
        }
        
        deq.push_back(i);
        max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[i]);
    }
    
    return max_sum;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` because each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the DP array and the deque. 

This ensures an efficient computation of the maximum constrained subsequence sum.
