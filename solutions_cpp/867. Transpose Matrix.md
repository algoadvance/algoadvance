[Leetcode 867. Transpose Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l867)
## Problem Statement

The problem "Transpose Matrix" can be found as problem number 867 on LeetCode. The task is as follows:

Given a 2D integer array `matrix`, return the transpose of `matrix`.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What size can the matrix be?** 
   - The matrix can have any size within reasonable limits (e.g., \(1 \leq matrix.length, matrix[i].length \leq 1000\)).

2. **What type of elements does the matrix contain?**
   - The elements are integers.

3. **Is it given that the input matrix is always rectangular?**
   - Yes, the input matrix is always rectangular, meaning all rows have the same number of columns.

4. **Can the matrix have negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the matrix can contain any integer values, including negative numbers.

## Strategy

To transpose a matrix, we need to swap the rows and columns of the input matrix. This means that the element at position `[i][j]` in the original matrix will be at position `[j][i]` in the transposed matrix.

### Steps:
1. Determine the dimensions of the input matrix.
2. Initialize a new matrix with flipped dimensions (number of rows becomes the number of columns and vice versa).
3. Populate the new matrix by assigning `transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j]`.
4. Return the transposed matrix.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this operation is \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the input matrix. This is because each element must be accessed once to be placed in the transposed matrix.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> transpose(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> transposed(n, vector<int>(m));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return transposed;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Explanation of the Code
1. Determine the dimensions of the matrix:
   - `m` is the number of rows in the input matrix.
   - `n` is the number of columns in the input matrix.
2. Create a new matrix `transposed` with dimensions `n` x `m`.
3. Use nested loops to iterate over each element in the original matrix:
   - The outer loop iterates over the rows `i`.
   - The inner loop iterates over the columns `j`.
   - Assign the element `matrix[i][j]` to `transposed[j][i]`.
4. Finally, return the transposed matrix.

This solution efficiently transposes the input matrix with a clear O(m * n) time complexity.
