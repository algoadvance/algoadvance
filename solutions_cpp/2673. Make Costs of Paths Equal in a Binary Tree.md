[Leetcode 2673. Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2673)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an unweighted binary tree with `n` nodes, and each node has a cost associated with it. Your task is to make the costs of all paths from the root to the leaves equal. The cost of a path is defined as the sum of the costs of the nodes on that path.

You are allowed to only increase the cost of any node, and you need to determine the minimum total cost necessary to achieve this goal.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Understanding the input/output:**
   - The input is a binary tree represented by its root node.
   - Each node has a value representing its current cost.
   - The output should be the minimum cost needed to make all root-to-leaf path costs equal.

2. **Constraints and validations:**
   - What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?
   - Are there any constraints on the values of the node costs?
   - Can the costs of the nodes be negative, or are they always non-negative?

By assuming typical constraints for a binary tree problem, like a max of around \(10^4\) nodes and non-negative costs, we can proceed to plan the solution.

## Strategy:
1. **Tree Traversal to Identify Paths:**
   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to record all root-to-leaf paths and their associated costs.

2. **Identify Maximum Path Cost:**
   - During DFS traversal, keep track of the maximum path cost from the root to any leaf.

3. **Calculate Required Increases:**
   - For each path, calculate the difference between its cost and the maximum path cost.
   - The total increment needed for each path to match the maximum path cost should be summed up.

4. **Return Total Increment Cost:**
   - Return the sum of the required increments to reach equal path costs.

## Code:
Here's the implementation to achieve the desired outcome in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int minCostEqualPaths(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        
        vector<int> pathCosts;
        findPathCosts(root, 0, pathCosts);
        
        int maxCost = *max_element(pathCosts.begin(), pathCosts.end());
        
        int totalIncrease = 0;
        for(int cost : pathCosts) {
            totalIncrease += (maxCost - cost);
        }
        
        return totalIncrease;
    }
    
private:
    void findPathCosts(TreeNode* node, int currentCost, vector<int>& pathCosts) {
        if(!node) return;
        
        currentCost += node->val;
        
        if(!node->left && !node->right) { // Leaf node
            pathCosts.push_back(currentCost);
        } else {
            findPathCosts(node->left, currentCost, pathCosts);
            findPathCosts(node->right, currentCost, pathCosts);
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Traversal Cost:**
  - The DFS traversal of the binary tree has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes.
  
- **Cost Computation:**
  - Calculating the maximum path cost and summing up the needed increments also operates within \(O(n)\).

Overall, the solution has a linear time complexity of \(O(n)\).

With these steps and considerations, you should be able to effectively address the problem of making the costs of paths equal in a binary tree.
