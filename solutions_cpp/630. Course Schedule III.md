[Leetcode 630. Course Schedule III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l630)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `courses` where `courses[i]` = `[duration_i, lastDay_i]` indicate that the ith course should be taken continuously for `duration_i` days and must be finished before or on `lastDay_i`. 

You start on the 1st day and can only take one course at a time. Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the `courses` array guarantee unique courses (i.e., no duplicates)?**
   - Yes, each element in the `courses` array represents a unique course with different durations and deadlines.
   
2. **Are the durations and last days always positive integers?**
   - Yes, both `duration_i` and `lastDay_i` are always positive integers.

3. **What is the maximum number of courses that can fit in the array?**
   - According to the problem constraints, the number of courses can go up to 10^4.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a Greedy Algorithm with the help of a Max-Heap (priority queue). The steps are as follows:

1. **Sort Courses by Deadline**: First, sort the courses by their `lastDay` value to try and finish courses as soon as their deadline allows.
2. **Use a Max-Heap to Track Course Durations**: To decide whether to take a course or not, we use a max-heap to keep track of the longest durations of courses we have taken so far.
  - If taking a new course exceeds the total days available until its deadline, we check if this new course has a shorter duration compared to the longest duration course we have taken. If it does, we can replace the longest duration course with the new course to free up days.
3. **Iterate Through Courses**: For each course, decide using the logic above. Add the course duration to the heap if it can be taken without violating deadlines or if it helps in replacing a longer duration course.
4. **Count Courses Taken**: The size of the heap at the end will give the maximum number of courses you can take.

### Time Complexity

Sorting the courses will take \(O(n \log n)\). Each course is pushed and potentially popped from the heap, giving us \(O(n \log n)\) operations due to the heap operations. Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int scheduleCourse(vector<vector<int>>& courses) {
        // Step 1: Sort courses by deadline (lastDay)
        sort(courses.begin(), courses.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[1] < b[1];
        });

        // Step 2: Use a max-heap to keep track of course durations
        priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
        int totalTime = 0;

        for (const auto& course : courses) {
            int duration = course[0];
            int lastDay = course[1];

            // If we can take this course without violating its deadline
            if (totalTime + duration <= lastDay) {
                totalTime += duration;
                maxHeap.push(duration);
            } else if (!maxHeap.empty() && maxHeap.top() > duration) {
                // If the current course requires less time and we can replace a longer one
                totalTime -= maxHeap.top(); // Remove longest course time
                maxHeap.pop();
                totalTime += duration;  // Add current course time
                maxHeap.push(duration);  // Push current course duration
            }
        }

        // The size of max-heap is the maximum number of courses that can be taken
        return maxHeap.size();
    }
};
```

This code sorts the input courses by their deadline and uses a max-heap to track the longest duration courses taken so far to maximize the number of courses that can be completed within their deadlines.
