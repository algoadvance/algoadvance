[Leetcode 1799. Maximize Score After N Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1799)
### Problem Statement

You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of size `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations to maximize your score. In the `i-th` operation `(1-indexed)`, you will:

1. Choose two elements, `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
2. Remove them from the array.
3. Your score increases by `i * gcd(nums[i], nums[j])`, where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing `n` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

Before starting with the solution, let's clarify a few details:

1. What is guaranteed about the size of the array `nums`?
   - The size of `nums` is strictly `2 * n`, meaning it is always even.
   
2. What is the range of values in the `nums` array?
   - `nums` can contain positive integers.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of `n`?
   - Typical constraints might be provided in the problem, such as `1 <= n <= 7`, which implies that the maximum size of `nums` can be `14`.

With this clarification in mind, let's move towards a strategy.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to use Dynamic Programming (DP) with bit manipulation to keep track of chosen elements. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Bitmask Representation**: Use a bitmask to represent which elements have been chosen. The bitmask will have `2 * n` bits for the possible states of each element.
2. **DP State Definition**: Define `dp[mask]` as the maximum score achievable with the elements corresponding to the bitmask `mask`.
3. **Transition**: For each pair (i, j) of elements that have not been chosen (checked using the bitmask), compute the new value by choosing these two elements in the current operation and update the state.
4. **Recursive Relation**: Use recursion with memoization to explore all possible pairs and states efficiently.
5. **Base Case**: Start from the base case where no elements are chosen (`mask = 0`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size() / 2;
        vector<int> dp(1 << (2 * n), -1);
        return helper(dp, nums, 0, 1, n);
    }

private:
    int helper(vector<int>& dp, vector<int>& nums, int mask, int k, int n) {
        if (dp[mask] != -1) {
            return dp[mask];
        }
        if (k > n) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
            if (!(mask & (1 << i))) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < 2 * n; ++j) {
                    if (!(mask & (1 << j))) {
                        int newMask = mask | (1 << i) | (1 << j);
                        int currentScore = k * gcd(nums[i], nums[j]);
                        res = max(res, currentScore + helper(dp, nums, newMask, k + 1, n));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        dp[mask] = res;
        return res;
    }
    
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis is crucial:

- **State Space**: There are `2^(2*n)` possible states for the different masks, so we have to potentially fill this entire space.
- **Transitions**: For each state, generating transitions involves nested loops within `2*n`, leading to transitions in `O((2n)^2)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:

\[ \mathcal{O}(2^{2n} \times (2n)^2) \]

Given the constraints (e.g., `1 \leq n \leq 7`), this is feasible since \(2^{14}\) is manageable within computational limits.
