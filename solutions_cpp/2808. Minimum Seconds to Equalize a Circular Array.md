[Leetcode 2808. Minimum Seconds to Equalize a Circular Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2808)
### Problem Statement

You are given a circular array `nums` of positive integers. You are allowed to perform any number of operations on the array. In one operation, you can choose one element of the array and change it to any of its neighbors.
Your task is to find the minimum number of seconds required to make all elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the modifications allowed to wrap around from the last element to the first element (and vice-versa) since the array is circular?**
   - Yes, the array is circular.

2. **What is the maximum size of the array?**
   - The constraints will specify this, but typical constraints are up to \(10^5\) elements.

3. **What is the range of values for the integers in the array?**
   - The integers are positive and typically bounded by the problem constraints, but this won't usually affect the algorithm's approach.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Circular Property:** Leverage the circular nature of the array, meaning the element after the last one is the first element.

2. **Initial Step Approach:** Identify the minimum seconds to equalize by each unique element in the array, considering the circular property.

3. **Distance Calculation:** For each element in the array, calculate the maximum distance (in terms of operations) needed to change contiguous segments to a particular element.

4. **Result:** The result would be the smallest of these maximum distances, which represents the minimum number of seconds required.

### Code
Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minSecondsToEqualize(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> positions;
    
    // Store positions of each element
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        positions[nums[i]].push_back(i);
    }
    
    int minSeconds = n; // Initialize to a large number
    
    // For each unique element, calculate the max gap
    for (const auto& p : positions) {
        const vector<int>& pos = p.second;
        int maxGap = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < pos.size(); ++i) {
            int current = pos[i];
            int next = pos[(i + 1) % pos.size()];
            int gap = (next - current + n) % n;
            maxGap = max(maxGap, gap);
        }
        
        // Calculate the minimum seconds required for this particular element
        minSeconds = min(minSeconds, (maxGap + 1) / 2);
    }
    
    return minSeconds;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 1, 3, 1, 2};
    int result = minSecondsToEqualize(nums);
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n):** Storing positions of each element runs in linear time relative to the size of the array.
- **O(m):** Iterating through each unique element's positions and calculating maximum gaps involves iterating through potentially every position.

Where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(m\) is the number of unique elements. Since in the worst case \(m\) is also \(O(n)\), the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Explanation

- **Step 1:** Store the positions of each element using a hash map.
- **Step 2:** For each unique element, compute the maximum circular gap between occurrences.
- **Step 3:** Calculate the minimal operations needed, which is derived from the maximum gap.
- **Step 4:** Return the smallest computed value across all unique elements, representing the minimal seconds to equalize the array.
