[Leetcode 1253. Reconstruct a 2](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1253)
Sure! Let's go through this step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given three integers: `upper`, `lower`, and `colsum`, where:
1. `upper` is the number of 1s in the first row.
2. `lower` is the number of 1s in the second row.
3. `colsum` is a list of integers where each integer can be 0, 1, or 2. The length of `colsum` is the number of columns in the matrix, and the integers represent the sum of the elements in both rows for the respective column.

You need to reconstruct and return a 2-row binary matrix (with elements 0 or 1) that meets the given conditions, or return an empty list if it's not possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Bounds**: What are the possible ranges for `upper`, `lower`, and the values in `colsum`?
2. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if `upper` or `lower` cannot be satisfied for a given `colsum`?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll proceed with the following steps:
1. Initialize two lists to represent the two rows of the matrix.
2. Iterate through the `colsum` to fill up the matrix columns while maintaining the count for `upper` and `lower`.
3. Manage these counts (i.e., `upper` and `lower`) carefully to maintain the invariant that both counts must not exceed their respective initial values and they should become zero exactly when the list `colsum` is exhausted.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructMatrix(int upper, int lower, vector<int>& colsum) {
        int n = colsum.size();
        vector<vector<int>> result(2, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (colsum[i] == 2) {
                if (upper > 0 && lower > 0) {
                    result[0][i] = 1;
                    result[1][i] = 1;
                    --upper;
                    --lower;
                } else {
                    return {};  // Impossible to form the matrix
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Fill the remaining places
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (colsum[i] == 1) {
                if (upper > 0) {
                    result[0][i] = 1;
                    --upper;
                } else if (lower > 0) {
                    result[1][i] = 1;
                    --lower;
                } else {
                    return {};  // Impossible to form the matrix
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if all upper and lower counts are used
        if (upper != 0 || lower != 0) {
            return {};  // Impossible to form the matrix
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Driver code to test above logic
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> colsum = {2, 2, 1, 1};
    int upper = 2;
    int lower = 3;
    vector<vector<int>> result = sol.reconstructMatrix(upper, lower, colsum);
    
    if (!result.empty()) {
        for (const auto& row : result) {
            for (int val : row) {
                cout << val << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }
    } else {
        cout << "[]"<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `colsum`, since we are iterating through the list a constant number of times. The space complexity is \(O(n)\) as well, due to the construction of the result matrix.

This approach ensures that we check and place values column by column while maintaining constraints on the counts of `upper` and `lower`. If any constraints are violated or if we cannot meet the requirements by the end, we return an empty list indicating it's impossible to form such a matrix.
