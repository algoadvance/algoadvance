[Leetcode 526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l526)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. A permutation of the first `n` positive integers is considered **beautiful** if for every `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), one of the following is true:

1. `i` is divisible by the element at the `i-th` position.
2. The element at the `i-th` position is divisible by `i`.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of the **beautiful arrangements** that you can construct.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - `n` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 15.
   
2. **What should the function return if `n` is 1?**
   - The result should be 1 since there is only one permutation of `{1}` which is trivially beautiful.

3. **Is there any specific input format?**
   - The input will be a single integer `n`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a backtracking approach:
1. Generate permutations of the first `n` positive integers.
2. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the conditions of a beautiful arrangement.
3. Count all the permutations that are beautiful arrangements.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Generate Permutations**: Use backtracking to generate permutations of the list `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
2. **Check Permutation**: For each permutation, check if each element at position `i` satisfies the beautiful arrangement conditions, i.e., `i` is divisible by the element at the `i-th` position or the element at the `i-th` position is divisible by `i`.
3. **Count Beautiful Arrangements**: Maintain a count of all valid (beautiful) permutations.

## Time Complexity

- Backtracking itself generates all permutations which is `O(n!)`.
- Checking each permutation takes `O(n)` time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * n!)`.

Now, let's implement the solution.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countArrangement(int n) {
        if (n < 1) return 0;
        
        std::vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
        return countArrangementHelper(n, 1, visited);
    }
    
private:
    int countArrangementHelper(int n, int pos, std::vector<bool>& visited) {
        if (pos > n) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i] && (i % pos == 0 || pos % i == 0)) {
                visited[i] = true;
                count += countArrangementHelper(n, pos + 1, visited);
                visited[i] = false;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. The function `countArrangement` initializes a `visited` array to keep track of which numbers have been used.
2. It calls the helper function `countArrangementHelper` starting from position 1.
3. The helper function recursively tries to place each number from 1 to `n` in the current position (`pos`), ensuring the beautiful arrangement condition.
4. Once `pos` exceeds `n`, it means a valid arrangement has been found, and it returns 1.
5. If a valid number is placed at position `pos`, the function recurses for the next position.
6. The `visited` array ensures that each number is used only once per arrangement.
