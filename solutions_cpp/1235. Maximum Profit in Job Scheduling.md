[Leetcode 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1235)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` jobs, where every job is represented by three integers `startTime[i]`, `endTime[i]` and `profit[i]`. You need to find the maximum profit you can achieve provided that no two jobs in the subset you select overlap. 

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: startTime = [1, 2, 3, 3], endTime = [3, 4, 5, 6], profit = [50, 10, 40, 70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
             Profit earned 50 + 70 = 120.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: startTime = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], endTime = [3, 5, 10, 6, 9], profit = [20, 20, 100, 70, 60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
             Profit earned 20 + 70 + 60 = 150.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: startTime = [1, 1, 1], endTime = [2, 3, 4], profit = [5, 6, 4]
Output: 6
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays of the same length?
   - **Yes**, you can assume they are of the same length.
2. Are the values in the arrays non-negative and within a reasonable range?
   - **Yes**, all values are non-negative and within typical input constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Combine and Sort**: Combine the input arrays into a single list of tuples or structs and sort it based on job end times. Sorting by end times will help us to decide the maximum profit by considering non-overlapping jobs in a systematic manner.
2. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: Utilize dynamic programming to store the maximum profit up to each job. For each job, use binary search to find the last job that finishes before the current job starts. This allows efficient computation of maximum profits without overlap.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Job {
    int start, end, profit;
};

bool compare(Job& a, Job& b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
}

int jobScheduling(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, vector<int>& profit) {
    int n = startTime.size();
    vector<Job> jobs(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        jobs[i] = { startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i] };
    }

    // Sort jobs based on end time
    sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), compare);

    // DP array to store the maximum profit up to each job
    vector<int> dp(n, 0);
    dp[0] = jobs[0].profit;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int profitIncludingCurrent = jobs[i].profit;

        // Find the last non-overlapping job using binary search
        int lo = 0, hi = i - 1;
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (jobs[mid].end <= jobs[i].start) {
                if (jobs[mid + 1].end <= jobs[i].start)
                    lo = mid + 1;
                else {
                    profitIncludingCurrent += dp[mid];
                    break;
                }
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], profitIncludingCurrent);
    }

    return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> startTime = {1, 2, 3, 3};
    vector<int> endTime = {3, 4, 5, 6};
    vector<int> profit = {50, 10, 40, 70};
    cout << "Maximum profit: " << jobScheduling(startTime, endTime, profit) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of jobs.
2. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: Each DP step involves a binary search, which is `O(log n)`, performed `n` times, resulting in `O(n log n)`.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`.

This approach helps efficiently compute the maximum profit achievable by selecting non-overlapping jobs.
