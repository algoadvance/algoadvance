[Leetcode 2568. Minimum Impossible OR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2568)
### Problem Statement

2568. Minimum Impossible OR-out

Given a list of integers nums, representing the bitwise OR result of some subset of the array nums, find the minimum impossible positive integer. 

The bitwise OR of a set is the result of applying the bitwise OR operation to all of the elements of the set. For example, the bitwise OR of the set [1, 2, 4] is 7.

Return the minimum positive integer that does not appear as a possible OR-out of a subset of the given list.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4]
Output: 8
Explanation: All of the possible subset bitwise OR results are:
- {}  --> 0
- {1}  --> 1
- {2}  --> 2
- {4}  --> 4
- {1, 2}  --> 3
- {1, 4}  --> 5
- {2, 4}  --> 6
- {1, 2, 4}  --> 7

As we can see, every number from 0 to 7 is possible, so the minimum impossible positive integer is 8.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** What is the size range of the input list and the value range of its elements?
2. **Output uniqueness:** Are there multiple valid answers, or is there always a unique minimum positive integer that cannot be obtained?
3. **Edge cases:** Should we worry about empty arrays or all elements being the same?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Thoughts:** The basic idea is to find the smallest integer not represented by any possible subset OR result of the given list.
2. **Set Approach:** We'll use sets to track all possible OR results.
3. **Iterative Calculation:** We'll iterate through the `nums` and update our set iteratively to cover all possible OR results.
4. **Determine Missing Value:** Once all results are tracked up to a certain range, we find the minimum integer not present in the set.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int minimumImpossibleOrOut(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_set<int> possibleOrResults;
    possibleOrResults.insert(0);  // Include the OR result of an empty subset
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        std::unordered_set<int> newResults = possibleOrResults;
        for (int res : possibleOrResults) {
            newResults.insert(res | num);
        }
        possibleOrResults = std::move(newResults);
    }
    
    int missingInt = 1;
    while (possibleOrResults.find(missingInt) != possibleOrResults.end()) {
        missingInt++;
    }
    
    return missingInt;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 4};
    std::cout << "Minimum impossible OR-out: " << minimumImpossibleOrOut(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization and Filling Set:** For each element in the list, we'll iterate through all current OR results. In the worst case, the number of results grows exponentially with the number of elements. Therefore, this step could potentially be O(N * 2^N) in the worst scenario.
- **Finding Missing Integer:** Finding the missing integer requires a linear pass through the consecutive integer set, which is O(N).

The overall complexity is dominated by the exponential growth of tracking all possible OR results: **O(N * 2^N)**.
