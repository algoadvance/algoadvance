[Leetcode 453. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l453)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, you need to find the minimum number of moves required to make all elements equal. In one move, you can increment `n - 1` elements by 1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can the array contain negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative integers as well as zero.
   
2. **Q:** Is the array allowed to contain duplicate numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicate numbers.

3. **Q:** Is there a constraint on the size of the array?
   **A:** The typical constraints apply, however, we should presume that `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we need to efficiently determine the minimum moves required to make all the elements equal. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Understanding the Operation**:
    - Incrementing `n - 1` elements by 1 is equivalent to decrementing one element by 1 when considering the offset to balance all elements.
    - Thus, making all elements equal is equivalent to reducing every element to the minimum element in the array.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
    - If we reduce all elements to the minimum element in the array, the number of moves required is the sum of the difference between each element and the minimum element.

### Plan:
1. Find the minimum element in the array.
2. Compute the sum of the differences between each element and the minimum element.
3. Return the computed sum.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minMoves(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int minElement = *std::min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int moves = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        moves += num - minElement;
    }
    
    return moves;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    std::cout << "Minimum moves required: " << minMoves(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is \(O(n)\) where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  - Finding the minimum element takes \(O(n)\) time.
  - Calculating the sum of differences also takes \(O(n)\) time.
- Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n) + O(n) = O(n)\).

This efficiency ensures the solution is scalable and handles the upper constraint limits gracefully.
