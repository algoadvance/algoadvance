[Leetcode 372. Super Pow](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l372)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integers `a` and an array of integers `b` that represents an extremely large integer. You need to calculate `a` raised to the power of this large integer (`a^b`) modulo `1337`.

Example:
- Input: `a = 2`, `b = [3]`
- Output: `8`

- Input: `a = 2`, `b = [1, 0]`
- Output: `1024`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= a <= 2^31 - 1`
- `1 <= b.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= b[i] <= 9`
- `b` does not contain leading zeros.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can `b` contain leading zeros?
   **A**: No, `b` does not contain leading zeros.
   
2. **Q**: What is the modulo value we need to compute?
   **A**: The modulo value is `1337`.

3. **Q**: What is the maximum length of array `b`?
   **A**: The maximum length of the array `b` is 2000.

4. **Q**: Should the solution handle extremely large integers efficiently?
   **A**: Yes, use appropriate methods to handle the extremely large power efficiently.

## Strategy
Given the constraints, we can't directly compute `a^b` as `b` can be very large. Instead, we can utilize properties of modular arithmetic, particularly Euler's theorem and modular exponentiation.

### Steps:
1. **Modular Exponentiation**:
   - We'll use the function `powmod(a, k, mod)` that computes `(a^k) % mod` using iterative squaring for efficiency.

2. **Breaking the problem**:
   - We will process each digit in the array `b` in reverse, treating it like a big integer.

3. **Combining results using properties**:
   - We need to compute the result in parts and combine using `(a^b) % mod = (a^(b1*10^k + b2*10^(k-1) + ... + bn)) % mod`.

### Time Complexity
The solution will be efficient with time complexity approximately `O(N * log(M))`, where `N` is the length of `b` and `M` is the largest value of `a`.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    const int MOD = 1337;

    int powmod(int a, int k, int mod) {
        a %= mod;
        int result = 1;
        while (k > 0) {
            if (k % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * a) % mod;
            }
            a = (a * a) % mod;
            k /= 2;
        }
        return result;
    }

public:
    int superPow(int a, vector<int>& b) {
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < b.size(); ++i) {
            result = powmod(result, 10, MOD) * powmod(a, b[i], MOD) % MOD;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **powmod function**:
   - Efficiently calculates `(a^k) % mod` using iterative squaring with time complexity `O(log k)`.

2. **superPow function**:
   - Iterates through each element of `b` (considering it as a large number).
   - Combines the results effectively using properties of modular exponentiation.

This strategy ensures that even for large values of `b`, the computation remains feasible within constraints.
