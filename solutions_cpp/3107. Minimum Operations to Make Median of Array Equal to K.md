[Leetcode 3107. Minimum Operations to Make Median of Array Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3107)
## Problem Statement
We are tasked with finding the minimum number of operations required to set the median of a given array to `K`. In each operation, we can add or subtract 1 from any element of the array.

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `K`, return the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the array equal to `K`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input:
nums = [1, 3, 3, 2, 4]
K = 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
To make the median 3, you could:
- Decrease 4 by 1 (4 -> 3)
- Increase 1 by 1 (1 -> 2)
So the minimum operations are 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of the median in this context?**
   - For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element after sorting.
   - For an even-length array, the median can be either of the two central elements. 

2. **Can the elements of `nums` include negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can include negative numbers.

3. **Is there a limit to the size or value of elements in `nums`?**
   - Yes, the constraints of the problem specify that the length and values of the array vary within reasonable limits to ensure it runs efficiently.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting:** The initial step is to simplify finding the median by sorting the array.
2. **Find the Median:** After sorting:
   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the array length is even, consider the lower of the two central elements as the median.
3. **Calculate Operations:** Traverse the array and compute the absolute difference between each element and `K`, summing these differences to determine the total number of operations.

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The sorting operation has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Counting Operations:** Calculating the number of operations is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

int minOperationsToMakeMedianEqualK(std::vector<int>& nums, int K) {
    // Sorting the array to help find the median
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    int n = nums.size();
    int medianIndex = n / 2;
    
    // Median for an odd-length array or selecting the smaller of the two central elements for an even-length array
    int median = nums[medianIndex];
    
    // Calculate total operations required to make the median of the array equal to K
    int operations = std::abs(median - K);
    
    return operations;
}
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how you might call this function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 3, 2, 4};
    int K = 3;
    
    int result = minOperationsToMakeMedianEqualK(nums, K);
    std::cout << "Minimum operations to make median equal to " << K << ": " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code computes the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the array equal to `K`.
