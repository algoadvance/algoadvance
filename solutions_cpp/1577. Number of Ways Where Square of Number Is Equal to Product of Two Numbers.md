[Leetcode 1577. Number of Ways Where Square of Number Is Equal to Product of Two Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1577)
### Problem Statement
Given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`, return the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` such that:

- `nums1[i] * nums1[i]` is equal to `nums2[j] * nums2[k]`, where `0 <= i < nums1.length` and `0 <= j < k < nums2.length`.
- `nums2[j] * nums2[j]` is equal to `nums1[i] * nums1[k]`, where `0 <= j < nums2.length` and `0 <= i < k < nums1.length`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the arrays contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the arrays can have negative numbers as there is no restriction mentioned against it.
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the arrays?**
   - While the problem statement does not explicitly mention constraints, it is typical to expect that the lengths of the arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) can go up to \(10^3\) for competitive programming problems.
3. **Are there duplicate elements in the arrays?**
   - Yes, arrays can have duplicate elements as it is not restricted by the problem statement.
4. **What about the result of calculations leading to a square or product of two large numbers, should we worry about integer overflows?**
   - For the current scope, we assume the calculations will fit within the standard integer range as per constraints \( -10^9 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^9 \).

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequency:** Use hash maps (`std::unordered_map`) to count the frequency of each product in both arrays.
2. **Calculate Triplets:**
   - For each `nums1[i]`, check if the square of `nums1[i]` is a product in `nums2` and count appropriate pairs.
   - Similarly, for each `nums2[j]`, check if the square of `nums2[j]` is a product in `nums1` and count appropriate pairs.

### Code
Here is the C++ code to implement the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numTriplets(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        unordered_map<long long, int> prod1, prod2;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count products of pairs in nums1
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums1.size(); ++j) {
                long long prod = (long long)nums1[i] * nums1[j];
                prod1[prod]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Count products of pairs in nums2
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums2.size(); ++j) {
                long long prod = (long long)nums2[i] * nums2[j];
                prod2[prod]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Check for each square in nums1 and find matching pairs in nums2
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); ++i) {
            long long square = (long long)nums1[i] * nums1[i];
            if (prod2.find(square) != prod2.end()) {
                count += prod2[square];
            }
        }
        
        // Check for each square in nums2 and find matching pairs in nums1
        for (int i = 0; i < nums2.size(); ++i) {
            long long square = (long long)nums2[i] * nums2[i];
            if (prod1.find(square) != prod1.end()) {
                count += prod1[square];
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Counting product pairs in `nums1`: \(O(N_1^2)\)
  - Counting product pairs in `nums2`: \(O(N_2^2)\)
- **Querying:**
  - Querying squares in `nums1` against product hash map of `nums2`: \(O(N_1)\)
  - Querying squares in `nums2` against product hash map of `nums1`: \(O(N_2)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(N_1^2 + N_2^2)\), where \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

### Space Complexity
- **Space for hash maps:**
  - In the worst case, each hash map could have \(O(N_1^2)\) or \(O(N_2^2)\) entries.

Thus, the space complexity is \(O(N_1^2 + N_2^2)\).
