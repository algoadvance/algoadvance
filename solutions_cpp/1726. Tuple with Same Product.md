[Leetcode 1726. Tuple with Same Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1726)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of integers. Create as many tuples as possible `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a, b, c, d` are elements of `nums`, and `a != b != c != d`. The order of the elements in the tuple doesn't matter.

Return the number of such tuples.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same element be used more than once?**
   - Within the tuple `(a, b, c, d)`, elements must be distinct. However, the same number can appear in multiple different tuples.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values and size of `nums`?**
   - Itâ€™s important to know the size and range to better understand the efficiency needed.
   - Typical constraints for such problems are that `nums` length is up to `10^4` and the values are within a manageable range.

3. **What should be returned if no such tuples exist?**
   - Simply return 0 in this case.

### Strategy

1. **Product Mapping:**
   - We can use a hash map to store the products of all pairs of elements in `nums`.
   - The key in the hash map will be the product, and the value will be a list of pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums[i] * nums[j] = product`.

2. **Count Tuples:**
   - For each product that appears in the map, if there are `k` pairs that produce this product, we can form `k*(k-1)/2` unique pairs of pairs (and each pair of pairs generates exactly 8 valid permutations of `(a, b, c, d)`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int tupleSameProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> productMap;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Store pairs of indices that produce the same product
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                int product = nums[i] * nums[j];
                productMap[product].emplace_back(i, j);
            }
        }
        
        // Count valid (a, b, c, d) tuples
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& entry : productMap) {
            int numPairs = entry.second.size();
            if (numPairs > 1) {
                // Number of ways to choose two pairs from numPairs is C(numPairs, 2)
                count += numPairs * (numPairs - 1) / 2 * 8; // Each pair contributes 8 permutations
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity

- **Pair generation:** O(n^2) because we consider all pairs from `nums`.
- **Hash map insertion:** each insertion is O(1) on average.
- **Counting tuples:** We iterate over the hash map, which is O(p), where p is the number of unique products. This gives us O(n^2) in the worst case scenario where all products are different.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**. 

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough to handle the problem.
