[Leetcode 461. Hamming Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l461)
### Problem Statement
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. 

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return the Hamming distance between them.

### Example
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1 (in binary):   0001
4 (in binary):   0100
The Hamming distance is 2 because there are two positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the integers x and y?**
   - Typically, this will be within the typical 32-bit signed integer range, but good to confirm.
   
2. **Do we need to consider negative integers?**
   - In most cases for this problem, you can assume non-negative integers.

3. **Do we need to handle edge cases like when x and y are the same?**
   - Yes, but the Hamming distance will naturally be 0 in this case.

### Strategy
1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation (`^`) between two bits results in `1` if the bits are different and `0` if they are the same. Thus, XORing the two numbers will result in a number whose binary representation has `1`s in positions where the corresponding bits of the original numbers differ.
2. **Counting the Bits**: To find the number of differing bits, we need to count the number of `1`s in this resultant number. This can be done using bit manipulation techniques or using built-in functions.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
    int xor_val = x ^ y;
    int distance = 0;
    while (xor_val > 0) {
        if (xor_val & 1) {
            distance++;
        }
        xor_val >>= 1;
    }
    return distance;
}

int main() {
    int x = 1;
    int y = 4;
    cout << "Hamming Distance between " << x << " and " << y << " is " << hammingDistance(x, y) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **XOR Calculation**: The XOR of `x` and `y` is computed with `int xor_val = x ^ y;`.
2. **Bit Counting**: Initialize `distance` to 0. While `xor_val` is greater than 0, check the least significant bit (LSB) using `xor_val & 1`. If the LSB is `1`, increment the `distance`. Shift `xor_val` right by one bit (`xor_val >>= 1;`) and continue until all bits are checked.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because, in the worst case, you would perform a constant number of operations (32 for a 32-bit number). Each bit is checked and counted only once.
  
The space complexity is `O(1)` as only a few integer variables are used, independent of the input values.
