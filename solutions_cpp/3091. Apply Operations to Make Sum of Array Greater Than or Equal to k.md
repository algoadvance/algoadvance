[Leetcode 3091. Apply Operations to Make Sum of Array Greater Than or Equal to k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3091)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can either:

1. Remove an element from the beginning or the end of the array `nums`, or
2. Add an integer to `nums`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array greater than or equal to `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums`?
    - What are the constraints on the elements of the array?
    - What is the range for integer `k`?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return the minimum number of operations as an integer?

3. **Operations Allowed**:
    - To clarify, we can both remove elements from either end and/or add new integers?

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - What if the array is already empty or has just one element?
    - What are the possible values for the integers added to the array? Can they be positive, negative, or zero?

## Strategy

1. **Sum Comparison**: First, calculate the current sum of the array.
2. **Check if Sufficient**: If the sum is already greater than or equal to `k`, no operations are needed.
3. **Remove Elements**: If the sum is less than `k`, compute how many elements can be removed from the beginning or the end of the array.
4. **Add Elements**: If the removal alone cannot achieve the required sum, calculate how many elements of minimum value need to be added to achieve the sum.

### Steps to Implement

1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Check if the sum is already >= `k`.
3. Use two pointers to try removing elements from either end to see if the sum can be achieved.
4. Calculate the number of minimum value additions required if removal alone is insufficient.

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the sum of the array takes O(n).
- The two-pointer technique for checking removal takes O(n).
- The final step of calculating additional required elements is O(1).

Total time complexity will be O(n).

## Code

Here is one possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int currentSum = 0;
    
    // Calculate the initial sum of the array
    for (int num : nums) {
        currentSum += num;
    }
    
    // If the current sum is already greater than or equal to k, no operations are needed
    if (currentSum >= k) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Two pointer technique
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    int minOperations = INT_MAX;
    int sum = currentSum;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        if (sum >= k) {
            minOperations = std::min(minOperations, (n - (right - left + 1)));
            sum -= nums[left++];
        } else {
            sum -= nums[right--];
        }
    }

    // If we could already perform enough operations by just removing elements
    if (sum >= k) {
        minOperations = std::min(minOperations, (n - (right - left + 1)));
    }

    // If the sum is still less than `k`, calculate how many parts we need to add
    int additionalSumNeeded = k - sum;

    // Number of additions required if only using 1s (assuming `1` as smallest unit addition)
    int additionsRequired = additionalSumNeeded;
    
    return std::min(minOperations, minOperations + additionsRequired);
}
```

This implementation is based on iterating with a two-pointer technique to see if removing elements can get the sum close enough to `k`, and calculating the minimal number of additions required afterward.

### Note
Always test the solution with multiple edge cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.
