[Leetcode 846. Hand of Straights](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l846)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `hand` of size `N` where `hand[i]` represents the rank of the ith card. You are also given an integer `groupSize` which represents the size of each group you want to divide the cards into.

You need to determine if it is possible to rearrange the cards in such a way that they can be grouped into sets of `groupSize` with consecutive cards. If it is possible, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Example:
```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Possible to reorder into groups: [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [6,7,8]
```
```
Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Cannot form groups of 4 with consecutive cards.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Values in `hand`**: Are there any constraints on the possible values of the cards?
   - **Assumption**: The range of values in `hand` is not constrained but will contain a reasonably large set of numbers.

2. **Unique Cards**: Can we assume that each group of consecutive cards is unique?
   - **Assumption**: No, there may be duplicates and the same card value can appear multiple times in different groups.

3. **Order of Groups**: Does the order in which the groups are formed matter?
   - **Assumption**: No, the order does not matter as long as all cards can be grouped.

### Strategy
1. **Check for Immediate Impossibility**: If `N % groupSize != 0`, it is immediately impossible to form the required groups.
2. **Frequency Map**: Use a frequency map (hash map) to count the occurrences of each card.
3. **Iterate and Form Groups**: Iterate through the sorted keys of the frequency map and try to form groups by ensuring that consecutive cards are available in sufficient quantity.
4. **Decrease Frequencies**: Decrease the count of each card used to form a group.
5. **Early Termination**: If at any point a card needed to complete a group is not available in sufficient quantity, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

bool isNStraightHand(std::vector<int>& hand, int groupSize) {
    if (hand.size() % groupSize != 0)
        return false;
    
    std::map<int, int> frequency;
    for (int card : hand) {
        frequency[card]++;
    }
    
    for (const auto& entry : frequency) {
        int startCard = entry.first;
        int count = entry.second;
        
        if (count > 0) {
            for (int i = 1; i < groupSize; ++i) {
                if (frequency[startCard + i] < count)
                    return false;
                frequency[startCard + i] -= count;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the hand takes **O(N log N)** where \(N\) is the number of cards.
- Iterating through the sorted keys and forming groups takes **O(N \cdot groupSize)** in the worst case, but since the size of each consecutive segment is bounded by `groupSize`, this can be considered **O(N)**.
- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: **O(N log N)**.

This solution ensures we efficiently determine if the hand can be rearranged into groups of the specified size.
