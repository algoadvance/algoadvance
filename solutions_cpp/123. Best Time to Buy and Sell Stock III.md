[Leetcode 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l123)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input array?**
   - The length of the array can range from 0 to 10^5.

2. **What are the possible values for the stock prices?**
   - The stock prices are non-negative integers typically ranging from 0 to 10^4.

3. **What should be returned if no profit can be made?**
   - If no transactions lead to profit, the function should return 0.

4. **Is it allowed to buy and sell on the same day?**
   - Technically, yes, but it wouldn't make any profit, so it's better avoided.

### Strategy

We need to calculate the maximum profit for up to two transactions. To accomplish this, the approach consists of:
1. Break the problem into two sub-arrays - one for each transaction.
2. Use dynamic programming to store maximum profits achievable up to each day when traversing from left to right and then from right to left.

**Dynamic Programming Strategy:**
1. Use two auxiliary arrays:
   - `leftProfits`: `leftProfits[i]` records the maximum profit achievable from day 0 to day i.
   - `rightProfits`: `rightProfits[i]` records the maximum profit achievable from day i to the last day.

2. Calculate these profits in two sweeps:
   - Forward sweep for `leftProfits`.
   - Backward sweep for `rightProfits`.

3. The final answer will be the maximum value of `leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i+1]` for all valid i.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<int> leftProfits(n, 0);
        vector<int> rightProfits(n, 0);
        
        // Calculate leftProfits
        int minPrice = prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            leftProfits[i] = max(leftProfits[i-1], prices[i] - minPrice);
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
        }
        
        // Calculate rightProfits
        int maxPrice = prices[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            rightProfits[i] = max(rightProfits[i+1], maxPrice - prices[i]);
            maxPrice = max(maxPrice, prices[i]);
        }
        
        // Combine the results
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, leftProfits[i] + rightProfits[i]);
        }
        
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The above solution runs in linear time:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the prices array. The forward and backward sweeps each run in O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), used for the `leftProfits` and `rightProfits` arrays.

The provided approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging dynamic programming and provides good balance between time and space complexity for given constraints.
