[Leetcode 1856. Maximum Subarray Min](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1856)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. The min-product of an array is defined as the minimum value in the array multiplied by the sum of the array. 

- For example, the array `[3,2,5]` (minimum value is 2, and the sum is 10), the min-product is `2 * 10 = 20`.

Return the maximum min-product of any non-empty subarray of `nums`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - **A**: Yes, the constraints are:
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
     - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
     
2. **Q**: Are there any negative numbers in the array?
   - **A**: No, all numbers are positive integers.

3. **Q**: Can we use auxiliary space for the solution apart from the input array?
   - **A**: Yes, using additional data structures like stacks or prefix sums is allowed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. **Prefix Sum**: Calculate the prefix sum array. This will help in calculating the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. **Finding Bounds**: For each element in the array, we need to find the largest subarray where it is the minimum element. This can be done efficiently using stacks to keep track of the next smaller and previous smaller elements for each element in the array.

3. **Calculate Min-Product**: For each element, calculate the min-product of the subarray where it is the minimal element, and keep track of the maximum min-product found.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: 
   - Compute the prefix sum array where `prefixSum[i]` stores the sum of elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`.

2. **Next and Previous Smaller Elements**:
   - Use stacks to find the index of the next smaller element and the previous smaller element for each element in the array.

3. **Compute the Min-Product**:
   - For each element as the minimum, calculate the sum of its corresponding subarray using the prefix sum array and compute the min-product.
   - Record the maximum min-product encountered.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumMinProduct(vector<int>& nums) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the prefix sum array
        vector<long long> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        // Step 2: Find the next smaller element for each element
        vector<int> nextSmaller(n, n);
        stack<int> stack;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while (!stack.empty() && nums[i] < nums[stack.top()]) {
                nextSmaller[stack.top()] = i;
                stack.pop();
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        
        // Step 3: Find the previous smaller element for each element
        vector<int> prevSmaller(n, -1);
        while (!stack.empty()) stack.pop();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (!stack.empty() && nums[i] < nums[stack.top()]) {
                prevSmaller[stack.top()] = i;
                stack.pop();
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        
        // Step 4: Calculate the maximum min-product
        long long maxMinProduct = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            long long totalSum = prefixSum[nextSmaller[i]] - prefixSum[prevSmaller[i] + 1];
            long long minProduct = totalSum * nums[i];
            maxMinProduct = max(maxMinProduct, minProduct);
        }
        
        return maxMinProduct % MOD;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(n)
2. **Finding Next Smaller and Previous Smaller Elements**: O(n) each, due to the efficient use of stacks.
3. **Computing the Min-Product**: O(n)

Overall, the solution has a time complexity of O(n).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(n) for the prefix sum array, next and previous smaller arrays, and the stack used in the calculations.
