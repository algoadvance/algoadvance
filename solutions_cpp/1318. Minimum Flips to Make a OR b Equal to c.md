[Leetcode 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1318)
### Problem Statement

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. You need to determine the minimum number of flips required in the binary representation of `a` and `b` to make `a OR b` equal to `c`.

There are two types of bit flips:
1. Change a `0` bit to `1`.
2. Change a `1` bit to `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
   - What is the range of values for `a`, `b`, and `c`?
   - **Answer**: The values are within the range of non-negative integers. Typically, they fit within the standard integer range in C++.

2. **Output**:
   - Should the result be printed, returned from a function, or both?
   - **Answer**: The result should be returned from a function.

3. **Example**:
   - Can you provide an example?
   - **Answer**: 
     ```cpp
     Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
     Output: 3
     Explanation:
     - a in binary:  0010
     - b in binary:  0110
     - c in binary:  0101
     - Minimum flips to make (a OR b) equal to c:
       - Flip the 1st bit of a from 0 to 1.
       - Flip the 2nd bit of b from 1 to 0.
       - Flip the 3rd bit of b from 1 to 0.
     ```

### Strategy

To determine the minimum number of flips needed:

1. Iterate through each bit position for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. Use bitwise operations to check the bits:
   - If `c` has a `0` at a bit position:
     - Both `a` and `b` should have `0` at this position.
     - If either (or both) have `1` instead, a flip is required for each bit that is `1`.
   - If `c` has a `1` at a bit position:
     - At least one of `a` or `b` should have `1` at this position.
     - If both are `0`, one flip is required to make at least one of them `1`.
3. Sum up the required flips.

### Code

Here is the C++ function implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    int flips = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
        bool bit_a = a & (1 << i);
        bool bit_b = b & (1 << i);
        bool bit_c = c & (1 << i);

        if (bit_c == 0) {
            if (bit_a == 1) ++flips;
            if (bit_b == 1) ++flips;
        } else {
            if (bit_a == 0 && bit_b == 0) ++flips;
        }
    }
    return flips;
}

int main() {
    int a = 2, b = 6, c = 5;
    int result = minFlips(a, b, c);
    std::cout << "Minimum number of flips: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(1)` because we iterate through a fixed number of 32-bit positions regardless of the input values. This is constant time in terms of the number of iterations, but the operations within the loop (bitwise AND and shift operations) are also `O(1)` for each iteration. Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(1)`.
