[Leetcode 523. Continuous Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l523)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if `nums` has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, or `false` otherwise.

A continuous subarray is defined as a non-empty sequence of elements of the array in the order they occur.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we do if `k` is zero?**
   If `k` is zero, it means we are looking for any subarray whose sum is zero.
   
2. **Can negative numbers be present in `nums`?**
   Yes, the array can have negative, zero, and positive integers.
   
3. **What's the size range of `nums` and the possible values of `k`?**
   The length of the array `nums` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`, and the integer `k` will be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]` including zero.

### Strategy
1. **Use Remainder Theorem (modulus operation)**:
   - If we find any two prefix sums `prefix_sum[i]` and `prefix_sum[j]` such that `(prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i]) % k == 0`, then the sum of the elements between `i+1` and `j` is a multiple of `k`.
   - To efficiently check for these conditions, use a hashmap (unordered_map) to store the remainders of prefix sums divided by `k`.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing a hashmap with the remainder of zero mapped to index `-1` to handle cases where the prefix sum itself is a multiple of `k`.

3. **Iterate through the array**:
   - Keep a running sum of the elements.
   - Compute the remainder of the current prefix sum with `k`.
   - If this remainder has been seen before and the subarray length is at least 2, return `true`.
   - Otherwise, store the current remainder with its index in the hashmap.
   
4. **Edge cases**:
   - Handle negative remainders by adjusting using `% k`.
   - If `k` is zero, check if there are at least two consecutive zeroes.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkSubarraySum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> remainder_index_map;
        remainder_index_map[0] = -1; // to handle cases where the sum itself is a multiple of k
        int running_sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            running_sum += nums[i];
            int remainder = (k == 0) ? running_sum : running_sum % k;
            
            // Adjust for negative remainder
            if (remainder < 0) remainder += k;
            
            if (remainder_index_map.find(remainder) != remainder_index_map.end()) {
                if (i - remainder_index_map[remainder] > 1) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                remainder_index_map[remainder] = i;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the size of the input array `nums`. This is due to a single pass through the array.
- **Space complexity**: O(min(n, k)) for the hashmap storing the remainders and their indices, which in the worst case could store up to `n` elements (though in practice, often fewer).

### Summary
This approach efficiently checks for any continuous subarray whose sum is a multiple of `k` by leveraging the properties of the remainder operation and utilizing a hashmap to track remainders of prefix sums.
