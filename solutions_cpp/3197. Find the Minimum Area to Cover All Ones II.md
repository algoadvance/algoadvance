[Leetcode 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3197)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n binary matrix `grid` where each element is either `0` (representing an empty cell) or `1` (representing a cell filled with a `1`). Find the minimum area of a rectangle that covers all the `1`s in the matrix. You must consider all the `1`s and cannot exclude any.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is it guaranteed that there's at least one `1` in the grid?**
   - Yes.
2. **What are the constraints on the size of the grid?**
   - Typically, m and n are up to 1000 in competitive programming scenarios, but they can vary.
3. **Is the input always valid, or do we need to handle any specific invalid scenarios?**
   - The input is always valid per the problem statement.

### Strategy:
To find the minimum rectangle that covers all `1`s:

1. Initialize four variables: `minRow`, `maxRow`, `minCol`, and `maxCol`.
2. Traverse the grid:
   - Update `minRow` with the minimum row index containing a `1`.
   - Update `maxRow` with the maximum row index containing a `1`.
   - Update `minCol` with the minimum column index containing a `1`.
   - Update `maxCol` with the maximum column index containing a `1`.
3. Compute the area of the rectangle using these bounds:
   - Height is calculated as `(maxRow - minRow + 1)`.
   - Width is calculated as `(maxCol - minCol + 1)`.
   - The area is `height * width`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minAreaCoveringOnes(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int minRow = grid.size(), maxRow = -1;
    int minCol = grid[0].size(), maxCol = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                if (i < minRow) minRow = i;
                if (i > maxRow) maxRow = i;
                if (j < minCol) minCol = j;
                if (j > maxCol) maxCol = j;
            }
        }
    }

    if (minRow == grid.size() || maxRow == -1 || minCol == grid[0].size() || maxCol == -1) {
        // This case should not happen as per the problem guarantees
        return 0;
    }

    int height = maxRow - minRow + 1;
    int width = maxCol - minCol + 1;

    return height * width;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> grid = {
        {0, 0, 0, 0},
        {0, 1, 1, 0},
        {0, 1, 1, 0},
        {0, 0, 0, 0}
    };

    int area = minAreaCoveringOnes(grid);
    std::cout << "Minimum area to cover all 1's: " << area << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to visit every cell in the grid once to determine the minimum and maximum rows and columns containing `1`s.
