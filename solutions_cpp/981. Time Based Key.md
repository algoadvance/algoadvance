[Leetcode 981. Time Based Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l981)
### Problem Statement

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain time stamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(string key, string value, int timestamp)` Stores the key and value, along with the given timestamp.
- `string get(string key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set(key, value, timestamp_prev)` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `timestamp`**: What are the minimum and maximum values for timestamps?
2. **Order of Operations**: Can `get` operations request values for timestamps for which no `set` operations have been logged?
3. **Duplicate Keys**: How do we handle duplicate keys with different timestamps?

### Strategy

To solve this, we'll use a `map` (or `unordered_map`) where keys are strings and values are `vector` of pairs (`timestamp`, `value`).

- **set operation**: Store the key with a list of pairs `(timestamp, value)`. Append the new pair to the list.
- **get operation**: Use binary search to find the largest timestamp which is less than or equal to the given timestamp, and return its associated value.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class TimeMap {
private:
    unordered_map<string, vector<pair<int, string>>> store;

public:
    TimeMap() {}

    void set(string key, string value, int timestamp) {
        store[key].emplace_back(timestamp, value);
    }

    string get(string key, int timestamp) {
        if (store.find(key) == store.end()) 
            return "";

        const vector<pair<int, string>>& timeValuePairs = store[key];
        int low = 0, high = timeValuePairs.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (timeValuePairs[mid].first <= timestamp)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }

        if (high >= 0 && high < timeValuePairs.size() && timeValuePairs[high].first <= timestamp) 
            return timeValuePairs[high].second;

        return "";
    }
};
```

### Explanation

- **Data Structure**: `unordered_map<string, vector<pair<int, string>>>`, where each key maintains a list of `(timestamp, value)` pairs.
- **set Function**: Inserts the `(timestamp, value)` pair into the vector corresponding to the given `key`. This operation is `O(1)`.
- **get Function**: Utilizes binary search (`O(log n)`) to quickly find the most recent value for the given timestamp. The `high` pointer ends up at the candidate with the largest `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`.

### Time Complexity

- **set Operation**: `O(1)` amortized time, as we just append to a vector.
- **get Operation**: `O(log n)`, where `n` is the number of timestamps associated with the particular key, due to binary search.
