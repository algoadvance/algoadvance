[Leetcode 2536. Increment Submatrices by One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2536)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a 2D integer matrix `n x n` initialized to zero. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` where each `queries[i] = [row1, col1, row2, col2]`. For each query, you should increment each element of the submatrix `matrix[row1...row2][col1...col2]` by one.

Return the matrix after processing all the queries.

### Example:
```text
Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,1,2,2],[0,0,1,1]]
Output: [[1,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,1,1]]
Explanation: The given queries are:
   1. Increment elements of submatrix [1,1,2,2] by 1.
   2. Increment elements of submatrix [0,0,1,1] by 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the maximum possible size of the matrix `n x n`?**
   - This will help in understanding any potential constraints related to time and space complexity.

2. **Should we assume that all indices provided in the queries are valid and within bounds?**
   - This ensures that no additional bounds-checking is needed within the code.

3. **Can the `queries` array be empty, and if so, what should be the output?**
   - This will help in addressing edge cases.

4. **Are there any constraints on the values within the `queries`?**
   - For instance, are negative indices allowed, or must they be non-negative?

## Strategy:

To efficiently process these queries, we can use a 2D version of the prefix sum algorithm. Instead of incrementing the elements directly, we can increment boundary markers and then use a prefix sum to determine the final matrix values. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize a `n x n` matrix filled with zeros.**

2. **For each query, instead of incrementing the entire submatrix, we will:**
   - Increment the starting cell of the submatrix.
   - Decrement the cell just outside the bottom-right of the submatrix.
   - Adjust cells to handle edge cases outside the matrix.

3. **After processing all queries, perform cumulative addition to finalize the values of each cell in the matrix.**

This approach ensures that updates are performed in constant time for each query, resulting in a more efficient solution compared to incrementing each cell individually for every query.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> incrementSubmatricesByOne(int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    // Process the queries with a difference array technique.
    for (const auto& q : queries) {
        int row1 = q[0], col1 = q[1], row2 = q[2], col2 = q[3];
        
        matrix[row1][col1] += 1;
        if (col2 + 1 < n) matrix[row1][col2 + 1] -= 1;
        if (row2 + 1 < n) matrix[row2 + 1][col1] -= 1;
        if (row2 + 1 < n && col2 + 1 < n) matrix[row2 + 1][col2 + 1] += 1;
    }
    
    // Apply prefix sum to rows.
    for (int r = 0; r < n; r++) {
        for (int c = 1; c < n; c++) {
            matrix[r][c] += matrix[r][c - 1];
        }
    }

    // Apply prefix sum to columns.
    for (int c = 0; c < n; c++) {
        for (int r = 1; r < n; r++) {
            matrix[r][c] += matrix[r - 1][c];
        }
    }

    return matrix;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Initialization of the matrix:** `O(n^2)`
- **Processing each query:** `O(1)` per query, thus `O(m)` for `m` queries.
- **Applying the row-wise and column-wise prefix sums:** `O(n^2)`

Overall time complexity is **O(n^2 + m)**, which is efficient for large input sizes assuming the number of queries `m` is not excessively large compared to `n^2`.
