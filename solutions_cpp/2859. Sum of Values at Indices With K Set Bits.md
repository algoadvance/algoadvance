### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2859: **Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits**

**Description:**
Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the sum of the elements of `nums` at indices having exactly `k` set bits in their binary representation.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: The indices with one set bit are 01 and 10, respectively indices 1 and 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What are the constraints on the size of the input array and the values in the array?**
   - A: There is no specified constraint in the problem description, so we should assume typical constraint values like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and integer values within standard ranges.

2. **Q: Can `k` be greater than the number of bits in the indices?**
   - A: Yes, but in such cases, the result should naturally be 0 as no index will have more set bits than its bit-length.

3. **Q: How do we determine what `k` set bits are?**
   - A: The number of set bits in binary representation of an index can be determined using bit manipulation or built-in functions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int sumIndicesWithKSetBits(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if(__builtin_popcount(i) == k) {
                sum += nums[i];
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k = 1;
    int result = sol.sumIndicesWithKSetBits(nums, k);
    cout << "Sum of values at indices with " << k << " set bits is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Count Set Bits:** Use the built-in GCC function `__builtin_popcount` to count the number of set bits in the index.
2. **Sum Matching Indices:** Iterate through the array and sum the values where the index has exactly `k` set bits.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array since we iterate through the array once and the `__builtin_popcount` function operates in `O(1)` time.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we are utilizing a constant amount of extra space not dependent on input size.

This method is efficient and leverages built-in functions for simplicity and speed.
