[Leetcode 2164. Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2164)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. Reorder the array so that:

- Odd indices (`1, 3, 5, ...`) are sorted in descending order.
- Even indices (`0, 2, 4, ...`) are sorted in ascending order.

Return the reordered array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Do we need to maintain the original indices after sorting?
   - **A**: Yes, indices remain the same. Only elements at odd and even indices are sorted independently.

2. **Q**: Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

3. **Q**: What is the maximum size of the array we can expect?
   - **A**: The problem constraints should mention this, but typically, you can expect the size to be up to `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Extract Odd and Even Indexed Elements**:
    - Traverse the array and separate the elements at odd and even indices.

2. **Sort the Extracted Elements**:
    - Sort the even-indexed elements in ascending order.
    - Sort the odd-indexed elements in descending order.

3. **Reconstruct the Original Array**:
    - Place the sorted elements back into their original positions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> sortEvenOdd(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> evenElements;
    std::vector<int> oddElements;
    
    // Extract even-indexed and odd-indexed elements
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            evenElements.push_back(nums[i]);
        } else {
            oddElements.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    
    // Sort the even-indexed elements in ascending order
    std::sort(evenElements.begin(), evenElements.end());
    
    // Sort the odd-indexed elements in descending order
    std::sort(oddElements.begin(), oddElements.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    // Place the sorted elements back in the array
    int evenIndex = 0, oddIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            nums[i] = evenElements[evenIndex++];
        } else {
            nums[i] = oddElements[oddIndex++];
        }
    }
    
    return nums;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Extraction**: O(n), where `n` is the size of the array.
- **Sorting**: O((n/2)log(n/2)) for even indices + O((n/2)log(n/2)) for odd indices.
  - This simplifies to O(n log n) because sorting dominates the time complexity.
- **Reconstruction**: O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting steps. The space complexity is **O(n)** for storing the odd and even indexed elements separately.
