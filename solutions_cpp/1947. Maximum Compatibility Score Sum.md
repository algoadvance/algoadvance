[Leetcode 1947. Maximum Compatibility Score Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1947)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 2D integer arrays `students` and `mentors`. Each 2D array is of size `m x n`, where `m` represents the number of students and mentors, and `n` represents the number of skills each student and mentor have. The compatibility score between a student and a mentor is defined as the number of skills in which both the student and the mentor are the same.

You need to find the maximum compatibility score sum that can be achieved by assigning each student to one and only one mentor.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraint on number of students and mentors:** Are the number of students and mentors always equal, i.e., `m` is the same for both `students` and `mentors` arrays?
2. **Skill match scoring:** Is the compatibility score between a student and a mentor always the sum of exact skill matches? For example, if both have the same skill in a specific position, then it contributes 1 to the score.
3. **Output format:** Should the output be an integer representing the maximum compatibility score sum?

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible assignments of students to mentors:

1. **Compute Compatibility Scores:** Calculate the compatibility scores between each student and every mentor.
2. **Backtracking:** Explore all possible assignments of students to mentors while maximizing the score.
3. **Memoization:** Use memoization to store already computed results to avoid repeated calculations and improve efficiency.

Here is the step-by-step implementation of the strategy.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCompatibilitySum(vector<vector<int>>& students, vector<vector<int>>& mentors) {
        int m = students.size(), n = students[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> scores(m, vector<int>(m, 0));
        
        // Compute compatibility scores for each student-mentor pair
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                int score = 0;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                    score += (students[i][k] == mentors[j][k]);
                }
                scores[i][j] = score;
            }
        }

        vector<int> dp(1 << m, -1);
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int mask, int idx) -> int {
            if (idx == m) return 0;
            if (dp[mask] != -1) return dp[mask];
            
            int maxScore = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                if (!(mask & (1 << j))) {
                    int newMask = mask | (1 << j);
                    maxScore = max(maxScore, scores[idx][j] + dfs(newMask, idx + 1));
                }
            }
            dp[mask] = maxScore;
            return maxScore;
        };

        return dfs(0, 0);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Compatibility Scores Calculation:**
    - We first compute the compatibility score between each student and each mentor, storing these in a matrix `scores`.
  
2. **Backtracking + Memoization:**
    - We then use a `dfs` (Depth-First Search) function with memoization.
    - `mask` keeps track of which mentors have been assigned.
    - `idx` is the current student being assigned.
    - For each student, we try assigning all possible mentors who are not yet assigned (indicated by the `mask`).
    - We store and reuse previously computed results using `dp` to avoid recomputation.

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity of this approach is `O(m * m * 2^m)`, where `m` is the number of students (same as the number of mentors). This is because:
  - We compute the compatibility scores in `O(m^2 * n)`.
  - The backtracking with memoization explores all subsets of mentors, which is `O(2^m)` states.
  - For each state, we perform `O(m)` work to try assigning mentors, leading to the final complexity.
