[Leetcode 1108. Defanging an IP Address](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1108)
### Problem Statement

You are given a valid IPv4 address `address`. Return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period `.` with `[.]`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we jump into solving the problem, let's ensure we understand all the requirements and constraints:
1. **Input**: What is the form of the input? (String)
2. **Validation**: Do we need to verify the validity of the input IPv4 address? (Assumed not necessary as per the problem statement)
3. **Output**: What should the output look like? (String with periods replaced by `[.]`)
4. **Edge Cases**: Are there any special edge cases to consider, such as an input string without any periods? (Handled implicitly by the string replace mechanism in C++)

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the string**: We will iterate through each character of the input string to look for periods (`.`).
2. **Construct the output**: As we move through the string, we will append each character to the output string. Whenever we encounter a period, we will append `[.]` to the output string instead of the period.
3. **Result**: Return the constructed output string.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string defangIPaddr(std::string address) {
        std::string defangedAddress;
        for (char c : address) {
            if (c == '.') {
                defangedAddress += "[.]";
            } else {
                defangedAddress += c;
            }
        }
        return defangedAddress;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::string address = "1.1.1.1";
    std::string result = solution.defangIPaddr(address);
    std::cout << "Defanged IP Address: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `address`. We are iterating through each character of the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `address`. We need to store the new string, which in the worst case can be up to twice the length of the original string (if all characters are periods).

This approach should work efficiently for the given problem constraints and typical input sizes.
