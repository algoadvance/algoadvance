[Leetcode 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l208)
## Problem Statement

Implement a trie with `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` methods.

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and search a set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. The main operations of a trie are:

- `insert(string word)`: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- `search(string word)`: Returns `true` if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and `false` otherwise.
- `startsWith(string prefix)`: Returns `true` if there is any string in the trie that starts with the given `prefix`, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Set**: 
   Do the strings only contain lowercase English letters? 
   
   **Assumption**: Yes, strings only contain 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Case Sensitivity**:
   Are the strings case-sensitive? 

   **Assumption**: No, we can assume the strings are lowercase for simplicity.

3. **Operations Frequency**:
   Will any operation (`insert`, `search`, `startsWith`) be called more frequently than others?

   **Assumption**: No specific operation is highlighted as being more frequent.

## Strategy

### Trie Node Structure
Each node in a Trie will contain:
- An array of pointers (or a map) to its children.
- A boolean to mark the end of a word.

### Insert Operation
- Traverse each character in the word.
- If the child node for that character doesn’t exist, create it.
- Move the current pointer to the child node.
- After the entire word is traversed, mark the end of the current node as `true`.

### Search Operation
- Traverse each character in the word.
- If the child node for that character doesn’t exist, return `false`.
- If the traversal completes and the current node is marked as the end of a word, return `true`.

### startsWith Operation
- Traverse each character in the prefix.
- If the child node for that character doesn’t exist, return `false`.
- If the traversal completes, return `true`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    bool isEndOfWord;
    vector<TrieNode*> children;
    
    TrieNode() : children(26, nullptr), isEndOfWord(false) {}
};

class Trie {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
    
public:
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for(char c : word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (!node->children[index]) {
                node->children[index] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[index];
        }
        node->isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    
    bool search(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for(char c : word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (!node->children[index]) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node->children[index];
        }
        return node != nullptr && node->isEndOfWord;
    }
    
    bool startsWith(string prefix) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for(char c : prefix) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (!node->children[index]) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node->children[index];
        }
        return node != nullptr;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insert Operation**: O(n)
    - `n`: The length of the word to be inserted.
    - Each character in the word is processed exactly once.
  
- **Search Operation**: O(n)
    - `n`: The length of the word to be searched.
    - Each character in the word is processed exactly once.
  
- **startsWith Operation**: O(n)
    - `n`: The length of the prefix.
    - Each character in the prefix is processed exactly once.

Given these complexities, the trie operations will be very efficient, particularly for string sets with a large number of common prefixes.
