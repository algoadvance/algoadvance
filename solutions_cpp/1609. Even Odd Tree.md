[Leetcode 1609. Even Odd Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1609)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree. A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:

1. The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, and so on.
2. For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
3. For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).

Return `true` if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return `false`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]
Output: true

Explanation:
Level 0: [1]
Level 1: [10,4]
Level 2: [3,7,9]
Level 3: [12,8,6]
Level 4: [2]

Each level meets the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.
```

## Clarifying Questions

- **What is the range of values that the tree nodes can hold?**
  - The values of the tree nodes are integers.
- **Is the tree balanced, or does it have any specific form (like a BST or complete tree)?**
  - No specific form is mentioned. The tree can be any binary tree.
- **Can the tree be empty?**
  - Yes, we should handle the case where the tree is empty and return `true` in that case since an empty tree trivially satisfies the conditions.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will perform a level-order traversal (Breadth-First Search - BFS) using a queue. During this traversal, we'll check the following conditions at each level:

- For even-indexed levels, ensure all node values are odd and strictly increasing.
- For odd-indexed levels, ensure all node values are even and strictly decreasing.

Steps:
1. Use a queue to perform BFS while keeping track of the current level index.
2. For each level, store the node values and verify the conditions.
3. If any condition fails, return `false`. If all levels are processed correctly, return `true`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isEvenOddTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true;

        std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        bool isEvenLevel = true;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            int prevValue = isEvenLevel ? INT_MIN : INT_MAX;

            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                int val = node->val;

                if (isEvenLevel) {
                    if (val % 2 == 0 || val <= prevValue) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    prevValue = val;
                } else {
                    if (val % 2 != 0 || val >= prevValue) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    prevValue = val;
                }

                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }

            isEvenLevel = !isEvenLevel;
        }

        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example Usage
    // Construct the tree [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(10);
    root->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = nullptr;
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);
    root->left->left->left = new TreeNode(12);
    root->left->left->right = new TreeNode(8);
    root->right->left->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->left->right = nullptr;
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(2);

    Solution solution;
    bool result = solution.isEvenOddTree(root);
    std::cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << std::endl; // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We process each node exactly once.

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional space required for the queue in the BFS traversal, which in the worst case can hold all nodes of a level in the binary tree.
