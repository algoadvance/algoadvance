[Leetcode 1531. String Compression II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1531)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to compress the string such that it has the minimum length possible after removing `k` characters. The compression works by replacing sequences of the same character with that character followed by the length of the sequence. For example, the string `"aaabcccd"` could be compressed to `"a3bc3d", "a2bca2d", "a2bacd"`, and so on. Your task is to figure out the minimum possible length of the compressed string after removing `k` characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Can the input string `s` contain characters other than lowercase English letters?
   A: No, the string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

2. Q: Do we have a maximum length constraint on string `s` or the value of `k`?
   A: The problem does not specify constraints, but typically we can assume `1 <= s.length <= 100` and `0 <= k < s.length` based on usual problem settings.

3. Q: For sequences with length <= 2, do we need to include the length number in the compressed version?
   A: No, for sequences of length 1, no number is added. For sequences of length greater than 1, only then the number is added.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a DP table where `dp[i][k]` represents the minimum length after processing up to the i-th character in the string `s` with `k` removals left.
    - Iterate over each character in `s` and calculate possible lengths by deciding to keep or remove characters.
    - For each character, explore the possibility of forming a compression block and updating the DP table accordingly.
    - At each step, compute the cost of keeping a sequence block and compressing it.

2. **Helper Functions**:
    - A helper function to calculate the length of compression for a sequence of `length` (`1` returns `0`, `2-9` returns `1`, `10-99` returns `2`, etc.)

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

class Solution {
public:
    int getLengthOfOptimalCompression(std::string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX));
        dp[0][0] = 0; // base case, no chars processed, no removal
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
                int removed = 0;
                for (int l = i; l < n; ++l) {
                    if (s[l] != s[i]) {
                        removed++;
                    }
                    if (j + removed <= k) {
                        dp[l + 1][j + removed] = std::min(dp[l + 1][j + removed], 
                                                          dp[i][j] + getCompressedLength(l - i + 1 - removed));
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (j + 1 <= k)
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = std::min(dp[i + 1][j + 1], dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return *std::min_element(dp[n].begin(), dp[n].end());
    }

private:
    int getCompressedLength(int length) {
        if (length == 1) return 1;
        if (length < 10) return 2;
        if (length < 100) return 3;
        return 4;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2 * k)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the allowed number of removals. This is derived from the nested loops iterating through `s` and considering each character segment for potential removals and compressions.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * k)`, for the DP table used to store intermediate results.

This approach ensures that we find the minimal length of the string after optimal compression considering up to `k` deletions.
