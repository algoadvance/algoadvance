[Leetcode 1278. Palindrome Partitioning III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1278)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You should partition the string into `k` palindromic substrings with the minimum number of changes required. 

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. A change involves replacing a character with another character.

Return the minimum number of changes needed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length of string `s`? 
     - The length `n` will be between `1` and `100`.
   - What's the range of `k`?
     - `k` will be between `1` and the length of the string `s`.
   - Characters in `s`?
     - The string `s` will only contain lowercase English letters.

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Return the minimum number of character changes required to partition the string into `k` palindromic substrings.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP).

1. **Define Subproblems:**
   - First, define a helper function to calculate the number of changes needed to make any substring of `s` a palindrome.
   - Use another DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of changes required to split the first `i` characters of the string into `j` palindromic partitions.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If we need to partition the string into one part (`k=1`), the answer is simply the number of changes to make the entire string a palindrome.
   - If we have `i=j`, the minimum number of changes is zero as the length of each substring would be one, which is inherently a palindrome.

3. **State Transition:**
   - For each substring `s[l...r]`, compute the number of changes needed.
   - Update the DP table using these computed values.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Precompute the changes needed for every substring to make it a palindrome to avoid recomputation during DP updates.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to calculate the number of changes needed for a substring to be a palindrome
int changesToPalindrome(const string &s, int l, int r) {
    int changes = 0;
    while (l < r) {
        if (s[l] != s[r]) changes++;
        l++;
        r--;
    }
    return changes;
}

int palindromePartition(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    vector<vector<int>> change(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

    // Precompute changes needed for every substring to become a palindrome
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            change[i][j] = changesToPalindrome(s, i, j);
        }
    }

    // dp[i][j] will be the minimum number of changes for the first i characters with j partitions
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX));
    dp[0][0] = 0; // No characters with 0 partitions needs 0 changes

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            for (int l = 0; l < i; l++) {
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[l][j - 1] + change[l][i - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k];
}

int main() {
    string s = "abc";
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Minimum changes: " << palindromePartition(s, k) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation (`change` table):**
  - Takes \(O(n^3)\) due to nested loops for calculating changes for each substring.
- **DP Computation:**
  - Takes \(O(n^2 \times k)\) due to the nested loops for filling the DP table.

Overall time complexity is dominated by \(O(n^3)\). This should be efficient given the constraint \(n \leq 100\).
