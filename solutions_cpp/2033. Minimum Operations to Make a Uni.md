[Leetcode 2033. Minimum Operations to Make a Uni](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2033)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can add or subtract `x` from any element of the grid. A uni-value grid is a grid where all values are the same. Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid a uni-value grid. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

**Input:**
- `grid`: `vector<vector<int>>` -> A 2-dimensional array of integers.
- `x`: `int` -> The increment or decrement value for each operation.

**Output:**
- `int` -> The minimum operations needed to make all values in the grid equal. If not possible, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Negative Values?**  
   Can the grid contain negative values?  
   *Yes, the grid can contain negative values.*

2. **Range of x?**  
   Can `x` be negative?  
   *No, `x` is positive as per the problem constraints.*

## Strategy

1. **Validation Check:**  
   Check if it's possible to make all elements equal using the given `x`. If the difference between any two elements is not divisible by `x`, then return `-1` immediately.

2. **Finding the Target Value:**  
   To minimize operations, we should aim to transform all the values to a value close to the median of the flattened grid. The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

3. **Calculating Minimum Operations:**  
   Calculate the operations needed to convert all grid values to the median.

### Steps:

1. Flatten the grid into a 1D array.
2. Check if all pairwise differences are divisible by `x`.
3. Sort the array to find median.
4. Calculate the total number of operations to make all elements equal to the median value.

## Code

Let's implement the strategy described above.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int minOperations(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<int> values;

    // Flatten the grid into a 1D array
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            values.push_back(grid[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Check if transformation is possible
    for (int i = 1; i < values.size(); ++i) {
        if ((values[i] - values[0]) % x != 0) {
            return -1;
        }
    }

    // Sort values to find the median
    sort(values.begin(), values.end());
    int median = values[values.size() / 2];
    int operations = 0;

    // Calculate the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to the median
    for (int value : values) {
        operations += abs(value - median) / x;
    }

    return operations;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = \{\{1, 5}, {2, 3}};
    int x = 1;
    cout << "Minimum Operations: " << minOperations(grid, x) << endl;  // Output: 5
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Flattening the Grid: O(m * n)**
2. **Checking divisibility constraints: O(m * n)**
3. **Sorting the Array: O((m * n) log(m * n))**
4. **Calculating Operations: O(m * n)**

**Overall Complexity:** O((m * n) log(m * n))
