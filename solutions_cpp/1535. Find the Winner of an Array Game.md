[Leetcode 1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1535)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr` of distinct integers and an integer `k`, we want to determine the winner of an array game. The following rules define the game:

1. **Initial Condition:** The first element of the array (arr[0]) is the initial winner.
2. **Game Rounds:**
    - The winner of each round is determined as follows: Starting with the initial winner, you compare the winner with the next element in the array (arr[1]).
    - The larger of the two elements becomes the new winner, and this new winner is compared with the next element in the array.
    - This process continues until one element has won `k` consecutive rounds, or you reach the end of the array.
3. If no element wins `k` consecutive rounds before reaching the end of the array, the largest element in the array wins.

Return the winner of the game.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases:** What are the constraints on `arr` and `k`? For example, is `k` always less than or equal to the length of the array?
2. **Input Size:** How large can the array be?
3. **Unique Elements:** Is it guaranteed that all elements in `arr` are distinct?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start by setting the first element as the initial winner.
2. **Simulation:** Simulate the game by iterating through the array and comparing the current winner with the next element.
3. **Count Consecutive Wins:** Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of consecutive wins for the current winner.
4. **Stopping Condition:** If an element wins `k` consecutive rounds, that element is the winner.
5. **End of Array:** If we reach the end of the array without any element winning `k` consecutive rounds, the largest element in the array is declared the winner.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int getWinner(std::vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    
    // Start with the first element as the initial winner
    int current_winner = arr[0];
    int consecutive_wins = 0;
    
    // Iterate through the elements to simulate the game
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] > current_winner) {
            current_winner = arr[i];
            consecutive_wins = 1;
        } else {
            consecutive_wins++;
        }
        
        // Check if the current winner has won k consecutive rounds
        if (consecutive_wins == k) {
            return current_winner;
        }
    }
    
    // If no element reaches k consecutive wins, return the maximum element
    return *std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {2,1,3,5,4,6,7};
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << "Winner: " << getWinner(arr, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Comparisons:** The algorithm involves a single pass through the array with a linear comparison, making the time complexity O(n).
- **Maximum Element:** If no element wins `k` consecutive rounds before the end of the array, we determine the maximum element, which is also O(n).
- **Overall Complexity:** Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.

This solution is efficient and works within the problem constraints.
