[Leetcode 2522. Partition String Into Substrings With Values at Most K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2522)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` representing a number and an integer `k`, partition the string into the minimum number of non-empty substrings such that the value of each substring is at most `k`. Return the minimum number of substrings such that the value of each substring is at most `k`. If it is not possible to partition the string in such a way, return `-1`.

#### Example:
- **Input**: `s = "165462"`, `k = 60`
- **Output**: `4`
- **Explanation**: The substrings are `"16"`, `"54"`, `"6"`, `"2"`. All of them are less than or equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
    - `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    - `s` consists of digits only and does not contain leading zeros.
    - `1 <= k <= 10^9`

2. **What should be returned if `k` is smaller than all the individual digits in `s`?**
    - If it's impossible to create partitions such that each value is ≤ k, return `-1`.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate Through the String**:
    - Use a loop to go through each character in the string `s`.
    - Try to build the largest possible substring starting from the current position such that its value is ≤ `k`.
    
2. **Greedy Approach**:
    - For each character, extend the current substring by adding characters until the value exceeds `k` or you reach the end of the string.
    - Once the value exceeds `k`, consider this the end of the current partition and start a new partition.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single character string.
    - All characters form values bigger than `k`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

int partitionStringWithValuesAtMostK(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    int parts = 0;
    long current_value = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        current_value = 0;
        int j = i;
        
        while (j < n) {
            current_value = current_value * 10 + (s[j] - '0'); // Convert substring to number
            if (current_value > k) break;
            j++;
        }
        
        if (j == i) return -1; // Single character more than k, impossible to partition
        
        parts++;
        i = j - 1; // Move to the next partition point
    }
    
    return parts;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "165462";
    int k = 60;
    int result = partitionStringWithValuesAtMostK(s, k);
    std::cout << "Minimum number of substrings: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed once in the primary loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant space used besides the input string and integer variables.
