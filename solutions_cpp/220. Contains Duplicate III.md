[Leetcode 220. Contains Duplicate III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l220)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `t`. Return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we write the code, let's clarify a few things:
1. Can the values of `k` or `t` be negative? 
   - No, by definition `k` and `t` are non-negative.
2. What should be returned if the input array `nums` is empty or has only one element?
   - We should return `false` because there can't be two distinct indices to compare.
3. Is there a constraint on the size of the input array `nums`?
   - The problem typically assumes constraints that are reasonable for common algorithmic complexity, but specifics aren't given here. We can assume the input size can be handled by an `O(n log n)` solution efficiently.

### Strategy

The task is to find two distinct indices that satisfy two conditions related to their values and their positions. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Sliding Window with Sorted Data Structure:** We'll use a sliding window of size `k` to keep track of the elements.
2. **Balanced BST for Lookup:** We'll use a Balanced BST-like structure (such as `std::set` in C++) to maintain the elements within the current window. This helps in efficiently finding closest elements.
3. **Comparison within Limits:** For each element in the array, we will try to find whether there's an element in the current window that is within distance `t` from the current element. 

We'll implement this by maintaining a set of elements in the current window and for each new element:
1. Check if there exists an element in the BST within the bounds of `t`.
2. Update the BST by adding the current element and removing the element that goes out of the window size `k`.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>  // For abs

bool containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(std::vector<int>& nums, int k, int t) {
    if (k <= 0 || t < 0) return false;

    std::set<long> window;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        long num = nums[i];

        // Check for a value within bounds of `t`
        auto lower_bound = window.lower_bound(num - t);
        if (lower_bound != window.end() && *lower_bound <= num + t) {
            return true;
        }

        window.insert(num);

        // Remove the element that is out of the window size `k`
        if (window.size() > k) {
            window.erase(nums[i - k]);
        }
    }

    return false;
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 1};
//     int k = 3;
//     int t = 0;
//     bool result = containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, k, t);
//     std::cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
// }

```

### Time Complexity

1. **Insertion and Deletion from `std::set`:** Each of these operations takes `O(log k)`, where `k` is the size of the set.
2. **Total Operations:** There are `n` elements in the array, and for each element, we perform insertion, deletion, and lookup in the set.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n log k)`.

This should be efficient enough for typical input size constraints in competitive programming or interview scenarios.
