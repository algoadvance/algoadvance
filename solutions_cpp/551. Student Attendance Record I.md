[Leetcode 551. Student Attendance Record I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l551)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
- `A`: Absent.
- `L`: Late.
- `P`: Present.

A student could be rewarded if their attendance record doesn't contain:
1. More than one `A` (absent).
2. More than two continuous `L` (late).

You need to implement a function `bool checkRecord(string s)` that returns `true` if the student's attendance record is rewardable according to these criteria.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the function be case-sensitive?
   - No, we can assume the input string will only contain uppercase `A`, `L`, and `P`.
2. Is the length of the string limited?
   - The length can be up to 100000.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Traverse the string `s` and count the occurrences of `A`. If it exceeds 1, return `false`.
2. Simultaneously, check for any instance of three consecutive `L`s. If found, return `false`.
3. If neither condition is violated by the end of the string, return `true`.

We will iterate through the string once, making this approach linear in time complexity.

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation based on the outlined strategy:

```cpp
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool checkRecord(string s) {
    int aCount = 0;  // To count 'A's
    int lStreak = 0;  // To count consecutive 'L's

    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == 'A') {
            aCount++;
            if (aCount > 1) return false;
        }
        if (c == 'L') {
            lStreak++;
            if (lStreak > 2) return false;
        } else {
            lStreak = 0;  // Reset streak if it's not 'L'
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. We make a single pass through the string to count the occurrences of 'A' and check for streaks of 'L'. The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a few extra integer variables for counting.
