[Leetcode 3086. Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3086)
## Problem Statement

**Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones-out**

You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one move, you can select an element and flip it (change `0` to `1` or change `1` to `0`). Your goal is to pick out `k` ones from the array with the minimum number of moves. The picked out `k` ones do not have to be contiguous. Return the minimum number of moves required to pick out exactly `k` ones.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Flip the second 0 to 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `k` be larger than the number of `1`s present in the array?
2. If we cannot find exactly `k` ones, what should be the expected output?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the `nums` array?

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int minMovesToPickKOnes(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::vector<int> onesIndices;
        
        // Collect indices of all '1's in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                onesIndices.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        int n = onesIndices.size();
        
        // If there are not enough '1's to pick k of them, return a large number or -1.
        if (n < k) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int minMoves = INT_MAX;

        // Sliding window to find the minimum moves to group k ones
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; ++i) {
            // Middle index of the current window of k ones
            int mid = i + k / 2;
            int moves = 0;
            
            // Calculate the number of moves required to center the k ones around this mid
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; ++j) {
                moves += abs(onesIndices[j] - onesIndices[mid]);
            }
            
            // Adjust for the relative positioning
            if (k % 2 == 0) {
                moves -= (onesIndices[mid] - onesIndices[mid - 1]) / 2 * k;
            }
            
            minMoves = std::min(minMoves, moves);
        }
        
        return minMoves;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0};
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << sol.minMovesToPickKOnes(nums, k) << std::endl; // Output should be 1
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Collect '1' Indices**:
   - Traverse the array and collect the indices of all the `1`s.
   
2. **Sliding Window**:
    - Use a sliding window of size `k` to find the optimal set of `k` ones.
    - Within each window, center the `k` ones around the median index to minimize the number of moves.
    
3. **Calculate Moves**:
    - For each window, calculate the sum of moves required to move `k` ones to the center.
    - Adjust moves calculation to account for positioning adjustments.

## Time Complexity

- **Collecting Indices**: O(n) where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Sliding Window and Calculation**: O(nk) where `n` is the number of `1`s and `k` is the window size.
  
The overall time complexity is effectively O(nk). However, since k is bounded by the number of 1's in the array, it is typically quite efficient for practical use cases.
