[Leetcode 2717. Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2717)
## Problem Statement
Given a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`, a permutation is called semi-ordered if and only if the first element is `1` and the last element is `n`. 

You need to determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the given permutation semi-ordered.

### Example
- Input: `nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]`
- Output: `1`
- Explanation: Swap `2` and `1` to get `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is semi-ordered.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the number of elements `n`?
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 1000`.
2. Can there be duplicate elements in the permutation?
   - No, since it's a permutation, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.
3. Is there any restriction on the maximum number of swaps?
   - The task is just to find the minimum number of swaps required.
   
## Strategy
1. **Identify positions of `1` and `n`**: Locate the positions of the smallest and largest element in the array.
2. **Calculate required swaps**:
   - If the position of `1` is not already at the beginning (`index of 1 != 0`), calculate the minimum swaps to bring `1` to the start of the array.
   - If the position of `n` is not already at the end (`index of n != n-1`), calculate the minimum swaps to bring `n` to the end of the array.
3. **Adjust for overlap**: Consider the case where moving `1` and `n` might interfere with each other.

### Code Implementation in C++
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int minSwapsToSemiOrdered(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int posOne = -1, posN = -1;
    
    // Finding the position of 1 and n in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == 1) posOne = i;
        if (nums[i] == n) posN = i;
        if (posOne != -1 && posN != -1) break;
    }
    
    int swapsToFront = posOne;
    int swapsToEnd = (n - 1 - posN);
    
    // If the `1` is initially at the front or `n` is initially at the end
    if (posOne < posN) {
        // They don't interfere
        return swapsToFront + swapsToEnd;
    } else {
        // They interfere, reduce one swap since one element will be moved into a position that affects the other directly
        return swapsToFront + swapsToEnd - 1;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 1, 3, 4};  // You can change this for different inputs
    cout << "Minimum number of swaps to make semi-ordered: " << minSwapsToSemiOrdered(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` due to the single pass needed to find the positions of `1` and `n`. After that, the required swaps calculation is constant time, `O(1)`. Hence, the overall complexity is `O(n)`.
