[Leetcode 2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2336)
## Problem Statement

[2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-in-infinite-set/)

You have a set which contains all positive integers. Implement the SmallestInfiniteSet class:
- `SmallestInfiniteSet()` Initializes the SmallestInfiniteSet object to contain all positive integers.
- `int popSmallest()` Removes and returns the smallest integer contained in the infinite set.
- `void addBack(int num)` Adds a positive integer `num` back into the infinite set, if it is not already present in the infinite set.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the numbers to be added back always guaranteed to be positive?
   - Yes, according to the problem statement.
2. Should the `SmallestInfiniteSet` support very high integers, or is there an upper bound we need to consider?
   - Theoretically, it should support all positive integers.

## Strategy
1. **Tracking the smallest available number**: We can use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the numbers that are currently available to be picked using `popSmallest()`.
2. **Avoid duplicates**: We need to ensure that numbers added back using `addBack()` are inserted only if they arenâ€™t already present in the heap. This can be accomplished using a set to track the integers currently in the heap.
3. **Generating numbers**: We need a counter to keep track of the next number to generate if the heap is empty when `popSmallest()` is called.
   
### High-level Pseudo-Algorithm
1. Initialize:
   - `minHeap` to track the currently available smallest numbers.
   - `numAddedBackSet` to check if a number has already been added back.
   - `currentNumber` to track the next smallest number to generate if the heap is empty.
2. `popSmallest()`:
   - If there are numbers in the heap (minHeap), remove and return the smallest one while removing it from `numAddedBackSet`.
   - If the heap is empty, return `currentNumber` and increment it.
3. `addBack(num)`:
   - If `num` is less than `currentNumber` and not present in `numAddedBackSet`, add it to the heap and `numAddedBackSet`.

### Time Complexity
- `popSmallest()`: \(O(\log k)\) where \(k\) is the size of the heap.
- `addBack()`: \(O(\log k)\) for the insertion into the heap.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

class SmallestInfiniteSet {
private:
    std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;
    std::unordered_set<int> numAddedBackSet;
    int currentNumber;
    
public:
    SmallestInfiniteSet() {
        currentNumber = 1;
    }
    
    int popSmallest() {
        if (!minHeap.empty()) {
            int smallest = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            numAddedBackSet.erase(smallest);
            return smallest;
        } else {
            return currentNumber++;
        }
    }
    
    void addBack(int num) {
        if (num < currentNumber && numAddedBackSet.find(num) == numAddedBackSet.end()) {
            minHeap.push(num);
            numAddedBackSet.insert(num);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    SmallestInfiniteSet infiniteSet;
    
    std::cout << infiniteSet.popSmallest() << std::endl; // Output: 1
    std::cout << infiniteSet.popSmallest() << std::endl; // Output: 2
    infiniteSet.addBack(1);
    std::cout << infiniteSet.popSmallest() << std::endl; // Output: 1
    std::cout << infiniteSet.popSmallest() << std::endl; // Output: 3
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: The class is initialized with a priority queue (`minHeap`), set (`numAddedBackSet`), and an integer (`currentNumber`) starting from 1.
- **popSmallest**:
  - Returns and removes the smallest element from the heap if it's not empty.
  - Otherwise, returns `currentNumber` and increments it.
- **addBack**:
  - Adds the number to the heap if it is less than `currentNumber` and not in the set, ensuring no duplicates in the heap.
