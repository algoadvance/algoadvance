[Leetcode 843. Guess the Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l843)
### Problem Statement

We are given a list of unique words, all of the same length. One word in this list is chosen as the secret word. We have to guess the secret word by choosing a word from the list and the system will tell us how many letters in our guessed word match and are in the correct position with the secret word.

We can make up to 10 guesses. We should use the information from the "similarity score" after each guess to make informed subsequent guesses.

Hereâ€™s the function signature:

```cpp
class Master {
public:
    int guess(string word);
};

class Solution {
public:
    void findSecretWord(vector<string>& wordlist, Master& master);
};
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How does the `Master` class work?**  
   The `Master` class has a `guess` method which takes a word as input and returns the similarity score, i.e., the number of letters in the guessed word that match in position with the secret word.

2. **What constraints exist for the word length and the size of the word list?**  
   - Word length: Let's assume a reasonable upper bound of 10.
   - Size of wordlist: Let's assume an upper bound of 100.

3. **What does the `guess` function's result effectively help us achieve?**  
   The result helps in narrowing down the list of possible secret words by comparing similarity scores.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Guess:** Start by guessing the median element or a randomly selected word to ensure we do not bias our first guess.
2. **Filter the List:** Based on the similarity score, filter the word list to only include words that could match the secret word.
3. **Repeat:** Use the filtered word list to make subsequent guesses, repeating the guess and filter process until the secret word is found or we run out of guesses.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Master {
public:
    int guess(string word);
};

class Solution {
public:
    void findSecretWord(vector<string>& wordlist, Master& master) {
        for (int i = 0, matches = 0; i < 10 && matches < wordlist[0].size(); ++i) {
            unordered_map<string, int> count;
            
            // To reduce the potential word space in one pass, we randomly select
            // Calculate frequency of zero matches per word
            for (string& w1 : wordlist) {
                for (string& w2 : wordlist) {
                    if (match(w1, w2) == 0) {
                        count[w1]++;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Minimize the maximum number of zero matches to guess the next word
            string guessWord = wordlist[0];
            int minZeroMatches = INT_MAX;
            for (string& w : wordlist) {
                if (count[w] < minZeroMatches) {
                    minZeroMatches = count[w];
                    guessWord = w;
                }
            }
            
            matches = master.guess(guessWord);
            vector<string> filteredList;
            for (string& word : wordlist) {
                if (match(guessWord, word) == matches) {
                    filteredList.push_back(word);
                }
            }
            wordlist = filteredList;
        }
    }
    
private:
    int match(string& a, string& b) {
        int matches = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i) {
            if (a[i] == b[i]) {
                matches++;
            }
        }
        return matches;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Guess Function Call:**
   - Worst-case: Called 10 times (guaranteed constraint).

2. **Filtering the List:**
    - Each filtering step involves comparing the guessed word with every word in the list (O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the length of each word). This is done up to 10 times, making it O(10 * N * M).

3. **Overall Complexity:** 
   - O(N * M) where N is the number of words in the list and M is the length of each word, considering the filter operation to be the dominant one.

This approach aims to minimize the number of words remaining in the list by filtering out ones based on the similarity score, optimizing our chances of guessing the secret word within 10 attempts.
