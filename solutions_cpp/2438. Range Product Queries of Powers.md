[Leetcode 2438. Range Product Queries of Powers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2438)
## Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, there exists a 0-indexed array `powers`, composed of the powers of `2`, such that the sum of elements in `powers` is equal to `n`. Additionally, you are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]`.

For each query, compute the product of all `powers[j]` where `left_i <= j <= right_i`. Return an array of integers `answers` where `answers[i]` is the answer for the `i-th` query. Since the answer to a query could be very large, each answer must be computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Constraints:
- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- \(1 \leq queries.length \leq 10^5\)
- \(0 \leq left_i \leq right_i < powers.length\)

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `powers` contain the same power of 2 multiple times? No, each power of 2 should be unique.
2. Are the queries always valid, such that `0 <= left_i <= right_i < powers.length`? Yes.
3. Is it guaranteed that the sum of the array `powers` will exactly match `n`? Yes, thatâ€™s part of the problem statement.

## Strategy
1. Convert the number `n` into a list of powers of 2 that sum up to `n`. This can be done by examining the binary representation of `n`.
2. For each query, compute the product of the specified range in the `powers` array.
3. Ensure that the product calculation takes into account the modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

1. Convert `n` into its binary representation to identify the powers of 2.
2. Store the identified powers of 2 in an array.
3. Loop through each query in `queries` and compute the product of the specified range using modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> productQueries(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        std::vector<int> powers;

        // Extract powers of 2 from the binary representation of n
        for (int i = 0; n > 0; ++i) {
            if (n & 1) {
                powers.push_back(1 << i);
            }
            n >>= 1;
        }

        std::vector<int> result;
        result.reserve(queries.size());

        // Process each query
        for (const auto& query : queries) {
            long long product = 1;
            for (int i = query[0]; i <= query[1]; ++i) {
                product = (product * powers[i]) % MOD;
            }
            result.push_back(static_cast<int>(product));
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Extracting the powers of 2**: This takes \(O(\log n)\) since we check each bit in the binary representation of `n`.
- **Processing each query**: In the worst case if each range length is very close to the size of `powers`, it would result in \(O(q \cdot \log n)\), where \(q\) is the number of queries.
  - Note: Each product computation involves iterating over the specified range in `powers`, which can vary in size but, in the worst case, could be up to \(\log n\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log n + q \cdot \log n)\). The space complexity is \(O(\log n)\) for storing powers derived from the binary representation of `n` and \(O(q)\) for storing the results.
