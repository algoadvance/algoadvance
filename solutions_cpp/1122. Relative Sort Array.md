[Leetcode 1122. Relative Sort Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1122)
## Problem Statement

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`. Sort the elements of `arr1` so that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in ascending order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr1 = [28,6,22,8,44,17], arr2 = [22,28,8,6]
Output: [22,28,8,6,17,44]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the array lengths?**
   - There is no specific constraint provided. Assume typical constraints.

2. **Is it safe to assume all elements of `arr2` are in `arr1`?**
   - Yes, as stated in the problem.

3. **What should be done with elements in `arr1` that are not in `arr2`?**
   - They should be placed at the end in ascending order.

4. **Do we need to consider duplicate numbers in `arr1`?**
   - Yes, duplicates in `arr1` should be handled accordingly.

## Strategy

1. **Count Elements**: First, count the occurrences of each element in `arr1`.
2. **Sort by `arr2`**: Use `arr2` to determine the initial order of elements, respecting their counts.
3. **Sort Remaining Elements**: Sort and append the remaining elements of `arr1` that are not in `arr2`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> relativeSortArray(std::vector<int>& arr1, std::vector<int>& arr2) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
    for (int num : arr1) {
        countMap[num]++;
    }

    std::vector<int> result;

    // Adding elements from arr2 in the required order
    for (int num : arr2) {
        while (countMap[num] > 0) {
            result.push_back(num);
            countMap[num]--;
        }
    }
    
    // Adding remaining elements from arr1 not in arr2
    std::vector<int> remainingElements;
    for (const auto& entry : countMap) {
        while (entry.second > 0) {
            remainingElements.push_back(entry.first);
            entry.second--;
        }
    }
    std::sort(remainingElements.begin(), remainingElements.end());

    // Merge results
    result.insert(result.end(), remainingElements.begin(), remainingElements.end());

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19};
    std::vector<int> arr2 = {2,1,4,3,9,6};
    std::vector<int> result = relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2);
    
    for(int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Counting Elements**: O(N) where N is the size of `arr1`.
2. **Sorting Remaining Elements**: O(M log M) where M is the number of elements not in `arr2`.
3. **Overall**: O(N + M log M) which simplifies to O(N log N) in the worst case, where N is the length of `arr1`.

This approach ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently and meets the problem requirements.
