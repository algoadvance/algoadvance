[Leetcode 2441. Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2441)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zero, find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` is also in `nums`. If there is no such integer, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Will the array always contain at least one element?**
   - Yes, the array will contain at least one element.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the integer values?**
   - The problem does not explicitly mention constraints, so we'll assume typical constraints for such problems on LeetCode (e.g., 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4 and -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5).

3. **Is the array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

### Strategy:

1. **Use a Hash Set**: This will allow O(1) average-time complexity for both insertions and lookups.
2. **Iterate Through the Array and Populate the Set**: As we iterate through the array, keep track of the largest `k` for which both `k` and `-k` exist in the set.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

int findMaxK(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_set<int> numSet;
    int largestK = -1;

    for (int num : nums) {
        numSet.insert(num);
    }

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 0 && numSet.find(-num) != numSet.end()) {
            largestK = std::max(largestK, num);
        }
    }

    return largestK;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Data Structure**: The unordered set (`numSet`) is used to store all elements from the array. This allows us to quickly check the presence of `-k`.
2. **Two-Pass Approach**:
   - **First Pass**: Populate the set with all elements for quick lookup.
   - **Second Pass**: Iterate through the array. For each positive integer `k`, check if `-k` exists in the set. Keep track of the maximum `k` found.

### Time Complexity:

- **Insertion**: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Lookup**: O(n) since we have to check each element once in the worst case.
- **Total**: The overall time complexity is O(n).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest integer `k` such that both `k` and `-k` exist in the array.
