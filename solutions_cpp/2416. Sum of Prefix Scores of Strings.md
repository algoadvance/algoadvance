[Leetcode 2416. Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2416)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, compute the prefix scores for each string and return an array of the same length where each element denotes the prefix score for the corresponding string. The prefix score of a string is defined as the sum of scores of all its prefixes. The score of a prefix is the number of strings in `words` that contain this prefix as a prefix.

In simpler terms, for each string in the array, calculate the sum of the number of strings that share each prefix of that string.

Input:
- An array of strings `words`.

Output:
- An array of integers representing the prefix scores of each string in `words`.

## Example

Input:
```cpp
words = ["abc", "ab", "bc", "b"]
```

Output:
```cpp
[ 5, 4, 3, 2 ]
```

Explanation:
- For "abc":
  - "a" is a prefix for ["abc", "ab"], count = 2
  - "ab" is a prefix for ["abc", "ab"], count = 2
  - "abc" is a prefix for ["abc"], count = 1
  - Sum = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5
- For "ab":
  - "a" is prefix for ["abc", "ab"], count = 2
  - "ab" is prefix for ["abc", "ab"], count = 2
  - Sum = 2 + 2 = 4
- For "bc":
  - "b" is prefix for ["bc", "b"], count = 2
  - "bc" is prefix for ["bc"], count = 1
  - Sum = 2 + 1 = 3
- For "b":
  - "b" is prefix for ["bc", "b"], count = 2
  - Sum = 2

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all elements of the array `words` composed of lowercase English letters only? 
2. Can the words contain only single character, and is there any upper limit on the length of each word?
3. Are there duplicate strings allowed in the input?

Let's assume:
1. Yes, all elements are lowercase English letters.
2. Yes, words can have variable length, and there isn't any specific upper limit provided.
3. Yes, duplicates are allowed.

## Strategy

1. **Trie Data Structure**: Use a Trie to store all prefixes and count the occurrences of each prefix.
   - Insert each word into the trie.
   - Each node in the trie will maintain a count of how many times that particular prefix is encountered.
2. **Compute Scores**: For each word, traverse the trie to compute the prefix scores by summing up the counts of each prefix as we traverse the trie.

## Time Complexity
- Insertion into Trie: O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the maximum length of a word.
- Computing Scores: O(n * m).

Thus, the overall complexity is O(n * m).

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve this problem.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    int count;
    
    TrieNode() : count(0) {}
};

class Trie {
public:
    TrieNode* root;
    
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(const string &word) {
        TrieNode* currentNode = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (currentNode->children.find(c) == currentNode->children.end()) {
                currentNode->children[c] = new TrieNode();
            }
            currentNode = currentNode->children[c];
            currentNode->count++; // Increment the prefix count at each node
        }
    }
    
    int computePrefixScore(const string &word) {
        TrieNode* currentNode = root;
        int score = 0;
        for (char c : word) {
            currentNode = currentNode->children[c];
            score += currentNode->count;
        }
        return score;
    }
};

vector<int> sumPrefixScores(vector<string>& words) {
    Trie trie;
    for (const string& word : words) {
        trie.insert(word);
    }
    
    vector<int> result;
    for (const string& word : words) {
        result.push_back(trie.computePrefixScore(word));
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This code initializes a Trie data structure, inserts all the words into the Trie, and then computes the prefix scores for each word based on the prefix counts stored in the Trie nodes.
