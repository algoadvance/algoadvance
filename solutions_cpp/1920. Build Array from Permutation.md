[Leetcode 1920. Build Array from Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1920)
### Problem Statement

You are given a zero-indexed array `nums` of size `n` consisting of distinct integers from `0` to `n - 1`. You need to build a new array `ans` where `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` for each `0 <= i < n` and return it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input array guaranteed to contain all integers from `0` to `n-1` without duplicates?
   - What would be the size constraints of the input array `nums`?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output array be of the same length as the input array?
   - Is in-place modification of the input array allowed or should a new array be created?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the behavior for the smallest input size (`n = 1`)?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to iterate through the input array `nums`.
   - For every element `i`, we compute `ans[i]` such that `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]`.

2. **Steps to Solve:**
   - Initialize an empty array `ans` of the same length as `nums`.
   - Iterate through the input array `nums`.
   - For each index `i`, assign `ans[i]` the value of `nums[nums[i]]`.

3. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - Since all elements in `nums` are distinct and from `0` to `n-1`, there is no out-of-bound access.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ans[i] = nums[nums[i]];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the array `nums` exactly once, performing a constant-time operation `nums[nums[i]]` for each element.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We use an additional array `ans` of the same length as the input array `nums`.

### Explanation:
- We iterate over the input vector `nums`.
- For each index `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `nums[nums[i]]` as per the problem statement.
- Finally, we return the constructed array `ans`.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the constraints of the problem effectively.
