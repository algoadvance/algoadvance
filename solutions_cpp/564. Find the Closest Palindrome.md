[Leetcode 564. Find the Closest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l564)
## Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. The 'closest' is defined as the absolute difference between two integers, and if there is a tie, the smaller one is more 'closest'.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = "123"
Output: "121"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = "1"
Output: "0"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = "99"
Output: "101"
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `n` be negative?
   - No, it is given as an unsigned integer represented as a string.
2. What is the maximum length of the input string `n`?
   - Length can go up to 18 digits to fit within the range of a `long long` in C++.

## Strategy:
To find the closest palindrome, we will generate the following candidates and choose the best one:
1. The palindrome formed by the upper half of the string.
2. The palindrome formed by incrementing the upper half of the string and reflecting it.
3. The palindrome formed by decrementing the upper half of the string and reflecting it.
4. One less than `n` (to possibly get a smaller palindrome).
5. One more than `n` (to possibly get a larger palindrome).
6. Special cases for very small numbers like "0", "1", etc.

We will convert these candidates to their integer form, compute their absolute difference from `n`, and then choose the smallest one (preferring the smaller numerical value in case of a tie).

## Time Complexity:
The approach should work in `O(1)` time concerning the length of the number, as it involves a fixed number of string manipulations and comparisons.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

string getLargerPalindrome(string half) {
    int n = half.length();
    string mirrored = half;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
        mirrored[n - i - 1] = mirrored[i];
    }
    return mirrored;
}

string getSmallerPalindrome(string half) {
    int n = half.length();
    string mirrored = half;
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
        mirrored[n - i - 1] = mirrored[i];
    }
    return mirrored;
}

string findClosestPalindrome(string n) {
    int len = n.length();
    if (len == 1) {
        return to_string(stoi(n) - 1);
    }

    vector<string> candidates;
    long ni = stol(n);
    
    // Get the upper half
    string upperHalf = n.substr(0, (len + 1) / 2);
    
    // Case 1: The palindrome formed by the upper half directly
    string candidate1 = getLargerPalindrome(n.substr(0, len / 2 + 1));
    candidates.push_back(candidate1);

    // Case 2: The palindrome formed by incrementing the upper half
    long upperHalfIncremented = stol(upperHalf) + 1;
    string upperHalfStrIncremented = to_string(upperHalfIncremented);
    string candidate2 = getLargerPalindrome(upperHalfStrIncremented);
    candidates.push_back(candidate2);

    // Case 3: The palindrome formed by decrementing the upper half
    long upperHalfDecremented = stol(upperHalf) - 1;
    if (upperHalfDecremented > 0 || (upperHalfDecremented == 0 && len > 1)) {
        string upperHalfStrDecremented = to_string(upperHalfDecremented);
        string candidate3 = getLargerPalindrome(upperHalfStrDecremented);
        candidates.push_back(candidate3);
    }

    // Case 4: One less than n
    candidates.push_back(to_string(ni - 1));

    // Case 5: One more than n
    candidates.push_back(to_string(ni + 1));
    
    string closest;
    long closestDiff = LONG_MAX;

    for (string candidate : candidates) {
        if (candidate == n || candidate.empty()) continue;
        long candidateLong = stol(candidate);
        long diff = abs(candidateLong - ni);
        if (diff < closestDiff || (diff == closestDiff && candidateLong < stol(closest))) {
            closestDiff = diff;
            closest = candidate;
        }
    }
    
    return closest;
}

int main() {
    string n = "123";
    cout << findClosestPalindrome(n) << endl; // Output: 121
    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a structured way to find the closest palindrome by considering potential candidates, checking their differences from the input, and selecting the best match.
