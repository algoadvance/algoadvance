[Leetcode 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2302)
Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, your task is to count the number of non-empty subarrays such that the score of the subarray is less than `k`. The score of a subarray consisting of `nums[l], nums[l+1], ..., nums[r]` is defined as the product of the sum of the subarray and the length of the subarray.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the size of the array and the values inside it?**
   - Assume `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
  
2. **Can `k` be negative or zero?**
   - No, `k` will be a positive integer.

3. **Do we need to consider only contiguous subarrays?**
   - Yes, only contiguous subarrays are considered.

### Strategy
Given the constraints, a brute-force solution of checking every possible subarray can be very inefficient (O(n^3)).

To optimize this, we can use a **sliding window** (two-pointer technique):
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` (both starting at the beginning of the array).
2. Maintain a sum of the current window.
3. For each starting point `i`, expand the window by moving `j` to the right.
    - Calculate the score of the current subarray (`current_sum * (j - i + 1)`).
    - If the score is less than `k`, increment `j`.
    - Otherwise, move `i` right and adjust the window.
4. We need to count all subarrays that meet the criteria as we expand and contract the window.

This reduces the complexity to O(n) since both pointers only traverse the list once.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;
        int current_sum = 0;
        int i = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            current_sum += nums[j];
            while (i <= j && current_sum * (j - i + 1) >= k) {
                current_sum -= nums[i++];
            }
            // All subarrays ending at j and starting from i to j are valid
            count += (j - i + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k = 10;
    int result = sol.countSubarrays(nums, k);
    cout << "Number of subarrays with score less than " << k << " is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The above solution maintains a time complexity of O(n) because each element is visited at most twice (once by the `j` pointer and once by the `i` pointer).
- The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the number of subarrays whose scores are less than `k` while avoiding the pitfalls of a brute-force method.
