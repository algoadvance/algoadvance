[Leetcode 2418. Sort the People](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2418)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `names`, and an array `heights` that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length `n`.

For each \(i\) (\(0 \leq i < n\)), \(names[i]\) and \(heights[i]\) denote the name and height of the \(i\)-th person.

Return the names of the people, sorted in descending order by their height.

### Example:
- Input: 
  - `names = ["Mary","John","Emma"]`
  - `heights = [180,165,170]`
- Output: 
  - `["Mary","Emma","John"]`
- Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and then John.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of `names` and `heights` always the same?**
   - Yes, both arrays will always have the same length `n`.
2. **Can the names array have duplicate names?**
   - No, the problem does not specify uniqueness in names but specifies that heights are distinct.
3. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typical constraints would be useful, but generally, you can assume \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<string> sortPeople(vector<string>& names, vector<int>& heights) {
    // Create a vector of pairs (height, name)
    vector<pair<int, string>> people;
    for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); ++i) {
        people.emplace_back(heights[i], names[i]);
    }

    // Sort the people by height in descending order
    sort(people.begin(), people.end(), [](const pair<int, string>& a, const pair<int, string>& b) {
        return b.first < a.first; // Sort in descending order
    });

    // Extract the sorted names
    vector<string> sortedNames;
    for (const auto& person : people) {
        sortedNames.push_back(person.second);
    }

    return sortedNames;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<string> names = {"Mary", "John", "Emma"};
    vector<int> heights = {180, 165, 170};
    vector<string> sortedNames = sortPeople(names, heights);

    for (const string& name : sortedNames) {
        cout << name << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Expected Output: Mary Emma John

    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Combine into Pairs:** Pair each name with its corresponding height. This will help to sort them together.
2. **Sort the Pairs:** Use the `sort` function with a custom comparator to sort the pairs based on heights in descending order.
3. **Extract Names:** Once sorted, extract names from the pairs in the new order.

Using this strategy, you can ensure that the names are sorted by height efficiently.

## Time Complexity

- **Pairing the names and heights:** This takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Sorting the pairs:** Standard sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, have an average time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Extracting sorted names:** This also takes \(O(n)\) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional storage needed for the pair vector.
