[Leetcode 2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2022)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 1D array `original` and two integers `m` and `n`. You are required to write a function that reshapes the 1D array into a 2D array with `m` rows and `n` columns.

If it is not possible to reshape the array due to mismatch in total size, return an empty 2D array.

### Example 1:

- **Input:**
  - `original = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - `m = 2`
  - `n = 2`
- **Output:** `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`

### Example 2:

- **Input:**
  - `original = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `m = 1`
  - `n = 3`
- **Output:** `[[1, 2, 3]]`

### Example 3:

- **Input:**
  - `original = [1, 2]`
  - `m = 1`
  - `n = 1`
- **Output:** `[]`
  
## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be done if `original` is empty?
   - **A:** If `original` is empty and `m` and `n` are both zero, return an empty 2D array. If `m` or `n` are non-zero, return an empty array as reshaping is not possible.
   
2. **Q:** Are the elements in `original` always positive integers?
   - **A:** The elements can be any integer, but it doesn't affect the reshaping logic.

3. **Q:** What if `m` or `n` are less than or equal to zero?
   - **A:** Since the dimensions for a matrix can't be non-positive, we should return an empty array in such cases.

## Strategy

1. **Check Validity:** First, we need to check if the reshape is possible by comparing the size of `original` with `m * n`.
2. **Initialization:** If sizes match, initialize a 2D vector of size `m` by `n`.
3. **Filling the 2D Array:** Use a nested loop or row-major indexing to fill in the 2D array from the 1D array.
4. **Return Result:** Return the freshly constructed 2D array if reshaping is possible; otherwise, return an empty vector.

## Code

Here's the C++ code to convert the 1D array into a 2D array:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> construct2DArray(vector<int>& original, int m, int n) {
        int totalSize = original.size();
        if (totalSize != m * n) {
            return vector<vector<int>>(); // Return an empty vector if reshaping is not possible
        }

        vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; ++i) {
            result[i / n][i % n] = original[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(m * n)** or **O(totalSize)** because we are iterating over the `original` array exactly once to fill the 2D array. The auxiliary space complexity is **O(1)**, excluding the space needed for the result vector.
