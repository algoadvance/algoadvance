[Leetcode 2512. Reward Top K Students](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2512)
Sure, let's start by breaking down the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement

You need to identify the top K students based on their report scores using a reward system. Given lists of positive and negative feedback words, a list of report strings, and a list of student IDs, you need to calculate a total score for each student. Positive feedback words increase the score, while negative feedback words decrease the score. Return the top K student IDs sorted by the highest score, and in case of a tie, by the smallest ID.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case sensitivity**: Are the feedback words in the reports case-sensitive?
2. **Input constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of the input lists?
3. **Tie-breaking**: Confirming that in case of a tie in the scores, we are to return the smaller student ID.

Let's assume the feedback words are case-insensitive and work within reasonable input size constraints (10000 reports, 100 feedback words, etc.).

Now we can proceed to the code.

### Strategy

1. **Preprocessing**:
    - Convert the positive and negative feedback words lists into sets for O(1) lookup.
    - Convert all feedback words to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.
      
2. **Score Calculation**:
    - Iterate over each report and split it into words.
    - Calculate the score based on the number of occurrences of positive and negative feedback words in each report.
      
3. **Ranking**:
    - Store the student scores in a vector of pairs. Sort the vector based on scores in descending order, and in case of a tie, sort by student IDs in ascending order.
    - Extract the top K student IDs from the sorted list.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> topKStudents(
    vector<string>& positive_feedback,
    vector<string>& negative_feedback,
    vector<string>& reports,
    vector<int>& student_id,
    int k) {
    
    unordered_set<string> positive_set;
    unordered_set<string> negative_set;
    
    // Convert feedback words to lowercase
    auto toLower = [](string &str) {
        transform(str.begin(), str.end(), str.begin(), ::tolower);
    };
    
    for (const string &word : positive_feedback) {
        string lw = word;
        toLower(lw);
        positive_set.emplace(lw);
    }
    
    for (const string &word : negative_feedback) {
        string lw = word;
        toLower(lw);
        negative_set.emplace(lw);
    }

    unordered_map<int, int> score_map;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < reports.size(); ++i) {
        stringstream ss(reports[i]);
        string word;
        int student_score = 0;

        while (ss >> word) {
            toLower(word);
            if (positive_set.count(word)) {
                student_score++;
            } else if (negative_set.count(word)) {
                student_score--;
            }
        }

        score_map[student_id[i]] += student_score;
    }

    vector<pair<int, int>> student_scores(score_map.begin(), score_map.end());

    sort(student_scores.begin(), student_scores.end(), [](const pair<int, int> &a, const pair<int, int> &b) {
        if (a.second == b.second) return a.first < b.first;
        return a.second > b.second;
    });

    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < k && i < student_scores.size(); ++i) {
        result.push_back(student_scores[i].first);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Insertion and Lookup in Sets**: O(1) average time for both positive and negative sets.
2. **Iterating Reports and Calculating Scores**: O(m * n), where `m` is the average length of each report and `n` is the number of reports.
3. **Sorting**: O(p log p), where `p` is the number of unique students.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by O(n * m) + O(p log p), ensuring efficiency for reasonable input sizes.
