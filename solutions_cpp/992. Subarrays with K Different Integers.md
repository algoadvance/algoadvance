[Leetcode 992. Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l992)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of good subarrays with exactly `k` different integers.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

### Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers are:
[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,3]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What are the constraints on the input array `nums` and the integer `k`?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 20000`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`
   - `1 <= k <= nums.length`

2. **Is it guaranteed that `nums` and `k` will always meet these constraints?**
   - Yes.

3. **Are we always dealing with non-negative integers in the list `nums`?**
   - Yes, based on the constraints provided.

### Strategy:

To solve this efficiently, we'll use the sliding window (two pointers) technique combined with a hash map to count the number of subarrays with at most `k` different integers. The key insight is that:

- The number of subarrays with exactly `k` different integers is the difference between the number of subarrays with at most `k` different integers and the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` different integers.
  
  Mathematically:
  \[
  \text{Subarrays with exactly } k \text{ different integers} = \text{Subarrays with at most } k \text{ different integers} - \text{Subarrays with at most } k-1 \text{ different integers}
  \]

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysWithKDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        return atMostKDistinct(nums, k) - atMostKDistinct(nums, k - 1);
    }
    
private:
    int atMostKDistinct(const vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int left = 0, right = 0, distinct = 0, result = 0;
        
        while (right < nums.size()) {
            if (count[nums[right]] == 0) {
                distinct++;
            }
            count[nums[right]]++;
            right++;
            
            while (distinct > k) {
                count[nums[left]]--;
                if (count[nums[left]] == 0) {
                    distinct--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            result += right - left;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3};
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Number of subarrays with exactly " << k << " different integers: " << sol.subarraysWithKDistinct(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`subarraysWithKDistinct` Function**:
   - This function calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct integers by computing the difference between the subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers and the subarrays with at most `k-1` distinct integers.

2. **`atMostKDistinct` Function**:
   - This helper function calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers using the sliding window (two pointers) technique.
   - A hash map `count` keeps track of the count of each integer in the current window.
   - `left` and `right` pointers denote the current window.
   - Increment `right` to expand the window and adjust `left` to maintain at most `k` distinct integers in the window.
   - For each position of `right`, the window size (number of subarrays ending at `right` and starting between `left` and `right`) is added to the result.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by each pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, in the worst case, for the hash map storing the count of elements.
