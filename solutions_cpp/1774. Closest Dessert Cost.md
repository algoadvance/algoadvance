[Leetcode 1774. Closest Dessert Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1774)
## Problem Statement

You have `n` ice cream base costs, represented by an integer array `baseCosts`, and `m` topping costs, represented by an integer array `toppingCosts`. You want to make a dessert with a total cost that is as close as possible to the target `target`.

You can use each base cost (from `baseCosts`) at most once, and you can use each topping cost (from `toppingCosts`) at most twice.

Return the closest possible cost of the dessert to the target. If there are multiple options, return the lower one.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: baseCosts = [1, 7], toppingCosts = [3, 4], target = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: You can use the following combinations: 
- 1 + (3 * 2) + (4 * 1) = 11
- 7 + (3 * 1) + (4 * 1) = 14
- 1 + (3 * 1) + (4 * 1) = 8
- 7 + (3 * 2) + (4 * 0) = 13
- 7 + (3 * 1) + (4 * 0) = 10 (closest to the target) 
- 1 + (3 * 0) + (4 * 0) = 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `baseCosts` and `toppingCosts` arrays be empty?
2. What are the constraints on the values of `baseCosts` and `toppingCosts`, and their lengths?
3. Is it guaranteed that the length of `baseCosts` and `toppingCosts` are within a reasonable range for a DFS solution?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible combinations of base and topping costs. For each combination, we keep track of the total cost and compare it against the target.

### Steps
1. Iterate over each base cost.
2. Use DFS to explore toppings. For each topping, you can either:
   - Ignore it.
   - Use it once.
   - Use it twice.
3. During DFS, maintain a variable to store the closest cost to the target.
4. Update the closest cost whenever a better candidate is found.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
private:
    void dfs(const std::vector<int>& toppingCosts, int index, int currentCost, int target, int& closest) {
        if (index == toppingCosts.size()) {
            if (std::abs(currentCost - target) < std::abs(closest - target) || 
                (std::abs(currentCost - target) == std::abs(closest - target) && currentCost < closest)) {
                closest = currentCost;
            }
            return;
        }
        
        // Explore the three cases: using the topping 0, 1, or 2 times
        dfs(toppingCosts, index + 1, currentCost, target, closest);
        dfs(toppingCosts, index + 1, currentCost + toppingCosts[index], target, closest);
        dfs(toppingCosts, index + 1, currentCost + 2 * toppingCosts[index], target, closest);
    }

public:
    int closestCost(std::vector<int>& baseCosts, std::vector<int>& toppingCosts, int target) {
        int closest = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int base : baseCosts) {
            dfs(toppingCosts, 0, base, target, closest);
        }
        
        return closest;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution depends on how many topping options we have. For each base cost, we perform a DFS traversal of the topping costs, which can be `3^m`, where `m` is the number of toppings (considering using each topping 0, 1, or 2 times).

- Let's denote `n` as the number of base costs and `m` as the number of topping costs.
- For each base, we traverse `3^m` combinations in the worst case.

Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n \cdot 3^m)\).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is primarily due to the depth of the recursion, which is `O(m)`.

This implementation should work well within the typical constraints provided in coding interview scenarios.
