[Leetcode 2001. Number of Pairs of Interchangeable Rectangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2001)
## Problem Statement
You are given `n` rectangles represented by a 2D integer array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [width_i, height_i]`.

Two rectangles `i` and `j` (i â‰  j) are considered interchangeable if, after rotating both rectangles (if necessary), they have the same width-to-height ratio. More formally, two rectangles `[width1, height1]` and `[width2, height2]` are interchangeable if and only if `width1/height1 == width2/height2`.

Return the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the ratio a floating-point comparison, or would it be better to use a fraction comparison to avoid precision issues?
   - A: You should use a fraction comparison (numerator/denominator form) to avoid precision issues.
   
2. Do all rectangle widths and heights fit into the range of integers?
   - A: Yes, they fit within the standard range of integers.

3. How should the solution handle rectangles with zero width or height?
   - A: Rectangles will have non-zero positive integers as their dimensions.

## Strategy
1. **Calculate Ratios:** For each rectangle, calculate the ratio of its width to height. To avoid floating-point precision issues, store the ratios as fractions in their simplest form.
2. **Use Hash Map:** Use an unordered map (hash map) where the key is the ratio (stored as a pair of integers representing the fraction in its simplest form) and the value is the count of how many times this ratio has appeared.
3. **Count Pairs:** Use the formula for combinations to determine the number of pairs for each unique ratio. If a ratio appears `k` times, the number of pairs is given by `k * (k - 1) / 2`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int interchangeableRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        auto gcd = [](int a, int b) {
            while (b != 0) {
                int temp = b;
                b = a % b;
                a = temp;
            }
            return a;
        };

        unordered_map<pair<int, int>, int, pair_hash> ratio_count;
        
        for (const auto& rect : rectangles) {
            int width = rect[0];
            int height = rect[1];
            int g = gcd(width, height);
            // Store simplified ratio
            int simple_width = width / g;
            int simple_height = height / g;
            ratio_count[{simple_width, simple_height}]++;
        }

        long long num_pairs = 0;
        for (const auto& entry : ratio_count) {
            int count = entry.second;
            if (count > 1) {
                num_pairs += static_cast<long long>(count) * (count - 1) / 2;
            }
        }

        return num_pairs;
    }
    
    // Custom hash function for pairs
    struct pair_hash {
        template <class T1, class T2>
        std::size_t operator() (const std::pair<T1, T2> &pair) const {
            return std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) ^ std::hash<T2>()(pair.second);
        }
    };
};
```

## Time Complexity
1. **GCD Calculation:** Each call to the GCD function takes O(log(min(a, b))) time.
2. **Loop Through Rectangles:** Looping through `n` rectangles takes O(n) time.
3. **Hash Map Operations:** Each insert and lookup in the hash map takes O(1) on average.
4. **Final Loop Through Hash Map:** Looping through the unique keys in the hash map generally takes O(k) time, where `k` is the number of unique ratios.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n log(min(width, height))) for the GCD computations within the loop.

This solution is efficient and leverages hashing and the properties of fractions to accurately count and compare the ratios.
