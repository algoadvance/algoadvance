[Leetcode 2748. Number of Beautiful Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2748)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is called beautiful if `1 <= i < j <= nums.length` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first digit of `nums[i]` and the last digit of `nums[j]` is 1. Return the number of beautiful pairs in the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
   - What are the possible ranges for the values within `nums`?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output be the total count of beautiful pairs, or additionally, should we return the pairs themselves?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if `nums` contains only one element?

### Strategy

1. **Extract Digits**:
   - For each number in `nums`, extract the first and the last digits.
   
2. **Check GCD Condition**:
   - Use the `__gcd` function from the `<numeric>` library to check if the GCD of the first digit of `nums[i]` and the last digit of `nums[j]` is 1.

3. **Counting Pairs**:
   - Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= nums.length` and count those pairs which meet the condition.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>  // for __gcd function

int firstDigit(int num) {
    while (num >= 10) {
        num /= 10;
    }
    return num;
}

int lastDigit(int num) {
    return num % 10;
}

int countBeautifulPairs(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int beautifulPairsCount = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int firstDigitI = firstDigit(nums[i]);
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            int lastDigitJ = lastDigit(nums[j]);
            if (std::gcd(firstDigitI, lastDigitJ) == 1) {
                beautifulPairsCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return beautifulPairsCount;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {13, 25, 32, 49};
    std::cout << "Number of beautiful pairs: " << countBeautifulPairs(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Extraction of digits**: Each number requires a logarithmic time operation to extract the first digit which can be approximated as \(O(1)\) since the numbers are bounded.
- **Nested loop**: The loops to generate pairs `(i, j)` have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).
- **GCD Calculation**: Each GCD computation is \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\), but since the digits involved are only from 1 to 9, this is also \(O(1)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.

### Space Complexity

- The space used is constant \(O(1)\) beyond the input data because we only store a few integer variables.

This solution efficiently and clearly identifies the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging straightforward algorithm constructs and the properties of GCD.
