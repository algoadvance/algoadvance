[Leetcode 2780. Minimum Index of a Valid Split](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2780)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array called `nums`. We need to find the minimum index `min_idx` such that, if we split the array at `min_idx`, the most frequent element in the left part is different from the most frequent element in the right part. That is, for the array to be split at `min_idx` (i.e., `nums[0:min_idx+1]` and `nums[min_idx+1:]`), the most frequent element on the left side should be different from that on the right side.

If no such index exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always guaranteed to have a solution?** 
   - No, if no such `min_idx` exists, we should return -1.

2. **What is the size range of the array?**
   - The size of the array can vary, and could be very large, up to 10^5 or more.

3. **Are there any constraints on the elements within the array?**
   - The elements are integers and can be negative, zero, or positive.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find a split point such that the most frequent elements on the two sides of the split are different.
   
2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Use a hash map to store the frequency counts of elements.
   - First, calculate the frequency of all elements in the entire array.
   - As you traverse the array to consider different split points, update the frequency hash maps for the left and right parts dynamically.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - For each possible split point, the most frequent element in the left part must not be the same as the most frequent element in the right part.

4. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Traverse the array once to build the initial frequency map.
   - Traverse the array again to dynamically update the frequency maps for left and right parts and check the condition at each split point.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimumIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n < 2) return -1; // Need at least one element on each side

    unordered_map<int, int> totalFreq;
    for (int num : nums) {
        totalFreq[num]++;
    }

    unordered_map<int, int> leftFreq;
    unordered_map<int, int> rightFreq = totalFreq;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        rightFreq[nums[i]]--;
        if (rightFreq[nums[i]] == 0) {
            rightFreq.erase(nums[i]);
        }
        
        leftFreq[nums[i]]++;
        
        if (i + 1 < n) {
            int leftMajority = max_element(leftFreq.begin(), leftFreq.end(),
                            [](const pair<int,int>& p1, const pair<int,int>& p2) {
                                return p1.second < p2.second;
                            })->first;

            int rightMajority = max_element(rightFreq.begin(), rightFreq.end(),
                            [](const pair<int,int>& p1, const pair<int,int>& p2) {
                                return p1.second < p2.second;
                            })->first;

            if (leftMajority != rightMajority) {
                return i;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial frequency computation:** `O(n)`
- **Traversing for split points:** `O(n)`
- **Finding the majority element:** `O(log k)` for updating the frequency maps where `k` is the number of unique elements, but this is manageable as k â‰¤ n.

Overall time complexity: **O(n log k)**, owing to efficient hashmap operations.
