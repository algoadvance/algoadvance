[Leetcode 2469. Convert the Temperature](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2469)
## Problem Statement
You are given a temperature in Celsius. You need to convert it to both Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it in an array where:
- The first element is the temperature in Kelvin.
- The second element is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Given a floating-point number `celsius` representing the temperature in Celsius, you need to implement a function that returns the resulting temperatures in a list of two floating point numbers.

### Conversion Formulas
- To convert Celsius to Kelvin: \( K = C + 273.15 \)
- To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit: \( F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \)

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are there any specific bounds on the value of the temperature in Celsius?
     - The problem statement does not specify any bounds, but we will assume it is a valid floating-point number.
     
2. **Output Format**:
   - Should the conversion retain a certain number of decimal places, or is any floating-point precision acceptable?
     - We will assume that any reasonable floating-point precision is acceptable unless otherwise specified.

## Strategy
1. Read the input temperature in Celsius.
2. Convert the temperature to Kelvin using the formula \( K = C + 273.15 \).
3. Convert the temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula \( F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 \).
4. Return the results in the specified array format `[Kelvin, Fahrenheit]`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<double> convertTemperature(double celsius) {
        double kelvin = celsius + 273.15;
        double fahrenheit = celsius * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32.0;
        return {kelvin, fahrenheit};
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is \( O(1) \), which is constant time. The reason is that only a fixed number of arithmetic operations are performed, irrespective of the input size.
