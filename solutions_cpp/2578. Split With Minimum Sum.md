[Leetcode 2578. Split With Minimum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2578)
## Problem Statement
You are given a positive integer `num` consisting of exactly `n` digits. You should split the number into two new integers `num1` and `num2` such that:
- `num1` and `num2` are non-negative integers.
- The concatenation of `num1` and `num2's` digits results in `num`.
- `num1` and `num2` must not contain any leading zeros.

The task is to minimize the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

**Example:**
```
Input: num = 4325
Output: 59
Explanation: num1 is 4 and num2 is 325, and their sum is 4 + 55 = 59. 

Input: num = 687
Output: 75
Explanation: num1 is 6 and num2 is 87, and their sum is 6 + 69 = 75.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the minimum number of digits `num` can have?** 
   - `num` will have at least 2 digits.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of `num`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but in general, assume reasonable limits for typical coding challenge environments (e.g., within the range of a standard data type).

3. **Can `num1` and `num2` be equal to zero?**
   - No, `num1` and `num2` cannot have leading zeros and must be valid non-negative integers when split.

## Strategy
To minimize the sum of the resulting numbers from the split, the lower digits should be distributed into the smaller number and the higher digits should focus on creating a larger number. Sorting the digits will help in arranging them optimally.

1. **Convert the number to a string** for easy manipulation of its digits.
2. **Sort the digits in ascending order** to process from the smallest to largest.
3. **Distribute the digits alternately** between two numbers, which can help in minimizing the sum.
4. Convert the results back into integers and return their sum.

## Code
Here is a concise implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int splitWithMinimumSum(int num) {
    string numStr = to_string(num);
    sort(numStr.begin(), numStr.end());

    string num1, num2;
    for (int i = 0; i < numStr.size(); ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0)
            num1 += numStr[i];
        else
            num2 += numStr[i];
    }

    // Convert the resulting strings back to integers
    int num1Int = num1.empty() ? 0 : stoi(num1);
    int num2Int = num2.empty() ? 0 : stoi(num2);
    
    return num1Int + num2Int;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    int num = 4325;
    cout << "Minimum sum after split: " << splitWithMinimumSum(num) << endl;  // Output: 59

    num = 687;
    cout << "Minimum sum after split: " << splitWithMinimumSum(num) << endl;  // Output: 75

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The main operations are:
1. **Conversion of integer to string** - O(n), where n is the number of digits.
2. **Sorting the digits** - O(n log n).
3. **Distributing the digits** - O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
