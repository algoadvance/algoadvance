## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2276: Count Integers in Intervals

You are given a series of queries for intervals. Implement a data structure that can efficiently add intervals and count the number of unique integers contained in all the intervals.

You need to implement the `CountIntervals` class:

- `CountIntervals()` Initializes the object with an empty set of intervals.
- `void add(int left, int right)` Adds the interval `[left, right]` to the set of intervals.
- `int count()` Returns the number of unique integers contained in all the intervals.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the intervals always closed (inclusive) intervals?**
   - Yes, intervals are always of the form [left, right].
2. **Can intervals overlap or be contiguous?**
   - Yes, intervals can overlap, be contiguous, or be entirely contained within another interval.
3. **Is there a constraint on the size of `left` and `right`?**
   - Both `left` and `right` are integers that can span a large range.
4. **What is the typical number of add operations and count operations?**
   - A solution needs to be efficient enough to handle a large number of operations.

## Strategy

To efficiently manage overlapping and contiguous intervals, we can use a data structure to store and merge intervals as they are added. A good candidate is the `std::map` data structure in C++, which provides logarithmic time complexity for insertion and find operations.

Here's the strategy:

1. **Storing intervals:** Use a `std::map` where keys are interval start points and values are interval end points.
2. **Adding intervals:** When adding a new interval, use the map to merge overlapping or contiguous intervals.
3. **Counting unique integers:** Maintain a count of total covered integers as intervals are added. Adjust this count dynamically by considering merges and overlaps.

## Code

```cpp
#include <map>

class CountIntervals {
private:
    std::map<int, int> intervals;
    int totalCount;

public:
    CountIntervals() : totalCount(0) {}

    void add(int left, int right) {
        auto it = intervals.lower_bound(left);
        if (it != intervals.begin() && std::prev(it)->second >= left - 1) {
            --it;
        }

        while (it != intervals.end() && it->first <= right + 1) {
            left = std::min(left, it->first);
            right = std::max(right, it->second);
            totalCount -= (it->second - it->first + 1);
            it = intervals.erase(it);
        }

        intervals[left] = right;
        totalCount += (right - left + 1);
    }

    int count() const {
        return totalCount;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **add()**: Each add operation needs to handle merge operations and involves a traversal over potentially overlapping intervals. This results in a complexity of \(O(M \log N)\), where \(M\) is the number of intervals being merged and \(N\) is the number of intervals stored.
- **count()**: This operation is \(O(1)\) since we maintain the total count dynamically.

Overall, the solution efficiently manages intervals and counts unique integers in logarithmic time for add operations.
