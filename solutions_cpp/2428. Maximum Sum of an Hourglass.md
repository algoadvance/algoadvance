[Leetcode 2428. Maximum Sum of an Hourglass](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2428)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the maximum sum of an hourglass. The hourglass is defined as a subset of elements of the matrix with the following form:
```
a b c
  d
e f g
```
Such that:
1. an hourglass must be entirely contained within the matrix.
2. Return the maximum sum of elements of an hourglass.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the minimum and maximum size of the matrix `m x n`?
    - Are there negative numbers in the matrix?

2. **Output:**
    - Is the result always going to be a single integer?
    
For now, I'll assume:
- The matrix `m x n` will have dimensions such that `m, n ≥ 3` because an hourglass must be contained within the matrix.
- Elements of the matrix could be both positive or negative.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Iterate through each possible center point of the hourglass in the grid, considering that an hourglass centered at position `(i, j)` can only be valid if `i` ranges from 1 to `m-2` and `j` ranges from 1 to `n-2`.
2. Calculate the sum of each hourglass following the pattern:
   ```
   grid[i-1][j-1] + grid[i-1][j] + grid[i-1][j+1]
                    grid[i][j]
   grid[i+1][j-1] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i+1][j+1]
   ```
3. Track the maximum sum of all calculated hourglass sums.
4. Return the maximum sum found.

### Time Complexity
Given an `m x n` matrix:
- Iterating through each valid center point involves `(m-2) * (n-2)` positions.
- Calculating the sum for each hourglass involves a constant number of 7 operations.
Hence, the time complexity is `O((m-2) * (n-2)) ≈ O(m * n)`.

### Code
Here's the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int maxSum = INT_MIN;
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
                int hourglassSum = grid[i - 1][j - 1] + grid[i - 1][j] + grid[i - 1][j + 1]
                                 + grid[i][j]
                                 + grid[i + 1][j - 1] + grid[i + 1][j] + grid[i + 1][j + 1];
                
                maxSum = std::max(maxSum, hourglassSum);
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. We initialize `maxSum` to `INT_MIN` to ensure it properly updates even if all possible sums are negative.
2. We then iterate through each valid center of an hourglass using two nested loops.
    - The outer loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m-2`.
    - The inner loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n-2`.
3. For each center point `(i, j)`, we calculate the hourglass sum by accessing the required matrix elements.
4. We update `maxSum` with the maximum value between the current `maxSum` and the calculated `hourglassSum`.
5. Finally, once all positions are checked, we return the `maxSum`.
