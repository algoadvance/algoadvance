[Leetcode 2531. Make Number of Distinct Characters Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2531)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, you need to determine if you can make the number of distinct characters in both strings equal by modifying at most one character in each string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the inputs always valid strings consisting of lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, both `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

2. **Can the strings be of different lengths?**
   - Yes, they can differ in length.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - Return `true` if you can make the number of distinct characters in both strings equal by modifying at most one character in each string; otherwise, return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Distinct Character Counts**:
   - Use a set to find and store the number of distinct characters in both `word1` and `word2`.

2. **Direct Comparison**:
   - If the number of distinct characters in both strings is already equal, return `true`.

3. **Simulate Modification**:
   - Consider removing any one character from `word1` and adding any one character from `word2` to `word1`.
   - Perform a similar operation for `word2`: removing a character from `word2` and adding a character from `word1`.

### Code Implementation

Here's how you can implement this logic in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

bool canMakeDistinctCharsEqual(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
    std::unordered_set<char> set1(word1.begin(), word1.end());
    std::unordered_set<char> set2(word2.begin(), word2.end());
    
    int distinctCount1 = set1.size();
    int distinctCount2 = set2.size();
    
    if (distinctCount1 == distinctCount2) {
        return true;
    }

    // Cases checking with modifications allowed
    if (std::abs(distinctCount1 - distinctCount2) > 2) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Attempt modification logic
    for (char c : word1) {
        for (char d : word2) {
            set1.erase(c);
            set1.insert(d);
            set2.erase(d);
            set2.insert(c);
            
            if (set1.size() == set2.size()) {
                return true;
            }
            
            // Revert the sets to original state
            set1.insert(c);
            set1.erase(d);
            set2.insert(d);
            set2.erase(c);
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// Test case
int main() {
    std::string word1 = "abc";
    std::string word2 = "xyz";
    bool result = canMakeDistinctCharsEqual(word1, word2);
    std::cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Set Construction**: \(O(n + m)\) where \(n\) is the length of `word1` and \(m\) is the length of `word2`.
- **Modification Simulation**: Since each character in `word1` can be exchanged with each character in `word2`, the nested loops involve \(O(n \times m)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), which may be sufficient given typical constraints in competitive programming scenarios.
