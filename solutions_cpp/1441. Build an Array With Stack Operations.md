[Leetcode 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1441)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `target` and an integer `n`, your goal is to build an array that matches the target array by performing specific stack operations. You can use the following operations:
1. "Push": Push an integer onto the stack.
2. "Pop": Remove the top integer from the stack.

You should return the stack operations that will result in the build of the target array `[target]`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range**: What is the range of possible integer values for `target` and `n`?
   - The target array consists of strictly increasing integers from 1 to n.
2. **Output Format**: How should the output be presented?
   - Output should be a vector of strings representing the operations.

### Strategy
1. **Iterator over Integers from 1 to n**:
   - Maintain a stack and an operations log.
   - Iterate through the integers from 1 to n.
   - For each integer, decide whether to "Push" it onto the stack or to discard it via "Pop" according to the `target` array:
     1. If the current integer matches the target's next required integer, "Push" it and move to the next integer in the `target` list.
     2. If it does not match, "Push" and then immediately "Pop" it to discard it.
2. **Stop Condition**: Stop the process when the stack matches the target array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

vector<string> buildArray(vector<int>& target, int n) {
    vector<string> operations;  // To store the operations.
    int currentVal = 1;         // To track the current value we are processing.
    int targetIdx = 0;          // To track position in the target array.

    // Iterate through numbers from 1 to n.
    while (currentVal <= n && targetIdx < target.size()) {
        if (currentVal == target[targetIdx]) {
            operations.push_back("Push");
            targetIdx++;
        } else {
            operations.push_back("Push");
            operations.push_back("Pop");
        }
        currentVal++;
    }

    return operations;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - An empty vector `operations` to store the sequence of operations.
   - Two integers, `currentVal` to iterate from 1 to `n` and `targetIdx` to track the current index in the `target` array.
2. **While Loop**:
   - Continue until either:
     1. All values from 1 to `n` are processed.
     2. All values in the target array are matched.
   - For each value:
     1. If it matches the current target value, perform a "Push" and move to the next target value.
     2. If it does not match, perform a "Push" followed by a "Pop" to discard it.
3. **Termination**:
   - The loop will terminate when one of the stop conditions is met and the constructed operations will be returned.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the size of the given integer `n`. The loop will iterate through each number from 1 to `n` at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(T)`, where `T` is the size of the `target` array, since the largest possible operations array would be twice the length of `target` in the worst case.
