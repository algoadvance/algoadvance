[Leetcode 2396. Strictly Palindromic Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2396)
Sure, let's tackle the LeetCode problem number 2396 titled "Strictly Palindromic Number". Here's a structured approach to solving this problem:

### Problem Statement

A strictly palindromic number is a number `n` that remains a palindrome when represented in every base `b` from `2` to `n-2`. Given a number `n`, determine if it is strictly palindromic.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a palindrome?**
   - A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

2. **What does it mean for a number to be strictly palindromic?**
   - A number `n` is strictly palindromic if it is a palindrome in every base from `2` to `n-2`.

3. **What are the constraints on the number `n`?**
   - The typical constraints are that `n` is a positive integer where `n >= 4`.

### Code

Let's provide the C++ code that solves this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

// Helper function to convert number to a given base
std::string toBase(int num, int base) {
    std::string result = "";
    while (num > 0) {
        result += std::to_string(num % base);
        num /= base;
    }
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}

// Helper function to check if a string is a palindrome
bool isPalindrome(const std::string& str) {
    int left = 0, right = str.length() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (str[left] != str[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Main function to check if a number is strictly palindromic
bool isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
    // Check each base from 2 to n-2
    for (int base = 2; base <= n - 2; base++) {
        std::string baseRepresentation = toBase(n, base);
        if (!isPalindrome(baseRepresentation)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    int n;
    std::cout << "Input n: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    if (isStrictlyPalindromic(n)) {
        std::cout << n << " is strictly palindromic." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << n << " is not strictly palindromic." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Conversion to Base**: Convert the number `n` to its representation in bases from `2` to `n-2`.
2. **Palindrome Check**: Check if the base representation is a palindrome.
3. **Loop Through Bases**: Loop through each base from `2` to `n-2` and apply the above two steps.
4. **Return Result**: If the number is a palindrome in all bases, it is strictly palindromic; otherwise, it is not.

### Time Complexity

1. **Conversion to Base**: The conversion of a number to a base `b` takes logarithmic time, `O(log_b(n))`.
2. **Palindrome Check**: Checking if a string is a palindrome takes linear time, `O(k)`, where `k` is the length of the string.

Since we are looping from `2` to `n-2`:

- The overall complexity per base is `O(log_b(n) + k)` which simplifies to approximately `O(log_b(n))` for small values of `k`.
- Therefore, the total complexity becomes `O((n-3) * log(n-2))`, which can be approximated as `O(n log n)` in the worst case.

This solution should be efficient for typical constraints given in competitive programming problems.
