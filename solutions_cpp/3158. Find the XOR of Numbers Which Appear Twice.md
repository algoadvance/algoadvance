[Leetcode 3158. Find the XOR of Numbers Which Appear Twice](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3158)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` where every element appears exactly twice except for one element which appears once. Find the element that appears once.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What is the maximum size of the input array?
   - Assuming a reasonable constraint, let's say the size of `nums` can go up to `10^6`.

2. **Value Range:** What is the range of the integer values in the array?
   - Let's assume the integer values can range from `-10^6` to `10^6`.

3. **Output:** Is there any specific format for the output?
   - The output should simply be the integer that appears only once.

## Strategy

We can leverage the XOR bitwise operator to solve this problem efficiently:

1. **XOR Property:** `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. This means that if we XOR all the numbers together, the numbers that appear twice will cancel each other out, leaving us with the number that appears only once.
   
2. **Time Complexity:** Since we only need a single pass through the array to compute the XOR, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

3. **Space Complexity:** We do not need any extra space other than a few variables for the XOR computation, so the space complexity is O(1).

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int findUniqueNumber(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int uniqueNumber = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        uniqueNumber ^= num;
    }
    return uniqueNumber;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums;
    int n;
    
    std::cout << "Enter the number of elements: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    
    std::cout << "Enter the elements: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        nums.push_back(x);
    }
    
    int result = findUniqueNumber(nums);
    std::cout << "The element that appears once is: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Input Handling:** We read the number of elements `n` and then populate the `nums` array with `n` integers.
2. **XOR Calculation:** We initialize `uniqueNumber` to 0 and iterate through all elements in `nums`, applying the XOR operation to `uniqueNumber` and each element. After the loop, `uniqueNumber` will hold the element that appears only once.
3. **Output:** Finally, we print the element that appears once.

By following this approach, we can efficiently determine the unique element in the array using XOR properties.
