[Leetcode 1297. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1297)
## Problem Statement

Let's consider a substring of a string `s` as `s[l...r]`, where `0 <= l <= r < len(s)`. The function `maxFreq` should find the maximum number of occurrences of any substring within the following constraints:
- The length of the substring is between `minSize` and `maxSize` inclusive.
- The substring contains at most `maxLetters` distinct letters.

Function Signature:
```cpp
int maxFreq(string s, int maxLetters, int minSize, int maxSize);
```

Given a string `s` and the integers `maxLetters`, `minSize`, and `maxSize`, you need to find the maximum number of occurrences of any substring of `s` that satisfies these constraints.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider substrings of all lengths between `minSize` and `maxSize`, or should we prioritize any specific length?
2. Can `s` contain non-alphabetic characters?
3. Is the input string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?

## Strategy
1. **Focus on Fixed Substring Size:** Given the constraints and nature of the problem, we can narrow down our approach to checking substrings specifically of size `minSize`. Checking substrings of varying lengths would require significantly more computation.
2. **Use a Sliding Window Approach:** A sliding window technique will allow us to efficiently traverse through the string while keeping track of the count of distinct characters.
3. **Use a HashMap for Frequency Counting:** Utilize a hashmap to count and store occurrences of valid substrings (those with at most `maxLetters` distinct characters).

This strategy ensures that our approach is both time and space efficient given the constraints.

## Code
Here's an implementation of `maxFreq` based on the defined strategy:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int maxFreq(string s, int maxLetters, int minSize, int maxSize) {
    unordered_map<string, int> substringFrequency;
    int maxOccurences = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i <= s.size() - minSize; ++i) {
        string sub = s.substr(i, minSize);
        unordered_set<char> uniqueChars(sub.begin(), sub.end());

        if (uniqueChars.size() <= maxLetters) {
            substringFrequency[sub]++;
            maxOccurences = max(maxOccurences, substringFrequency[sub]);
        }
    }

    return maxOccurences;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sliding Window:** We iterate over the string with a window of size `minSize`, resulting in a complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Substring and Set Operations:** Extracting substrings and creating sets to count unique characters can take `O(minSize)`. However, since `minSize` is a constant with respect to input constraints, it doesn't affect the overall linear time complexity significantly.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * minSize)` -> Simplified to `O(n)` as `minSize` is treated as a constant.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing substring frequencies.

This solution ensures efficiency both in terms of time and space, making it suitable for the input constraints typically encountered in such problems.
