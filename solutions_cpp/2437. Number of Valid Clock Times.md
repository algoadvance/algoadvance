[Leetcode 2437. Number of Valid Clock Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2437)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `time` in the form "HH:MM", where some of the digits may be replaced by '?'. This string represents a time on a 24-hour clock (i.e., 00:00 to 23:59). Write a function to count the number of valid clock times possible by replacing each '?' with a digit (0-9).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of the String:** Are we guaranteed that the input string is always in the format "HH:MM"?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, the string is always in the correct format.
  
2. **Character Constraints:** Are the positions of the '?' fixed, and can they appear in any position?
   - **Assumption:** '?' can appear in any of the positions, including multiple ones.

3. **Valid Times:** Should we consider leading zeros in valid times (e.g., 00:00 to 09:59)?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, leading zeros are valid in a 24-hour time format.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we'll take the following approach:

1. **Identify Positions of '?':** For each position in the "HH:MM" format, determine the valid digits that can replace '?'.
2. **Count Valid Combinations:** Multiply the number of valid choices for each position to get the total valid times.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown for each position in the string "HH:MM":

- For `HH`, the valid hour ranges are from `00` to `23`.
  - The first digit (`H1`):
    - If it is `?`, it can be `0`, `1`, or `2` depending on the second digit.
  - The second digit (`H2`):
    - If the first digit is `0` or `1`, it can be `0` to `9`.
    - If the first digit is `2`, it can be `0` to `3`.
- For `MM`, the valid minute ranges are from `00` to `59`.
  - The first digit (`M1`):
    - If it is `?`, it can be `0` to `5`.
  - The second digit (`M2`):
    - If it is `?`, it can be `0` to `9`.

### Code

Let's implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int countTime(string time) {
    int count = 1;
    
    if (time[0] == '?') {
        if (time[1] == '?' || time[1] < '4') {
            count *= 3; // '0', '1', '2'
        } else {
            count *= 2; // '0', '1'
        }
    }
    
    if (time[1] == '?') {
        if (time[0] == '2') {
            count *= 4; // '0', '1', '2', '3'
        } else if (time[0] == '?') {
            count *= 10; // '0'-'9'
        } else {
            count *= 10; // '0'-'9'
        }
    }
    
    if (time[3] == '?') {
        count *= 6; // '0'-'5'
    }
    
    if (time[4] == '?') {
        count *= 10; // '0'-'9'
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string time = "?4:5?";
    cout << countTime(time) << endl; // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` since it involves a constant number of operations regardless of the input size. The input size is always fixed at 5 characters.

### Explanation

This code examines each position in the given time string and determines how many valid digits can replace the '?' character:
- For `HH`, depending on the values of `time[0]` and `time[1]`, different ranges of numbers are valid.
- For `MM`, the ranges are more straightforward and depend on the range of valid minutes.

Multiplying the number of choices for each position gives the total count of valid times.
