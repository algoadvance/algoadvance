[Leetcode 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2108)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string `""`.

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input size?**
   - The array can have up to \(10^5\) strings and each string length can be up to 100 characters.
   
2. **What characters do the strings consist of?**
   - The strings only consist of lowercase English letters.

3. **Should the function handle empty strings in the input array?**
   - Yes, the function should handle empty strings, which are inherently palindromic.

4. **Is there any restriction on processing time?**
   - Standard limits apply, typically aiming for \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings and \(M\) is the average length of the strings.

## Strategy

1. **Check Each String for Palindrome:**
   - Iterate over each string in the array.
   - For each string, check if it is a palindrome:
     - Use two-pointer technique to check if the string reads the same forwards and backwards:
       - Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the string.
       - Move the start pointer forward and the end pointer backward, comparing the characters at each step.
       - If the characters at the two pointers are different, the string is not a palindrome.
       - If the pointers cross each other without finding different characters, the string is a palindrome.
       
2. **Return the first palindromic string found:**
   - Once a palindromic string is found, return it immediately.
   - If no palindromic string is found by the end of the array, return an empty string `""`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string firstPalindrome(std::vector<std::string>& words) {
        for (const auto& word : words) {
            if (isPalindrome(word)) {
                return word;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }
    
private:
    bool isPalindrome(const std::string& s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            ++left;
            --right;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Checking if a string is a palindrome takes \(O(M)\), where \(M\) is the length of the string.
  - In the worst case, all strings are checked, leading to a time complexity of \(O(N \times M)\), where \(N\) is the number of strings and \(M\) is the average length of the strings.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the `isPalindrome` function, as it uses a fixed amount of additional space.
  - The overall space complexity is therefore also \(O(1)\) beyond the input storage.
