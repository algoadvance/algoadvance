[Leetcode 860. Lemonade Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l860)
### Problem Statement

The problem is taken from LeetCode and is as follows:

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and they order one at a time (in the order specified by the given integer array `bills` where `bills[i]` is the bill the `i-th` customer pays). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer based only on the bills you have previously received.

Return `true` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure the problem is fully understood, let's clarify potential questions:

1. **Can the initial amount of money be assumed to be zero?**
   - Yes, you start with no money.

2. **Is the input `bills` array guaranteed to only contain valid bill denominations (i.e., $5, $10, $20)?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, `bills` only contains these denominations.

3. **Should we handle cases where no bills are passed (empty array)?**
   - Yes, if no bills are passed, we should return true as no transaction means no need to change.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Maintain a count for $5 and $10 bills since $20 bills don't need to be tracked individually for giving change (as they can't contribute to giving any meaningful change).

2. Iterate through the list of bills received:
   - If a customer gives a $5 bill, simply increase the count of $5 bills.
   - If a customer gives a $10 bill, decrease the count of $5 bills by one (for change) and increase the count of $10 bills. If you don't have a $5 bill to give as change, return `false`.
   - If a customer gives a $20 bill, try to give one $10 bill and one $5 bill as change, if possible. If not, then try to give three $5 bills. If neither is possible, return `false`.

3. If you can handle all customers correctly, return `true`.

### Code

Here's the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

bool lemonadeChange(std::vector<int>& bills) {
    int count5 = 0, count10 = 0;
    
    for (int bill : bills) {
        if (bill == 5) {
            count5++;
        } else if (bill == 10) {
            if (count5 <= 0) return false;
            count5--;
            count10++;
        } else {  // bill == 20
            if (count10 > 0 && count5 > 0) {
                count10--;
                count5--;
            } else if (count5 >= 3) {
                count5 -= 3;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```
### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `bills` array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the counts of $5 and $10 bills.
