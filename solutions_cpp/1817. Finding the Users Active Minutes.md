[Leetcode 1817. Finding the Users Active Minutes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1817)
## Problem Statement

You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and you need to analyze the user activity. Each log entry is represented as a pair of integers, `logs[i] = [IDi, timei]`, where `IDi` is the user ID and `timei` is the time when the action occurred. Multiple users can log in at the same time, and the same user can log in multiple times at different timestamps or the same timestamp.

You are to calculate the "Active Minutes" (UAM) for each user. Specifically, each user has a certain number of unique active minutes where they performed some actions. You need to determine how many users have exactly `k` unique active minutes for `k` ranging from 1 to `k`.

Return an array `result` where `result[k-1]` is the number of users with exactly `k` unique active minutes.

### Example:
**Input:**
```plaintext
logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]]
k = 5
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[0,2,0,0,0]
```

**Explanation:**
- User 0 has (5, 2) unique minutes. 
- User 1 has (2, 3) unique minutes.
- There are 2 users with 2 unique active minutes.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum number of logs?**
   - The problem constraints might indicate this, but we will handle it in a general way unless otherwise specified.

2. **Can a user have multiple logins at the same time?**
   - Yes, but only unique minutes count toward their UAM.

3. **What should our array represent if `k` is larger than any user's possible UAM?**
   - We should ensure that our array is of size `k`, initialized with zeros.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

std::vector<int> findingUsersActiveMinutes(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& logs, int k) {
    // Dictionary to store user id and the set of unique minutes
    std::unordered_map<int, std::unordered_set<int>> userMinuteMap;
    
    // Fill the dictionary with user activities
    for (const auto& log : logs) {
        int userId = log[0];
        int time = log[1];
        userMinuteMap[userId].insert(time);
    }

    // Array to count the number of users with X unique active minutes
    std::vector<int> result(k, 0);

    // Count the unique active minutes for each user
    for (const auto& userActivity : userMinuteMap) {
        int uam = userActivity.second.size();
        if (uam <= k) {
            result[uam - 1]++;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Input Processing:**
   - Use a map (`unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>>`) to store each user's ID and their set of unique active minutes.

2. **Calculating Unique Active Minutes:**
   - For each log entry, add the time to the set corresponding to the user ID. This will automatically handle duplicate times for the same user ID.

3. **Count Users by UAM:**
   - Use a vector of size `k` to count how many users have exactly `u` unique active minutes. We populate this by iterating over the map.

4. **Result Population:**
   - Populate the result vector by counting users with each possible number of unique active minutes and adjusting their positions in the result vector.

## Time Complexity

- **Insertion Time for Logs:** Each insertion into the set takes O(1) on average. Thus, processing all logs is O(n) where n is the number of logs.
- **Counting Unique Minutes:** We iterate over the map which has at most the number of unique users, say `u`. This takes O(u).
- **Total Complexity:** O(n + u), but since u <= n, it essentially reduces to O(n) for the overall process.
