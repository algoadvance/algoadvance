[Leetcode 12. Integer to Roman](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l12)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Integer**:
   - What is the range of the integer? 
   - **Response**: The integer is between 1 and 3999 inclusive as traditionally accepted Roman numerals cover this range.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - Is the output expected to be in uppercase Roman numerals?
   - **Response**: Yes, the traditional Roman numerals are typically represented in uppercase.

### Strategy

To convert an integer to a Roman numeral, we should understand the Roman numeral system. Here are the basic symbols:

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Special cases are when a smaller numeral appears before a larger numeral to indicate subtraction:
- IV (4), IX (9)
- XL (40), XC (90)
- CD (400), CM (900)

We can use a list of these values in descending order to form a greedy algorithm that repeatedly subtracts the largest possible value and appends the corresponding numeral to the result.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation for converting an integer to a Roman numeral:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string intToRoman(int num) {
    // Define mappings of Roman symbols to their corresponding values
    std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> valueSymbols = {
        {1000, "M"}, {900, "CM"}, {500, "D"}, {400, "CD"},
        {100, "C"}, {90, "XC"}, {50, "L"}, {40, "XL"},
        {10, "X"}, {9, "IX"}, {5, "V"}, {4, "IV"}, {1, "I"}
    };
    
    std::string result = "";
    
    // Iterate over the value-symbol pairs
    for (const auto &pair : valueSymbols) {
        // While we can subtract the current value from num, append the symbol
        while (num >= pair.first) {
            num -= pair.first;
            result += pair.second;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int num = 1994;
    std::string roman = intToRoman(num);
    std::cout << "The Roman numeral for " << num << " is " << roman << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\). This is because:
1. The number of operations is bounded by the number of Roman value-symbol pairs (which is always constant, specifically 13 pairs).
2. The algorithm walks through the list of value-symbol pairs and subtracts these values from the input number.

Therefore, our algorithm runs in constant time with respect to the size of the input integer.
