[Leetcode 2425. Bitwise XOR of All Pairings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2425)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, consisting of non-negative integers. There exists another array, `nums3`, which contains the bitwise XOR of all pairings of the integers in `nums1` and `nums2` (every integer in `nums1` is paired with every integer in `nums2` exactly once).

Return the bitwise XOR of all integers in `nums3`.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [2,1], nums2 = [3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The array nums3 contains the following values:
- nums3[0] = 2 XOR 3 = 1
- nums3[1] = 2 XOR 1 = 3
- nums3[2] = 1 XOR 3 = 2
- nums3[3] = 1 XOR 1 = 0
Thus, the answer is 1 XOR 3 XOR 2 XOR 0 = 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validation**: Should the inputs be validated for the non-negative integer constraint?
2. **Array Size Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the problem handle empty arrays?

Based on these potential clarifications, let's proceed to solve the problem.

### Strategy

Calculating the `nums3` array directly and then XORing all its elements would be computationally expensive and inefficient because the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` could be large. 

Instead, we can observe the following:

1. When `nums1` and `nums2` both contain repeated values, many of these XOR operations will either cancel themselves out because XORing a number with itself yields 0.
2. The final result will be influenced by how frequently each element appears in the resultant pairs.

From the properties of XOR:
- \( a \oplus a = 0 \)
- \( a \oplus 0 = a \)

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int xorAllPairs(const vector<int>& nums1, const vector<int>& nums2) {
    int xorResult = 0;
    
    // If nums2 has an odd length, each element in nums1 will appear that many times in the final result
    if (nums2.size() % 2 == 1) {
        for (int n : nums1) {
            xorResult ^= n;
        }
    }
    
    // Similarly, if nums1 has an odd length, each element in nums2 will appear that many times in the final result
    if (nums1.size() % 2 == 1) {
        for (int n : nums2) {
            xorResult ^= n;
        }
    }
    
    return xorResult;
}

/* Helper function to run the example cases */
void runExample() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {2, 1};
    vector<int> nums2 = {3, 1};
    cout << "Output: " << xorAllPairs(nums1, nums2) << endl; // Output: 2
}

int main() {
    runExample();
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where 'n' is the length of `nums1` and 'm' is the length of `nums2` because we traverse each array linearly at most once.
2. **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution ensures efficiency both in terms of time and space by leveraging the properties of XOR.
