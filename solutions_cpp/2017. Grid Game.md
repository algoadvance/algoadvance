[Leetcode 2017. Grid Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2017)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2 x n grid of positive integers, you need to choose a path from the leftmost column to the rightmost column which minimizes the maximum sum of integers on the top and bottom rows. Specifically, the worker starts at (0, 0) and robot starts at (1, 0). The worker can only move right or right-up, and the robot can only move right or right-down. They both move alternatively column by column, one after another. Return the minimum possible maximum sum of the integers on the path of the worker and the robot.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the worker and robot allowed to move simultaneously?
   - No, they move alternatively. From (0,0) to the first column is the worker, then from (1,0) to the second column is the robot, and so on.

2. Is there any restriction in the grid beyond the constraints?
   - No, the grid is just 2 x n and they move as explained.

3. Do they end at the specific last column, or can they end before?
   - They must traverse from the leftmost to the rightmost column.

4. Are there any constraints on the integers in the grid?
    - The integers are positive.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We can use Dynamic Programming to keep track of the minimum possible maximum sum for both the worker and the robot as they progress column by column.

2. **Calculate Prefix Sums**:
   - We'll use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of integers in the paths.

3. **Transition Between States**:
   - Given that each player moves column by column, we can maintain a table to keep track of their paths and sums at each step.
  
4. **Result Calculation**:
   - At each column, we calculate the sums for both paths and determine the potential minimum possible maximum sum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int gridGame(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<long long> prefixSumTop(n + 1, 0), prefixSumBottom(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Calculate prefix sums
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSumTop[i + 1] = prefixSumTop[i] + grid[0][i];
            prefixSumBottom[i + 1] = prefixSumBottom[i] + grid[1][i];
        }
        
        // Initialize result to a large value
        long long result = LLONG_MAX;
        
        // Evaluate the maximum sum for both the worker and the robot
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            long long topRemaining = prefixSumTop[n] - prefixSumTop[i + 1];
            long long bottomRemaining = prefixSumBottom[i];
            long long maxSum = max(topRemaining, bottomRemaining);
            result = min(result, maxSum);
        }
        
        return static_cast<int>(result);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Calculating the prefix sums takes O(n) time.
  - Evaluating the possible paths and maximum sums at each column takes O(n) time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use additional space for the prefix sum arrays, which are of size `n + 1`.

This solution efficiently computes the desired result using Dynamic Programming combined with prefix sum arrays and ensures the constraints are adhered to.
