[Leetcode 3163. String Compression III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3163)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the task is to compress the string such that any sequence of the same character is reduced to the character followed by the number of characters in the sequence. After that, remove up to `k` characters from the string such that the length of the compressed string is minimized. Return the minimized length of the compressed string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the string `s` contain any characters, or is it limited to lowercase letters?
2. Is the order of characters in the compressed string significant (i.e., should it preserve the original order of characters)?
3. Can we assume the input values for `s` and `k` are within normal constraints for a coding interview problem, i.e., not exceedingly large?

### Strategy
The problem can be approached using dynamic programming to explore the different ways of removing `k` characters to achieve the optimal compression.

#### Steps:
1. **Define the dynamic programming state**: 
    - let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum length of the compressed string using the first `i` characters with `j` deletions.
  
2. **Transitions**:
    - If we do not delete the ith character, the number of repetitions of the last continuous block of characters might change its encoded length.
    - If we delete the ith character, we need to consider the previous state `dp[i-1][j-1]`.

3. **Base Case**:
    - `dp[0][0]` is `0` since no characters would result in a zero-length string.
    - If we are to remove more characters than the string length, it should result in 0 because deleting all covers all needs.

4. **Compression length formula**:
    - For a sequence of length `len` being compressed, the effective contribution to the compressed string depends on whether `len` is `1`, between `10`, or more than `99`, `100`, etc.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int getLengthOfOptimalCompression(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX / 2));
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
                // Option 1: delete current character
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                
                // Option 2: keep current character
                int same = 0, different = 0;
                for (int l = i; l >= 1; --l) {
                    if (s[l - 1] == s[i - 1]) {
                        same++;
                    } else {
                        different++;
                    }
                    
                    if (j >= different) {
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[l - 1][j - different] + compressLength(same));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][k];
    }
    
private:
    int compressLength(int count) {
        if (count == 1) {
            return 1;
        } else if (count < 10) {
            return 2;
        } else if (count < 100) {
            return 3;
        } else {
            return 4;
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n * n * k), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the number of deletions allowed. This is because for every character and for every number of deletions, we potentially look back through all previous characters to calculate the optimal transitions.

The space complexity is O(n * k) due to the dynamic programming table.
