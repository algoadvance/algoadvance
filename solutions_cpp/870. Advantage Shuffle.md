[Leetcode 870. Advantage Shuffle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l870)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` both of the same length. The advantage of `nums1` with respect to `nums2` is the number of indices `i` for which `nums1[i] > nums2[i]`.

Return **any** permutation of `nums1` that maximizes its advantage with respect to `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in `nums1` and `nums2` unique?**
   - The problem statement does not specify whether the elements are unique, so we have to assume that there can be duplicates.
   
2. **Is there a certain range for the integer values within the arrays?**
   - The range is not specified, so let's consider the generic integer range in C++.

### Strategy

The problem can be efficiently solved using a greedy approach with sorting:

1. **Sort `nums1`** in non-decreasing order.
2. **Sort `nums2`** maintaining the original indices.
3. Use a two-pointer technique to determine which elements in `nums1` can give an advantage over elements in `nums2`.
4. Traverse through the sorted `nums2`, and for each element, try to find the smallest element in `nums1` that is greater.
5. Use two additional pointers or lists to keep track of the elements in `nums1` that can be used and the ones that cannot provide an advantage.
6. Construct the result array by combining elements that provide an advantage and the remaining elements.

### Code

Here's the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

vector<int> advantageCount(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    
    // Sort nums1
    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    
    // Create a pair of (value, index) for nums2
    vector<pair<int, int>> sorted_nums2(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sorted_nums2[i] = {nums2[i], i};
    }
    
    // Sort nums2 based on the value
    sort(sorted_nums2.begin(), sorted_nums2.end());
    
    // Result array
    vector<int> result(n);
    // Two pointers for nums1
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    
    // Try to maximize advantage
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums1[left] > sorted_nums2[i].first) {
            result[sorted_nums2[i].second] = nums1[left++];
        } else {
            result[sorted_nums2[i].second] = nums1[right--];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting `nums1`:** \(O(n \log n)\)
2. **Creating the pair and sorting `nums2`:** \(O(n \log n)\)
3. **Traversing through `nums2` with two pointers:** \(O(n)\)

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting steps:
\[ O(n \log n) + O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n) \]

This is efficient for the given problem constraints and provides an optimal solution.
