[Leetcode 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1727)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary matrix `matrix`, you can rearrange the columns of each row independently. Return the area of the largest submatrix that you can obtain within the given matrix after rearranging the columns optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the matrix contain any other values apart from `0` and `1`?
   - No, the matrix only contains binary values `0` and `1`.

2. What are the matrix dimensions constraints?
   - The matrix dimensions are constrained; typically but not necessarily up to 300x300, which should be manageable by our approach.

3. Are negative values or empty matrices possible?
   - No, since the matrix is binary and consists strictly of `0`s and `1`s, and the matrix provided will not be empty.

### Strategy

1. **Transform the matrix:** Convert the matrix such that each element represents the number of consecutive `1`s up to that row from the top. Let's call this the `height` matrix.

2. **Sort rows for submatrix optimization:** For each row in the `height` matrix, sort the row in non-ascending order. This sorting helps in maximizing the possible rectangle areas you can form using that row as the base.

3. **Calculate the maximum area:** Calculate the maximum possible rectangle area for each row where the width is from 1 to the number of columns.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int largestSubmatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return 0;
        
        int rows = matrix.size();
        int cols = matrix[0].size();
        
        // Compute heights for each column
        for (int i = 1; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    matrix[i][j] += matrix[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        // Find maximum area for the resulting heights
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            // Sort heights in non-ascending order
            sort(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end(), greater<int>());
            
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) break; // No point in looking after a zero
                int height = matrix[i][j];
                int width = j + 1;
                int currentArea = height * width;
                maxArea = max(maxArea, currentArea);
            }
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution s;
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {0, 0, 1},
        {1, 1, 1},
        {1, 0, 1}
    };
    cout << s.largestSubmatrix(matrix) << endl; // Output: 4.
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Transforming to height matrix:** This operation runs in \(O(R \times C)\) where \(R\) is the number of rows and \(C\) is the number of columns.
- **Sorting each row:** The sorting operation per row takes \(O(C \log C)\) and needs to be done for each row, resulting in a total of \(O(R \times C \log C)\) for sorting.
- **Calculating maximum area:** This is again \(O(R \times C)\), iterating through each element to check the area.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(R \times C \log C)\).

This solution leverages sorting to ensure the largest areas possible are calculated efficiently, keeping it optimal for given constraints.
