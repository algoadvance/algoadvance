[Leetcode 1103. Distribute Candies to People](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1103)
### Problem Statement

You are given `candies` number of candies that you need to distribute to `num_people` people. The task is to distribute the candies in the following way:

- You start by giving 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until you give `i` candies to the `i-th` person.
- After you have given to the `num_people`-th person, you start again from the first person and continue giving candies.

You need to return an array that represents the number of candies each person gets.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What happens if we run out of candies before completely fulfilling a person's right to candies?**
   - If there are fewer candies remaining than required for the next distribution, give all remaining candies to that person.

2. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - Return an array containing the number of candies each person receives.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `result` of length equal to `num_people`, initialized to 0.
   - Declare a variable `current_candy` to keep track of the number of candies to distribute on each turn.

2. **Distribution Loop:**
   - Use a loop to distribute candies until all candies are exhausted.
   - For each iteration, update the corresponding person's count.
   - If the remaining candies are fewer than `current_candy`, distribute all remaining candies and exit.

3. **Index Management:**
   - Use a modulo operation to cycle through the people array continuously.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

vector<int> distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
    vector<int> result(num_people, 0);  // Initialize result array with 0s
    int current_candy = 1;  // Start with 1 candy to distribute
    int index = 0;  // Start with the first person

    while (candies > 0) {
        if (candies < current_candy) {
            result[index] += candies;  // If the remaining candies are less than current_candy
            break;  // Exhaust all candies
        } else {
            result[index] += current_candy;
        }
        
        candies -= current_candy;  // Decrease the remaining candies
        current_candy++;  // Increment the candies to distribute next time
        index = (index + 1) % num_people;  // Move to the next person cyclically
    }

    return result;
}

// Driver function for testing purposes
int main() {
    int candies = 7;
    int num_people = 4;
    vector<int> result = distributeCandies(candies, num_people);
    
    for (int candy : result) {
        cout << candy << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The loop runs as long as there are candies left, and `current_candy` increases by 1 each iteration. The sum of the first `n` integers is \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\). Therefore, the number of iterations is approximately \(\sqrt{2 \times \text{candies}}\). Thus, the time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{\text{candies}})\).

### Space Complexity
- We only use an extra array of size `num_people`, so the space complexity is \(O(\text{num_people})\).

This code provides an efficient and clear approach to solving the problem by iteratively distributing candies in the specified manner.
