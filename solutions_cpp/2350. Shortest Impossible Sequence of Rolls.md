[Leetcode 2350. Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2350)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `n` and an integer k. You roll a k-sided dice and get the results in the array `rolls`.

Return the length of the **shortest** sequence of rolls that **cannot** be achieved with the given `rolls`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the values in `rolls`?**
   - Values in `rolls` are between `1` and `k`, inclusive.
2. **What is `k`?**
   - `k` is the number of sides on the dice.
3. **What values does `n` take?**
   - `n` is the length of the array `rolls`.
4. **Is `rolls` guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, `n` â‰¥ 1.

### Strategy
We need to find the length of the shortest sequence that cannot be achieved using the given rolls. To do this, we can use a set to track unique outcomes we've seen. Each time we see all possible outcomes (i.e., every integer from 1 to k) within a segment of rolls, we reset our set and start counting a new segment. The number of times we reset our set plus one will give us the length of the sequence we cannot form.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int shortestImpossibleSequence(std::vector<int>& rolls, int k) {
    std::unordered_set<int> seen;
    int fails = 0;

    for (int roll : rolls) {
        seen.insert(roll);
        if (seen.size() == k) {
            fails++;
            seen.clear();
        }
    }
    
    return fails + 1;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `rolls` array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), since the unordered set `seen` storing unique rolls can contain at most `k` elements.

This approach ensures we efficiently track segments of `rolls` and detect transitions where all possible outcomes occur, then we count these transitions to determine the shortest impossible sequence length.
