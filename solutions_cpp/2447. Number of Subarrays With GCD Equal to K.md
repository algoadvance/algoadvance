[Leetcode 2447. Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2447)
### Problem Statement
We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of subarrays whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of `nums`?**
   The array `nums` can have length from `1` to `10^4`.

2. **What about the values in `nums`?**
   Each element in the array `nums` is in the range from `1` to `10^4`.

3. **What if no subarray has a GCD equal to `k`?**
   In such a case, the result should be `0`.

4. **Are all elements in `nums` guaranteed to be positive?**
   Yes, all elements are positive integers.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, the strategy can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Iterate over all possible subarrays.
2. Compute the GCD of each subarray.
3. Check if the GCD is equal to `k`.
4. Count the number of subarrays that meet the criterion.

Given that the number of subarrays in an array of size `n` is `O(n^2)`, and computing the GCD of subarray elements can be done in `O(log(min(a, b)))` using the Euclidean algorithm, the worst-case time complexity could be relatively high if not controlled. However, considering constraints, the solution should be feasible.

### Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::gcd

int subarrayGCD(const std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int gcd = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            gcd = std::gcd(gcd, nums[j]);
            if (gcd == k) {
                ++count;
            }
            // If the GCD drops below k, further elements cannot help, break early
            if (gcd < k) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 6, 9, 12}; // Example input
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << "Number of subarrays with GCD " << k << ": " << subarrayGCD(nums, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Outer Loop (i):** This loop iterates over all starting points of subarrays.
2. **Inner Loop (j):** This nested loop iterates over all possible ending points of subarrays starting at `i`.
3. **GCD Calculation:** `std::gcd` is used to compute the GCD of the current subarray.
4. **Count Increment:** If the GCD of the current subarray equals `k`, we increment the count.
5. **Early Termination:** If at any point, the GCD becomes less than `k`, further extending that subarray will not help in achieving a GCD of `k`, so we break early.

### Time Complexity
- The code has a time complexity of `O(n^2 * log(max(nums)))`, where `n` is the size of the input array and `log(max(nums))` comes from the GCD calculation. This is manageable within the given constraints.

Implementing further optimizations if required can be done, but this approach should work efficiently for most practical cases given the constraints.
