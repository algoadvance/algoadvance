[Leetcode 3071. Minimum Operations to Write the Letter Y on a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3071)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of size `n x m` initialized with zeros. You are tasked with writing the letter 'Y' on this grid using a minimum number of operations. An operation consists of choosing a cell and toggling between 0 and 1 (i.e., changing 0 to 1 or 1 to 0). The letter 'Y' is represented as follows in a 3x3 grid:

```
1 0 1
  1
  1
```

Given `n` rows and `m` columns, determine the minimum number of operations needed to write the letter 'Y' on the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Fixed Pattern:** Is the pattern for the letter 'Y' fixed, or can it take any size/form?
    - Assume the pattern is fixed as shown in the problem statement.
2. **Grid Dimensions:** What are the constraints for the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`?
    - Typically, `1 <= n, m <= 1000`.

3. **Irregular Grid Sizes:** How should we handle cases where `n < 3` or `m < 3`?
    - It's impossible to form a 'Y' in such cases, so operations should be minimal or return a special value (like `-1`).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use the following approach:

1. **Identify Valid Positions**: Identify all possible positions for the top of the 'Y' in the grid.
2. **Calculate Toggle Costs**: For each position, calculate the number of operations required to transform the relevant subgrid into the pattern of 'Y'.
3. **Choose Minimum Cost**: Out of all possible valid positions, choose the one with the minimum toggle cost.

### Code

Here's the code implementation for this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minOperationsToWriteY(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int n, int m) {
    if (n < 3 || m < 3) return -1;

    vector<vector<int>> dy = \{\{1, 0, 1},
                              {0, 1, 0},
                              {0, 1, 0}};
    int minOperations = INT_MAX;

    for (int i = 0; i <= n - 3; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= m - 3; ++j) {
            int operations = 0;
            for (int x = 0; x < 3; ++x) {
                for (int y = 0; y < 3; ++y) {
                    if (grid[i + x][j + y] != dy[x][y]) {
                        operations++;
                    }
                }
            }
            minOperations = min(minOperations, operations);
        }
    }

    return minOperations;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<vector<int>> grid(n, vector<int>(m));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            cin >> grid[i][j];
        }
    }

    int result = minOperationsToWriteY(grid, n, m);
    cout << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loops:** The nested loops run `(n - 2) * (m - 2)` times.
- **Inner Cost Calculation:** For each of those iterations, we have a fixed number of 9 operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the grid. This complexity is efficient given the constraints `1 <= n, m <= 1000`.
