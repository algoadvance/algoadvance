[Leetcode 347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l347)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of integers, you need to return the `k` most frequent elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Note:**
- You may assume `k` is always valid, `1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements`.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
    - No, the problem states that the array will be non-empty.

2. **Can there be negative numbers in the array?**
    - Yes, the problem does not restrict the type of integers, so negative numbers are allowed.

3. **Should the result be in any specific order?**
    - The order of elements in the result does not matter.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Mapping:** 
    - First, count the frequency of each element using a hash map (`unordered_map`).

2. **Bucket Sort:**
    - Since we want to find the most frequent elements, we can use a bucket sort. Create an array of buckets where the index represents the frequency and each bucket contains the list of numbers with that frequency.

3. **Collect Results:**
    - Start from the highest possible frequency and collect elements until we've gathered `k` elements.

This approach guarantees that we can handle the required time complexity better than `O(n log n)`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
        unordered_map<int, int> frequencyMap;
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap[num]++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Create buckets where index represents frequency
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> buckets(n + 1);
        for (auto& pair : frequencyMap) {
            int frequency = pair.second;
            int number = pair.first;
            buckets[frequency].push_back(number);
        }

        // Step 3: Collect the top k frequent elements
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = n; i >= 0 && result.size() < k; --i) {
            if (!buckets[i].empty()) {
                for (int num : buckets[i]) {
                    result.push_back(num);
                    if (result.size() == k) {
                        return result;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Map Construction:** 
    - This takes `O(n)` time to count the frequency of each element.

2. **Bucket Sort:**
    - Creating and populating the buckets takes `O(n)` time.

3. **Collect Results:** 
    - Collecting top `k` elements takes `O(n)` time in the worst case where all elements are unique and we might have to look in every bucket.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient given the constraints.
