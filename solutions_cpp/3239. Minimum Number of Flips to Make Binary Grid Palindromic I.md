[Leetcode 3239. Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3239)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` binary grid. A binary grid means that each element in the grid is either `0` or `1`. A binary grid is palindromic if the grid and its transpose are the same (i.e., for all `i, j`, it holds that `grid[i][j] == grid[j][i]`).

Your task is to determine the minimum number of elements you need to flip (convert `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`) to make the binary grid palindromic.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: What is the range of values for `m` and `n`?
2. **Input validation**: Can we assume that the input grid is always a valid binary grid with `m` rows and `n` columns?
3. **Edge cases**: How should the solution handle cases where the grid is already palindromic? Should it return `0` in that case?
4. **Transpose checks**: Should we only flip elements on the top-right half of the diagonal or anywhere in the grid?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that every element `grid[i][j]` matches its transpose counterpart `grid[j][i]` for all `i` and `j`.

1. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate over each element of the upper triangular part of the grid (above the main diagonal).
   - For each pair of elements `(i, j)` and `(j, i)`, check if they are the same.
   - If they are different, we need one flip to make them the same.
2. **Counting Flips**:
   - Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of flips required.
3. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all required elements, return the flip counter's value.

The algorithm primarily involves iterating through half of the grid, comparing pairs of elements, and updating a counter, which ensures an efficient solution.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int flips = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i != j && grid[i][j] != grid[j][i]) {
                    flips += 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return flips / 2;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     vector<vector<int>> grid = {{0, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 0}};
//     int result = sol.minFlips(grid);
//     cout << "Minimum flips required: " << result << endl; // Output will be the minimum flips needed
// }
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m \times n)\), where we iterate through each element in an `m x n` grid once.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a constant amount of extra space for counting the flips.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum number of flips required to make the binary grid palindromic, making it effective for typical competitive programming constraints.
