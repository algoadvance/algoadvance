[Leetcode 1254. Number of Closed Islands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1254)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land. An **island** is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `0`s and a **closed island** is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1`s.

**Return the number of closed islands.**

Example:
```
Input: grid = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],
  [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],
  [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]
]
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all cells of the grid guaranteed to be either 0 or 1?**
   - Yes, the grid contains only 0s and 1s.

2. **What should we return if there are no closed islands?**
   - Return `0` if there are no closed islands.

3. **What is the range of the grid dimensions?**
   - `1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100`.

### Strategy

1. **Traversal and Marking:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid. We need to mark visited `0`s to ensure they are not counted multiple times.
   
2. **Boundary Check:**
   - Any `0`s connected to the border of the grid are not part of a closed island. Hence, we can first mark all border-connected components.

3. **Counting Closed Islands:**
   - After marking border-connected water, traverse the grid again to count the number of closed islands using DFS.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Create a function that uses DFS to mark all connected `0`s.
   - First, use this function to mark all `0`s connected to the grid boundaries.
   - Then, traverse the grid and apply the function a second time to count and mark all closed islands.

The following is a concise and efficient C++ implementation:

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int closedIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        
        // Helper function to run DFS to mark visited '0's
        auto dfs = [&](int r, int c) {
            if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || grid[r][c] == 1) return;
            grid[r][c] = 1; // Mark the cell as visited by turning it into '1'
            dfs(r + 1, c);
            dfs(r - 1, c);
            dfs(r, c + 1);
            dfs(r, c - 1);
        };
        
        // Step 1: Mark the border-connected '0's
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            dfs(i, 0);
            dfs(i, cols - 1);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
            dfs(0, j);
            dfs(rows - 1, j);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Count the closed islands
        int closedIslands = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    ++closedIslands;
                    dfs(i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return closedIslands;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because:
- We potentially visit every cell once during the marking of border-connected `0`s.
- We visit each cell again during the closed island counting phase.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(m * n)` in the worst case due to the recursive depth of the DFS calls (stack space). However, this is typically less problematic for grids sizes up to the given constraints.
