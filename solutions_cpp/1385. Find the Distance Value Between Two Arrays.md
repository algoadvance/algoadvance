[Leetcode 1385. Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1385)
### Problem Statement:
Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, and an integer `d`, you need to find the distance value between the two arrays. The distance value is defined as the number of elements `arr1[i]` such that there is no element `arr2[j]` for which `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the arrays contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, both arrays can contain duplicate elements.
2. **What is the range of the array elements?**
   - The array elements can be within the range of `-10^4` to `10^4`.
3. **Is there a limit on the size of the arrays?**
   - Yes, each array can have up to `500` elements.

### Strategy:
1. Initialize a counter to zero to keep track of the distance value.
2. For each element in `arr1`, check if there is any element in `arr2` such that the absolute difference `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]|` is less than or equal to `d`.
3. If no such element exists for a given `arr1[i]`, increment the counter.
4. Return the counter after examining all elements in `arr1`.

### Time Complexity:
- The naive approach would involve a nested loop where for each element in `arr1`, we check all elements in `arr2`. This would result in a time complexity of `O(n * m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
- However, we can improve this with sorting and binary search (or two-pointer technique).

### Code:
Here is the optimized approach using sorting and binary search in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int findTheDistanceValue(std::vector<int>& arr1, std::vector<int>& arr2, int d) {
    std::sort(arr2.begin(), arr2.end());
    int distanceValue = 0;

    for (int num : arr1) {
        // Binary search to find the position in arr2 where this element could be
        auto lower_bound_pos = std::lower_bound(arr2.begin(), arr2.end(), num - d);
        auto upper_bound_pos = std::upper_bound(arr2.begin(), arr2.end(), num + d);

        // If there is no element in the valid range, increment the count
        if (lower_bound_pos == upper_bound_pos) {
            distanceValue++;
        }
    }
    return distanceValue;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr1 = {4, 5, 8};
    std::vector<int> arr2 = {10, 9, 1, 8};
    int d = 2;
    std::cout << "Distance Value: " << findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: First, we sort `arr2` to enable binary search.
2. **Binary Search**: For each element in `arr1`, we use `std::lower_bound` and `std::upper_bound` to find the range in `arr2` where elements fall within `[num - d, num + d]`.
3. **Count and Increment**: If the positions found by `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` are the same, it means there is no element in `arr2` within the distance `d` from the current element in `arr1`. Hence, we increment the `distanceValue`.
4. **Output**: Finally, we return and print the distance value.

This approach ensures that we perform the distance check efficiently by leveraging sorting and binary search, yielding a time complexity of \(O(n \log m)\).
