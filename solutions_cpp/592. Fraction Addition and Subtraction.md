[Leetcode 592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l592)
### Problem Statement

Given a string representing an expression of fractions, you need to add and subtract the fractions and return the result in its simplest form. 

The input string will contain fractions separated by a '+' or '-'. Each fraction will be in the form `a/b`, where `a` and `b` are integers. The output should also be a fraction in its simplest form.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:** Is it safe to assume that the input string will always be a valid expression with numbers only?
   - Yes, you can assume the input will always be a valid expression of fractions.
   
2. **Negative Numbers:** Can the numerator and/or the denominator be negative, or will we only have negative signs indicating subtraction?
   - Both numerators and denominators can be negative, but generally negative signs will be indicative of subtraction between fractions.

### Strategy

1. **Parsing:** Parse the string to identify all fractions and their signs.
2. **Common Denominator:** Convert all fractions to have a common denominator to facilitate addition and subtraction.
3. **Numerator Sum:** Sum up the numerators after they have a common denominator.
4. **Simplify Result:** Reduce the resulting fraction to its simplest form using the greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Code

Here's the C++ function to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string fractionAddition(std::string expression) {
        std::vector<int> numerators, denominators;
        std::istringstream iss(expression);
        char dummy;
        int num, denom, first_num, first_denom;
        
        // Parsing the expression and generating numerators and denominators
        while (iss >> num >> dummy >> denom) {
            numerators.push_back(num);
            denominators.push_back(denom);
            iss >> dummy;
        }
        
        // Find least common denominator (LCD)
        int lcm = denominators[0];
        for (int d : denominators) {
            lcm = lcm / std::gcd(lcm, d) * d;
        }
        
        // Adjust numerators to the common denominator
        int result_num = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < numerators.size(); ++i) {
            result_num += numerators[i] * (lcm / denominators[i]);
        }
        
        // Reduce the result fraction
        int g = std::gcd(abs(result_num), lcm);
        result_num /= g;
        lcm /= g;
        
        return std::to_string(result_num) + "/" + std::to_string(lcm);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Parsing:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string.
2. **Finding LCM:** O(k), where `k` is the number of fractions.
3. **Adjusting Numerators:** O(k), iterating over the fractions.
4. **Simplifying Fraction:** O(log(min(result_num, lcm))), for the GCD calculation.

Overall, the time complexity is primarily O(n + k), which should be efficient for reasonable input sizes according to problem constraints.
