[Leetcode 2191. Sort the Jumbled Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2191)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `mapping` which represents the mapping rule of a shuffled integer system. `mapping[i] = j` means the digit `i` should be mapped to the digit `j` in this system.

You are also given another integer array `nums`. Apply this mapping to each of the numbers in `nums`, and sort the resulting numbers.

More formally, for each integer in `nums`, replace every occurrence of the digit `i` with `mapping[i]` in the integer. Then, sort the array `nums` based on the new values.

Return the array `nums` sorted in the new order defined by the mapping.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of `nums` and the possible values it can contain?**
    - Assume reasonable constraints, such as `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `0 <= nums[i] < 10^6`.

2. **Will `mapping` always be of length 10 with unique digits from 0 to 9?**
    - Yes, `mapping` will always have 10 elements where each element is a unique digit from 0 to 9.

3. **Should we consider leading zeros in the mapped numbers?**
    - No, leading zeros will not be present in the input numbers or need to be handled in the output.

## Strategy
1. **Mapping Conversion**: First, define a function to convert a number using the given mapping.
2. **Sort**: Use the converted numbers to sort the original `nums` array.
3. **Comparison**: While sorting, compare the mapped values instead of the original numbers.

### Steps:

1. Create a helper function `mapNumber` that converts a given number based on the mapping.
2. Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the original number and its corresponding mapped value.
3. Sort the tuples based on the mapped values.
4. Extract and return the sorted list of original numbers.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

// Function to convert a single number using the mapping
int mapNumber(int num, const std::vector<int>& mapping) {
    std::string original = std::to_string(num);
    std::string mapped;
    
    for (char digit : original) {
        mapped += std::to_string(mapping[digit - '0']);
    }
    
    return std::stoi(mapped);
}

std::vector<int> sortJumbled(const std::vector<int>& mapping, std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Pair each number with its mapped value
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> mappedNums;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        mappedNums.emplace_back(mapNumber(num, mapping), num);
    }
    
    // Sort based on the mapped values
    std::sort(mappedNums.begin(), mappedNums.end());
    
    // Extract sorted numbers
    std::vector<int> sortedNums;
    for (const auto& pair : mappedNums) {
        sortedNums.push_back(pair.second);
    }
    
    return sortedNums;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Mapping Conversion**: Converting each number takes \( O(\log n) \) time where \( n \) is the number being converted. For each of the `nums`, this gives \( O(N \log n) \) where \( N \) is the length of `nums`.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting the array of mapped values takes \( O(N \log N) \).

Combining these, the total time complexity is \( O(N \log N + N \log n) \). Given typical constraints, this should be efficient enough for practical usage.
