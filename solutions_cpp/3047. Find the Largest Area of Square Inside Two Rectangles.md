[Leetcode 3047. Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3047)
## Problem Statement

You are given the coordinates of two rectangles `A` and `B` in a 2D plane, specified by their vertices (bottom-left and top-right). The task is to determine the side length of the largest square that can be formed inside one of these rectangles but not at any intersection of the two rectangles.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: How are the rectangles represented? Are they given by their opposite corners, such as bottom-left and top-right?
2. **Output**: Are we supposed to output just the side length of the largest possible square?
3. **Coordinates**: Can the rectangles overlap or share sides, and do they always lie in the first quadrant (positive coordinates)?
4. **Side Length**: Is the side length of the square required to be an integer?

Assumptions based on typical problems if not explicitly stated:
- Each rectangle is given by two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) where (x1, y1) is the bottom-left corner and (x2, y2) is the top-right corner.
- The rectangles can overlap.
- Output should be the maximal integer side length of the largest square.
  
## Strategy

To find the largest square inside either of the rectangles and outside their intersection, follow these steps:

1. **Determine Side Lengths Within Rectangles**: 
    - For each rectangle, calculate the maximum possible square that can fit within it.
2. **Calculate Intersection**:
    - Determine any overlapping area.
3. **Check Non-Intersection Regions**:
    - Calculate the valid non-overlapping regions where a square can be placed.
4. **Find Maximum Square**:
    - Determine the maximum possible square in valid regions.

## Code

Hereâ€™s a structured approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to find intersection of two given segments
int intersect(int a1, int a2, int b1, int b2) {
    return max(0, min(a2, b2) - max(a1, b1));
}

// Helper function to find the largest side of the square that can fit in a rectangle
int maxSquareInRectangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
    return min(x2 - x1, y2 - y1);
}

int largestSquare(int Ax1, int Ay1, int Ax2, int Ay2, int Bx1, int By1, int Bx2, int By2) {
    // Find the maximum possible square in the rectangles A and B
    int maxSquareA = maxSquareInRectangle(Ax1, Ay1, Ax2, Ay2);
    int maxSquareB = maxSquareInRectangle(Bx1, By1, Bx2, By2);

    // Determine overlapping region
    int ox1 = max(Ax1, Bx1), oy1 = max(Ay1, By1);
    int ox2 = min(Ax2, Bx2), oy2 = min(Ay2, By2);

    // If there's an overlap, calculate the largest square that fits within the non-overlapping parts
    int maxNonOverlapSquare = 0;

    if (ox1 < ox2 && oy1 < oy2) {
        // Overlapping region present
        maxNonOverlapSquare = max({
            (ox1 > Ax1) ? maxSquareInRectangle(Ax1, Ay1, ox1, Ay2) : 0, // Left of A
            (ox2 < Ax2) ? maxSquareInRectangle(ox2, Ay1, Ax2, Ay2) : 0, // Right of A
            (oy1 > Ay1) ? maxSquareInRectangle(Ax1, Ay1, Ax2, oy1) : 0, // Below A
            (oy2 < Ay2) ? maxSquareInRectangle(Ax1, oy2, Ax2, Ay2) : 0, // Above A
            (ox1 > Bx1) ? maxSquareInRectangle(Bx1, By1, ox1, By2) : 0, // Left of B
            (ox2 < Bx2) ? maxSquareInRectangle(ox2, By1, Bx2, By2) : 0, // Right of B
            (oy1 > By1) ? maxSquareInRectangle(Bx1, By1, Bx2, oy1) : 0, // Below B
            (oy2 < By2) ? maxSquareInRectangle(Bx1, oy2, Bx2, By2) : 0  // Above B
        });
    }

    return max({maxSquareA, maxSquareB, maxNonOverlapSquare});
}

// Main method for testing
int main() {
    int Ax1, Ay1, Ax2, Ay2;
    int Bx1, By1, Bx2, By2;
    
    cout << "Enter the coordinates for rectangle A (x1 y1 x2 y2): ";
    cin >> Ax1 >> Ay1 >> Ax2 >> Ay2;
    
    cout << "Enter the coordinates for rectangle B (x1 y1 x2 y2): ";
    cin >> Bx1 >> By1 >> Bx2 >> By2;

    cout << "The largest square has side length: " << largestSquare(Ax1, Ay1, Ax2, Ay2, Bx1, By1, Bx2, By2) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy Explanation

1. **Max Square in Each Rectangle**:
    - Directly calculate the largest square based on minimal side lengths of each rectangle.
2. **Overlap Calculation**:
    - Determine the overlapping region, if any, by intersecting x and y ranges.
3. **Non-Overlap Handling**:
    - Calculate the largest square by considering the non-overlapping parts of rectangles A and B.
4. **Combination**:
    - Comparing the largest possible squares from both rectangles and non-overlapping calculation to get the maximum possible value.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - All operations (calculations and comparisons) are constant time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a fixed number of variables are used irrespective of the input size.
