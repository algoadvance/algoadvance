[Leetcode 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2110)
## Problem Statement

A smooth descent period of a stock's price consists of one or more contiguous days such that for each day `i` in that period (except the last day), the price on day `i` is greater than the price on the day `i+1` by exactly `1`. Given an array `prices` representing the daily price of a stock, return the number of smooth descent periods.

### Example:
- Input: `prices = [3,2,1,4]`
- Output: `7`
  
**Explanation**: The 7 smooth descent periods are:
- `[3, 2, 1]`
- `[3, 2]`
- `[2, 1]`
- `[3]`
- `[2]`
- `[1]`
- `[4]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can prices have negative values?
   - No, stock prices are always positive integers.
   
2. What is the maximum possible length of the `prices` array?
   - The length of the `prices` array will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

3. What should the function return if the input array is empty?
   - Given the constraints, the input array will always have at least one element.


## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Maintain a variable `count` to store the total number of smooth descent periods. Another variable `descent_length` will keep track of the length of the current descent period.
  
2. **Iteration**: Iterate through the `prices` array.
    - If the current price is exactly 1 less than the previous price, it is part of a descent period; increase the `descent_length`.
    - If it is not, reset `descent_length` to 1 as every single day is also a smooth descent period.
  
3. **Count Calculation**: For each day, add `descent_length` to `count` to account for all possible sub-periods ending at that day.

4. **Return Result**: After the loop, return the total count.


## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    long long getDescentPeriods(std::vector<int>& prices) {
        long long count = 0;
        int descent_length = 1; // Initialize to 1 for the first element
        
        count += descent_length; // Count the first element itself
        
        for (size_t i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if (prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1) {
                descent_length++;
            } else {
                descent_length = 1;
            }
            
            count += descent_length; // Add current descent length to count
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `prices` array. This is because the algorithm iterates through the array once, and each operation inside the loop takes constant time.

The solution is efficient and well-suited for inputs up to the maximum constraint.
