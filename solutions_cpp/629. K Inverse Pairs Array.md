[Leetcode 629. K Inverse Pairs Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l629)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the number of different arrays consist of numbers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs. Since the answer can be huge, return it modulo \(10^9+7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is an inverse pair?**
   - An inverse pair in an array is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `A[i] > A[j]`.

2. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - The constraints generally are `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`.

3. **Should the arrays be permutations of numbers `1` to `n`?**
   - Yes, the arrays should consist of a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will use a 2D dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the number of arrays consisting of numbers from `1` to `i` with exactly `j` inverse pairs.

2. **Transition Formula**:
   - If we add the number `i` to an array of length `i-1`, it can create `0` to `i-1` inverse pairs depending on its position.
   - Therefore, the formula for update is:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-2] + \ldots + dp[i-1][j-(i-1)]) \mod 10^9 + 7
     \]

3. **Prefix Sum Optimization**:
   - Instead of summing up to `i` terms for each update, a prefix sum can be used:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j] - (j-i >= 0 ? dp[i-1][j-i] : 0) + 10^9 + 7) \mod 10^9 + 7
     \]

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int kInversePairs(int n, int k) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1; // One way to arrange 0 elements with 0 inverse pairs.

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; ++j) {
                // Sum of dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1], ..., dp[i-1][j-(i-1)]
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % MOD;
                }
                if (j >= i) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] - dp[i-1][j-i] + MOD) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times k)\), where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the number of inverse pairs.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times k)\) for the dynamic programming table.

This approach ensures an efficient calculation of the number of permutations satisfying the conditions given in the problem statement.
