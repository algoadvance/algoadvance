[Leetcode 2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2114)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `sentences` where each sentence `i` consists of words separated by spaces. Your task is to return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.

A sentence is defined as a string of spaces-separated words. For example, the string `"This is a sample sentence"` has 5 words: "This", "is", "a", "sample", "sentence".

**Example:**

- Input: `sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]`
- Output: 6

**Note:**

- Each sentence `i` contains only lowercase English letters and spaces.
- It's guaranteed that the length of each sentence `i` is at least 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Spaces Only for Separation:** Can we assume that there are no leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces between words? 
    - **Assumption:** Yes, since stated sentences consist of words separated by single spaces.

2. **Empty Sentences:** Are there any completely empty sentences in the input array?
    - **Assumption:** No, because it's mentioned that each sentence is of length at least 1.
  
## Strategy

1. Iterate over each sentence in the `sentences` list.
2. Split each sentence based on spaces to count the number of words.
3. Keep a variable to track the maximum number of words found in any sentence.
4. Return the maximum count.

## Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

int mostWordsFound(std::vector<std::string>& sentences) {
    int maxWords = 0;
    
    for(const std::string& sentence : sentences) {
        // Using stringstream to split the sentence into words
        std::stringstream ss(sentence);
        std::string word;
        int wordCount = 0;
        while (ss >> word) {
            wordCount++;
        }
        // Update the maximum words found if the current sentence has more words
        maxWords = std::max(maxWords, wordCount);
    }
    
    return maxWords;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> sentences = {"alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"};
    std::cout << "Maximum number of words in a single sentence: " << mostWordsFound(sentences) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting Each Sentence:** If `n` is the number of sentences and `m` is the average length of a sentence, splitting each sentence into words runs in O(m) time.
- **Overall Complexity:** The total time complexity is O(n * m) since we have to process each sentence.

Thus, with efficient handling using string streams, the solution is optimized for typical sentence processing scenarios.
