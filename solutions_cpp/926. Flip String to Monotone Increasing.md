[Leetcode 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l926)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` (change `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`) as many times as you want.

Return the minimum number of flips required to make `s` monotone increasing.

A string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`'s (possibly zero), followed by some number of `1`'s (also possibly zero).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the length of the string be constrained in any particular way? (e.g., up to `10^5`)
2. Are there any constraints on the characters in the string? (e.g., only '0' or '1')

## Strategy
The core idea is to track the minimum number of flips required to make the string monotone increasing. To solve this problem efficiently, you can use dynamic programming or a greedy approach.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Keep two running totals:
    - `count_flips_if_monotone`: Minimum flips needed to make the string monotone starting from the beginning up to the current position.
    - `count_ones`: Count of `1`s encountered so far.

2. **Iterate through the string**:
    - For every character:
        - If it's `0`, you can either:
            - Flip the `0` to `1` to maintain the monotone increasing sequence (which uses the `count_ones` flips so far).
            - Keep the `0` and consider how many flips it would take to convert all previous ones to zeros.
        - Update the running total of flips required.

3. **Return Result**: The minimum number of flips at the end of the string.

By following this strategy, you can determine the optimal point to partition the zeroes and ones.

### Time Complexity
The solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string, as it requires a single pass through the string with constant time operations within the loop.

## Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minFlipsMonoIncr(std::string s) {
    int count_flips_if_monotone = 0;
    int count_ones = 0;
    
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (ch == '1') {
            count_ones++;
        } else { // ch == '0'
            count_flips_if_monotone = std::min(count_flips_if_monotone + 1, count_ones);
        }
    }
    
    return count_flips_if_monotone;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **count_flips_if_monotone**: Keeps track of the optimal number of flips required to make the string monotone increasing up to the current character.
- **count_ones**: Tracks the number of `1`s encountered so far.
- For each character in the string, we update these counts appropriately and maintain the minimum flips needed by either turning `0` to `1` or by maintaining it as `0`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum flips necessary in a single pass through the string.
