[Leetcode 2874. Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2874)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. Find the maximum number you can obtain by multiplying `nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]` where `0 <= i < j < k < nums.length`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
Explanation: Maximum product is 2*3*4 = 24.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.
2. **What is the size range of the array?**
   - The size of the array `nums` is at least 3.
3. **Are all numbers positive integers?**
   - Yes, all numbers in `nums` are positive integers.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
   - The three largest values will be the last three elements in the sorted array.

2. **Finding Maximum Product:**
   - Compute the product of the three largest values.

**Example Execution:**

- Given `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- After sorting, `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- The maximum product is `2 * 3 * 4 = 24`

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int maximumTripletValue(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array in non-decreasing order
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Step 2: Compute the product of the last three elements
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxProduct = nums[n-3] * nums[n-2] * nums[n-1];
    
    return maxProduct;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::cout << maximumTripletValue(nums) << std::endl;  // Output: 24
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the array.
- **Finding the Product:** \(O(1)\), since we only need the last three elements of the sorted array.

The overall time complexity of the solution is **\(O(n \log n)\)** due to the sorting step. This approach ensures that we find the maximum product of an ordered triplet in an efficient manner.
