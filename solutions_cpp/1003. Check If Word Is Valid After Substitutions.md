[Leetcode 1003. Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1003)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, determine if it is valid based on the following conditions:
- The string is initially empty.
- A valid string can be formed by inserting the substring "abc" into any position of the string zero or more times.

A string is considered valid if and only if it can be transformed into an empty string by repeatedly deleting the substring "abc".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input string `s` contain any characters other than `a`, `b`, and `c`?
   **A:** No, the input string `s` will only contain the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   **A:** The length of string `s` can be up to 20,000 characters.

3. **Q:** Should we consider the order of characters within the "abc" substring to validate?
   **A:** Yes, the order of "abc" should be exactly as given. No permutation of these characters should be considered valid.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach, as it allows for efficient handling of the substring elimination process. The idea is to:
1. Traverse the string character by character.
2. Push each character to a stack.
3. Each time the top three characters in the stack form the substring "abc", pop these three characters off the stack.
4. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, the string is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(std::string s) {
        std::stack<char> stk;
        for (char ch : s) {
            stk.push(ch);
            // Check the top three characters if they form "abc"
            if (stk.size() >= 3) {
                char c3 = stk.top(); stk.pop();
                char c2 = stk.top(); stk.pop();
                char c1 = stk.top(); stk.pop();
                if (c1 == 'a' && c2 == 'b' && c3 == 'c') {
                    // Valid "abc" found, continue without pushing them back
                    continue;
                } else {
                    // If it's not "abc", push them back in order
                    stk.push(c1);
                    stk.push(c2);
                    stk.push(c3);
                }
            }
        }
        return stk.empty();
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string s = "aabcbc";
    std::cout << (sol.isValid(s) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    s = "abcabcababcc";
    std::cout << (sol.isValid(s) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    s = "abccba";
    std::cout << (sol.isValid(s) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    s = "cababc";
    std::cout << (sol.isValid(s) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are traversing each character of the string exactly once and performing constant-time operations (push and conditional pop) for each character.
The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case, because the stack can potentially store all characters of the input string if no valid "abc" substrings are found during the process.
