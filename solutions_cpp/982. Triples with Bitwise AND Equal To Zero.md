[Leetcode 982. Triples with Bitwise AND Equal To Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l982)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `A`, find the number of triples `(i, j, k)` such that:

- `i`, `j`, `k` are the indices of three different elements in `A`.
- The bitwise AND of the elements at these indices is zero, i.e., `A[i] & A[j] & A[k] == 0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements be repeated in the array?**
   - Yes, elements in the arrays can be repeated, but the indices must be different.

2. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array or the range of its elements?**
   - The problem usually involves constraints mentioned in the problem statement, for example, array size up to 1000 and elements within the range of `0` to `2^16 - 1` (since these can represent 16-bit integers).

3. **Should we consider the order of indices (i, j, k)?**
   - Since `(i, j, k)` needs to be a combination of distinct indices, the order doesnâ€™t matter; `(i, j, k)` equals `(k, j, i)` in terms of counting.

### Strategy

1. Count pairs `(A[i], A[j])` whose bitwise AND is zero and store it in a hashmap.
2. Iterate through each element `A[k]` and check against the pairs stored in the hashmap such that the final bitwise AND with `A[k]` is zero.
3. Count all such valid combinations and return the result.

### Time Complexity

- **Preparation of pairs table:** O(N^2)
- **Triple check with third element:** O(N^2)
- Overall Complexity: O(N^3) - This is acceptable for N around 1000 based on constraints usually found in such problems.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int countTriplets(std::vector<int>& A) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> pairCount;
        int n = A.size();
        
        // Counting pairs (A[i] & A[j]) where the result is zero 
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                pairCount[A[i] & A[j]]++;
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        
        // For each number, check against the pairs stored to count valid triples
        for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for(auto pair : pairCount) {
                if((pair.first & A[k]) == 0) {
                    result += pair.second;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Pairs:**
   - We count all pairs `(A[i], A[j])` and store their bitwise AND result in a hashmap called `pairCount`.
   - `pairCount[bitwise_and]` would contain the number of pairs that resulted in `bitwise_and`.

2. **Triples Check:**
   - For each number `A[k]` in the array, we check the hashmap to see if there are pairs `(A[i], A[j])` where `(A[i] & A[j] & A[k]) == 0`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, we increase our result count by the count of such pairs.

3. **Result:**
   - The final `result` gives the number of such valid triples `(i, j, k)`.

This approach efficiently counts all valid triples by precomputing pairs and then checking them efficiently within the constraints.
