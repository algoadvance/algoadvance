[Leetcode 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1200)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of distinct integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements. Each pair `arr[i], arr[j]` must be in the format `[arr[i], arr[j]]` with `arr[i] < arr[j]`.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair `[a, b]` follows
- `a < b`
- `a` = arr[i]
- `b` = arr[j]
- `|a - b|` == minimum absolute difference of any two elements

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the input array contains at least two elements?
   - Yes, because there would be no pairs if there were fewer than two elements.
2. Is the array given in any particular order?
   - No, the array is not guaranteed to be in any particular order.
3. Do we need to consider time and space constraints for large arrays?
   - Typically, performance is a consideration, but for this problem, an O(n log n) solution should be acceptable due to the sorting step involved.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** First, we need to sort the array to be able to efficiently compute the differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Find Minimum Absolute Difference:** As we traverse the sorted array, we compute the differences between consecutive elements and track the minimum absolute difference found.
3. **Collect Result Pairs:** Again, traverse the sorted array and collect all pairs that have this minimum absolute difference.

### Code
Here is the C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> minimumAbsDifference(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Sort the array
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    // Initialize the minimum difference as a large value
    int min_diff = INT_MAX;
    
    // Compute the minimum absolute difference
    for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; ++i) {
        min_diff = std::min(min_diff, arr[i+1] - arr[i]);
    }
    
    // Collect all pairs with the minimum absolute difference
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; ++i) {
        if (arr[i+1] - arr[i] == min_diff) {
            result.push_back({arr[i], arr[i+1]});
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting the Array:** We sort the array in ascending order which allows us to only consider the differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Finding the Minimum Difference:**
   - Initialize the `min_diff` to the maximum possible integer value.
   - Traverse the array and update `min_diff` to be the minimum of the current `min_diff` and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements.
3. **Collecting Result Pairs:**
   - Traverse the array again to find all pairs where the difference between consecutive elements is equal to `min_diff`.
   - Add these pairs to the result list.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- Finding the minimum absolute difference takes `O(n)`.
- Collecting result pairs also takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)`.
