[Leetcode 2798. Number of Employees Who Met the Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2798)
## Problem Statement

### Number of Employees Who Met the Target

You are given a list of integers representing the number of units sold by each employee during a certain period. Also, you are given an integer target which represents the minimum number of units that an employee needs to sell to be considered as meeting the target.

Write a function that returns the number of employees who met or exceeded the target sales.

### Function Signature
```cpp
int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(vector<int>& sales, int target);
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Bounds & Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the number of employees (length of the sales vector)?
   - What is the range of the sales units and the target value?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if there are no employees (i.e., the list is empty)?
   - Should we consider non-positive target values, and how to handle them?

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through the list of sales:**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - For each employee's sales value:
       - Compare it with the target.
       - If it meets or exceeds the target, increment the counter.
   
2. **Return the counter at the end.**

This approach ensures we check each employeeâ€™s sales exactly once, making the solution efficient.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(std::vector<int>& sales, int target) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int sale : sales) {
        if (sale >= target) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the sales vector. This is because we are iterating through the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution is efficient and straightforward for the given problem constraints.
