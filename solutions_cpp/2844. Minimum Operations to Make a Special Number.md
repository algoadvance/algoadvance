[Leetcode 2844. Minimum Operations to Make a Special Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2844)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `num` representing a non-negative integer, your task is to make this integer a "special number" by performing a minimum number of operations. A special number is a number that either ends with the digit 5 or is entirely divisible by 25. In each operation, you may either:

1. Remove a single character from the string `num`.
2. Swap two adjacent characters of the string `num`.

You need to find the minimum number of operations required to make `num` a special number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the length of the string `num`?
   - In general problems, the length can go up to 10^5.
   
2. **Leading Zeros**: If removing characters leads to leading zeros, should they be handled in any special way?
   - Generally, leading zeros are not considered as part of the number if they are not valid.

3. **Multiple Operations**: Can the operations (removal and swap) be combined, or should they be applied in any specific order?
   - The operations can be combined in any sequence to minimize the total number of operations.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Target Patterns**: We will look for possible patterns that make the number special (ends with '0', '5', '25', '50', or '75').
2. **Calculate Minimum Operations**: For each pattern, we will calculate the operations needed by checking the distance between relevant characters and how many removals or swaps are necessary.
3. **Choose the Optimal Solution**: We will consider the least number of operations from step 2 to determine our answer.

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(string num) {
    int n = num.size();
    int result = n;  // Start with the maximum possible value

    // Check all possible endings: "00", "25", "50", "75"

    // Ending "00"
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if(num[i] == '0') {
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if(num[j] == '0') {
                    result = min(result, n - j - 1 + j - i - 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Ending "25"
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if(num[i] == '2') {
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if(num[j] == '5') {
                    result = min(result, n - j - 1 + j - i - 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Ending "50"
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if(num[i] == '5') {
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if(num[j] == '0') {
                    result = min(result, n - j - 1 + j - i - 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Ending "75"
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if(num[i] == '7') {
            for(int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if(num[j] == '5') {
                    result = min(result, n - j - 1 + j - i - 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string num;
    cin >> num;
    cout << minOperations(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We initialize our result to `n` (the length of the string), as it represents the worst-case scenario where all characters may need to be removed.
2. **Pattern Checking**: We check for the four possible patterns that make the number "special." For each pattern:
   - We find the positions where the relevant digits occur.
   - Calculate the minimum number of operations required if these positions can be rearranged to form the desired pattern.
3. **Comparing Costs**: For each pattern, the required operations are calculated by considering the removals or swaps needed to reposition the characters correctly. We update our result with the minimum value obtained from these calculations.
   
### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) because for each possible first character, we are scanning the rest of the string to find the second character. Given that the nested loops run in quadratic time in the worst case, \(O(n^2)\) is our final complexity, which should be efficient for typical interview constraints.
