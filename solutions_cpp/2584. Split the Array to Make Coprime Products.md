[Leetcode 2584. Split the Array to Make Coprime Products](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2584)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the earliest possible index `i` such that the product of the elements before `i` (from index `0` to `i-1`) and the product of the elements from index `i` to the end of the array are coprime. Coprime numbers are numbers that have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of `1`.

You must return the smallest possible value of `i` that meets the condition. If there is no such index, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Size**: What is the size range of the input array `nums`?
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of the elements in `nums`?
3. **Duplicates**: Can there be duplicate values in `nums`?
4. **Special Cases**: How should the function handle arrays that are entirely coprime or not at all?

### Example

Consider the following example:

```cpp
Input: nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Product of elements before index 2 (2 and 3) is 2 * 3 = 6
Product of elements from index 2 (4, 5, 6) is 4 * 5 * 6 = 120
GCD(6, 120) = 1, so they are coprime. Hence, the earliest index is 2.
```

### Strategy

To find the solution, we need to:
1. Use prefix and suffix products to efficiently calculate gcd.
2. Keep two running products:
   - `prefixProduct` for product of elements from `0` to `i-1`.
   - `suffixProduct` for product of elements from `i` to `n-1`.
3. Iterate through the array and update these products to check the gcd condition.

### Code

Here's the C++ code to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // For std::gcd

int findSplitIndex(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n < 2) return -1; // Not possible to split

    // Initialize prefix and suffix products
    std::vector<int> prefixProduct(n, 1);
    std::vector<int> suffixProduct(n, 1);

    prefixProduct[0] = nums[0];
    suffixProduct[n-1] = nums[n-1];

    // Populate the prefix and suffix products
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixProduct[i] = prefixProduct[i-1] * nums[i];
    }

    for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i) {
        suffixProduct[i] = suffixProduct[i+1] * nums[i];
    }

    // Check the gcd condition for the splitting point
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (std::gcd(prefixProduct[i-1], suffixProduct[i]) == 1) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1; // No valid split index found
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int result = findSplitIndex(nums);
    std::cout << "The earliest index to split the array is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because:
- Constructing the prefix and suffix products takes `O(n)` time.
- Iterating through the array to find the gcd and determine the split index also takes `O(n)` time.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n)`.
