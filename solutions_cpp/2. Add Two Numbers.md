[Leetcode 2. Add Two Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2)
## Problem Statement
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example:
```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: What happens if the two linked lists have different lengths?
   **A**: You continue to add the numbers until both lists are fully traversed, treating the missing digits of the shorter list as zero.
   
2. **Q**: What if the sum of the digits produces a carry?
   **A**: The carry should be propagated to the next place value in the list.

3. **Q**: Can we modify the input linked lists, or must we create a new list for the result?
   **A**: Create a new linked list for the result.

## Strategy
1. Initialize a dummy head for the result linked list.
2. Use pointers to traverse both linked lists (`l1` and `l2`).
3. Initialize a `carry` variable to hold the carry-over value (initially 0).
4. Traverse both lists until the end of both lists and any carry exists:
    - Calculate the sum of the current digits along with the carry.
    - Update the carry.
    - Create a new node in the result list with the resulting digit.
5. Finally, ensure that if there is any carry left after the loop, it's added as a new node in the result list.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode* dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* p = l1, *q = l2, *current = dummyHead;
        int carry = 0;
        
        while (p != nullptr || q != nullptr) {
            int x = (p != nullptr) ? p->val : 0;
            int y = (q != nullptr) ? q->val : 0;
            int sum = carry + x + y;
            carry = sum / 10;
            current->next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            current = current->next;
            if (p != nullptr) p = p->next;
            if (q != nullptr) q = q->next;
        }
        
        if (carry > 0) {
            current->next = new ListNode(carry);
        }
        
        ListNode* result = dummyHead->next;
        delete dummyHead;  // Free the dummy head.
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(max(n, m))**, where `n` is the length of the first linked list and `m` is the length of the second linked list. This is because we need to traverse both linked lists completely.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(max(n, m))** as well, due to the output linked list that we construct, which in the worst case, will have a length equal to the longer of the two input lists plus one additional node for any final carry-over.
