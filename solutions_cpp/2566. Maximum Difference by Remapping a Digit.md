## Problem Statement
2566. Maximum Difference by Remapping a Digit

You are given an integer `num`. You will choose exactly two different digits `a` and `b` from the decimal representation of `num`, and replace all occurrences of the digit `a` with `b` and all occurrences of the digit `b` with `a`. Your goal is to maximize the difference between the transformed integer and `num`. Return the maximum difference you can achieve.

### Example
**Input**: `num = 123456`
**Output**: `619836`

**Note**: For `num = 123456`, you can choose `a = 1` and `b = 6`, then swap them resulting in `623451`. The difference between `623451` and `123456` is `499995`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer `num` into its string representation.
2. Iterate over each pair of digits `a` and `b` in the string.
3. For each pair, create a new string where all occurrences of `a` are replaced with `b` and all occurrences of `b` are replaced with `a`.
4. Convert the new string back to an integer.
5. Calculate the difference between this new integer and the original `num`.
6. Track the maximum difference encountered during the process.
7. Return the maximum difference.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are `a` and `b` guaranteed to be different digits?
   - Yes, `a` and `b` must be different digits.
2. Can `num` have leading zeros after digit replacement?
   - No, converting back to integer will handle any leading zeros automatically.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

int getMaxDifferenceByRemapping(int num) {
    std::string numStr = std::to_string(num);
    int n = numStr.size();
    int maxDifference = 0;
    
    for (char a = '0'; a <= '9'; ++a) {
        for (char b = '0'; b <= '9'; ++b) {
            if (a != b) {
                std::string transformed = numStr;
                for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                    if (transformed[i] == a) {
                        transformed[i] = b;
                    } else if (transformed[i] == b) {
                        transformed[i] = a;
                    }
                }
                int transformedNum = std::stoi(transformed);
                int currentDifference = std::abs(transformedNum - num);
                maxDifference = std::max(maxDifference, currentDifference);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxDifference;
}

int main() {
    int num = 123456;
    std::cout << "Maximum Difference: " << getMaxDifferenceByRemapping(num) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * 10 * 10), where:
- `n` is the number of digits in the integer `num`.
- The nested loops iterate over all pairs of digits (from 0 to 9), giving a constant factor of 100.

Thus, the time complexity simplifies to O(n), which is efficient for typical input sizes.
