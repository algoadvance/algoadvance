[Leetcode 16. 3Sum Closest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l16)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
```cpp
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n` (size of nums)?
   - Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - What is the range of the integer values in `nums`?

2. **Output Guarantees:**
   - Should the function return only the closest sum or the exact sum if it matches the target?

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - Begin by sorting the array. This allows us to efficiently find the closest sum using a two-pointer technique.

2. **Iterate and Use Two Pointers:**
   - Iterate through each element, and for each element, use two pointers to find the close sum for the remaining elements.
   - Calculate and update the closest sum during each iteration.

3. **Update the Closest Sum:**
   - If the current three-sum is closer to the `target` than the previously recorded closest sum, update the closest sum.
   - Adjust the pointers based on the comparison with the target to efficiently narrow down the closest sum.

4. **Terminate Early:**
   - If you find an exact match (`current_sum == target`), you can immediately return because you can't get closer than an exact match.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstdlib> // for abs()

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int closestSum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]; // Initial assumption with first three elements

        for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; ++i) {
            size_t left = i + 1;
            size_t right = nums.size() - 1;

            while (left < right) {
                int currentSum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

                // Update the closestSum if the currentSum is closer to the target
                if (abs(currentSum - target) < abs(closestSum - target)) {
                    closestSum = currentSum;
                }

                if (currentSum < target) {
                    ++left;
                } else if (currentSum > target) {
                    --right;
                } else {
                    // If currentSum equals target, we've found the closest possible sum
                    return currentSum;
                }
            }
        }

        return closestSum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) because we sort the array initially.
- **Two-pointer traversal**: \(O(n^2)\) because for each element, we traverse the rest of the array using two pointers.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the size of the input array `nums`.

### Final Notes
- This approach efficiently narrows down the closest sum using sorting combined with the two-pointer technique.
- It guarantees a solution with time complexity manageable for reasonably large inputs.
