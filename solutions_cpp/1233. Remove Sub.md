[Leetcode 1233. Remove Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1233)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of folders `folders` in a filesystem, you are to remove all sub-folders from the list and return the folders after removing sub-folders in lexicographical order.

If a folder `x` is located within another folder `y`, then `y` is called a sub-folder of `x`. The folders are represented as strings, similar to file paths in a consistent manner, i.e., `folders = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the list of folders be empty? (Assuming it's possible and should return an empty list.)
2. Are there any duplicate entries in the folder list? (Assuming it's not, but if yes, we can handle it by using a set for uniqueness.)
3. Should we handle invalid folder paths? (Assuming all folder paths are valid.)

## Strategy

1. **Sorting:** First, sort the list of folders. Sorting ensures that any sub-folder always comes immediately after its parent folder due to lexicographical order.
2. **Iteration and Checking:** Iterate through the sorted list and keep track of the last added folder. For each new folder, check if it starts with the last added folder path plus a `/`. If yes, it's a sub-folder and should be skipped; otherwise, add it to the result.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
    // Sort the folder list lexicographically
    sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());

    vector<string> result;
    string lastAdded = "";

    for (const string& f : folder) {
        // If it's not a sub-folder of the last added folder, add it to the result
        if (lastAdded.empty() || f.find(lastAdded + '/') != 0) {
            result.push_back(f);
            lastAdded = f;
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<string> folders = {"/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"};
    vector<string> result = removeSubfolders(folders);

    for (const string& folder : result) {
        cout << folder << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The sort operation takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of folders.
- **Iteration:** The iteration over the folder list takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.
