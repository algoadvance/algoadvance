[Leetcode 1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1221)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1221: Split a String in Balanced Strings

You are given a string `s` of 'L' and 'R' characters, and you need to split this string into as many balanced strings as possible.

A balanced string is defined as a string with an equal number of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is the length of the string constrained (e.g., maximum length)?
    - Are there any constraints regarding the characters in the string (will it always contain only 'L' and 'R')?

2. **Output**
    - What should be returned if the input string cannot be split into any balanced strings? (This might be inherently handled by the problem constraints).

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach where we count 'L' and 'R' characters as we traverse the string:

1. Initialize a counter (let's call it `balance`) and another counter for the number of balanced strings (`num_balanced`).
2. Traverse the string character by character:
   - Increment `balance` by 1 for 'L' and decrement it by 1 for 'R'.
   - Whenever `balance` becomes zero, it means we have found a balanced string.
3. Count each instance where balance becomes zero, as it indicates a balanced substring.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int balancedStringSplit(std::string s) {
    int balance = 0;
    int num_balanced = 0;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == 'L') {
            balance++;
        } else if (c == 'R') {
            balance--;
        }
        
        if (balance == 0) {
            num_balanced++;
        }
    }
    
    return num_balanced;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "RLRRLLRLRL";
    std::cout << balancedStringSplit(s) << std::endl;  // Output: 4
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once, making the operations linear in terms of the number of characters.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1), The space used does not scale with the input size, as we only use a few integer variables.
