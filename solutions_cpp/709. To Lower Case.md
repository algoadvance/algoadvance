[Leetcode 709. To Lower Case](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l709)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, convert it to lowercase. The function should return a new string that contains the same characters as `s`, but all converted to lowercase.

**Example:**
- Input: "Hello"
- Output: "hello"

- Input: "here"
- Output: "here"

- Input: "LOVELY"
- Output: "lovely"

You need to implement a function with the following signature:
```cpp
string toLowerCase(string s);
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input string include numbers or special characters?
   - **A:** Yes, the input string can include any ASCII characters.

2. **Q:** Should the function handle empty strings?
   - **A:** Yes, the function should return an empty string if the input is empty.

3. **Q:** Is there a limit to the length of the input string?
   - **A:** There is no explicit limit mentioned, but it can be assumed it fits within standard constraints (e.g., typical constraints might be up to 10^4 characters).

## Strategy
1. **Traversal and Conversion:**
   - Traverse each character of the string.
   - For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z').
   - If it is uppercase, convert it to its corresponding lowercase character by adding the difference between 'a' and 'A' to it.
   - Append the resulting character to a new string.

2. **ASCII Value Utilization:**
   - The conversion from uppercase to lowercase can be done using ASCII values: 
     - For any uppercase letter `ch`, its lowercase can be calculated using `ch + ('a' - 'A')`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty string should be handled by simply returning an empty string.
   - If the string contains non-alphabetic characters (numbers or special characters), they should remain unchanged.

## Code
```cpp
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string toLowerCase(string s) {
    string result;
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') {
            result += ch + ('a' - 'A');
        } else {
            result += ch;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. Each character is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is due to the storage required for the resultant string.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently handles the conversion with a straightforward traversal and ASCII value manipulation.
