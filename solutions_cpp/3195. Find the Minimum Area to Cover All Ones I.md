[Leetcode 3195. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3195)
## Problem Statement
You are given a binary matrix (consisting of 0s and 1s). You need to find the minimum area of a rectangle that can cover all the '1's in the matrix.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 0]
]
Output: 6
```
In this example, the smallest rectangle that can cover all the '1's has an area of 6.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What are the dimensions of the matrix?
   - Assume the matrix is at most 100x100.
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if there are no '1's in the matrix?
     - Return 0 in this case.
   - What if the matrix is completely filled with '1's?
     - The area would be the total number of elements in the matrix \((rows \times columns)\).

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:** 
   - We'll iterate through the matrix to determine the smallest rectangle that can cover all the '1's.
   
2. **Determining Bounds:**
   - We need to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain '1's.
     - min_row: The smallest row index that contains '1'.
     - max_row: The largest row index that contains '1'.
     - min_col: The smallest column index that contains '1'.
     - max_col: The largest column index that contains '1'.
   
3. **Computing Area:**
   - Compute the area of the rectangle defined by these min/max boundaries.
   
4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If no '1' is found during the traversal, return an area of 0.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minAreaRectangleToCoverOnes(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
    int rows = matrix.size();
    if (rows == 0) return 0;
    int cols = matrix[0].size();
    if (cols == 0) return 0;

    int min_row = rows, max_row = -1;
    int min_col = cols, max_col = -1;

    // Find the boundaries of the smallest rectangle that covers all 1s
    for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                if (i < min_row) min_row = i;
                if (i > max_row) max_row = i;
                if (j < min_col) min_col = j;
                if (j > max_col) max_col = j;
            }
        }
    }

    // If there are no 1s in the matrix
    if (max_row == -1) return 0;

    // Calculate the area of the rectangle
    int area = (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1);
    return area;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrix = {
        {1, 0, 0},
        {0, 1, 1},
        {0, 1, 0}
    };
    int result = minAreaRectangleToCoverOnes(matrix);
    std::cout << "Minimum area: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * M)
  - We traverse the entire matrix once to find the boundaries of the rectangle, where \(N\) is the number of rows and \(M\) is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a fixed amount of extra space for storing the boundary indices.
