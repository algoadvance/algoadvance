[Leetcode 3044. Most Frequent Prime](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3044)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, return the most frequently occurring prime number in the array. If there is a tie, return the smallest prime number. If there are no prime numbers in the array, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the size of the input array?
   - The array can have up to 100,000 elements.
   
2. **Element Range**: What are the constraints on the integer values in the array?
   - Elements of the array can range from -10^6 to 10^6, but only positive numbers can be prime.
   
3. **Output**: What should be returned if there are no prime numbers in the array?
   - The function should return -1 if there are no prime numbers in the array.

### Strategy
1. **Prime Number Generation**: 
   - Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a list of prime numbers up to the maximum possible value in the array. This will allow quick prime checks.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - Use a map to count the frequency of each prime number found in the array.

3. **Result Extraction**:
   - Iterate through the frequency map to find the most frequent prime number. If there's a tie, choose the smallest one.

### Code
Here's a C++ implementation of the plan:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to implement Sieve of Eratosthenes
vector<bool> sieveOfEratosthenes(int maxVal) {
    vector<bool> isPrime(maxVal + 1, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

    for (int p = 2; p * p <= maxVal; ++p) {
        if (isPrime[p]) {
            for (int i = p * p; i <= maxVal; i += p) {
                isPrime[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return isPrime;
}

int mostFrequentPrime(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Define the maximum possible value we need primes for
    int maxVal = 1'000'000;
    
    // Generate primes up to maxVal using Sieve of Eratosthenes
    vector<bool> isPrime = sieveOfEratosthenes(maxVal);

    // Map to store the frequency of prime numbers
    unordered_map<int, int> primeFrequency;
    
    // Count occurrences of primes in the array
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 1 && isPrime[num]) {
            primeFrequency[num]++;
        }
    }

    if (primeFrequency.empty()) return -1;

    // Determine the most frequent prime (with tie-breaking to the smallest number)
    int mostFreqPrime = -1;
    int highestFrequency = 0;
    
    for (const auto& entry : primeFrequency) {
        if (entry.second > highestFrequency || (entry.second == highestFrequency && entry.first < mostFreqPrime)) {
            highestFrequency = entry.second;
            mostFreqPrime = entry.first;
        }
    }
    
    return mostFreqPrime;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3, 7, 11, 11, 11};

    int result = mostFrequentPrime(nums);
    cout << "The most frequent prime is: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: \(O(n \log \log n)\) where \(n\) is the largest number in the range.
2. **Frequency Counting**: \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of elements in the array.
3. **Result Extraction**: \(O(p)\) where \(p\) is the number of distinct primes in the array.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the Sieve of Eratosthenes: \(O(n \log \log n) + O(m)\). Given the constraints, this should work efficiently.
