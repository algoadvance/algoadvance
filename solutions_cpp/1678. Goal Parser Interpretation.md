[Leetcode 1678. Goal Parser Interpretation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1678)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `command` that consists of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The goal is to interpret this string where:

- "G" is interpreted as the string "G".
- "()" is interpreted as the string "o".
- "(al)" is interpreted as the string "al".

Return the interpreted string.

### Example 1:
```
Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: command = "G()()()()(al)"
Output: "Gooooal"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: command = "(al)G(al)()()G"
Output: "alGalooG"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum length of the `command` string?**
   - The constraints specify that the length of the command string will be between `1` and `100`.

2. **Are there any invalid cases (e.g., strings that do not conform to the given patterns) we need to handle?**
   - The constraint ensures the command string is always valid according to the provided patterns, so no need to handle invalid cases.

3. **Is the solution case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, based on the examples, it is case-sensitive.

## Strategy
1. We will iterate through the `command` string.
2. Whenever we encounter a 'G', we append 'G' to the result.
3. If we encounter '()', we append 'o' to the result.
4. If we encounter '(al)', we append 'al' to the result.
5. We skip the appropriate number of characters after recognizing '()', or '(al)' to avoid reprocessing.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the command string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the result string, in the worst case, it can be equal to the length of the input string.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string interpret(std::string command) {
        std::string result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < command.length(); ++i) {
            if (command[i] == 'G') {
                result += 'G';
            } else if (command[i] == '(' && command[i + 1] == ')') {
                result += 'o';
                i++; // Skip the next character
            } else if (command[i] == '(' && command[i + 1] == 'a') {
                result += "al";
                i += 3; // Skip the next three characters, i.e., "al)"
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::string command1 = "G()(al)";
    std::string command2 = "G()()()()(al)";
    std::string command3 = "(al)G(al)()()G";
    
    std::cout << solution.interpret(command1) << std::endl; // Output: "Goal"
    std::cout << solution.interpret(command2) << std::endl; // Output: "Gooooal"
    std::cout << solution.interpret(command3) << std::endl; // Output: "alGalooG"
    
    return 0;
}
```
This solution efficiently parses and translates the given command string while maintaining a linear time complexity.
