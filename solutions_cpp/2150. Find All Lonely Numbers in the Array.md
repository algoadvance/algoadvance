[Leetcode 2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2150)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is considered lonely if it appears only once in the array and no adjacent numbers (`x - 1` and `x + 1`) appear in the array.

Return all lonely numbers in `nums`. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10, 8]
Explanation:
- 10 is a lonely number since it does not appear in nums or nums - 1 or nums + 1.
- 6 is not a lonely number since 5 appears in nums.
- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums.
- 8 is a lonely number since neither 7 nor 9 appear in nums.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**
   - What is the range of numbers in the array?
   - What is the maximum length of the array?
   
2. **Output Specification**
   - Can the result array be in any order?

Assuming the constraints based on typical competitive programming problems:
- The elements in the array are `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.
- The length of the array is `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

## Strategy

1. **Count Elements**:
   - Use a hash map to count the occurrence of each number in the array.

2. **Identify Lonely Numbers**:
   - Iterate through the unique elements and check if the number occurs only once.
   - Also check if the adjacent numbers (`num - 1` and `num + 1`) do not exist in the hash map.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<int> findLonely(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
    
    // Step 1: Count frequency of each number
    for (int num : nums) {
        countMap[num]++;
    }
    
    vector<int> lonelyNumbers;
    
    // Step 2: Identify lonely numbers
    for (auto& [num, count] : countMap) {
        if (count == 1 && countMap.find(num - 1) == countMap.end() && countMap.find(num + 1) == countMap.end()) {
            lonelyNumbers.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    return lonelyNumbers;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Count Map**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We iterate through the array to count the frequency of each number.
- **Identifying Lonely Numbers**: O(m), where `m` is the number of unique elements in the count map. Since each insertion and lookup in the hash map is O(1), it results in an O(m) check.
- Overall: O(n), since `m <= n`.

This approach should be efficient given the constraints. The primary time complexity comes from the number of elements in the array, making it linear in respect to the array length.
