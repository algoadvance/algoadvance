[Leetcode 1830. Minimum Number of Operations to Make String Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1830)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` (consisting of lowercase English letters) and your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string sorted in non-decreasing order. In each operation, you can select any one index of the string and move it to the beginning of the string.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to transform the string into its sorted version using the minimum number of specified operations. 

### Steps to form a strategy:

1. **Identify Required Ends:** Since the final target is the sorted string, we can keep comparing the given string to its sorted version.
  
2. **Operations Planning:** We employ a greedy approach:
    - Starting from the beginning, we try to move the smallest character to the front if it's not already in place.
    - To minimize the extra operations, each character should be moved only if it improves the alignment towards the sorted string.

3. **Implementation Outline:**
    - Sort string `s` to get `sorted_s`.
    - Initialize operations counter to 0.
    - For each mismatch between the current character of `s` and `sorted_s`, move character in `s` to the front.
  
4. **Tracking Minimum Operations:**
    - Utilize a map or frequency array to track each character's occurrence to quickly identify the position without repeatedly scanning.

### Code Implementation

Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minOperationsToSortString(const string& s) {
    // We copy and sort the original string to get the target sorted string
    string sorted_s = s;
    sort(sorted_s.begin(), sorted_s.end());

    // Vector to mark characters' positions in the sorted string
    vector<int> positions(26, 0);
    // Calculate positions for each char in sorted string
    for (char c: sorted_s) {
        positions[c - 'a']++;
    }

    // Final position adjustment vector to calculate minimum operations
    vector<int> freq(26, 0);
    int num_ops = 0;

    for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (char c = s[i] - 1; c >= 'a'; --c) {
            num_ops += freq[c - 'a'];
        }
        freq[s[i] - 'a']++;
    }

    return num_ops;
}

int main() {
    string s = "cba";
    cout << "Minimum number of operations to sort the string: " << minOperationsToSortString(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

- **Input Constraints**: How large can the string be?
- **Character Range**: Are we only dealing with lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z')?
- **Multiple Operations**: Confirm that multiple operations can be performed on the same index if needed.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step:** Sorting the string takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Processing:** Each character is processed and moved which in the worst case involves \(O(n)\) operations, making the overall complexity \(O(n^2)\).

Thus, the solution is efficient for moderate-sized strings typical in competitive programming contexts.
