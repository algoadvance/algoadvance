[Leetcode 948. Bag of Tokens](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l948)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `tokens` where `tokens[i]` represents the value of the ith token and an integer `P` representing your initial power.

```
If your current power is at least tokens[i], you can play the ith token face up, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 point.

If your current score is at least 1, you can play the ith token face down, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 point.

Each token can be played at most once and in any order. You want to maximize your total score by possibly playing some tokens in your collection.

Return the largest possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
```

Example:
```
Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `tokens` be empty?**
   - Yes, in such a case the output should be `0`.
2. **Are all elements of `tokens` positive integers?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, all token values are positive integers.
3. **Can the initial power `P` be zero or negative?**
   - No, as per the problem, P is a positive integer.

### Strategy

- Sort the tokens array.
- Use a two-pointer technique to interact with the smallest and largest tokens.
- Initialize two pointers:
  - `left` starting at the beginning (0)
  - `right` starting at the end (tokens.size()-1)
- Initialize a `score` to `0` and a `maxScore` to keep track of the highest score achieved.
- Execute a loop where:
  - If the current `power` is at least `tokens[left]`, play the token at `left` face-up to gain a point and lose `tokens[left]` power, then increment the `left` pointer.
  - If the current `power` is less and `score` is at least `1`, play the token at `right` face-down to gain `tokens[right]` power and lose 1 point, then decrement the `right` pointer.
  - Stop if neither action can be taken.
- Update `maxScore` after every face-up play to ensure we are capturing the highest score achieved in any state.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int P) {
        sort(tokens.begin(), tokens.end());
        int left = 0, right = tokens.size() - 1;
        int score = 0, maxScore = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            if (P >= tokens[left]) {
                P -= tokens[left++];
                score++;
                maxScore = max(maxScore, score);
            } else if (score >= 1) {
                P += tokens[right--];
                score--;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting of the tokens array will take \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of tokens.
- **Two-pointer processing**: The while loop involves a single pass through the tokens array, which is \( O(n) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

Hope this helps in solving the problem effectively!
