[Leetcode 2433. Find The Original Array of Prefix Xor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2433)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `prefix` of size `n` where `prefix[i]` is the result of `prefix[i-1]` XOR `arr[i]` (where `arr` is the original array) with
`prefix[0] = arr[0]`.

Return the original array `arr`. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - Typically, constraints like `1 <= n <= 10^5` should be expected, but let's assume it's within a reasonable bound for typical competitive programming (e.g., up to `10^5`).

2. **What are the constraints on the values inside the array?**
   - Values are usually within standard integer bounds, i.e., `0 <= prefix[i] <= 10^9`.

3. **Is the prefix array always valid and consistent?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that the given `prefix` array is derived correctly.

## Strategy

1. The given `prefix` array is constructed such that:
   - `prefix[0] = arr[0]`
   - `prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] ^ arr[i]` for `i > 0`

2. To find `arr[i]`:
   - Rearrange the equation to get `arr[i] = prefix[i] ^ prefix[i-1]`
   - For `i = 0`, `arr[0] = prefix[0]`

3. Iterate over the prefix array to build the original array using the relationships above.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> findArray(std::vector<int>& prefix) {
    int n = prefix.size();
    std::vector<int> arr(n);
    
    // The first element of arr is the same as the first element of prefix
    arr[0] = prefix[0];

    // Use the recursive relationship to determine each arr[i]
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        arr[i] = prefix[i] ^ prefix[i-1];
    }
    
    return arr;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the prefix array. We traverse the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the original array.

This solution is efficient and expected to work within the problem's constraints. The XOR operations are constant time, making this approach linear with respect to the size of the input array.
