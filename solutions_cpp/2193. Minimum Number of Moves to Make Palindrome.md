[Leetcode 2193. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2193)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are allowed to perform the following operations any number of times:

1. Move any character in `s` to any position in `s`.

Return the **minimum number of moves** needed to make `s` a palindrome.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
   - Can `s` contain both uppercase and lowercase characters, and if so, are they distinct?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output be an integer representing the minimum number of moves?

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can move 'a' from the front to the back and 'b' from the back to the front.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "letelt"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can move 'l' from the middle to the back and 't' from the back to the front.
```

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Identify the Two-Pointer Technique**:
    - Use two pointers (left and right) to traverse the string from both ends toward the center.
    - Check characters at both pointers and determine if they are the same.

2. **Move Operations**:
    - If the characters at the two pointers are the same, move both pointers inward.
    - If not, determine the minimum moves required either by shifting/moving one of the characters towards the other end to make a match.

3. **Tracking Moves**:
    - Use a count variable to keep track of the number of moves performed.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is expected to be O(n^2) in the worst case due to the nested operations performed during character swaps/moves.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>  // For std::swap

using namespace std;

int minMovesToMakePalindrome(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    int moves = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] == s[right]) {
            left++;
            right--;
        } else {
            int l = left, r = right;
            
            while (l < r && s[l] !== s[right]) l++;
            while (r > l && s[r] !== s[left]) r--;
            
            if (l == right) {
                std::swap(s[right], s[right - 1]);
                moves++;
            } else if (r == left) {
                std::swap(s[left], s[left + 1]);
                moves++;
            } else {
                std::swap(s[l], s[right]);
                moves++;
            }
        }
    }
    return moves;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    cout << minMovesToMakePalindrome(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize pointers `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the string.
2. Traverse inward while comparing the characters at `left` and `right`:
    - If characters match, simply move both pointers inward.
    - If they do not match, find the nearest matching character by moving either the left pointer outward or the right pointer inward.
    - Perform a swap and increment the move count.
3. Repeat until both pointers meet in the middle.
4. Return the total number of moves required.

By following this approach, we ensure that the string is restructured efficiently to form a palindrome while minimizing the number of character moves.
