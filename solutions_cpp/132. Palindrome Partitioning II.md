[Leetcode 132. Palindrome Partitioning II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l132)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`? 
   - Can `s` contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return just the minimum number of cuts, or do we need to return the actual palindrome substrings as well?

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we would utilize dynamic programming. Here are the main steps:

1. **Precompute Palindromic Substrings:**
   - Use a 2D DP array `isPalindrome` where `isPalindrome[i][j]` is `true` if the substring `s[i...j]` is a palindrome.

2. **Minimizing Cuts:**
   - Use another DP array `minCuts` where `minCuts[i]` represents the minimum cuts needed to partition the substring `s[0...i]`.

3. **Combining both DP arrays:**
   - Iterate over the string and update the `minCuts` array using the precomputed `isPalindrome` array to determine the smallest possible cuts for each substring.

### Code
Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minCut(std::string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Step 1: Precompute palindromes
        std::vector<std::vector<bool>> isPalindrome(n, std::vector<bool>(n, false));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            isPalindrome[i][i] = true;
        }
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i + length <= n; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    if (length == 2) {
                        isPalindrome[i][j] = true;
                    } else {
                        isPalindrome[i][j] = isPalindrome[i + 1][j - 1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Compute minimum cuts
        std::vector<int> minCuts(n, INT_MAX);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (isPalindrome[0][i]) {
                minCuts[i] = 0;
            } else {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                    if (isPalindrome[j + 1][i]) {
                        minCuts[i] = std::min(minCuts[i], minCuts[j] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minCuts[n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Precomputing Palindromic Substrings:**
   - Filling the `isPalindrome` table involves checking each substring, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Computing Minimum Cuts:**
   - Filling the `minCuts` array involves nested loops, similar to above, leading to another \(O(n^2)\) complexity.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\), which is efficient for reasonably large input sizes within typical constraints.
