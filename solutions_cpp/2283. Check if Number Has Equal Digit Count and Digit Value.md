[Leetcode 2283. Check if Number Has Equal Digit Count and Digit Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2283)
### Problem Statement

The problem is as follows:

You are given a string `num` consisting of digits. Return `true` if for every digit `d` in the string `num`, the digit `d` appears `d` times in the string. Otherwise, return `false`.

For example, given the string `"1210"`, the number `1` in the `0`th index of the string appears `1` time(s) in the string, the number `2` in the `1`st index appears `2` time(s) in the string, the number `1` in the `2`nd index appears `1` time(s) in the string, and the number `0` in the `3`rd index appears `0` time(s) in the string. Since the counts align with the values, the output should be `true` for `"1210"`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the input string (length, characters)?**
   - The string will only contain digits and will have a length between 1 and 10 inclusive.

2. **Should we consider leading zeros or other invalid digit scenarios?**
   - The string will be a valid digit string as per the usual constraints of the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Create an array of size 10 (for digits 0 through 9) to keep count of how many times each digit appears in the string.
2. **Count Digits**: Iterate over the input string and update the counter for each digit.
3. **Check Conditions**: Iterate over the string again and check if the digit `d` at position `i` appears exactly `d` times in the string.
4. **Return the Result**: If all conditions are satisfied, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool digitCount(std::string num) {
    std::vector<int> count(10, 0); // Array to count occurrences of each digit
    
    // Count occurrences of each digit
    for (char c : num) {
        count[c - '0']++;
    }
    
    // Check if the digit count matches the expected value
    for (int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++) {
        int digit = num[i] - '0';
        if (count[i] != digit) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string num = "1210";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << digitCount(num) << std::endl; // Output: true
    
    num = "030";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << digitCount(num) << std::endl; // Output: false
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Digits**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we iterate over the string to populate the `count` array.
- **Validating Counts**: O(n), as we iterate over the string again to validate the counts.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a fixed-size array (of size 10) regardless of the input size.
