[Leetcode 2603. Collect Coins in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2603)
## Problem Statement

Given an undirected tree (a connected acyclic graph) with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each vertex has a certain number of coins associated with it. You need to collect all the coins in the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can move from one vertex to an adjacent vertex and pick up all coins there. The goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to collect all the coins.

### Example

**Input:**
- `edges`: A list of lists where each sublist `[u, v]` represents an edge between vertices `u` and `v`.
- `coins`: A list where `coins[i]` is the number of coins at vertex `i`.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the minimum number of moves required to collect all the coins.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], coins = [1,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation:
1. Move from vertex 0 to vertex 1 and pick up 2 coins.
2. Move from vertex 1 to vertex 2 and pick up 3 coins.
Total moves required: 1 + 1 = 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume that the input tree contains at least one vertex?
2. Is it guaranteed that the input graph is connected and acyclic?
3. Are there any constraints on the values within the `coins` array or the vertex count `n`?

## Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal**: We will use a DFS to traverse the tree.
2. **Tracking Moves**: Maintain a count of moves required to collect coins.
3. **Conditional Moves**: Only move to a vertex if there are coins to collect either at that vertex or downstream.

### Steps:
1. Construct an adjacency list from the given edges.
2. Use a DFS to collect coins, returning the number of moves required to collect all downstream coins.
3. For each vertex, skip moving if there are no coins downstream and at the current vertex.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int collectCoins(vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& coins) {
        int n = coins.size();
        // Step 1: Create an adjacency list
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adjList;
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adjList[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adjList[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        // Step 2: DFS to calculate the mini movements
        return dfs(0, -1, adjList, coins).second;
    }
    
private:
    // A pair of (coins collected, moves required)
    pair<int, int> dfs(int node, int parent, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& adjList, vector<int>& coins) {
        int coinsCollected = coins[node];
        int moves = 0;
        
        for (int neighbor : adjList[node]) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                auto [subCoins, subMoves] = dfs(neighbor, node, adjList, coins);
                if (subCoins > 0) {
                    moves += subMoves + 2;
                    coinsCollected += subCoins;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return {coinsCollected, moves};
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree. This is because we traverse each vertex exactly once using DFS.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also `O(n)` because of the space used for the adjacency list and the recursion stack during the DFS.
