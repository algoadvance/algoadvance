[Leetcode 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1145)
### Problem Statement

The problem is from LeetCode, titled "1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game".

#### Description:

Two players play a turn-based game on a binary tree. Initially, the first player names a value `x` with 1 <= x <= n. The second player can then choose one of the following moves:
1. Choose a node in the subtree of node `x`.
2. Choose a node in the subtree of `x`â€™s parent.

In each move, a player can "color" that node. However, once a node is colored, neither player can color it again. 

The players continue coloring alternately and the game ends when all possible nodes have been colored. The player who has colored more nodes when the game ends is the winner.

You need to return `true` if the second player can win, otherwise return `false`.

#### Input:
- A binary tree root
- The number of nodes `n`
- An integer `x` representing the initial node named by the first player

#### Output:
- A boolean indicating whether the second player can win

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are all nodes unique?
   - Yes.
2. Will the tree always be non-empty?
   - Yes.
3. Can `x` be the root or a leaf node?
   - Yes, `x` can be any valid node within the tree from 1 to `n`.

### Strategy

The idea is to assess the potential choices for the second player:
1. We need to calculate the sizes of the subtrees rooted at the left and right child of node `x` and the size of the "parent" subtree which is outside the subtree rooted at node `x`.
2. The second player has a winning strategy if any of these subtree sizes (left, right, or parent) is more than half of the total nodes `n`.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode* root, int n, int x) {
        // Placeholder variables to store sizes of subtrees
        int leftSubtreeSize = 0, rightSubtreeSize = 0;
        
        // DFS traversal to calculate subtree sizes
        std::function<int(TreeNode*)> dfs = [&](TreeNode* node) -> int {
            if (!node) return 0;
            int left = dfs(node->left);
            int right = dfs(node->right);
            if (node->val == x) {
                leftSubtreeSize = left;
                rightSubtreeSize = right;
            }
            return left + right + 1;
        };
        
        int totalSize = dfs(root);
        
        // Size of nodes outside the subtree rooted at `x`
        int parentSubtreeSize = totalSize - (leftSubtreeSize + rightSubtreeSize + 1);
        
        // Second player wins if they can choose a subtree larger than half of `n`
        return max({leftSubtreeSize, rightSubtreeSize, parentSubtreeSize}) > n / 2;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    Solution solution;
    int n = 7;
    int x = 3;
 
    bool canSecondPlayerWin = solution.btreeGameWinningMove(root, n, x);
    std::cout << (canSecondPlayerWin ? "Second player can win!" : "Second player cannot win.") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. The DFS traversal for calculating subtree sizes takes \( O(n) \) time, where \( n \) is the total number of nodes in the tree.
2. All other operations (comparisons and arithmetic) are \( O(1) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n) \).

This solution is efficient and ensures that we are accounting for all possible moves the second player can make, providing a correct outcome regarding their potential to win.
