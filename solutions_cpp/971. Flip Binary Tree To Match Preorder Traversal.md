[Leetcode 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l971)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely assigned a value from `1` to `n`. You are also given a sequence of `n` values called `voyage`, which represents the desired pre-order traversal of the binary tree. 

You are required to flip the nodes in the binary tree such that the tree matches the desired pre-order traversal specified by `voyage`. A flip involves swapping the left and right subtree of a node. 

Return a list of the values of all nodes flipped in order to make the tree match the pre-order traversal. If it is not possible to obtain the desired pre-order traversal, return the list `[-1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a flip in this problem?**
   - A flip means swapping the left and right children of a node.
   
2. **Can the voyage contain repeated elements?**
   - No, since the problem statement mentions that each node value is unique and represents unique values from `1` to `n`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the binary tree depth and breadth?**
   - The tree can have any structure but has `n` uniquely assigned nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Pre-order Traversal**:
    - Preorder traversal is a form of depth-first traversal where we visit nodes in the following order: `root -> left -> right`.

2. **Match Voyage**:
    - Traverse the tree using a recursive approach following the pre-order method. We will simultaneously traverse the `voyage` array.
    - At each node, ensure the current node matches the current index of `voyage`.
    - If the left child exists and does not match the next value in `voyage`, flip the left and right subtrees and note the flip.
    
3. **Recursion**:
    - Base Case: If the root is `nullptr`, then it matches the voyage trivially.
    - Recursive Steps: Ensure current node value matches the current voyage value. If not, return false. If children do not match voyage, flip and continue.

4. **Edge Case**:
    - If at any point the tree structure makes matching voyage impossible, immediately return `[-1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> flipMatchVoyage(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& voyage) {
        vector<int> res;
        int i = 0;
        if (dfs(root, voyage, i, res)) return res;
        return {-1};
    }

private:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* node, vector<int>& voyage, int& i, vector<int>& res) {
        if (!node) return true;
        if (node->val != voyage[i++]) return false;
        
        if (node->left && node->left->val != voyage[i]) {
            res.push_back(node->val);
            return dfs(node->right, voyage, i, res) && dfs(node->left, voyage, i, res);
        }
        return dfs(node->left, voyage, i, res) && dfs(node->right, voyage, i, res);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the recursive pre-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, due to the recursion stack in the worst case (e.g., a completely skewed tree).

This approach ensures that we follow the desired pre-order traversal, flipping nodes as needed and confirming the possibility of attaining the given order. If not possible at any node, we return `[-1]`.
