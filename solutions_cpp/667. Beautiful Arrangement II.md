[Leetcode 667. Beautiful Arrangement II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l667)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and **exactly** `k` different integers exist such that there are exactly `k` distinct absolute differences between consecutive elements of the list.

Return the list. If there are multiple valid lists, you can return any of them.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `n` be less than `0`?
   - No, `n` is a positive integer by the constraints.
2. What are the ranges for `n` and `k`?
   - Typically, in such problems, `n` can be quite large (up to 10,000). `k` is such that `1 <= k < n`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    int low = 1, high = n;
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            result.push_back(low++);
        } else {
            result.push_back(high--);
        }
    }
    if (k % 2 == 0) {
        for (int i = high; i >= low; --i) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    } else {
        for (int i = low; i <= high; ++i) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10, k = 4;
    std::vector<int> result = constructArray(n, k);
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Begin with two pointers: `low = 1` and `high = n`.
   - This approach interleaves the smallest and the largest remaining numbers.

2. **First Part (Handling k unique differences)**:
   - For the first `k+1` elements, alternate between picking the smallest available number (`low`) and the largest available number (`high`). This guarantees that we achieve `k` unique differences.

3. **Second Part (Filling the remaining n - k - 1 elements)**:
   - Depending on whether `k` is odd or even, fill the remaining part of the array:
       - If `k` is odd, continue with the numbers in the increasing order.
       - If `k` is even, continue with the numbers in the decreasing order.

This strategy ensures that exactly `k` unique differences are achieved because the alternating selections in the first part create diverse gaps that cannot repeat within the initial `k+1` numbers.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The construction of the array involves linear operations of pushing items into the result vector.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The space required is linear with respect to `n`, as we store all `n` elements in the result vector.
