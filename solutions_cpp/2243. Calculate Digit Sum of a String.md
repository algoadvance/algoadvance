[Leetcode 2243. Calculate Digit Sum of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2243)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits and an integer `k`. You need to transform the string into a new string according to the following process:
1. Divide the string `s` into groups of size `k`.
2. If the size of the last group is less than `k`, this is fine and you should proceed with summing the digits in the current groups to form a new string.
3. Replace each group of `s` with the sum of the digits in the respective group.
4. Repeat the process until the resultant string's length is less than or equal to `k`.

Return the final string as the output.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - This will help in understanding if we need to handle very large strings.
   
2. **What should be done if `s` is already of length less than or equal to `k`?**
   - It appears that we return `s` without any changes.
   
3. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the string `s`?**
   - The problem specifies that `s` consists of digits only.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to calculate the digit sum of a string
std::string digitSum(std::string s, int k) {
    while (s.length() > k) {
        std::string new_s = "";
        for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length(); i += k) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (size_t j = i; j < i + k && j < s.length(); ++j) {
                sum += s[j] - '0';  // Convert char digit to integer and add to sum
            }
            new_s += std::to_string(sum);  // Append the sum to the new string
        }
        s = new_s;
    }
    return s;
}

// Testing the function
int main() {
    std::string s = "1111122222";
    int k = 3;
    std::string result = digitSum(s, k);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Iterative Reduction**:
   - Continuously reduce the length of the string by summing digits of segments of size `k`.
   - Iterate until the length of the resultant string becomes less than or equal to `k`.
   
2. **String Processing**:
   - Use slices of size `k` to compute the sum for each segment.
   - Convert the sum back to a string and append to the new resultant string.
   
3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the string length is already less than or equal to `k`, return the string as is.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n\*log(n/k))**:
- The outer loop runs log(n/k) times because each iteration reduces the length of the string roughly by a factor of `k`.
- Inside the loop, we process each character once, leading to O(n) per complete pass of string summing.

Here, `n` is the length of the initial string `s`.

This ensures that the solution should work efficiently even for moderately large strings.
