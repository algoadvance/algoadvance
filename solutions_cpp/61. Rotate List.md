[Leetcode 61. Rotate List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l61)
## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

**Example:**

Given the linked list: `1->2->3->4->5->NULL` and `k = 2`,  
Return: `4->5->1->2->3->NULL`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should I return if the list is empty or has only one node?**
   - If the list is empty (`head == NULL`) or has only one node (`head->next == NULL`), return the head as it is.

2. **What if `k` is greater than the length of the list?**
   - We can use `k % length` to rotate because rotating by the length of the list results in the same list.

3. **What kind of elements does the list contain?**
   - The elements are integers.

4. **Do I need to handle any special cases, such as negative values of `k`?**
   - No, `k` is always given as a non-negative integer.

## Strategy

1. **Determine the length of the list.**
   - Traverse the list to obtain its length. While traversing, connect the last node to the head, forming a circular list.

2. **Calculate the effective number of rotations.**
   - Use `k % length` to determine the number of rotations needed.

3. **Identify the new tail and the new head of the rotated list.**
   - The new tail will be at position `(length - k % length - 1)` and the new head will be the node immediately after the new tail.

4. **Break the list at the new tail and set the new head.**
   - Adjust the pointers to complete the rotation and break the circular connection.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode* next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* rotateRight(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if (!head || !head->next || k == 0) return head;

        // Calculate the length of the list
        ListNode* current = head;
        int length = 1; // start from 1 because we are already at head
        while (current->next) {
            current = current->next;
            length++;
        }
        
        // Connect the last node to the head, forming a circular list
        current->next = head;
        
        // Find the point to break the circle at (new tail)
        k = k % length;
        int stepsToNewHead = length - k;
        
        current = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < stepsToNewHead; ++i) {
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        // `current` is now pointing to the new tail
        ListNode* newHead = current->next;
        current->next = nullptr; // Break the circular list
        
        return newHead;
    }
};

// Helper function to print list (for debugging purposes)
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head) {
        std::cout << head->val << " -> ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    std::cout << "NULL" << std::endl;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(N)**:
  - Calculating the length of the list takes O(N).
  - Making the list circular and breaking it takes O(N) in total.

- **Overall**: The algorithm processes the list a constant number of times (2-3 full traversals), so it runs in linear time relative to the size of the list.
