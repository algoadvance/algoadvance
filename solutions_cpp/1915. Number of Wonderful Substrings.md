[Leetcode 1915. Number of Wonderful Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1915)
### Problem Statement

A **wonderful** substring is defined as a substring where there is at most one character with an odd frequency.

Given a string `word` (which consists of lower-case English letters), your task is to count the number of wonderful substrings in `word`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string `word`? (Let's assume up to 100,000 for time complexity considerations.)
   - Do we always have at least one character in the `word`? (Yes)
   
2. **Output**:
   - The function should return an integer representing the number of wonderful substrings.
   
3. **Characters**:
   - The string only contains lower-case English letters (`a` to `z`).

### Strategy

We'll use a **bitmask** to effectively count characters with odd frequencies. Specifically, we'll maintain a `bitmask` where the `i-th` bit is set if the count of character `i + 'a'` is odd.

Steps:
1. Initialize a map to store the frequency of each bitmask encountered.
2. Traverse the string while calculating the current bitmask.
3. For each character, toggle its corresponding bit in the bitmask.
4. Check how many times the same bitmask has been seen before, because if the same bitmask has been seen before, the substring between two occurrences of this bitmask is a wonderful substring.
5. Also, there should be a check to count for substrings where at most one bit is different (one character with odd frequency).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long wonderfulSubstrings(string word) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        freq[0] = 1;  // Initial bitmask before any characters
        int current_mask = 0;
        long long result = 0;
        
        for (char c : word) {
            current_mask ^= 1 << (c - 'a');
            
            // Count exact matches
            if (freq.find(current_mask) != freq.end()) {
                result += freq[current_mask];
            }
            
            // Count matches with one bit difference
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
                int mask_with_one_bit_diff = current_mask ^ (1 << i);
                if (freq.find(mask_with_one_bit_diff) != freq.end()) {
                    result += freq[mask_with_one_bit_diff];
                }
            }
            
            // Record the current bitmask
            freq[current_mask]++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n * k), where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( k \) is constant (10 here, because there are 10 possible bits). This simplifies to O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.
- **Space complexity**: O(2^k), which simplifies to O(1) because \( k \) (the number of possible bit masks) is fixed and small (2^10), resulting in a bounded size.

This ensures the solution is efficient and suitable for large input sizes.
