[Leetcode 2596. Check Knight Tour Configuration](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2596)
### Problem Statement:
A knight’s tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. Given an `n x n` grid representing the order of cells being visited by a knight, return `true` if the grid represents a knight’s tour sequence or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input constraints?**
   - `1 <= n <= 100`.
   - The grid will contain all numbers from 0 to n^2 - 1 exactly once.
   
2. **Expected output?**
   - A boolean `true` or `false`.

3. **Grid characteristics?**
   - Each cell in the grid contains a unique integer representing the step in the tour.

### Strategy:
1. **Define Knight Moves**:
   - A knight in chess moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular.

2. **Validate Tour Sequence**:
   - Iterate through the grid based on the sequence numbers (from 0 to n^2 - 1) and verify that each move from one number to the next (i to i+1) corresponds to a valid knight move.

3. **Check Adjacent Positions**:
   - For any current position `(x, y)` on the board, check the possible valid knight moves to find the cell containing the next sequence number.

4. **Return Result**:
   - If all sequence numbers follow valid knight moves, return `true`; otherwise, `false`.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkValidGrid(const vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {
            { 2,  1}, { 2, -1}, {-2,  1}, {-2, -1},
            { 1,  2}, { 1, -2}, {-1,  2}, {-1, -2}
        };

        // Find position of all sequence numbers
        vector<pair<int, int>> pos(n*n);
        for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < n; ++c) {
                pos[grid[r][c]] = {r, c};
            }
        }

        // Validate knight's tour by checking valid knight moves
        for (int i = 0; i < n*n - 1; ++i) {
            int cur_x = pos[i].first, cur_y = pos[i].second;
            int next_x = pos[i + 1].first, next_y = pos[i + 1].second;

            bool valid_move = false;
            for (const auto& dir : directions) {
                int new_x = cur_x + dir.first;
                int new_y = cur_y + dir.second;
                if (new_x == next_x && new_y == next_y) {
                    valid_move = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!valid_move) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: Because we iterate over every cell once to record positions and then again to validate knight moves, which involves each cell's neighbors (constant time due to fixed possible knight moves).

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Record the position (row and column) of each number from 0 to n^2 - 1.
2. **Validate Moves**:
   - For each number `i` from 0 to n^2 - 2, verify that the move to `i+1` is a valid knight's move. Check all 8 possible directions.
3. **Return**:
   - If all moves are valid knight moves, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

This ensures that the given grid forms a valid knight's tour sequence.
