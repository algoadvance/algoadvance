[Leetcode 1160. Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1160)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`. A string is *good* if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can be used only once). Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

### Example:
```text
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" which has a length of 3+3=6.
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can characters be reused for different words?**
   - Yes, the characters in `chars` can be reused for different words, but within a single word, a character from `chars` can only be used as many times as it appears in `chars`.

2. **What should be done for an empty `words` array or `chars` string?**
   - If `words` is empty, return 0. If `chars` is empty, no word can be formed, so return 0 as well.

3. **Are all characters lowercase English letters (`a-z`) only?**
   - Yes, the problem statement ensures that all characters are lowercase English letters.

### Strategy:

1. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - First, we will count the frequency of each character in `chars` using an array or unordered_map.
   
2. **Check Each Word**:
   - For each word in `words`, we will create a frequency count, and check if it can be formed using characters in `chars`.
   
3. **Sum Lengths**:
   - If a word can be formed, add its length to the sum.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int countCharacters(vector<string>& words, string chars) {
    // Create a frequency count for chars
    unordered_map<char, int> charsCount;
    for (char ch : chars) {
        charsCount[ch]++;
    }

    int totalLength = 0;
    
    for (const string& word : words) {
        // Create a frequency count for the current word
        unordered_map<char, int> wordCount;
        for (char ch : word) {
            wordCount[ch]++;
        }

        // Check if the word can be formed by chars
        bool canBeFormed = true;
        for (const auto& pair : wordCount) {
            char ch = pair.first;
            int freq = pair.second;
            if (charsCount[ch] < freq) {
                canBeFormed = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        // If the word can be formed, add its length to totalLength
        if (canBeFormed) {
            totalLength += word.length();
        }
    }

    return totalLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"cat", "bt", "hat", "tree"};
    string chars = "atach";
    cout << "Output: " << countCharacters(words, chars) << endl; // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Counting characters in `chars` takes O(n), where `n` is the length of `chars`.

- **Checking Words**:
  - For each word in `words`, creating the frequency count of the word and checking against `charsCount` takes O(m) time, where `m` is the length of the word.
  - Therefore, for all words, the time complexity is O(W * L), where `W` is the number of words and `L` is the average length of the words.

- **Overall**:
  - The overall time complexity is O(n + W * L).

This solution is efficient for the problem constraints and should work well for typical input sizes.
