[Leetcode 813. Largest Sum of Averages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l813)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `A` and an integer `K`. You can partition the array into at most `K` non-empty adjacent subarrays, and the score of a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray. Determine the largest sum of averages you can achieve.

### Example:

- `Input: A = [9,1,2,3,9], K = 3`
- `Output: 20`

Explanation: 
- The optimal partition is `[9], [1, 2, 3], [9]` with the corresponding averages `9`, `2`, and `9` respectively. Hence, the result is `9 + 2 + 9 = 20`.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= `A.length` <= 100
- 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10000
- 1 <= `K` <= `A.length`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `K` be larger than the length of the array `A`? 
   - No, `K` will always be less than or equal to the length of `A`.
2. Are the integers all positive?
   - Yes, as per the constraint 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10000.
3. Should the result be a floating point number or an integer?
   - The result should be a floating point number as averages might not be integers.

## Strategy
1. Use Dynamic Programming to solve the problem.
2. Define `dp[i][k]` as the maximum sum of averages we can achieve for the first `i` elements with `k` partitions.
3. Compute cumulative sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
4. Transition:
   - If you are at index `i` and making a partition at `j`, the new state can be derived using `dp[j][k-1]` plus the average of subarray `[j+1, i]`.
5. Initialize the cumulated sum array.
6. Fill the dynamic programming table based on transitions.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>
 
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double largestSumOfAverages(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int n = A.size();
        vector<double> prefixSum(n + 1, 0.0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + A[i];
        }

        vector<vector<double>> dp(n + 1, vector<double>(K + 1, 0.0));

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i][1] = prefixSum[i] / i;
        }

        for (int k = 2; k <= K; ++k) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                    dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k], dp[j][k - 1] + (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j]) / (i - j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][K];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2 * K)`, where `n` is the length of array `A`. This results from three nested loops: the outer loop iterates over `K` (partitions), and the two inner loops (one to fix the end of the subarray and one to iterate over possible start points).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * K)`, due to the DP table `dp` and the prefix sum array.

This solution efficiently computes the largest sum of averages by leveraging dynamic programming and prefix sums to reduce redundant calculations.
