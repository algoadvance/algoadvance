[Leetcode 2057. Smallest Index With Equal Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2057)
## Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, return *the smallest index `i` of `nums` such that `i mod 10 == nums[i]`, or -1 if such index does not exist.*

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The array size can be from 1 to \(10^4\).
   
2. **What are the constraints on the values of the elements in the array?**
   - The values of the elements can range from 0 to \(10^9\).

3. **Do we need to handle any special cases like negative values or non-integer inputs?**
   - No, the problem constraints specify non-negative integers.

4. **What should be returned if there are multiple indices satisfying the condition?**
   - We return the smallest index.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: We will initialize the result value to be -1, indicating if we don’t find any index that satisfies the condition.
   
2. **Iterate through the array**: 
   - We will traverse each index and check if the condition `i % 10 == nums[i]` holds true.
   - If it does, we return the index immediately because we are looking for the smallest index.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is empty, though by constraints, it won’t be.
   - If all elements are greater than the index or no index satisfies the condition, return -1.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestEqual(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Iterate over each index
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (i % 10 == nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        // Return -1 if no index satisfies the condition
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the array. We traverse the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because no extra space is used that scales with input size.

This solution efficiently checks each index of the array to find the smallest index that meets the given condition.
