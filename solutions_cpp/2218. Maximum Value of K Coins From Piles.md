[Leetcode 2218. Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2218)
## Problem Statement
You have several **piles** of coins, each pile consisting of a positive integer number of coins of assorted denominations. In one move, you can choose any coin from the top of any pile, remove it, and keep it. You keep the coins in a separate pile.

You will repeatedly make moves until you have kept exactly k coins. Your goal is to maximize the total value of the coins you have kept.

Given a list `piles`, where `piles[i]` is a list of integers denoting the coin values of the \(i\)-th pile, and given an integer `k`, return the maximum possible total value of coins you can keep.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: piles = [[1,100,3],[7,8,9]], k = 2
Output: 101
Explanation:
- In the first move, you will take the top coin from the second pile (9 coins per move), and add its value to your answer.
- In the second move, you will take the top coin from the first pile (91 coins per move), and add its value to your answer.
- Now you have exactly 2 coins, and the total value is 100 + 1 = 101.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= piles.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= piles[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= piles[i][j] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= sum(piles[i].length) for all i`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the coins within each pile ordered in any way (e.g., descending by value)?
   - No, they can be in any order.
2. Can we assume all inputs are valid and within constraints?
   - Yes.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value we can get from the first `i` piles, considering exactly `j` coins.
2. **Build Prefix Sums**: Precompute prefix sums for each pile to quickly get the value of the top `x` coins from any pile.
3. **DP Transition**: For each pile, we consider taking 0 to all coins up to `k` coins at maximum from the current pile and maximize the total value.
4. **Final Result**: After completing the transitions for all piles, the result will be stored in `dp[piles.size()][k]`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxValueOfCoins(vector<vector<int>>& piles, int k) {
        int n = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));

        // For each pile
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            // Prefix sums for the current pile
            vector<int> curr_prefix_sum = piles[i - 1];
            for (int j = 1; j < curr_prefix_sum.size(); ++j) {
                curr_prefix_sum[j] += curr_prefix_sum[j - 1];
            }

            // Update DP table
            for (int coins_taken = 0; coins_taken <= k; ++coins_taken) {
                // If we decide to take 0 coins from this pile
                dp[i][coins_taken] = dp[i - 1][coins_taken];
                for (int x = 1; x <= min(coins_taken, (int)piles[i - 1].size()); ++x) {
                    dp[i][coins_taken] = max(dp[i][coins_taken], dp[i - 1][coins_taken - x] + curr_prefix_sum[x - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Precomputation of Prefix Sums**: \(O(n \times m)\), where \(m\) is the maximum number of coins in any pile.
- **DP Transition**: \(O(n \times k \times m)\) since we are transitioning through all the piles, considering \(k\) coins, and the maximum pile size being \(m\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \times k \times m)\).

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough.
