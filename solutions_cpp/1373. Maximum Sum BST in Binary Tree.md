[Leetcode 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1373)
Sure! Let's break down the problem and approach it step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the tree nodes?**
   - Each node has integer values for `val`, and pointers to left and right children.

2. **What should we return if there are no valid BST sub-trees in the given binary tree?**
   - Return 0 if no BST sub-tree is found.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?**
   - The values can be negative, positive, or zero.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree and check at each node whether the subtree rooted at that node is a BST. If it is, we compute the sum of its nodes and keep track of the maximum sum found so far.

Here's a concise plan:

1. **Helper Function (`postOrderTraverse`):**
   - Traverse the tree in post-order (left, right, then root) to process each node only after processing its children.
   - At each node, determine whether the subtree rooted at this node is a BST:
     - A subtree is a BST if all nodes in the left subtree are less than the current node’s value, and all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the current node’s value.
   - Maintain three key pieces of information for each subtree:
     1. Is the subtree a BST?
     2. The sum of values in the subtree if it is a BST.
     3. The minimum and maximum values in the subtree to validate the BST properties.
   
2. **Combine Results:**
   - While traversing, keep updating the maximum sum when a valid BST subtree is found.

### Code

Here is the complete code to solve this problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumBST(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxSum = 0;
        postOrderTraverse(root, maxSum);
        return maxSum;
    }

private:
    // Structure to hold information about the subtree status
    struct SubtreeData {
        bool isBST;
        int minVal;
        int maxVal;
        int sum;
    };

    SubtreeData postOrderTraverse(TreeNode* node, int &maxSum) {
        if (!node) {
            // An empty tree is a BST with sum 0, minValue as INT_MAX and maxValue as INT_MIN.
            return {true, INT_MAX, INT_MIN, 0};
        }
        
        SubtreeData left = postOrderTraverse(node->left, maxSum);
        SubtreeData right = postOrderTraverse(node->right, maxSum);
        
        // Validate the BST properties
        if (left.isBST && right.isBST && node->val > left.maxVal && node->val < right.minVal) {
            int currentSum = node->val + left.sum + right.sum;
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, currentSum);
            return {true, std::min(node->val, left.minVal), std::max(node->val, right.maxVal), currentSum};
        } else {
            return {false, 0, 0, 0};
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(6);

    Solution sol;
    std::cout << "Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree: " << sol.maxSumBST(root) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves a post-order traversal of the tree, resulting in each node being visited exactly once.
- Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

This strategy and code should help in finding the maximum sum of a BST sub-tree within any binary tree effectively.
