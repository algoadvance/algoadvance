[Leetcode 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l632)
## Problem Statement
You are given `k` lists of sorted integers `nums`. Find the smallest range `[min, max]` that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the input lists all non-empty?
   - **A:** Yes, all lists are guaranteed to be non-empty.
2. **Q:** Can the lists contain negative numbers? 
   - **A:** Yes, the lists can contain negative numbers.
3. **Q:** How are the ranges defined in terms of inclusivity?
   - **A:** The range `[min, max]` is inclusive of both `min` and `max`.

## Strategy
The strategy involves using a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each list:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the smallest elements from each list.
   - Also, track the maximum value in the current range.
   
2. **Processing**:
   - Insert the first element of each list into the min-heap along with the list index and element index.
   - Track the current maximum value among these first elements.
   
3. **Range Calculation**:
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap (this gives the current minimum).
   - Calculate the range using the current minimum and the tracked maximum.
   - If this range is smaller than the previously found ranges, update the result.
   - Push the next element from the same list into the heap.
   - Update the current maximum if required.

4. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm continues until one of the lists gets exhausted, i.e., no more elements can be pushed from one of the lists into the heap.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits.h>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> smallestRange(vector<vector<int>>& nums) {
        auto comp = [&](const tuple<int, int, int>& a, const tuple<int, int, int>& b) {
            return get<0>(a) > get<0>(b); // min-heap based on value
        };
        
        priority_queue<tuple<int, int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, decltype(comp)> minHeap(comp);
        int currentMax = INT_MIN;
        
        // Initialize the heap with the first element of each list
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            minHeap.emplace(nums[i][0], i, 0);
            currentMax = max(currentMax, nums[i][0]);
        }
        
        int rangeStart = 0, rangeEnd = INT_MAX;
        
        while (true) {
            auto [minVal, listIdx, elemIdx] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            // Update the range if it is smaller
            if (currentMax - minVal < rangeEnd - rangeStart) {
                rangeStart = minVal;
                rangeEnd = currentMax;
            }
            
            if (elemIdx + 1 == nums[listIdx].size()) {
                break; // If there is no more element in one of the lists, exit
            }
            
            // Get the next element from the same list
            int nextVal = nums[listIdx][elemIdx + 1];
            minHeap.emplace(nextVal, listIdx, elemIdx + 1);
            
            // Update the current maximum
            if (nextVal > currentMax) {
                currentMax = nextVal;
            }
        }
        
        return {rangeStart, rangeEnd};
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm primarily involves operations on a priority queue where each element is inserted and removed once.
- Let `N` be the total number of elements across all `k` lists.
- The heap operations (insert and extract) take `O(log k)` time, and we perform them `N` times, leading to a time complexity of `O(N log k)`.

This approach effectively finds the smallest range by managing the min-heap and ensuring all lists contribute to the range dynamically.
