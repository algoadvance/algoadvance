[Leetcode 2928. Distribute Candies Among Children I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2928)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `candies` where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies of the `i-th` type you have. You are also given an integer `k` representing the number of children. You need to determine whether it's possible to distribute all candies such that each child gets exactly the same number of candies of each type. If it is possible, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we do if the sum of candies is not divisible by `k`?**
   - If the sum of candies for each type is not divisible by `k`, then it is impossible to distribute them equally, and we should return `false`.
  
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the `candies` array or the values within it?**
   - This problem might assume typical array size and value constraints as found in competitive programming contests, so we'll consider reasonable limits (e.g., 1 ≤ `candies.length` ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ `candies[i]` ≤ 10^7.)

### Strategy
1. **Check Divisibility**:
   - For each candy type, check if the number of candies of that type is divisible by `k`.
   - If any candy type count is not divisible by `k`, return `false`.
2. **Return True if All Types Are Divisible**:
   - If all candy type counts are divisible by `k`, then return `true` because it is possible to distribute the candies equally among the children.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool canDistributeCandies(std::vector<int>& candies, int k) {
        for (int candyCount : candies) {
            if (candyCount % k != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `candies` array. This is because we need to iterate through the entire array to check divisibility for each candy type.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the additional space used is constant and does not depend on the input size.

This solution efficiently checks the divisibility condition for each type of candy, ensuring the problem constraints and requirements are met.
