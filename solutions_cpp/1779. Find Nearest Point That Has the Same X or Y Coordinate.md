[Leetcode 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1779)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid. You are also given an array `points` where each `points[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents that a point exists at `(a_i, b_i)` on the grid. A point is valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return the index (0-based) of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple, return the smallest index. If there are no valid points, return -1.

The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the points array be empty?**
   - Yes, it's possible for the points array to be empty.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the coordinates?**
   - Conventional constraints associated with arrays and integer values usually apply. Specific problem constraints from the prompt should be taken into account.

3. **Is it guaranteed the points array contains at least one valid point?**
   - No, it's not guaranteed. If no valid points exist, the function should return -1.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Initialize a variable to store the minimum distance found so far.
   - Initialize a variable to store the index of the closest valid point.

2. **Iterate Through Points:**
   - For each point, check if it shares the same x or y coordinate with the current location.
   - If valid, calculate the Manhattan distance.
   - If this distance is smaller than the current minimum distance, update the minimum distance and the index.

3. **Return Result:**
   - After iterating through all points, return the stored index of the closest valid point. If no valid point was found, return -1.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int nearestValidPoint(int x, int y, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points) {
        int minDistance = INT_MAX;
        int nearestIndex = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < points.size(); ++i) {
            int a = points[i][0];
            int b = points[i][1];

            if (a == x || b == y) {
                int distance = std::abs(x - a) + std::abs(y - b);
                if (distance < minDistance) {
                    minDistance = distance;
                    nearestIndex = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return nearestIndex;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of points in the `points` array. This is because we iterate through each point exactly once, performing a constant amount of work for each point (checking coordinates and calculating Manhattan distance). 

The space complexity is **O(1)** as we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input.
