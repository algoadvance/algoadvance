[Leetcode 2245. Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2245)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of integers. A "path" in the grid satisfies the following conditions:
1. It starts at any grid cell and ends at any grid cell.
2. It must only move in four directions: right, down, left, up.
3. It only visits each cell at most once.

A "cornered path" is a path that:
1. Turns exactly once.

We need to find such a path where the product of the numbers on the path contains the maximum number of trailing zeros. Note that trailing zeros in a number are produced by factors of 10, which is the product of the factors 2 and 5.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Grid Size Constraints:** What is the size of the grid?
    - This problem typically imposes standard constraints for grid problems, often with rows and columns up to 1000.
    
2. **Value Range:** Are there any constraints on the values within the grid cells?
    - Usually, values are within a reasonable integer range, but it's good to confirm they don't have special constraints like negatives or zeroes.

3. **Output Expected:** Should the output be the maximum number of trailing zeros directly?
    - Yes, the result should be the maximum trailing zeros that can be obtained by any such "cornered path".

### Strategy

1. **Factorize Grid Values:** Since trailing zeros are a result of factors of 10, decompose each grid value into its factors of 2 and 5.
2. **Prefix Sums:** Compute prefix sums for the number of 2s and 5s up to each cell in the grid. This will allow quick computation of factors along any path.
3. **Path Calculation:** For each possible turning point in the grid, compute the number of trailing zeros for all possible cornered paths.
4. **Maximize Result:** Track and update the maximum trailing zeros observed.

### Time Complexity
- Factorizing: \(O(R \times C)\), where \(R\) and \(C\) are the row and column counts.
- Prefix sums: \(O(R \times C)\).
- Traversal for path calculation: \(O(R \times C)\) for each possible turning point, but we can optimize it.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

pair<int, int> countFactors(int num) {
    int twos = 0, fives = 0;
    while (num % 2 == 0 && num > 0) {
        twos++;
        num /= 2;
    }
    while (num % 5 == 0 && num > 0) {
        fives++;
        num /= 5;
    }
    return {twos, fives};
}

    for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {{10, 5, 2},
                                {20, 10, 5},
                                {40, 15, 3}};
    
    cout << "Maximum trailing zeros in a cornered path: " << maxTrailingZeros(grid) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Factor Count Calculation:** The `countFactors` function returns the count of 2 and 5 factors for a given number.
- **Prefix Sums:** Using prefix sums arrays `prefix2` and `prefix5` to store cumulative counts of 2s and 5s, respectively, for efficient path calculations.
- **Path Calculation:** For each cell, calculate possible trailing zeros from different cornered paths and update the maximum trailing zeros found.

### Time Complexity
- Overall, the time complexity is \(O(R \times C)\) where \(R\) is number of rows and \(C\) is number of columns. This ensures the algorithm is efficient and scalable for larger grids up to the constraints typically allowed by LeetCode.
