[Leetcode 1985. Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1985)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in `nums` represents an integer without any leading zeros. Return the string that represents the `kth` largest integer in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of the number of elements in `nums`?
    - What is the range of the lengths of the strings in `nums`?
    - What if two strings represent the same number? Is it guaranteed that the inputs are unique?

2. **Output Specification**:
    - Should the function return the integer as a string or as an actual integer?
    - Are there any specific edge cases to consider?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to interpret each string as an integer and find the `kth` largest among them. Given that the strings can be large, converting them directly to integers might not be feasible due to potential overflow and performance issues. Instead, we can leverage string comparison for efficiently finding the `kth` largest integer.

Here are the steps:
1. Use a custom comparator to compare strings as integers.
2. Apply a sorting algorithm (e.g., quicksort) using this comparator.
3. Select the `kth` largest element from the sorted list.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the array.
- Retrieving the `kth` largest element after sorting takes \(O(1)\).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\).

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

// Comparator function to compare two strings representing integers
bool customCompare(const std::string &a, const std::string &b) {
    // Compare by length first
    if (a.length() != b.length()) {
        return a.length() < b.length();
    }
    // If lengths are the same, compare lexicographically
    return a < b;
}

std::string kthLargestNumber(std::vector<std::string>& nums, int k) {
    // Sort using the custom comparator
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), customCompare);
    // Return the kth largest element
    return nums[nums.size() - k];
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> nums = {"3", "6", "7", "10"};
    int k = 4;
    std::cout << "The " << k << "th largest number is: " << kthLargestNumber(nums, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code:
1. Defines a custom comparator for comparing the string representations of integers.
2. Sorts the `nums` vector using this comparator.
3. Returns the `kth` largest element by indexing from the end of the sorted list.

Remember to test the implementation with edge cases, such as when `nums` contains numbers with varying number of digits or when `k` equals 1 (largest number) or equals the size of the array (smallest number).
