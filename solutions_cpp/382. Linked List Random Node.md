[Leetcode 382. Linked List Random Node](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l382)
### Problem Statement

Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the **same probability** of being chosen.

Implement the `Solution` class:
- `Solution(ListNode head)` Initializes the object with the head of the singly-linked list `head`.
- `int getRandom()` Chooses a node randomly from the list and returns its value. All the nodes of the list should be equally likely to be chosen.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - How long can the linked list be? (It can be reasonably long)
   - What are the possible values for the node's data? (It can be any integer)
   
2. **Randomness Requirements**:
   - Is there any specific random number generator we should use? (We can use C++ standard library).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should we do if the list is empty? (We can assume the list is non-empty).

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the head of the list.
   
2. **Solution Approach**:
   - To ensure each node is picked with equal probability, we can use **Reservoir Sampling**.
   - Traverse the list. For the `i-th` node, select it with probability `1/i`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a variable to store the chosen value.
   - Start with the head node, and initialize a counter.
   - Traverse through the linked list:
     - For each node with index `i`:
       - Generate a random number between `1` and `i`.
       - If the generated number is `1`, update the chosen value to the current node's value.
   - Continue until you traverse through the entire list.
   - Return the chosen value.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib> // For rand() and srand()
#include <ctime>   // For time()

// Definition for singly-linked list node.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* head;
    
    // Initialize with head of the linked list.
    Solution(ListNode* head) {
        this->head = head;
        std::srand(std::time(nullptr)); // Seed for randomness
    }
    
    int getRandom() {
        ListNode* current = head;
        int result = current->val;
        int index = 1;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            // Generate a random number between 1 and index (both inclusive)
            if (std::rand() % index == 0) {
                result = current->val;
            }
            index++;
            current = current->next;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (Constructor)**: O(1) - Just store the head of the list.
- **getRandom() Method**: O(N) - Traverse through the entire list where N is the number of nodes in the list.

This ensures each node is picked with equal probability, making it an effective and efficient approach for the problem.
