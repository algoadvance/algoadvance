[Leetcode 1604. Alert Using Same Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1604)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 1604: **Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period**

A security system aims to determine whether any worker used their key-card three or more times in a one-hour period. 

You are given an array of strings `keyName` and an array of strings `keyTime` where:
- `keyName[i]` is the name of the employee who used the key card at the time `keyTime[i]` (in 24-hour format "HH:MM").

Return a list of unique worker names who used their key-card three or more times in a one-hour period. Their names can be returned in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we jump into solving the problem, let's clarify a few things:
1. **Input size**: How large can the input arrays be?
2. **Time format**: Are all times given in the correct "HH:MM" format and are they within valid 24-hour time ranges?
3. **Sort requirement**: Do the input times come in a sorted order, or do we need to sort them ourselves before processing?
4. **Case sensitivity**: Are the worker names case-sensitive?
5. **Multiple alerts**: If a worker triggers multiple alert periods, does that affect the outcome, or should we account only once per worker?

### Strategy
1. **Parse Input**: Convert the time strings into a more manipulatable format such as minutes from midnight.
2. **Organize and Sort**: Group the times by each worker and sort these times.
3. **Check for Alerts**: For each worker, check if there is any subset of three or more times within a one-hour window.
4. **Collect Results**: If a worker meets the alert condition, add their name to the result list.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<string> alertNames(vector<string>& keyName, vector<string>& keyTime) {
    unordered_map<string, vector<int>> employee_times;
    
    // Parse and convert time to minutes from "HH:MM"
    for (int i = 0; i < keyName.size(); ++i) {
        int hours = stoi(keyTime[i].substr(0, 2));
        int minutes = stoi(keyTime[i].substr(3, 2));
        int totalMinutes = hours * 60 + minutes;
        employee_times[keyName[i]].push_back(totalMinutes);
    }

    set<string> alerts;

    // Check for each employee
    for (auto& [employee, times] : employee_times) {
        sort(times.begin(), times.end());

        // Sliding window to find any three times within one hour
        for (int i = 0; i < times.size(); ++i) {
            int j = i + 2; // we are looking for three or more usages
            if (j < times.size() && times[j] - times[i] <= 60) {
                alerts.insert(employee);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return vector<string>(alerts.begin(), alerts.end());
}
```

### Strategy Breakdown
1. **Parse and Convert Time**:
   - Convert "HH:MM" to total minutes from midnight to simplify time comparisons.
2. **Store Times by Employee**:
   - Use an unordered map to group the times for each employee.
3. **Sort Times**:
   - Ensure that each employee's times are sorted to facilitate checking for one-hour windows.
4. **Sliding Window Check**:
   - For each employee's sorted time list, use a sliding window approach to find any triplet of times within one hour.
5. **Collect and Return Results**:
   - Use a set to automatically handle duplicate names and easily collect results.

### Time Complexity
- **Parsing and Storing**: O(n), where n is the number of entries, for parsing and inserting times.
- **Sorting**: O(n log k), where k is the number of unique employees and the dominant factor is sorting individual time vectors.
- **Checking Alerts**: O(k * m), where m is the average number of times per employee. In the worst case, m ~ n if one employee has all the times.

The overall time complexity is mainly influenced by the sorting step, giving us approximately O(n log n).

This approach should handle typical input sizes within reasonable time constraints for coding interviews.
