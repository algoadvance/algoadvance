[Leetcode 2003. Smallest Missing Genetic Value in Each Subtree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2003)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected, and acyclic graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges). The tree is rooted at node `0` and is represented with a 0-indexed array `parents` of size `n`, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parents[0] == -1`.

You are also given a 0-indexed array `nums` of size `n`, where `nums[i]` is a distinct integer, representing the genetic value of the i-th node.

Return an array `ans` of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the smallest missing positive integer (i.e., greater than 0) that is not present in the subtree rooted at node `i`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the integers in `nums` be negative or zero?
    - No, `nums` only consists of distinct positive integers.

2. What is the range of values for `n` (number of nodes)?
    - The constraints typically suggest that `n` can be as large as `100,000`.

3. Are there any specific constraints on the edges provided in the tree?
    - Yes, it is given that the input is a valid tree, meaning it is connected and acyclic.

### Strategy
1. **Tree Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Post-order DFS**: Traverse the tree using Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each subtree.
3. **Tracking Presence of Values**: Use a set to track the genetic values present in each subtree.
4. **Finding the Smallest Missing Positive**: For each node, determine the smallest missing positive integer not present in the corresponding subtree.

### Time Complexity
The algorithm involves a single traversal of the tree (DFS) which is `O(n)`. Checking for the smallest missing positive integer in a set can be done efficiently, making the overall time complexity approximately `O(n)`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> smallestMissingValueSubtree(vector<int>& parents, vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = parents.size();
        vector<vector<int>> children(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            children[parents[i]].push_back(i);
        }

        vector<int> result(n);
        vector<bool> found(100002, false); // buffer for genetic values up to 100001
        int missingValue = 1;

        function<unordered_set<int>(int)> dfs = [&](int node) -> unordered_set<int> {
            unordered_set<int> presentValues;
            for (int child : children[node]) {
                unordered_set<int> childValues = dfs(child);
                for (int val : childValues) {
                    presentValues.insert(val);
                }
            }
            presentValues.insert(nums[node]);
            while (found[missingValue]) {
                missingValue++;
            }
            result[node] = missingValue;
            return presentValues;
        };

        dfs(0);

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Tree Construction**: The `children` vector is built to hold the child nodes for each node based on the `parents` array.
2. **DFS Function**: The function `dfs()` recursively traverses the tree to gather the set of genetic values for each node's subtree.
3. **Tracking Found Values**: The vector `found` is used to keep track of which values have been encountered up to the current smallest missing value.
4. **Result Calculation**: For each node, update the result with the smallest missing positive integer (`missingValue`) that has not been found yet.
5. **Return Result**: After traversing the entire tree, `result` contains the smallest missing positive integer for each node's subtree.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by leveraging DFS to compute necessary information for each subtree in a single pass.
