[Leetcode 1471. The k Strongest Values in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1471)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, find the `k` strongest values in the array. The strength of an element `arr[i]` is defined as the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `m`, where `m` is the median of the array.

If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: The median is 3.
The strength of the values are [2,1,0,1,2]. The strongest values are [5, 1].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
Output: [5,5]
Explanation: The median is 3.
The strength of the values are [2,2,0,2,2]. The strongest values are [5, 5].
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** What is the range of the input array size?
   **A:** The array size can range from 1 to 10^5.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values within the input array?
   **A:** Yes, each value is an integer within the range of -10^4 to 10^4.
   
3. **Q:** Can `k` be greater than the size of the array?
   **A:** No, `k` should be less than or equal to the size of the array.

### Strategy:

1. **Find the Median:**
   - Sort the array.
   - If the array length is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the array length is even, the median is the lower middle element.

2. **Calculate Strength:**
   - For each element, calculate its strength as the absolute difference between the element and the median.

3. **Sort by Strength and Value:**
   - Use a custom comparator to sort the elements based on their strength. If two elements have the same strength, the element with the higher value should come first.

4. **Select the Top `k`:**
   - Select the first `k` elements from the sorted array.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getStrongest(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array to find the median
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        int median = arr[(n - 1) / 2]; // Note this is the lower middle

        // Step 2: Create a custom comparator for sorting by strength
        auto compare = [median](int a, int b) {
            int strengthA = abs(a - median);
            int strengthB = abs(b - median);
            if (strengthA == strengthB) {
                return a > b; // If strengths are equal, return the larger value
            }
            return strengthA > strengthB; // Otherwise, return the stronger one
        };

        // Step 3: Sort the array by strength using the comparator
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), compare);

        // Step 4: Take the first k elements
        vector<int> result(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + k);

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the array to find the median: `O(n log n)`
- Sorting the array based on strength: `O(n log n)`
- Extracting the first `k` elements: `O(k)`
Overall time complexity: `O(n log n)`, which is dominated by the sorting steps.

This ensures the solution is efficient and suitable even for larger input sizes.
