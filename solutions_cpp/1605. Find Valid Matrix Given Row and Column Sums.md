[Leetcode 1605. Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1605)
## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `rowSum` and `colSum` of non-negative integers, where `rowSum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the `i-th` row and `colSum[j]` is the sum of the elements in the `j-th` column of a matrix you need to construct. The task is to return any matrix `mat` of non-negative integers of size `rowSum.length x colSum.length` that meets the given row and column sums.

**Example:**

```
Input:
rowSum = [3, 8]
colSum = [4, 7]

Output:
[
  [3, 0],
  [1, 7]
]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= rowSum.length, colSum.length <= 500
- 0 <= rowSum[i], colSum[j] <= 10^9
- The sum of all elements in rowSum and colSum are equal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be multiple valid matrices?
   - Yes, any one of them can be returned.
   
2. Are `rowSum` and `colSum` guaranteed to have at least one valid solution?
   - Yes, it is guaranteed by the problem constraints.

3. Can we assume the inputs (rowSum and colSum) are always non-negative integers?
   - Yes, as per the problem statement.

4. Do we need to minimize or maximize any particular element in the matrix?
   - No, just need to construct any valid matrix meeting the row and column sum constraints.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a matrix of the required size filled with zeros.
2. Iterate through rows and columns, filling in the smallest possible value at each position without violating the row or column sum conditions.
3. Reduce the respective row and column sums accordingly.
4. Continue this process until all positions are filled.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> restoreMatrix(vector<int>& rowSum, vector<int>& colSum) {
    int m = rowSum.size();
    int n = colSum.size();
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            int minValue = min(rowSum[i], colSum[j]);
            matrix[i][j] = minValue;
            rowSum[i] -= minValue;
            colSum[j] -= minValue;
        }
    }
    
    return matrix;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because the algorithm iterates over every cell in the `m x n` matrix once.

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing the matrix with zeros. This ensures that all entries are initially zero.
2. **Main Iteration**:
   - We use nested loops to iterate through each position in the matrix.
   - For each position `(i, j)`, we take the minimum value between `rowSum[i]` and `colSum[j]`. This ensures that we do not exceed the required sum for either the current row or column.
   - We assign this minimum value to `matrix[i][j]` and then decrement the values in `rowSum[i]` and `colSum[j]` by this minimum value.
3. **Completion**:
   - We continue this process until all positions have been filled, ensuring that the resulting matrix satisfies both the row and column sum requirements.

This algorithm leverages a greedy approach to ensure that each cell in the matrix is correctly populated with a valid value while maintaining the required row and column sums.
