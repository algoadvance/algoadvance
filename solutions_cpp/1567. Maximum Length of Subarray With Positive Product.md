[Leetcode 1567. Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1567)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,-2,-3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The array [1,-2,-3,4] has a positive product of 24.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [0,1,-2,-3,-4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The array [1,-2,-3] has a positive product of 6.
```
### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The array [-1,-2] has a positive product of 2.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain zero?**
   - Yes, the array can contain zero, which will act as a delimiter for subarrays.
   
2. **Are all integers (including negative, positive, and zero) allowed?**
   - Yes, the array can contain any integer within the given range.

## Strategy

The goal is to identify the longest subarray within the given array `nums` where the product of all elements in the subarray is positive. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Keep track of two separate lengths:
     - `pos_len`: Length of the current positive product subarray.
     - `neg_len`: Length of the current negative product subarray.
   - Initialize `max_len` to capture the maximum length of subarray with a positive product.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - For each element `num` in `nums`:
     - If `num` is `0`, reset `pos_len` and `neg_len` to `0` because a zero product breaks any subarray continuity.
     - If `num` is positive:
       - Increment `pos_len` (extend the length of the current positive product subarray).
       - If `neg_len` > 0, increment `neg_len` because adding a positive number maintains the negative product.
     - If `num` is negative:
       - Swap `pos_len` and `neg_len` because multiplying with a negative number inverses the product sign.
       - Increment `pos_len` if the new `pos_len` (previous `neg_len` + 1) is positive.
   
3. **Update `max_len`**:
   - After processing each element, update `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and `pos_len`.

This approach ensures we handle each element in constant time, resulting in an efficient O(n) solution.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int getMaxLen(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int pos_len = 0, neg_len = 0, max_len = 0;
        
        for (const auto& num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                pos_len = 0;
                neg_len = 0;
            } else if (num > 0) {
                pos_len++;
                if (neg_len > 0) {
                    neg_len++;
                }
            } else {
                int temp = pos_len;
                pos_len = (neg_len > 0) ? neg_len + 1 : 0;
                neg_len = temp + 1;
            }
            max_len = std::max(max_len, pos_len);
        }
        
        return max_len;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm processes each element of the array exactly once, making the time complexity:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the given array `nums`.

This linear complexity ensures that the solution is efficient and suitable for large input sizes up to the constraints.
