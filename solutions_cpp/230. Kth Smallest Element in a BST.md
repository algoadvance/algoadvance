[Leetcode 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l230)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `k`, return the `k`th smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values in the BST.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `k`?**
   - `1 <= k <= number of nodes in the BST`.

2. **Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - No, the problem assumes all values in the BST are unique.

3. **What is the size range of the BST?**
   - Typically, constraints are not given explicitly, but we will assume a range up to several thousand nodes for practical purposes.

4. **Is the given BST guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, the input is assumed to be a valid binary search tree.

### Strategy

To find the `k`th smallest element in a BST, an in-order traversal is an effective method. This traversal visits nodes in ascending order for a BST. During the traversal, we simply count the nodes until we reach the `k`th node.

The steps are:
1. Perform an in-order traversal.
2. Keep track of the count of nodes visited.
3. When the count equals `k`, record the value of the current node.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int result = -1;
        inorderTraversal(root, k, count, result);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* node, int k, int &count, int &result) {
        if (!node) return;

        inorderTraversal(node->left, k, count, result);

        count++;
        if (count == k) {
            result = node->val;
            return;
        }

        inorderTraversal(node->right, k, count, result);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the BST. This is because in the worst case, we might need to traverse all nodes if `k` is the largest possible (`k == N`).

The space complexity is **O(H)**, where H is the height of the BST. This space is required for the call stack during the recursion. For a balanced BST, the height H = log(N). In the worst case (unbalanced BST), H can be up to N.
