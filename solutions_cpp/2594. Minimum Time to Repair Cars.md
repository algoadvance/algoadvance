[Leetcode 2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2594)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the ranks of mechanics, and an integer `cars` representing the number of cars that need to be repaired. Each mechanic i can repair a car in `ranks[i]` minutes. Each mechanic can repair only one car at a time.

Determine the minimum minutes required to repair all the cars with the given mechanics.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the mechanics busy until they finish repairing one car?**
   - Yes, each mechanic can work on only one car at a time.
   
2. **Can a car be partially repaired by one mechanic and then finished by another?**
   - No, once a mechanic starts repairing a car, they will finish repairing it on their own.

3. **Is there any limit on the number of mechanics or the ranks?**
   - No specific limits are given on the number of mechanics or the values of ranks. However, the problem should be solvable with the given constraints.

4. **Can more than one mechanic have the same rank?**
   - Yes, multiple mechanics can have the same rank.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to determine how efficiently we can allocate the cars to the mechanics such that the total time is minimized. Here's the plan:

1. **Binary Search on Time**:
    - Use binary search on the time taken to repair all cars because the optimal time, T, lies between 0 and a very high value (infinity in the worst case). However, practically we can use the maximum time taken by the worst mechanic if he repaired all cars.
  
2. **Checking Feasibility for a Given Time**:
    - For each mid-value in the binary search range, check if it is possible to repair all the cars within this time.
    - Calculate, for each mechanic, how many cars they can repair within this time (`mid / ranks[i]`). Sum these counts across all mechanics.
    - If the total number of cars that can be repaired is at least equal to `cars`, then the time is feasible; otherwise, it is not.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

bool canRepairInTime(const vector<int>& ranks, int cars, long long time) {
    int totalCarsRepaired = 0;
    for (auto rank : ranks) {
        totalCarsRepaired += time / rank;
        if (totalCarsRepaired >= cars) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return totalCarsRepaired >= cars;
}

long long minimumTimeToRepairCars(vector<int>& ranks, int cars) {
    long long left = 0;
    long long right = static_cast<long long>(*max_element(ranks.begin(), ranks.end())) * cars;
    long long answer = right;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        long long mid = left + (left - right) / 2;
        if (canRepairInTime(ranks, cars, mid)) {
            answer = mid;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return answer;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> ranks = {4, 3, 2};
    int cars = 10;
    long long result = minimumTimeToRepairCars(ranks, cars);
    cout << "Minimum time to repair " << cars << " cars is: " << result << " minutes.\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the above approach is primarily determined by the binary search. If `ranks` has \( n \) elements and we perform binary search over a maximum value of \( O(max(rank) \times cars) \), the complexity can be broken down as:
  - Binary Search: \( O(\log(max(rank) \times cars)) \)
  - Checking feasibility: \( O(n) \)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log(max(rank) \times cars)) \). 

This approach ensures an efficient solution even for large inputs.
