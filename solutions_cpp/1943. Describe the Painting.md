[Leetcode 1943. Describe the Painting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1943)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `segments`, where `segments[i] = [starti, endi, colori]` essentially describes painting the half-open interval `[starti, endi)` with the color `colori` over the existing painting.

The function should return a description of the painting after all the painting operations have been applied. You may assume that every color changes the painting, meaning no segment in the input array is ever fully covered by a segment added later.

The output format should be a 2D integer array `painting` that describes the resulting painting after all operations. Each entry in the array `painting` should be `[left, right, color]` which means that the half-open interval `[left, right)` is painted with `color`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:** What are the limits on the values of `starti`, `endi`, and `colori`?
2. **Non-overlapping assumption:** Can we assume that no two painting segments in `segments` list are overlapping unless one color fully covers a part of another?
3. **Empty intervals:** Can intervals be empty and do we need to handle such cases?

### Strategy

1. **Event-based Approach:** 
   - Treating the painting process as an event where each interval `[starti, endi)` is broken down into two events: a start event at `starti` and an end event at `endi`.
   - Use a map to handle these events and the painting persistence at each point.
   
2. **Interval Merging:**
   - After sorting all the events, iterate through them while maintaining the current state of painting using a rolling count.
   - Merge intervals with the same color.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> splitPainting(vector<vector<int>>& segments) {
    map<int, long long> events;
    
    for (const auto& seg : segments) {
        int start = seg[0];
        int end = seg[1];
        int color = seg[2];
        
        events[start] += color;
        events[end] -= color;
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> painting;
    long long currentColor = 0;
    int prev = -1;
    
    for (const auto &event : events) {
        int point = event.first;
        long long delta = event.second;
        
        if (currentColor != 0 && prev != point) {
            painting.push_back({prev, point, (int)currentColor});
        }
        
        currentColor += delta;
        prev = point;
    }
    
    return painting;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> segments = \{\{1,4,5},{4,7,7},{1,7,9}};
    vector<vector<int>> result = splitPainting(segments);

    for (const auto &entry : result) {
        cout << "[" << entry[0] << "," << entry[1] << "," << entry[2] << "]\n";
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the events has a complexity of \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of unique endpoints.
- Processing each event is \(O(N)\) in the worst case.
- The overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\) due to the sorting step.

### Explanation

1. **Events Handling:**
   - We create events that mark the start and end of a painting segment. 
   - Using a map `events`, we keep accumulation at each point adding color on start and subtracting on end.

2. **Current Painting Update:**
   - By iterating over sorted events, we can maintain a rolling sum (`currentColor`) to determine the active paint at any point in the interval.
   - Whenever a non-zero painting segment ends (from `prev` to `point`), it's recorded in the result.
