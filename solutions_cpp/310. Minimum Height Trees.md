[Leetcode 310. Minimum Height Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l310)
### Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`, you need to find all the nodes that can be the root of a Minimum Height Tree (MHT). A Minimum Height Tree is a tree with the minimum possible height.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the limits on `n` and the length of `edges`?
     - `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
     - `edges.length == n - 1`
     - `0 <= ai, bi < n`
     - `ai != bi`
     - All pairs `(ai, bi)` are unique.
     
2. **Graph Characteristics**:
   - The graph is always connected and has `n-1` edges, indicating that it is a tree.

With these constraints in mind, let's move forward to the strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The problem can be visualized as finding the "centers" of the tree as the root nodes that result in the minimum height.

2. **Degree Reduction (Pruning) Technique**:
   - Start by identifying all the leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1).
   - Iteratively remove the leaf nodes and update the degrees of their neighbors.
   - Continue this process until 1 or 2 nodes are left. These nodes are the centroids of the graph, representing the roots of the Minimum Height Trees.

3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a graph using adjacency lists.
   - Identify all leaf nodes.
   - Iteratively prune the tree from the leaves inward.
   - Return the remaining nodes, which are the centroids.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    if (n == 1) return {0};
    
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
    vector<int> degree(n, 0);
    
    // Build the adjacency list and degree of each node.
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].emplace_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].emplace_back(edge[0]);
        degree[edge[0]]++;
        degree[edge[1]]++;
    }
    
    queue<int> leaves;
    // Collect all initial leaves
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (degree[i] == 1) {
            leaves.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    int remainingNodes = n;
    // Trim the leaves until one or two nodes remain
    while (remainingNodes > 2) {
        int leavesCount = leaves.size();
        remainingNodes -= leavesCount;
        for (int i = 0; i < leavesCount; ++i) {
            int leaf = leaves.front();
            leaves.pop();
            // Decrease the degree of connected nodes
            for (int neighbor : adj[leaf]) {
                degree[neighbor]--;
                if (degree[neighbor] == 1) {
                    leaves.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> result;
    while (!leaves.empty()) {
        result.push_back(leaves.front());
        leaves.pop();
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building adjacency list**: \(O(n)\)
- **Initial leaves collection**: \(O(n)\)
- **Pruning process**: Also \(O(n)\) as each edge and node is processed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Summary
To solve the `Minimum Height Trees` problem, we repeatedly prune the leaves of the tree until 1 or 2 nodes remain, which are the centroids. This approach ensures that we identify the roots of the minimum height trees efficiently in linear time.
