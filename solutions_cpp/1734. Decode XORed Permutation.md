[Leetcode 1734. Decode XORed Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1734)
### Problem Statement

The problem is taken from LeetCode - [1734. Decode XORed Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-xored-permutation/):

There is an integer array `perm` that is a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is always odd.

It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, where `encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]`. 

For example, if `perm = [1,3,2]`, then `encoded = [2,1]` because `1 XOR 3 = 2` and `3 XOR 2 = 1`.

Given the `encoded` array, you need to find the original array `perm`. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input/Output constraints:**
   - What is the size of the encoded array, or equivalently the size of `n`?
   - Are there any negative numbers or zeroes in the arrays?

2. **Examples/Edge Cases:**
   - Any specific examples you would like to see solved?
   - Is there any specific range of values for the integers in `perm`?

### Strategy

1. **Observations:**
   - Since `n` is odd, we know that a permutation exists of the first `n` positive integers where `perm` can be used to calculate `encoded`.
   - Given the property of XOR, we can deduce the permutation.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The key insight is that the XOR of all elements from `1` to `n` (`totalXor`) can be computed.
   - Then, using the `encoded` array, we can find the XOR of all elements at even indices and odd indices in `perm`.
   - Using these XOR operations, extract the `perm` array effectively.

3. **Steps to Implement:**
   - Calculate `totalXor` as the XOR of all integers from `1` to `n`.
   - Calculate the first element of `perm` using a derived relationship.
   - Iterate through the `encoded` array to reconstruct the entire `perm` array.

### Code

Here's how to implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> decode(std::vector<int>& encoded) {
    int n = encoded.size() + 1;
    int totalXor = 0;
    int encodedXor = 0;
    
    // Calculate totalXor which is XOR of all numbers from 1 to n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        totalXor ^= i;
    }
    
    // Calculate XOR of every second element in encoded starting from 1st to (n-2)th
    for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i += 2) {
        encodedXor ^= encoded[i];
    }
    
    // The first number in perm can be derived
    int firstElement = totalXor ^ encodedXor;
    
    std::vector<int> perm(n, 0);
    perm[0] = firstElement;
    
    // Using the firstElement we can get the rest of the elements in the permutation
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        perm[i + 1] = perm[i] ^ encoded[i];
    }
    
    return perm;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> encoded = {3, 1};
    auto result = decode(encoded);
    
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Calculating `totalXor` involves a loop from `1` to `n` which takes O(n) time.
  - Computing `encodedXor` takes another loop through half of the elements of `encoded` hence O(n / 2) = O(n).
  - Constructing the `perm` array from `encoded` takes another O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

This code effectively uses the properties of XOR to decode the permutation array in a straightforward manner.
