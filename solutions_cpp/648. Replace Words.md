[Leetcode 648. Replace Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l648)
## Problem Statement

Given a dictionary of words, find all occurrences of the roots in the sentence and replace them with the root itself. If a word has multiple roots, replace it with the shortest one.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: dictionary = ["cat", "bat", "rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

### Notes:
1. The input will be in lowercase letters.
2. The output should be a lowercase sentence.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the behavior for words in the sentence that have no root in the dictionary?** 
   - They should remain unchanged in the sentence.
2. **Can we assume the dictionary and the sentence are both non-empty?**
   - Yes, for simplification we can assume both are non-empty.
3. **Are all characters in the dictionary and the sentence lowercase?**
   - Yes, as specified in the problem description.

## Strategy
1. **Trie Data Structure:** Use a Trie (prefix tree) to store the dictionary words. This allows for efficient prefix searching.
2. **Splitting the Sentence:** Split the input sentence into words.
3. **Replace Words:** For each word in the sentence, find the shortest prefix in the Trie and replace the word with this prefix. If no prefix is found, keep the word unchanged.
4. **Reconstruct Sentence:** Join the words back into a single string.

## Code 

Here is the C++ implementation for the described problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    string word;
    TrieNode() : word("") {}
};

class Trie {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
    
public:
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for(char ch : word) {
            if(!node->children.count(ch)) {
                node->children[ch] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[ch];
        }
        node->word = word;
    }
    
    string searchPrefix(string word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for(char ch : word) {
            if(node->children.count(ch)) {
                node = node->children[ch];
                if(!node->word.empty()) { // If a word is found in the trie
                    return node->word;
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return word; // Return original word if no prefix found
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    string replaceWords(vector<string>& dictionary, string sentence) {
        Trie trie;
        for(string root : dictionary) {
            trie.insert(root);
        }
        
        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string word;
        string result = "";
        
        while(ss >> word) {
            if(!result.empty()) {
                result += " ";
            }
            result += trie.searchPrefix(word);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Helper function to print the solution
int main() {
    vector<string> dictionary = {"cat", "bat", "rat"};
    string sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery";
    
    Solution solution;
    string replacedSentence = solution.replaceWords(dictionary, sentence);
    
    cout << replacedSentence << endl; // Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Trie Construction:** `O(D * L)` where `D` is the number of dictionary words and `L` is the maximum length of a dictionary word.
2. **Search Prefix:** For a sentence of length `N` and each word of maximum length `L`, the prefix search operation will be `O(N * L)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(D * L + N * L)`.
