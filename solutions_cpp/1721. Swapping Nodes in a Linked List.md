[Leetcode 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1721)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer `k`. Return the linked list after swapping the values of the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that `k` is always a valid index within the list?
   - Yes, `k` is always valid and within the bounds of the linked list length.

2. Should we handle the case where the linked list contains only one node?
   - Yes, but since swapping the only node with itself does nothing, the list should remain unchanged.

3. Are there any constraints on the length of the linked list?
   - The linked list contains between `1` to `10^5` nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Traversal and Identification**:
   - Use a two-pointer approach to find the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end.
   - Traverse the list once to calculate its length. The `k-th` node from the end can be found by traversing again or by calculating its position as `n - k + 1` from the start, where `n` is the length of the linked list.

2. **Swapping**:
   - Swap the values of the identified `k-th` nodes.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list contains only one node, or the nodes to be swapped are the same, the list remains unaffected.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* swapNodes(ListNode* head, int k) {
        // First pass to find the length of the linked list.
        ListNode* current = head;
        int length = 0;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            length++;
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        // Identify the k-th node from the beginning.
        ListNode* frontNode = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; ++i) {
            frontNode = frontNode->next;
        }
        
        // Identify the k-th node from the end.
        ListNode* endNode = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < length - k + 1; ++i) {
            endNode = endNode->next;
        }
        
        // Swap the values of frontNode and endNode.
        int temp = frontNode->val;
        frontNode->val = endNode->val;
        endNode->val = temp;
        
        return head;
    }
};

// Helper function to print the linked list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        std::cout << head->val << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(3);
    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(5);

    Solution sol;
    head = sol.swapNodes(head, 2);

    printList(head);  // Output: 1 4 3 2 5

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal for length calculation**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Traversal to find k-th nodes**: `O(n)` in total.
- **Swapping**: `O(1)` since we're only swapping values.
  
So, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
