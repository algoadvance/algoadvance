[Leetcode 455. Assign Cookies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l455)
### Problem Statement

You are assigned to allocate cookies to children. Each child has a greed factor, representing the minimum size of the cookie they will be content with, and each cookie has a size. You want to maximize the number of satisfied children by giving each child at most one cookie.

**Input:**
- Two integer arrays `g` and `s` where `g[i]` is the greed factor of the `i-th` child, and `s[j]` is the size of the `j-th` cookie.

**Output:**
- Return the maximum number of children you can satisfy.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: g = [1, 2, 3], s = [1, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of the children are 1, 2, 3 and even though you have 2 cookies, since the cookies are both of size 1, only 1 child can be satisfied.

Input: g = [1, 2], s = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of the children are 1, 2, and you have cookies with sizes 1, 2, 3. You can satisfy 2 children.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the arrays `g` and `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. Can the greed factor and cookie sizes be zero?
3. Do we need to return the actual list of satisfied children or just the count?

### Strategy

To maximize the number of satisfied children, we should always try to offer the smallest sufficient cookie to a child with the least possible greed. A greedy algorithm is highly appropriate for this problem. 

1. **Sort** both `g` (greed factors) and `s` (cookie sizes).
2. Use two pointers to iterate through `g` and `s`:
   - Start with the smallest greed and the smallest cookie.
   - If the current cookie can satisfy the current child's greed, move to the next child and next cookie.
   - Otherwise, move to the next cookie.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(std::vector<int>& g, std::vector<int>& s) {
        // Sort the greed factors and the cookies sizes
        std::sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        
        // Initialize pointers for g and s
        int i = 0; // Pointer for children
        int j = 0; // Pointer for cookies
        
        // Iterate through the cookies and greed factors
        while (i < g.size() && j < s.size()) {
            if (s[j] >= g[i]) {
                // Cookie s[j] can satisfy the child g[i]
                i++;
            }
            // Move to the next cookie
            j++;
        }
        
        // The number of children satisfied
        return i;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting `g` and `s` will take \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\) respectively, where \(n\) is the length of `g` and \(m\) is the length of `s`.
- The while loop will run in \(O(n + m)\) time because each pointer is incremented at most `n` or `m` times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\). The space complexity is \(O(1)\) beyond the input storage, as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.
