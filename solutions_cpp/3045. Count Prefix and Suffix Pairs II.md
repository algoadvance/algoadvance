[Leetcode 3045. Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3045)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`. A **prefix-suffix pair** is a pair of prefixes of `s1` and suffixes of `s2` such that they are equal. We need to determine the total number of prefix-suffix pairs.

### Example:

- For `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "bc"`, the prefix-suffix pairs are:
  - Prefix: "a", Suffix: "c" (not equal)
  - Prefix: "ab", Suffix: "bc" (not equal)
  - Prefix: "abc", Suffix: "bc" (equal)
  
  Output: 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the strings `s1` and `s2`?**
   - The strings can be of any length from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **Are the strings guaranteed to contain only lowercase English characters?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Generate Prefixes for `s1`:**
   - Traverse through the string `s1` to generate all possible prefixes.

2. **Generate Suffixes for `s2`:**
   - Traverse through the string `s2` to generate all possible suffixes.

3. **Count Matching Prefixes and Suffixes:**
   - Use a loop or a set to keep track of prefixes of `s1` and check if any of these prefixes exist in the generated suffixes of `s2`.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Instead of checking subsequences manually, we can use hashmaps or sets for faster lookup.

## Time Complexity

- **Generating prefixes**: O(n) for `s1` where n is the length of `s1`.
- **Generating suffixes**: O(m) for `s2` where m is the length of `s2`.
- **Total Complexity**: O(n + m). This is optimal considering we need to process each character of both strings at least once.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int countPrefixSuffixPairs(string s1, string s2) {
    unordered_set<string> prefixes;
    unordered_set<string> suffixes;
    
    // Generate all prefixes of s1
    string prefix = "";
    for (char c : s1) {
        prefix += c;
        prefixes.insert(prefix);
    }

    // Generate all suffixes of s2
    string suffix = "";
    for (int i = s2.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        suffix = s2[i] + suffix;
        suffixes.insert(suffix);
    }

    // Count matching prefixes and suffixes
    int count = 0;
    for (const auto& pre : prefixes) {
        if (suffixes.find(pre) != suffixes.end()) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "abc";
    string s2 = "bc";
    cout << "Number of prefix-suffix pairs: " << countPrefixSuffixPairs(s1, s2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Prefix Generation:**
   - We iterate through each character in `s1`, building prefixes by appending characters from left to right.

2. **Suffix Generation:**
   - We iterate through `s2` in reverse order, building suffixes by appending characters from right to left (using `s2[i] + suffix`).

3. **Count Matching Prefix-Suffix Pairs:**
   - Using the set data structure, we store all possible prefixes of `s1` and suffixes of `s2`.
   - By iterating over prefixes and checking for presence in suffixes set, we count the number of matches.

This solution ensures we achieve the problem's goal with a linear complexity regarding the input sizes, thus making it highly efficient.
