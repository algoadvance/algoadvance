[Leetcode 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l718)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the length of the longest common subarray that appears in both arrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the elements in the arrays?**
   - The elements of the arrays can be any integers.

2. **What is the length range for `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

3. **How should the solution handle cases where no common subarray exists?**
   - If no common subarray exists, the function should return `0`.

### Strategy

We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.

1. **Define a DP Array:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest common subarray that ends at index `i-1` in `nums1` and index `j-1` in `nums2`.
   
2. **Initialize the DP Array:**
   - Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(len(nums1)+1) x  (len(nums2)+1)` with all elements set to `0`.

3. **Fill the DP Array:**
   - Traverse both arrays using two nested loops.
   - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - If they are not equal, `dp[i][j]` remains `0`.

4. **Track the Maximum Length:**
   - Keep a variable `max_len` to track the maximum value in the `dp` array during the traversal.

5. **Return the Result**
   - The value of `max_len` will be the length of the longest common subarray.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findLength(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n1 = nums1.size();
        int n2 = nums2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1 + 1, vector<int>(n2 + 1, 0));
        int max_len = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n1; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n2; ++j) {
                if (nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                    max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j]);
                }
                // No need to set dp[i][j] to 0 if elements don't match because
                // it's already initialized to 0.
            }
        }

        return max_len;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n1 * n2)` where `n1` is the length of `nums1` and `n2` is the length of `nums2`. This is because we are using two nested loops to fill the `dp` array.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n1 * n2)` for storing the `dp` array of size `(n1+1) x (n2+1)`.

With this solution, we effectively find the length of the longest common subarray between the two given arrays.
