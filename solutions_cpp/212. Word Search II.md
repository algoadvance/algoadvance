[Leetcode 212. Word Search II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l212)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` board of characters and a list of strings `words`. Find all the words on the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
board = [
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["oath","eat"]
```

**Constraints:**
- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 12`
- `1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- `board` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same word appear multiple times on the board?**
   - No, each word should be listed only once in the output, even if it appears multiple times on the board.

2. **Can the words have duplicate letters?**
   - Yes, the words can contain duplicate letters.

3. **Should the order of words in the resulting list match the order in the input list?**
   - No, the order of words in the output list does not matter.

## Strategy

1. **Trie Construction**: Use a Trie (prefix tree) to store all the words for efficient prefix searching.
2. **Backtracking**: On each cell of the board, use a backtracking function to explore all possible words starting from that cell.
3. **Optimization**: By using a Trie, we can abandon a search path early if the current prefix doesn't lead to any word.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Build the Trie**: Insert all words into a Trie.
2. **DFS with Backtracking**: For each cell in the board, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking to explore all possible words.
3. **Early Termination**: If a prefix does not exist in the Trie, terminate that path early.
4. **Result Collection**: Collect all valid words found during the DFS.

## Code

Here is the C++ solution implementing the approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[26];
    string word;
    TrieNode() {
        fill(begin(children), end(children), nullptr);
        word = "";
    }
};

class Trie {
public:
    TrieNode* root;
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(string& word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (!node->children[c - 'a']) {
                node->children[c - 'a'] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[c - 'a'];
        }
        node->word = word;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        Trie trie;
        for (string& word : words) {
            trie.insert(word);
        }
        
        unordered_set<string> result_set;
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                dfs(board, i, j, trie.root, result_set);
            }
        }
        
        return vector<string>(result_set.begin(), result_set.end());
    }
    
private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& board, int i, int j, TrieNode* node, unordered_set<string>& result_set) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= board.size() || j < 0 || j >= board[0].size() || board[i][j] == '#')
            return;
        
        char c = board[i][j];
        if (!node->children[c - 'a"])
            return;
        
        node = node->children[c - 'a'];
        if (node->word != "") {
            result_set.insert(node->word);
        }
        
        board[i][j] = '#';
        int directions[4][2] = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        for (auto& dir : directions) {
            int ni = i + dir[0], nj = j + dir[1];
            dfs(board, ni, nj, node, result_set);
        }
        board[i][j] = c;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Trie Construction**: `O(W * L)`, where `W` is the number of words and `L` is the average length of the words.
- **DFS**: In the worst case, the DFS can explore all cells, so `O(m * n * 4^L)`, where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `L` is the maximum length of a word in `words`.

Overall, the problem complexity is dominated by the DFS, making the approach manageable for the given constraints.
