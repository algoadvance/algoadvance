[Leetcode 587. Erect the Fence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l587)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the forest. You are asked to form a fence with the minimum length to enclose all the trees. The fence must be a convex polygon. You need to return the coordinates of the trees that are exactly located on the fence's perimeter.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of values for the coordinates of the trees?
   - What is the maximum number of trees given in the input array?

2. **Output Details**:
   - In which order should the output coordinates be?
   - Are there any special cases (such as all points being collinear) that need to be handled specifically?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Convex Hull**:
   - The problem boils down to finding the convex hull of a set of points. There are different algorithms to achieve this, such as Graham's scan or Andrew's monotone chain algorithm.

2. **Algorithm Choice**:
   - We'll use Andrew's monotone chain algorithm, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of points.

3. **Steps**:
   1. **Sort the Points**: Sort the array of points lexicographically (first by x coordinate, and in case of a tie, by y coordinate).
   2. **Build the Lower Hull**: Iterate over the points to build the lower part of the convex hull.
   3. **Build the Upper Hull**: Iterate over the points in reverse order to build the upper part of the convex hull.
   4. **Combine the Hulls**: Concatenate the lower and upper hulls to get the convex hull.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - All points being collinear.
   - Handling duplicates points, although generally, there should be no duplicates as per problem constraints.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> outerTrees(vector<vector<int>>& trees) {
        // Sort the points
        sort(trees.begin(), trees.end());
        
        // Function to find the cross product
        auto cross = [](const vector<int>& O, const vector<int>& A, const vector<int>& B) {
            return (A[0] - O[0]) * (B[1] - O[1]) - (A[1] - O[1]) * (B[0] - O[0]);
        };
        
        // Build the lower hull
        vector<vector<int>> hull;
        for (const auto& p : trees) {
            while (hull.size() >= 2 && cross(hull[hull.size() - 2], hull.back(), p) < 0) {
                hull.pop_back();
            }
            hull.push_back(p);
        }
        
        // Build the upper hull
        for (int i = trees.size() - 2, t = hull.size() + 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (hull.size() >= t && cross(hull[hull.size() - 2], hull.back(), trees[i]) < 0) {
                hull.pop_back();
            }
            hull.push_back(trees[i]);
        }
        
        // Remove the last point of the hull because it's the same as the first one
        hull.pop_back();

        // Remove duplicates if any
        sort(hull.begin(), hull.end());
        hull.erase(unique(hull.begin(), hull.end()), hull.end());
        
        return hull;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Building Hull**: \( O(n) \)

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \), which is efficient for this problem.
