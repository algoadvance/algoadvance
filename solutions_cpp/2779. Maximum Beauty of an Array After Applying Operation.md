[Leetcode 2779. Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2779)
Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. The beauty of an array is defined as the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array. You can perform the following operation on the array at most once:

- Choose an element from the array (let's call it `nums[i]`) and replace it with any integer from 1 to 10^6 (both inclusive).

Determine the maximum beauty the array can achieve after applying the above operation at most once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the size of the input array?
2. Should the input array always contain at least one element?
3. Is the input array always sorted?
4. Are there any constraints on the elements within the array other than the given range for the operation?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Array Beauty**: First, we need to calculate the initial beauty of the array. This is given by the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

2. **Potential Replacements**:
   - If we replace the maximum element with `1` and calculate the new beauty.
   - If we replace the minimum element with `10^6` and calculate the new beauty.
   - If we replace any element in between with `1` and `10^6` and see which contributes to the maximum beauty.

3. **Comparison**: Compare the beauty obtained from the above potential replacements to find the maximum possible beauty.

### Time Complexity

The strategy will involve finding the minimum and maximum in the array and then computing potential new beauties, which involves constant time checks. Given n as the array size, the overall complexity can be expressed as O(n), dominated by the initial min and max finding operations.

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

using namespace std;

int maxBeauty(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();

    if (n == 1) return nums[0] - nums[0]; // If only one element, beauty is zero
    
    int currentMax = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int currentMin = *min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    // Initial beauty of the array
    int initialBeauty = currentMax - currentMin;
    
    // Beauty if we replace currentMin with 10^6
    int beautyReplaceMinWithMax = (1000000) - *min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end() - 1);

    // Beauty if we replace currentMax with 1
    int beautyReplaceMaxWithMin = *max_element(nums.begin() + 1, nums.end()) - 1;

    // Get the maximum possible beauty
    return max(initialBeauty, max(beautyReplaceMinWithMax, beautyReplaceMaxWithMin));
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 4, 6, 8};
    cout << "Maximum Beauty: " << maxBeauty(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initial Calculations**: Compute the current maximum and minimum of the array.
2. **Initial Beauty**: Calculate the initial beauty by `currentMax - currentMin`.
3. **Replacement Calculations**: 
   - For maximum beauty by setting the smallest element to the largest possible value (10^6).
   - For maximum beauty by setting the largest element to the smallest possible value (1).
4. **Result Comparison**: Compare these computed beauties and return the highest value.

This solution efficiently computes the required operation to maximize the beauty of the array after making at most one operation.
