[Leetcode 2615. Sum of Distances](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2615)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, return a new array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the sum of the absolute differences between `nums[i]` and all the other elements in `nums`.

In other words, the array `answer` will contain the total "cost" of "moving" element `i` to the positions of all other elements in the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size limit of the input array?**
   - This will help in determining whether the solution should be optimized for large inputs.

2. **What are the range of values in the input array?**
   - Whether the input elements are all positive, negative, or a mix of both.

3. **Can there be duplicate values in the input array?**
   - This could influence the approach, especially in terms of optimization.

4. **Is there a specific requirement for space complexity?**
   - Helps decide whether we can use additional space for keeping track of cumulative sums etc.

5. **How should we handle edge cases such as an empty array or an array with a single element?**
   - Important for ensuring the solution is robust.

Letâ€™s assume the input array can have upto \(10^5\) elements, which means an \(O(n^2)\) solution could be problematic.

## Strategy

A brute force approach would involve calculating the sum of absolute differences for each element in \(O(n^2)\) time. However, a more efficient approach can be achieved using prefix sums:

1. **Sort the array** (not necessarily, but makes the prefix sums easier to handle in a sorted manner).
2. **Compute prefix sums** and use them to compute the distance sums in linear time.

### Step-by-step Approach

1. **Sort the array** while keeping track of original indices.
2. **Compute prefix sums** of the sorted array.
3. Calculate the result for each element using the prefix sums:
   - For an element at index `i`, use the prefix sums to compute the sum of all elements to the left and to the right.
   - Use the prefix sum arrays to calculate the sum of distances in \(O(1)\) for each element.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

vector<long long> getSumOfDistances(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<long long> answer(n, 0);
    vector<int> sorted_nums = nums;
    sort(sorted_nums.begin(), sorted_nums.end());
    
    vector<long long> prefix_sum(n+1, 0);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + sorted_nums[i];
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        long long left_sum = prefix_sum[i];
        long long right_sum = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i+1];
        answer[i] = (i * sorted_nums[i] - left_sum) + (right_sum - (n-1-i) * sorted_nums[i]);
    }
    
    return answer;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Computing prefix sums** takes \(O(n)\).
- **Calculating results for each element** takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which should be efficient enough for the size constraints mentioned.

## Space Complexity

- Storing the prefix sums takes \(O(n)\).
- The sorted array and the result array each take \(O(n)\).

Hence, the space complexity is \(O(n)\), which is reasonable given the constraints.
