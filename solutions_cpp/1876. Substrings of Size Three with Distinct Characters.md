[Leetcode 1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1876)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of length `n`. Your task is to find the number of substrings of length 3 that consist of distinct characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one substring of size 3 with distinct characters: "xyz".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: Substrings with 3 unique characters are "abc", "bca", "cab" and "abc".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the string contain non-alphabet characters? (It's implied to be alphabetic based on example)
   - What is the maximum length `n` of the input string?

2. **Output:**
   - Is the function expected to only print the result or return it?

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Approach:** 
   - Use a sliding window of size 3 to traverse the string.
   - At each step, check if the characters in the current window are distinct.
   - Count such valid windows.

2. **Distinct Check:**
   - Use a set to check if the characters in the current substring are unique.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

int countGoodSubstrings(std::string s) {
    if (s.length() < 3) return 0;
    
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - 3; ++i) {
        std::unordered_set<char> unique_chars(s.begin() + i, s.begin() + i + 3);
        if (unique_chars.size() == 3) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    std::string s1 = "xyzzaz";
    std::string s2 = "aababcabc";
    
    std::cout << "Count for s1: " << countGoodSubstrings(s1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Count for s2: " << countGoodSubstrings(s2) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initial Checks:** If the string length is less than 3, return 0 because no substring of size 3 is possible.

2. **Sliding Window Loop:** Iterate through the string from the start to `length - 3`. For each iteration:
   - Construct a set containing the characters of the current substring of length 3.
   - If the size of the set is 3, that means all characters are unique, so increment the count.

3. **Return the Count:** Finally, return the count of valid substrings.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We are iterating through the string once and performing a fixed amount of work (3 insertions into a set) at each step.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the set contains at most 3 characters.
