[Leetcode 808. Soup Servings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l808)
### Problem Statement

There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially, we have `N` ml of soup A and `N` ml of soup B. We serve soup according to the following probability operations:

- Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B (25% probability).
- Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B (25% probability).
- Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B (25% probability).
- Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B (25% probability).

We stop serving the soup when either type of soup becomes empty or both become empty. The operation of serving soup obeys this hierarchy:

1. If both A and B become empty simultaneously, we get result 0.5.
2. If only soup A becomes empty while soup B has some remaining, we get result 1.
3. If only soup B becomes empty while soup A has some remaining, we get result 0.

Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B will become empty at the same time.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, let's clarify a few details:
1. What is the maximum value for N?
2. Should we consider `N` to be large, possibly requiring optimization techniques?

Assuming the above information is standard:

### Strategy

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If N â‰¤ 0, return 0.5, since N = 0 implies both soups are empty.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a map to store intermediate results.
   - Key: the tuple (A, B) representing current amounts of soups A and B.
   - Value: the probability of serving soup A first or both soups together from state (A, B).

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a function `probability(A, B)` which returns the desired probability for given amounts A and B.
   - Use the recursive relation considering the four service operations and their associated probabilities.
   - Memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.

### Time Complexity
Given the memoization approach, the complexity is O(N^2) in terms of states (A, B).

### Code

Let's implement this solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <map>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    map<pair<int, int>, double> memo;

    double probability(int A, int B) {
        if (A <= 0 && B <= 0) return 0.5;
        if (A <= 0) return 1.0;
        if (B <= 0) return 0.0;
        
        if (memo.find({A, B}) != memo.end()) {
            return memo[{A, B}];
        }
        
        double result = 0.25 * (probability(A - 100, B) +
                                probability(A - 75, B - 25) +
                                probability(A - 50, B - 50) +
                                probability(A - 25, B - 75));
        
        memo[{A, B}] = result;
        return result;
    }

    double soupServings(int N) {
        if (N > 4800) return 1.0; // Fast return for large N based on empirical observations
        return probability(N, N);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Base Cases**: Handle the cases when either or both soups reach zero.
2. **Memoization**: Use a map `memo` to store and reuse results.
3. **Recursive Function**: The function `probability` calculates the probability based on recursive states.
4. **Optimization for Large `N`**: If N is larger than a threshold (4800), return 1.0 directly as the probability asymptotically approaches 1.0.
