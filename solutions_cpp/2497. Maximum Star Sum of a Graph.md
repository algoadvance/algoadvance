[Leetcode 2497. Maximum Star Sum of a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2497)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n` which is the number of nodes, an integer array `values` representing the value of each node, and a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.

The **star sum** of a node `x` is the sum of the nodeâ€™s value and the values of all its neighboring nodes. The task is to return the maximum star sum of any node in the graph.

#### Example:
```
Input:
n = 5
values = [5, 2, 1, 4, 3]
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]]

Output:
14

Explanation:
- Star sum of node 0 is 5 + 2 + 1 = 8
- Star sum of node 1 is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14
- Star sum of node 2 is 1 + 5 = 6
- Star sum of node 3 is 4 + 2 = 6
- Star sum of node 4 is 3 + 2 = 5
Maximum star sum is 14.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can values of nodes be negative?
   - For the sake of the problem, let's assume that values can be negative, though unlikely.
   
2. Are self-loops or multiple edges between the same nodes allowed?
   - The problem defines the input as an undirected unweighted graph generally without self-loops or multiple edges, consistent with standard undirected graph properties unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Calculate Star Sum**: For each node, calculate the star sum by summing its value and the values of all its neighboring nodes.
3. **Find Maximum Star Sum**: Iterate through all nodes to find and return the maximum star sum.

### Code

Here's a solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int maxStarSum(int n, const vector<int>& values, const vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

    // Create adjacency list
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    int max_sum = numeric_limits<int>::min();

    // Calculate star sum for each node
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int star_sum = values[i];
        for (int neighbor : adj[i]) {
            star_sum += values[neighbor];
        }
        max_sum = max(max_sum, star_sum);
    }

    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    // Example test case:
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> values = {5, 2, 1, 4, 3};
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}};
    
    cout << maxStarSum(n, values, edges) << endl;  // Output should be 14

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Adjacency List Creation**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
2. **Star Sum Calculation**: O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes (vertices) and E is the number of edges. Each node is iterated over, and for each node, its neighbours are iterated over.
   
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(V + E). Given the problem constraints, this solution should be efficient for typical graph sizes encountered in practice.
