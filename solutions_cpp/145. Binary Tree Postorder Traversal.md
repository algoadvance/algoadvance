[Leetcode 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l145)
### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values. Postorder traversal is a type of depth-first traversal where the nodes are recursively visited in this order: left subtree, right subtree, root.

For example, given a binary tree:
```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
```
You should return the list `[3, 2, 1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can the binary tree be empty (i.e., `root` is `nullptr`)? 
     - Yes, the function should return an empty list in this case.
   - What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?
     - The number of nodes can be up to \(10^4\).
   
2. **Node Values**:
   - Are the node values unique?
     - Yes, for simplification we can assume node values are unique.
   - Could the node values be negative?
     - Yes, node values can be negative.

### Strategy

To solve this, we can use a recursive approach to traverse the tree in postorder. A postorder traversal visits nodes in the order:
1. Visit left subtree.
2. Visit right subtree.
3. Visit root.

For each node, we will:
1. Recursively visit its left child.
2. Recursively visit its right child.
3. Process the root node (i.e., add its value to the result list).

### Code

Here's how you can implement the postorder traversal recursively in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr, right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> postorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        std::vector<int> result;
        postorderHelper(root, result);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void postorderHelper(TreeNode* node, std::vector<int>& result) {
        // Base case: if the node is null, just return.
        if (node == nullptr) return;

        // Recursive case: visit left subtree first.
        postorderHelper(node->left, result);

        // Then visit right subtree.
        postorderHelper(node->right, result);

        // Visit the node itself.
        result.push_back(node->val);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\). In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as the height of the tree, which can be \(O(n)\) in the case of a skewed tree (or \(O(\log n)\) in the best case of a balanced tree). Additionally, we use \(O(n)\) space to store the result.

This should cover all necessary aspects to solve the problem using a recursive approach. If you have further questions or need an iterative solution, feel free to ask!
