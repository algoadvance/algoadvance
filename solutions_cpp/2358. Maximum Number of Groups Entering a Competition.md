[Leetcode 2358. Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2358)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `grades` representing the grades of students in a class. You want to form the maximum number of groups such that each group has a strictly greater total grade sum than the previous group.

Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.

## Clarifying Questions

To better understand the problem, let's consider the following clarifications:
1. Are there any constraints on the number of students or the values of their grades?
2. Are groups allowed to have a single student or should each group have at least two students?

Given problem is expected to return maximum number of groups satisfying the conditions.

## Strategy

The problem involves dividing an array into subgroups where each subgroup has a larger sum than the previous one. We are interested in forming the maximum number of such subgroups.

To solve this problem, we could follow these steps:
1. Sort the grades array in non-decreasing order.
2. Use a greedy approach to form the groups. Start forming groups from the first element while keeping track of the sum of the current group and the sum of the previous group.
3. Keep forming groups as long as the sum of the current group is greater than the sum of the previous group.
4. Track the number of valid groups formed.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGroups(std::vector<int>& grades) {
        std::sort(grades.begin(), grades.end());
        
        int groupCount = 0;
        int currentGroupSize = 1;
        
        while (true) {
            int sumCurrentGroup = 0;
            if (grades.size() < currentGroupSize) break;
            for (int i = 0; i < currentGroupSize; ++i) {
                sumCurrentGroup += grades[i];
            }
            grades.erase(grades.begin(), grades.begin() + currentGroupSize);
            
            ++groupCount;
            ++currentGroupSize;
        }
        
        return groupCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> grades = {10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5};
    int result = solution.maximumGroups(grades);
    std::cout << "Maximum number of groups: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the grades array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `grades` array.
- The greedy approach to form groups takes \(O(n)\) since in the worst case each element is considered once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient enough for this problem given the typical constraints.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) extra space, not counting the space required to store the input, because we are only using a few additional variables for counting and calculating sums.

This solution should be optimal for forming the maximum number of groups with given constraints.
