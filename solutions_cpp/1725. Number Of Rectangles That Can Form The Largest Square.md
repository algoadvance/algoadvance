[Leetcode 1725. Number Of Rectangles That Can Form The Largest Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1725)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of rectangles represented by a 2D array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, wi]` denotes the length and width of the `i`-th rectangle. You need to find the number of rectangles that can form the largest square.

A rectangle can form a square if and only if at least one of its sides is the length of the largest square possible. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Sizes**: What is the maximum number of rectangles we can expect in the `rectangles` array?
2. **Equal Length and Width**: If a rectangle has dimensions [3, 3], does it count as forming a square of size 3?
3. **Side Restrictions**: Should we consider both length and width for forming the largest square, or is it only the smaller side of the rectangle that should be considered?

### Example
Given `rectangles = [[2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 3], [3, 3]]`, the output should be 3. This is because the largest square possible is of side 3, and there are three rectangles that can form this square: `[3, 7], [4, 3], [3, 3]`.

### Strategy
1. **Finding the Maximum Square Size**: Determine the maximum side length that can form a square. This would be the minimum of `li` and `wi` for each rectangle.
2. **Counting Rectangles**: Count how many rectangles have this maximum possible side length.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the number of rectangles. We iterate through the list twice: once to find the maximum side length and once to count the rectangles that can form a square with that side length.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        // Step 1: Find the longest possible side length of a square
        for (const auto& rectangle : rectangles) {
            int sideLen = min(rectangle[0], rectangle[1]);
            maxLen = max(maxLen, sideLen);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Count how many rectangles can form the largest square
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& rectangle : rectangles) {
            if (min(rectangle[0], rectangle[1]) == maxLen) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> rectangles1 = {{2, 3}, {3, 7}, {4, 3}, {3, 3}};
    cout << sol.countGoodRectangles(rectangles1) << endl; // Output: 3

    vector<vector<int>> rectangles2 = {{5, 8}, {3, 9}, {5, 12}, {16, 5}};
    cout << sol.countGoodRectangles(rectangles2) << endl; // Output: 3
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Finding the Largest Square Side**: We first iterate through all rectangles to find the maximum possible side length using `min(li, wi)`.
2. **Counting Rectangles**: Next, we iterate again to count how many rectangles can form a square of this maximum side length.
3. **Result**: We return the count obtained from the second step. 

This approach ensures we efficiently find and count the rectangles capable of forming the largest possible square.
