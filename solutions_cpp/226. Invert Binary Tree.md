[Leetcode 226. Invert Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l226)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 226: Invert Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

For example, if the input binary tree is:
```
     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9
```
The inverted binary tree is:
```
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Specifications:** Will the tree be given as TreeNode objects or a different format?
   - Tree is provided as TreeNode objects.
   
2. **Constraints:** 
   - What is the expected size of the binary tree (in terms of number of nodes)?
     - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
   - Can the binary tree have negative values?
     - Yes, the tree nodes can have negative values.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the `root` is `null`?
     - If the root is `null`, the function should return `null`.

## Strategy

To invert a binary tree, we need to swap the left and right children at each node. We can achieve this using either recursion or iteration.

### Recursive Approach

1. **Base Case:** If the current node is `null`, return `null`.
2. **Recursive Step:** 
   - Swap the left child and the right child.
   - Recursively invert the left and right subtree.
   
### Iterative Approach

1. **Using a Queue (BFS):** Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level and swap children iteratively.
   - Initialize the queue with the root node.
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue a node.
     - Swap its children.
     - Enqueue the non-null children.

We will use the recursive approach in this solution because it is more intuitive and simpler to implement for binary tree problems.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for both the recursive and iterative approaches is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once, and a constant amount of work is done per node.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the recursive approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Base case: if the tree is empty, return null
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // Swap the left and right children of the current node
        TreeNode* temp = root->left;
        root->left = root->right;
        root->right = temp;
        
        // Recursively invert the left subtree and right subtree
        invertTree(root->left);
        invertTree(root->right);
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Usage example
int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(9);
    
    Solution sol;
    TreeNode* invertedRoot = sol.invertTree(root);
    
    // Output the result (for testing purposes)
    // Expected output should show the structure of the inverted tree
    std::cout << "Root: " << invertedRoot->val << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Left child: " << invertedRoot->left->val << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Right child: " << invertedRoot->right->val << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution will correctly invert a binary tree using a recursive approach. The main function shows how to use the `invertTree` function and print the results for testing purposes.
