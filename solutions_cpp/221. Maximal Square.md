[Leetcode 221. Maximal Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l221)
## Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` binary matrix filled with `0's` and `1's`, find the largest square containing only `1's` and return its area.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix?
   - Typically, constraints would be: \(1 \leq m, n \leq 300\).
   
2. **Matrix Content**: Is the matrix guaranteed to be binary?
   - Yes, each element in the matrix is either `0` or `1`.

3. **Expected Output**: Should the result be the area of the largest square?
   - Yes, the output should be the area of the largest square containing only `1's`.

With these clarifications, let's proceed to the strategy.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We will use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is the cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Transition**: For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix:
   - If `matrix[i][j] == '0'`, then `dp[i][j] = 0` because it can't be a part of any square of `1's`.
   - If `matrix[i][j] == '1'` and it's not on the first row or first column (where squares larger than 1x1 can't exist), then:
     \[
     dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     \]
     This relation arises because we can form a larger square only if there are squares ending at `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`.

3. **Result**: Track the maximum value in the DP table, say `maxSide`. The area will be \(maxSide^2\).

4. **Initialization**: Initialize a DP table with all zeroes. 

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) as we need to traverse each cell of the matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) to store the DP table.

## Code
Here is the C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maximalSquare(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
    if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return 0;
    int m = matrix.size();
    int n = matrix[0].size();
    
    // DP table initialized to 0
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    int maxSide = 0;

    // Fill the dp table
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1; // Edge case for first row and column
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]}) + 1;
                }
                maxSide = max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Area of the largest square
    return maxSide * maxSide;
}
```

This C++ code will find and return the area of the largest square containing only `1's` in the given binary matrix.
