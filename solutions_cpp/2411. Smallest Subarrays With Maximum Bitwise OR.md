[Leetcode 2411. Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2411)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, you need to find the smallest subarray for each index `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n) such that the bitwise OR of the elements of the subarray starting at index `i` is maximum possible. The output should be an array of size `n` where the element at index `i` is the length of this smallest subarray starting from `i`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output if the array is empty?**
   - Since the constraints ensure the size is n, this scenario won't occur.

2. **Are all integral operations confined to standard integer limits?**
   - Yes, assume standard 32-bit integer limits.

3. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, since bitwise operations are typically defined for non-negative integers in such problems.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize the following strategy:
1. **Calculate bitwise ORs and subarray lengths incrementally:** Start from each index `i` and iterate forward to calculate the bitwise OR.
2. **Track the positions:** Utilize an auxiliary array or data structure to keep track of the most recent positions of each bit set to `1` as we iterate through `nums`.
3. **Calculate lengths:** For each index `i`, use the tracked positions to determine the smallest subarray length that achieves the maximum bitwise OR.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize an array `result` of size `n` to store the results.
2. Initialize an array `latest` of size 32 (for each bit) to -1 to track the latest index where each bit is set.
3. Start from the end of the array and move backward to use the information about the next indices efficiently.
4. For each index `i`, update the `latest` array and find the farthest index influenced by any bit from `latest`.
5. The length for each index `i` will be `farthest - i + 1`.

### Code

Here is the implementation using the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<int> smallestSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> result(n, 0);
    vector<int> latest(32, -1); // There are 32 possible bits for a standard 32-bit integer.

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int bit = 0; bit < 32; ++bit) {
            if (nums[i] & (1 << bit)) {
                latest[bit] = i;
            }
        }
        
        int farthest = i;
        for (int bit = 0; bit < 32; ++bit) {
            if (latest[bit] != -1) {
                farthest = max(farthest, latest[bit]);
            }
        }
        
        result[i] = farthest - i + 1;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n * k), where:
- `n` is the size of the input array `nums`.
- `k` is a constant representing the number of bits (32 here, for 32-bit integers).

Thus, the time complexity is effectively O(n) due to the constant factor.

This solution ensures you obtain the smallest subarrays for each index `i` with the maximum bitwise OR in a linear scan of the array.
