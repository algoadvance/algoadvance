[Leetcode 2681. Power of Heroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2681)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. You must select a non-empty subset of the array, and for each element in this subset, compute the product of its square with the squared sum of the subset. Return the sum of these computed values for all possible non-empty subsets of the array. As the answer can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum size of the `nums` array?
   - Are all the elements in the `nums` array positive integers?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - The result needs to be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we consider the case where `nums` has only one element?
   - How should we handle very large numbers due to squaring and summing?

Let's assume:
1. `nums` has a maximum size of \(1000\).
2. Each element in `nums` is a positive integer within the range \([1, 1000]\).

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to:

1. **Understand Subset Generation and Calculation:**
   - For each subset, compute:
     - The sum of the elements in the subset.
     - The product of each element squared with the squared sum of the subset.
   - Accumulate these values across all subsets.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Direct computation for all subsets may not be feasible due to the exponential number of subsets.
   - Utilize mathematical properties and dynamic programming for optimization.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Ensure all operations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large values.
   
## Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfPower(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long result = 0;

        // We generate all subsets by bit-masking.
        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            long long subsetSum = 0;

            // Calculate the subset sum
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                    subsetSum = (subsetSum + nums[i]) % MOD;
                }
            }
            
            // Calculate each element's contribution in the subset
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (mask & (1 << i)) {
                    long long elementPower = (nums[i] * nums[i]) % MOD;
                    long long contribution = (elementPower * subsetSum * subsetSum) % MOD;
                    result = (result + contribution) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Subset Generation:** \(2^n\) for generating subsets.
- **Subset Processing:** For each subset, it takes \(O(n)\) to calculate the sum and contributions.
- **Total Time Complexity:** \(O(2^n \times n^2)\)

Given the constraints, this approach might become infeasible for large `n`, thus further optimizations or approximations could be considered for practical implementations or larger constraints.

However, this solution gives a good starting point by iterating through subsets and applying modular arithmetic to manage large values.
