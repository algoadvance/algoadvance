[Leetcode 1968. Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1968)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of **n** integers, and you need to **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that no element remains at the same position after rearranging. This is referred to as a **derangement**. You need to find any derangement of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the given array have duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate elements.

2. **Is there a size limit to the input array?**
   - According to general constraints, let's assume the length of the array is within reasonable bounds (e.g., 1 to \(10^5\)) which is typical for competitive programming problems.

3. **Do we return a specific result if it's not possible to derange the array?**
   - Since a derangement always exists for arrays of length 2 or greater, we do not need a specific case for returning in this problem.

### Strategy

The problem is to find a derangement of the array, where no element stands in its original position. A simple yet efficient way to achieve this involves the following:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting makes it easier to ensure duplicity handling and easier reordering.
2. **Interchange Halves**: The easiest method post sorting is to find the midpoint of the array, then swap elements from the first half with elements from the second half. This ensures all elements change their positions, avoiding any on their original indices.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle even and odd lengths appropriately, ensuring the last element in case of odd-length is swapped correctly.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> result(n);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
            result[i] = nums[n / 2 + i];
            result[n / 2 + i] = nums[i];
        }
        
        // If odd, the middle element should be handled
        if (n % 2 != 0) {
            result[n - 1] = nums[n / 2];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Rearranging**: \(O(n)\) for reordering operations.

Hence, the overall time complexity of this operation is \(O(n \log n + n)\) which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array**: We first sort the array so that managing swaps and ensuring no element remains in its original position becomes manageable.
2. **Reordering**: We then iterate and swap elements from the first half with the second, ensuring elements move from their original positions.
3. **Completion**: Handle the middle element separately if the input array length is odd.

This ensures we get the required derangement while adhering to the efficient computational constraints.
