[Leetcode 1828. Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1828)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `points` and `queries`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` is a point on the X-Y plane and `queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]` describes a circle centered at `(xj, yj)` with radius `rj`, return an array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the number of points inside the `j-th` query circle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Point on Boundary:** Should points on the boundary of the circle be considered inside the circle?
    - **Answer:** Yes, points on the boundary are considered inside the circle.
2. **Range of Input Values:** What are the constraints on the coordinates and radius values?
    - **Answer:** Generally, constraints for the problem may be:
        - `1 <= points.length, queries.length <= 500`
        - `points[i].length == 2`
        - `queries[j].length == 3`
        - `1 <= xi, yi, xj, yj, rj <= 5000`

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each query.**
2. **For each query, check all points to see if they lie within the circle defined by the query.**
3. **Use the distance formula to determine if a point lies inside or on the boundary of the circle:**
   - For a point \((xi, yi)\) and circle \((xj, yj, rj)\), check if \((xi - xj)^2 + (yi - yj)^2 \leq rj^2\).
4. **Count the number of points satisfying the condition for each query and store these counts in the answer array.**

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> countPoints(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& queries) {
    std::vector<int> answer;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int xj = query[0], yj = query[1], rj = query[2];
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            int xi = point[0], yi = point[1];
            if (std::pow(xi - xj, 2) + std::pow(yi - yj, 2) <= std::pow(rj, 2)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        answer.push_back(count);
    }
    return answer;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot n)\) where \(m\) is the number of queries and \(n\) is the number of points.
  - For each query, we iterate over all points resulting in \(m\) (queries) times \(n\) (points) iterations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) excluding the space used for input and output arrays since no additional significant space is required. 

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints and leverages direct distance comparison for determining point inclusion within circles.
