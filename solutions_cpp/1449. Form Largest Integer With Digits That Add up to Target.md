[Leetcode 1449. Form Largest Integer With Digits That Add up to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1449)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of the ith digit (0-indexed) of a number, and an integer `target`. Return the largest integer you can have with a total cost equal to `target`. 

Since the answer may be very large, return it as a string. If no number is possible, return "0".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the cost array?**
    - The size of the cost array is fixed at 9, corresponding to digits 1 to 9.

2. **Can we have multiple digits with the same cost?**
    - Yes, it is possible that multiple digits have the same cost.

3. **What are the constraints on the `target` value?**
    - `target` is a positive integer value.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (DP)**:
    - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the largest number that can be formed with cost `i`.
    - Initialize the `dp` array with empty strings, and set `dp[0]` to an empty string because a cost of 0 results in an empty number.
    - Iterate over all possible targets from 1 to `target`:
        - For each cost, iterate over all digits (from 1 to 9).
        - If the current target can include the current digit, update the `dp` array.
    - At the end, `dp[target]` contains the largest number that can be formed with the given cost.

2. **Update Rule**:
    - For each valid combination, if using a certain digit yields a larger number (in the lexicographical sense), update the result for the current target.

3. **Handling Special Cases**:
    - If no solution is found by the end of the iterations, return "0".

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation using the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string largestNumber(std::vector<int>& cost, int target) {
    // Initialize dp array with empty strings
    std::vector<std::string> dp(target + 1, "0");
    dp[0] = "";

    // Iterate through each possible target
    for (int t = 1; t <= target; ++t) {
        for (int d = 9; d >= 1; --d) {
            int c = cost[d - 1];
            if (t >= c && dp[t - c] != "0") {
                std::string candidate = dp[t - c] + std::to_string(d);
                if (dp[t] == "0" || candidate.size() > dp[t].size() || candidate > dp[t]) {
                    dp[t] = candidate;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[target];
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> cost = {4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5};
    int target = 9;

    std::string result = largestNumber(cost, target);
    std::cout << "Largest Number: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(target * 9)
    - Each target value from 1 to `target` is processed.
    - For each target value, we iterate over 9 possible digits.
    - Hence it results in O(target * 9) complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: O(target)
    - The `dp` array is of size `target + 1`.

This approach ensures that we systematically construct the largest possible number by examining every valid combination of digits and costs.
