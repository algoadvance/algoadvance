[Leetcode 777. Swap Adjacent in LR String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l777)
### Problem Statement

The problem statement can be found on LeetCode under the title "777. Swap Adjacent in LR String". Below is a summary of the problem statement.

In a string composed of 'L', 'R', and 'X' characters:

- 'L' can move to the left one space.
- 'R' can move to the right one space.
- 'X' can swap with adjacent 'L' or 'R'.

Given two strings `start` and `end`, determine if it's possible to transform the `start` string into the `end` string using a finite number of moves.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the strings always of the same length?**
   - Yes, both `start` and `end` are of the same length.
  
2. **Do the strings only contain the characters 'L', 'R', and 'X'?**
   - Yes, they contain only these three characters.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the transformation is possible if the function returns `true`?**
   - Yes, the function should return `true` only if it's possible to transform `start` to `end`.

### Strategy

1. **Check Length and Characters**: Ensure both strings are of the same length and contain the same set of characters when 'X' is ignored (since 'X' can be both present and moved around freely).

2. **Double Pointer Technique**:
   - Iterate through both strings using two pointers: `i` for `start` and `j` for `end`.
   - Skip all 'X' in both strings.
   - Compare `start[i]` with `end[j]`:
     - If the characters are different, return `false`.
     - If the characters are 'L', ensure `i` is not less than `j` because 'L' can only move left.
     - If the characters are 'R', ensure `i` is not greater than `j` because 'R' can only move right.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool canTransform(std::string start, std::string end) {
    int n = start.size();
    
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    
    while (i < n || j < n) {
        // Skip all 'X' in start
        while (i < n && start[i] == 'X') i++;
        // Skip all 'X' in end
        while (j < n && end[j] == 'X') j++;
        
        // If both pointers reach the end
        if (i == n && j == n) return true;
        
        // If only one of them reaches the end
        if (i == n || j == n) return false;
        
        // If characters are not matching
        if (start[i] != end[j]) return false;
        
        // If characters are 'L'
        if (start[i] == 'L' && i < j) return false;
        
        // If characters are 'R'
        if (start[i] == 'R' && i > j) return false;
        
        // Move both pointers
        i++;
        j++;
    }
    
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string start = "RXXLRXRXL";
    std::string end = "XRLXXRRLX";
    bool result = canTransform(start, end);
    
    std::cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the strings because we are essentially traversing each string once with our pointers.

### Explanation

- We maintain two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `start` and `end`, respectively.
- We skip over 'X' since they can freely move and swap with 'L' and 'R'.
- We compare 'L' and 'R' at each non-'X' character to ensure they follow the move constraints.
- If any constraint is violated, we return false; otherwise, we continue and eventually return true if all conditions are satisfied.

This ensures an efficient check in linear time with respect to the length of the strings.
