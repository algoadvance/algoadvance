[Leetcode 1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1482)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`. You need to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, and each flower blooms in `bloomDay[i]` (i.e. the `i-th` flower will bloom in `bloomDay[i]` days). You need to find out the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

Here are some clarifications that might help in understanding the problem:
1. **Input Range:** What are the constraints on the elements of `bloomDay` array and the values of `m` and `k`?
   - The constraints are:
     - `bloomDay.length == n`
     - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
     - `1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9`
     - `1 <= m <= 10^6`
     - `1 <= k <= n`
   - Note: It is given that `m * k <= n`.

2. **Output:** If it is not possible to form `m` bouquets, should we always return `-1`?
   - Yes, if it is impossible to form the required number of bouquets return `-1`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a **binary search** on the number of days. The idea is as follows:

1. **Binary Search Setup:** 
   - Set the left boundary of the search to the minimum day (`minDay = 1`).
   - Set the right boundary to the maximum bloom day (`maxDay = 10^9`).

2. **Feasibility Check:**
   - For a given day (midpoint), check if it is possible to form `m` bouquets using `k` adjacent flowers that have all bloomed on or before that day.

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - If it is possible to form `m` bouquets by the midpoint day, move the right boundary to midpoint - 1.
   - If it is not possible, move the left boundary to midpoint + 1.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - The smallest day in which we can form the required number of bouquets will be our answer.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canMakeBouquets(vector<int>& bloomDay, int m, int k, int day) {
        int flowers = 0, bouquets = 0;
        for (int bloom : bloomDay) {
            if (bloom <= day) {
                if (++flowers == k) {
                    bouquets++;
                    flowers = 0;
                }
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }
            if (bouquets >= m) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    int minDays(vector<int>& bloomDay, int m, int k) {
        int n = bloomDay.size();
        if (m * k > n) return -1;

        int low = 1, high = *max_element(bloomDay.begin(), bloomDay.end());
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canMakeBouquets(bloomDay, m, k, mid)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The binary search runs in `O(log(maxBloomDay))` where `maxBloomDay` is the maximum possible value of bloom days (which is `10^9`).
- **Feasibility Check:** For each midpoint day, we check if we can create the bouquets in `O(n)` where `n` is the number of flowers.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(maxBloomDay))`. Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough.
