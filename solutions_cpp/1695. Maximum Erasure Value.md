[Leetcode 1695. Maximum Erasure Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1695)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and you want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements. Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements in the array positive?**
   - Yes, all elements in `nums` are positive integers.

2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one element. 

3. **What is the maximum size of the array `nums`?**
   - The array size can be up to `10^5`.

4. **Are there any constraints on the values of the elements within the array?**
   - Each element in the array is a positive integer and can be as large as `10^4`.

With these clarifications, let's proceed to the solution.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique to maintain a window of unique elements. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - A set `unique_elements` to track the unique elements within the current window.
   - Two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current window.
   - A variable `current_sum` to keep track of the sum of elements in the current window.
   - A variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum of any window found so far.

2. **Iterate with the `end` Pointer:**
   - For each `end` position, check if the element `nums[end]` is in `unique_elements`.
   - If it is, move the `start` pointer to the right until `nums[end]` can be added without repeating any element.
   - Update the `current_sum` and `unique_elements` as appropriate.
   - Compare `current_sum` with `max_sum` and update `max_sum` if `current_sum` is greater.

3. **Return Result:**
   - After the iteration, `max_sum` will hold the maximum erasure value.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumUniqueSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_set<int> unique_elements;
        int start = 0, end = 0, current_sum = 0, max_sum = 0;
        
        while (end < nums.size()) {
            // Ensure the element at `end` is not in the current window
            while (unique_elements.find(nums[end]) != unique_elements.end()) {
                unique_elements.erase(nums[start]);
                current_sum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }
            // Add the current element to the window
            unique_elements.insert(nums[end]);
            current_sum += nums[end];
            // Update the max_sum
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_sum);
            end++;
        }
        
        return max_sum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm processes each element at most twice (once when expanding the window with `end` and once when shrinking it with `start`). Since each insertion and deletion in an unordered_set costs `O(1)` on average, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.

- **Space Complexity:** We use extra space for the `unordered_set` which in the worst-case scenario can hold all elements in `nums`. Thus, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum erasure value by leveraging the properties of the sliding window and the `unordered_set` for constant-time membership checks.
