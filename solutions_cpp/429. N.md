[Leetcode 429. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l429)
## Problem Statement

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

An n-ary tree is a tree in which each node has no more than N children. Each node is defined as follows:

```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - Is the root node guaranteed not to be NULL? (Assume yes for now, but if NULL handling is needed, we will check for it).

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be structured as a vector of vectors containing the level-order traversal values?

3. **Constraints:**
   - Can we assume that the number of nodes in the tree is within a reasonable limit so that recursion depth and space constraints are not an issue?

## Strategy

To achieve the level order traversal of an n-ary tree, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. BFS uses a queue to traverse the tree level by level. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step plan:

1. **If the root is NULL, return an empty vector.**
2. **Initialize a result vector to hold the level order traversal.**
3. **Initialize a queue and push the root node into the queue.**
4. **While the queue is not empty:**
   - Get the number of nodes at the current level using the size of the queue.
   - Initialize a temporary vector to hold values of nodes at the current level.
   - Loop through nodes at the current level:
     - Pop the front node from the queue.
     - Add this node's value to the temporary vector.
     - Push all children of this node into the queue.
   - Add the temporary vector to the result vector.
5. **Return the result vector.**

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(Node* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return result;
        }

        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            vector<int> currentLevel;
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                Node* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                currentLevel.push_back(node->val);
                for (Node* child : node->children) {
                    q.push(child);
                }
            }
            result.push_back(currentLevel);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the n-ary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(N)\) in the worst case, which occurs when the tree is a complete tree and the last level contains almost \(N/2\) nodes. This accounts for the space used by the queue.
