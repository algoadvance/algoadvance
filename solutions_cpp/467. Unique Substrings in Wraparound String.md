[Leetcode 467. Unique Substrings in Wraparound String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l467)
### Problem Statement
Consider a string "p" where "p" is a substring of the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...". We need to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of "p" are present in this infinite wraparound string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can "p" contain any characters other than lowercase English alphabets?
    - No, "p" consists of only lowercase English alphabets.
  
2. What is the maximum length of the string "p"?
    - The length of "p" can be up to 100,000.

3. Should the substrings be contiguous in "p"?
    - Yes, substrings are contiguous segments of "p".

### Strategy
1. Define a `dp` array (length 26) such that `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest substring ending with the character `i + 'a'` in the string "p" which forms a contiguous substring in the wraparound alphabet.

2. Iterate through the string "p":
   - For each character, check if it extends a previous contiguous substring (for example, 'c' following 'b'). 
   - Update the `dp` array value for the character if the new length is greater than the existing value.

3. Add up values in the `dp` array to get the total count of unique substrings.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int findSubstringInWraproundString(string p) {
    vector<int> dp(26, 0);  // dp[i] means the maximum unique substring end with 'a' + i

    int n = p.length();
    int maxLengthCur = 0;  // max length of the current valid substring

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i > 0 && (p[i] - p[i-1] == 1 || p[i-1] - p[i] == 25)) {
            // current character is following last character in the wrapround string
            maxLengthCur++;
        } else {
            maxLengthCur = 1;
        }
        int index = p[i] - 'a';
        dp[index] = max(dp[index], maxLengthCur);
    }

    // Sum up all counts in dp array
    int result = 0;
    for (int count : dp) {
        result += count;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string "p". This is because we only make a single pass through the string and perform constant-time operations for each character. The space complexity is O(1) since the `dp` array size is fixed at 26.
