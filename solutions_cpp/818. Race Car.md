## Problem Statement

[Leetcode 818: Race Car](https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car/)

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into reverse gear, which allows it to move in the opposite direction. The car has two possible commands:

- "A" (accelerate): Positions the car at `position + speed`, and increases the speed by doubling (i.e., `speed` becomes `speed * 2`).
- "R" (reverse): Reverse the direction of the car. If the car is moving forward, then it makes the car move backwards by setting `speed` to `-1`. If it is moving backwards, then it changes the speed to `1`.

The car starts at position 0 with speed 1. You are given a target position. Return the length of the shortest sequence of commands to reach the target position.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Is the target position always a positive integer?
   **A**: Yes, assume the target position is always a positive integer for this problem.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the maximum value of the target?
   **A**: Constraints are provided in the problem statement. Typically, target can go up to 10000.

3. **Q**: Can we overshoot the target position and still be able to reverse and reach the target?
   **A**: Yes, overshooting is allowed, and reversing may be needed based on the optimal path.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy that explores the state space of position and speed. Each state can be represented as a tuple `(position, speed)`. 

1. Initialize a queue for BFS starting from position `0` and speed `1`.
2. Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid reprocessing the same state.
3. While processing each state from the queue:
   - Apply the "A" command to get the new state `(new_position = position + speed, new_speed = speed * 2)`.
   - Apply the "R" command to get the reversed state `(same_position = position, new_speed = speed > 0 ? -1 : 1)`.
   - Check if the new state meets the target, if yes, return the number of commands taken.
   - If not, enqueue the unvisited new states and mark them as visited.
  
This ensures that the shortest sequence of commands is found due to the nature of BFS.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int racecar(int target) {
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;  // (position, speed)
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    q.push({0, 1});
    visited.insert("0,1");
    
    int steps = 0;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int size = q.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            auto [pos, speed] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if (pos == target) {
                return steps;
            }
            
            // Accelerate
            int newPos = pos + speed;
            int newSpeed = speed * 2;
            string accelState = to_string(newPos) + "," + to_string(newSpeed);
            if (!visited.count(accelState) && newPos > 0 && newPos < 2 * target) {
                q.push({newPos, newSpeed});
                visited.insert(accelState);
            }
            
            // Reverse
            newSpeed = speed > 0 ? -1 : 1;
            string reverseState = to_string(pos) + "," + to_string(newSpeed);
            if (!visited.count(reverseState)) {
                q.push({pos, newSpeed});
                visited.insert(reverseState);
            }
        }
        ++steps;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int target = 3;
    cout << "Minimum number of commands to reach target " << target << " is: " << racecar(target) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is difficult to predict exactly due to the branching factor in BFS and the possible number of unique states, but it is generally considered to be exponential in terms of the worst-case number of unique states (position, speed) pairs. Given the constraints, this solution is capable of handling targets up to 10000 efficiently.
