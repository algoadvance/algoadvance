[Leetcode 2806. Account Balance After Rounded Purchase](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2806)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer representing the initial balance in a bank account. You need to implement a function that simulates a purchase. After a purchase, the balance will be reduced. However, due to some promotion, the purchase amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 before being subtracted from the account balance.

Write a function `int calculateBalance(int balance, int purchaseAmount)` that takes two integer arguments: the initial balance and the purchase amount. The function should return the remaining balance after subtracting the rounded purchase amount.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should happen if the purchase amount is greater than the balance?**
   - Assume purchases are valid and will always be less than or equal to the balance for simplification.

2. **How should we handle rounding of the purchase amount?**
   - Round to the nearest multiple of 10:
     - Examples:
       - 5 rounds to 10
       - 13 rounds to 10
       - 25 rounds to 30
       - 27 rounds to 30

3. **Will the purchase amount and balance always be positive integers?**
   - For simplicity, yes, you can assume both are positive integers.

### Code

```cpp
#include <cmath>

int calculateBalance(int balance, int purchaseAmount) {
    // Round the purchaseAmount to the nearest multiple of 10.
    int roundedPurchase = round(purchaseAmount / 10.0) * 10;
    
    // Calculate the remaining balance.
    int remainingBalance = balance - roundedPurchase;
    
    return remainingBalance;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Rounding**:
   - Use the standard `round` function which rounds to the nearest integer. 
   - To round to the nearest multiple of 10, divide the purchase amount by 10, round it, then multiply back by 10.

2. **Subtract and Return**:
   - Once the rounded value is determined, subtract it from the initial balance and return the result.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity for this operation is O(1). The calculations involved (division, rounding, multiplication, and subtraction) are all constant time operations.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space to store intermediate variables.
