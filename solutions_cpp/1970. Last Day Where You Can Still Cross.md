[Leetcode 1970. Last Day Where You Can Still Cross](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1970)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `cells` where `cells[i] = [ri, ci]` represents that a cell `(ri, ci)` will become a land on the `i-th` day. You must find the last day `k` (1-indexed) on which you can still walk from the top to the bottom by only walking on land cells.

You can start at any cell in the top row and walk through neighboring cells (i.e., left, right, up, or down) to reach the bottom row. You return the last day when you can still walk from the top to the bottom.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How big can the matrix be?**
   - The dimensions of the matrix `m` and `n` can be up to `2 * 10^4`.
   
2. **Can we assume that walking is possible initially and the land cells appear incrementally?**
   - Although we need to determine if it's possible each day, not necessarily every configuration will remain walkable. We can assume that the input for cells is ordered by the days.

3. **What kind of visual representation could we use to convey our solution?**
   - A visual representation could involve marking paths on the matrix day-by-day or using union-find or BFS/DFS algorithms to determine connected components.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a binary search in combination with a flood-fill technique (either BFS or DFS) to determine the feasibility of walking from the top to the bottom on a given day. 

The logic is:

1. **Binary Search on the days**: Use binary search to find the latest day where walking from the top to the bottom is possible.
2. **Flood-Fill Technique**: Utilize a flood fill algorithm (either BFS or DFS) to check if there is a path from any cell in the top row to any cell in the bottom row for a given day.

### Code

Here is the solution for the problem, making use of binary search and BFS:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> directions = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    bool canCross(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int m, int n) {
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[0][j] == 1) {
                q.push({0, j});
                grid[0][j] = -1; // Mark as visited
            }
        }
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (x == m - 1) return true; // If we've reached the last row
            
            for (const auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                    grid[nx][ny] = -1; // Mark as visited
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    int latestDayToCross(int row, int col, vector<vector<int>>& cells) {
        int left = 1, right = cells.size();
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = right - (right - left) / 2;
            vector<vector<int>> grid(row, vector<int>(col, 0));
            
            for (int i = 0; i < mid; ++i) {
                grid[cells[i][0] - 1][cells[i][1] - 1] = 1;
            }
            
            if (canCross(grid, row, col)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search**: `O(log(cells.size()))`
2. **Flood-Fill (BFS)**: In the worst case, it visits all cells in `m*n` time. This occurs for each step of binary search.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * log(cells.size()))`
