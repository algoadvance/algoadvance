[Leetcode 354. Russian Doll Envelopes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l354)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D array of integers representing the dimensions of envelopes. An envelope is represented as a pair of integers `(width, height)`. One envelope can fit inside another if and only if both the width and height of the first envelope are smaller than those of the second envelope.

Your task is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Sorting Order**: How should envelopes with equal widths be treated?
   - **Answer**: When two envelopes have the same width, the one with the greater height should come first because we cannot have envelopes with the same width nested within each other.

2. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the envelopes? 
   - **Answer**: The size of the 2D array will be within the range `[1, 5000]` and the values of width and height are positive integers.

3. **Edge Cases**: Can there be multiple envelopes with the exact same dimensions?
   - **Answer**: Yes, but they cannot be used to nest within each other.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the envelopes first by their width in ascending order.
   - For envelopes with the same width, sort by their height in descending order.

2. **Dynamic Programming / Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**:
   - Once sorted, we can reduce the problem to finding the longest increasing subsequence based on the heights of the sorted envelopes.
   - Use a dynamic programming approach or a binary search method to determine the LIS of the heights to achieve an optimal solution.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxEnvelopes(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& envelopes) {
        if (envelopes.empty()) return 0;
        
        // Sort the envelopes, first by width (ascending), and then by height (descending)
        std::sort(envelopes.begin(), envelopes.end(), [](const std::pair<int, int>& a, const std::pair<int, int>& b) {
            return a.first == b.first ? a.second > b.second : a.first < b.first;
        });
        
        // Extract the heights and find the LIS in the height dimension
        std::vector<int> heights;
        for (auto& envelope : envelopes) {
            heights.push_back(envelope.second);
        }
        
        // Find LIS in heights
        std::vector<int> dp;
        for (int height : heights) {
            auto it = std::lower_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), height);
            if (it == dp.end()) {
                dp.push_back(height);
            } else {
                *it = height;
            }
        }
        
        return dp.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> envelopes = \{\{5,4},{6,4},{6,7},{2,3}};
    std::cout << sol.maxEnvelopes(envelopes) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
- **LIS Calculation**: Extracting the heights and finding the LIS using binary search also has a complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Summary
This solution effectively first sorts the envelopes to ensure that we can apply the LIS method on the heights. By sorting, we guarantee an optimal ordering to find the maximum sequence of envelopes that can be nested inside each other. This approach is efficient and well-suited to the problem constraints.
