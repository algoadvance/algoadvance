[Leetcode 2400. Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2400)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `startPos` and `endPos` representing the start and end positions on an infinite 1D line, and an integer `k` representing the number of steps you can take. Each step you can move either 1 position to the left or 1 position to the right.

Return the number of different ways to reach the `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of `startPos`, `endPos`, and `k`?**
   - Yes, typically `-1000 <= startPos, endPos <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`.

2. **Can we assume that `k` will be a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, `k` will be a non-negative integer.

3. **Do the steps need to reach exactly to `endPos`?**
   - Yes, you must reach `endPos` exactly after `k` steps. Overshooting or undershooting in steps is not allowed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a memoization technique to store intermediate subproblems and then build the solution using these subproblems.

1. **State Representation:**
   - Let `dp[step][pos]` represent the number of ways to reach position `pos` from `startPos` in `step` steps.

2. **State Transition:**
   - For each position `pos` at step `step`, you can reach it either from `pos + 1` or `pos - 1` in the previous step.
   - Hence, `dp[step][pos] = dp[step - 1][pos - 1] + dp[step - 1][pos + 1]`.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Initialize `dp[0][startPos]` to 1 because the number of ways to be at `startPos` with 0 steps is 1.

4. **Final State:**
   - The result will be `dp[k][endPos]` representing the number of ways to reach `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(int startPos, int endPos, int k) {
        int offset = 1000; // we use this offset to handle negative positions
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(4001, 0));
        
        // Base Case
        dp[0][startPos + offset] = 1;
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int step = 1; step <= k; ++step) {
            for (int pos = 0; pos <= 4000; ++pos) {
                if (pos > 0)
                    dp[step][pos] += dp[step - 1][pos - 1];
                if (pos < 4000)
                    dp[step][pos] += dp[step - 1][pos + 1];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][endPos + offset];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int startPos = 2, endPos = 5, k = 3;
    cout << solution.numberOfWays(startPos, endPos, k) << endl; // Output should match the expected result
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - We use an offset to adjust for negative positions.
   - Initialize `dp[0][startPos + offset]` to 1 because you are at the start position initially without any steps.

2. **DP Table Filling:**
   - Iterate through all steps from 1 to `k`.
   - For each position, aggregate the ways from the previous step either from left (`pos-1`) or right (`pos+1`).

3. **Return the Result:**
   - The final number of ways to reach `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps is found in `dp[k][endPos + offset]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(k * n)` where `n` is the range of positions we need to consider, in this case, `4001`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(k * n)` due to the DP table size.

This approach efficiently solves the problem using dynamic programming and memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
