[Leetcode 2455. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2455)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by `3`. If there are no such integers, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should the function return if the array is empty?
   - **A:** The function should return `0` since there are no integers to consider.

2. **Q:** What if there are no even integers in the array?
   - **A:** The function should return `0` if there are no even integers divisible by `3`.

3. **Q:** How should the average be calculated and returned considering integer arithmetic?
   - **A:** The average should be calculated as a floating-point value, but since we are dealing with array elements which are integers, we can use integer division for this specific problem.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array**: Iterate over each element in the array and check if it is both even and divisible by `3`.
2. **Sum and Count**: Maintain a sum variable to accumulate the qualifying values and a count variable to keep track of the number of such values.
3. **Calculate average**: After processing all elements, calculate the average if the count is greater than `0`; otherwise, return `0`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int averageValue(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 6 == 0) {
                sum += num;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count > 0 ? sum / count : 0;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `sum` to `0` and `count` to `0`.
2. **Loop Through Numbers**: We loop through each number in the array:
   - Check if the number is divisible by both `2` and `3` which is equivalent to checking `num % 6 == 0`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, add the number to `sum` and increment `count`.
3. **Calculate Average**: After the loop, if `count` is greater than `0`, we return the integer division result of `sum` divided by `count`. Otherwise, we return `0`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. We only make one pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space (for `sum` and `count`).

This solution is efficient and concise, adhering to the requirements of the problem.
