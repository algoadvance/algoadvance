[Leetcode 1748. Sum of Unique Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1748)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of all the unique elements of `nums`. An element of `nums` is unique if it appears exactly once in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** What is the maximum size of the array?
   - Typically, constraints might be stated in the problem. If not, assume a reasonable size, for instance, up to 10,000 elements.
   
2. **Element Range:** What are the values of individual elements in the array?
   - Usually, elements are within a certain range like `-1000` to `1000`, but confirm this if possible.
   
3. **Time Complexity:** Are there any specific time complexity constraints?
   - Aim for a solution that is efficient, ideally O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Use a hash map (unordered_map) to store the count of each element in the array.
2. Traverse the array and populate the hash map with the frequency of each element.
3. Traverse the hash map to sum up elements that have a frequency of exactly 1.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int sumOfUnique(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
    
    // Populate frequency map
    for(const int& num : nums) {
        freqMap[num]++;
    }
    
    int sum = 0;
    // Sum up elements with frequency exactly 1
    for(const auto& entry : freqMap) {
        if(entry.second == 1) {
            sum += entry.first;
        }
    }
    
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 2};
    std::cout << "Sum of unique elements: " << sumOfUnique(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The approach involves two passes over the `nums`:
  1. First pass to populate the frequency map: O(n)
  2. Second pass to sum the unique elements from the hash map: O(n)
  Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** We use extra space to store the frequency of each element. In the worst case, this space is proportional to the number of unique elements, which is O(n). Thus, the space complexity is O(n).
