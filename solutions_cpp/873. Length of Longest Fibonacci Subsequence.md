[Leetcode 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l873)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, return the length of the longest Fib-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return `0`.

A sequence `X1, X2, ..., Xn` is a Fib-like sequence if:

* `n >= 3`
* `Xi + Xi+1 = Xi+2` for all `i + 2 <= n`

A subsequence is derived from another sequence `arr` by deleting some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3, 5, 8]` is a subsequence of `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of input length?
    - What are the values of the integers in `arr`?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should the output be the length of the longest subsequence, or the subsequence itself?

3. **Duplicates**:
    - How should duplicates be handled? Should we consider only distinct subsequences, or do duplicates affect the result?

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Use a hash table (or set) to quickly check the existence of previous elements.
2. Utilize dynamic programming (DP) to build potential sequences.

### Steps
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a set to store all elements of the array for quick look-up.
   - Define a DP dictionary, where `dp[i, j]` represents the length of the Fibonacci-like subsequence ending with elements `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Loop through each pair of indices `(i, j)` and check if there exists an earlier index `k` such that `arr[k] + arr[i] == arr[j]`. If it exists, update the DP state.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The length of the longest valid subsequence is found by taking the maximum value in the DP table, ensuring it is at least 3, or return 0 otherwise.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2 log M)` where `N` is the length of the array and `M` is the maximum number in `arr`. The `log M` comes from the set operations.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N^2)` for the DP dictionary and set operations.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int lenLongestFibSubseq(vector<int>& arr) {
    unordered_set<int> S(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    unordered_map<int, int> dp;
    int n = arr.size();
    int maxLen = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            int a = arr[i];
            int b = arr[j];
            int len = 2;
            while (S.find(a + b) != S.end()) {
                int c = a + b;
                a = b;
                b = c;
                ++len;
            }
            maxLen = max(maxLen, len);
        }
    }
    // We need at least three elements to form a sequence
    return maxLen >= 3 ? maxLen : 0;
}
```

This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate through index pairs and a while-loop to extend the potential Fibonacci subsequence. It ensures to keep track of the longest sequence found and checks if it meets the minimum required length of 3.
