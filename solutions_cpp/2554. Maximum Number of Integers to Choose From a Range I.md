[Leetcode 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2554)
## Problem Statement

You have a range of integers `low` to `high` inclusive and a positive integer `n`. Your task is to select exactly `n` integers from the range `[low, high]` such that the difference between any two integers among the chosen integers is not divisible by `n`.

You need to return the maximum number of integers you can choose under these conditions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `low` be greater than `high`?**
   - No, `low` will always be less than or equal to `high`.

2. **Can `n` be greater than the number of integers in the range `[low, high]`?**
   - Yes, `n` can be greater than the number of integers in the range `[low, high]`.

3. **What constraints should we consider for the values of `low`, `high`, and `n`?**
   - Typical constraint values are `1 <= low <= high <= 10^4` and `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

4. **Can there be negative values for `low` and `high`?**
   - No, the constraints indicate positive integers.

## Strategy

1. Calculate the total numbers in the range `[low, high]`.
2. If the number of integers in the range is less than or equal to `n`, we can return this count as the answer since we can choose each number without worrying about divisibility by `n`.
3. If `n` is greater than the range size, the maximum number will be the range size itself.
4. If not, we need to maximize the number of integers chosen so that no two numbers have a difference divisible by `n`. 
   - For every number `x` we select in such a way, the next number we select must be such that:
     - `(x + kn) % n != 0` for any integer `k`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int maxCount(int low, int high, int n) {
    int rangeSize = high - low + 1;
    
    // If the range size is less than or equal to n, return the range size.
    if (rangeSize <= n) {
        return rangeSize;
    }
    
    // Otherwise, calculate maximum possible integers we can choose
    // We fill groups of size `n`
    // Start from minimum of low to high divisible by `n`
    
    int maxNumbers = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (low + i <= high) {
            maxNumbers++;
        }
    }
    
    return maxNumbers;
}

int main() {
    int low = 1;
    int high = 10;
    int n = 3;
    std::cout << "Max number of integers: " << maxCount(low, high, n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because the range `[low, high]` and the integer `n` are analyzed in constant time, and we only perform a fixed number of operations independent of the size of the input. The loop runs a fixed number (`n` times) of iterations, which is independent of the range size.
