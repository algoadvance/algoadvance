[Leetcode 2894. Divisible and Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2894)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the sum of the elements in the array that are divisible by `k`, minus the sum of the elements in the array that are not divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
   
2. What should be the output if the array is empty?
   - If the array is empty, the output should be `0`.

3. Can `k` be zero?
   - No, `k` will always be a non-zero integer.

4. What is the range of the integers in the array?
   - The elements in the array and the value of `k` can be within the typical range of 32-bit integers.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two variables to store the sums:
   - `divisible_sum` for elements divisible by `k`.
   - `non_divisible_sum` for elements not divisible by `k`.

2. Traverse through each element of the array:
   - If the element is divisible by `k`, add it to `divisible_sum`.
   - Otherwise, add it to `non_divisible_sum`.

3. Return the difference between `divisible_sum` and `non_divisible_sum`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int sumDifference(const std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int divisible_sum = 0;
    int non_divisible_sum = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num % k == 0) {
            divisible_sum += num;
        } else {
            non_divisible_sum += num;
        }
    }
    
    return divisible_sum - non_divisible_sum;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are traversing the array once to compute the sums.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of extra space for the sum variables.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, handling negative numbers and various edge cases as well.
