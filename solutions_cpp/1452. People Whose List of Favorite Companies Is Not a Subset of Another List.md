[Leetcode 1452. People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1452)
### Problem Statement

Given the array `favoriteCompanies` where `favoriteCompanies[i]` is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0), return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorite companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the number of people and companies they like? 
   - Are all provided company names unique across lists?
   
2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the output indices be sorted in ascending order?

3. **Company Names and Case-Sensitivity:**
   - Are company names case-sensitive? 

4. **Data Types:**
   - Are company names guaranteed to be string types?

### Strategy

1. **Transformation to Sets:**
   - Convert each individual's list of companies into a set for easier subset comparisons.

2. **Subset Comparison:**
   - For each person, compare their set to every other person's set to check if it is a subset.

3. **Efficient Checking:**
   - Use a nested loop where for each person, iterate over all other people to check for subset containment.
   - If a person's list isnâ€™t a subset of any other list, include their index in the result.

4. **Sorting:**
   - Ensure the indices are sorted in ascending order before returning the result.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> peopleIndexes(std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>& favoriteCompanies) {
        int n = favoriteCompanies.size();
        std::vector<std::unordered_set<std::string>> sets(n);
        
        // Transform each list to a set
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            sets[i] = std::unordered_set<std::string>(favoriteCompanies[i].begin(), favoriteCompanies[i].end());
        }
        
        std::vector<int> res;
        
        // Check for each person
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            bool isSubset = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i != j && isSubsetOf(sets[i], sets[j])) {
                    isSubset = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isSubset) {
                res.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        std::sort(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }

private:
    bool isSubsetOf(const std::unordered_set<std::string>& set1, const std::unordered_set<std::string>& set2) {
        // Check if set1 is a subset of set2
        for (const auto& s : set1) {
            if (set2.find(s) == set2.end()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Set Conversion:**
   - Converting `favoriteCompanies[i]` to a set has a complexity of O(m), where m is the average size of the list.

2. **Subset Checking:**
   - Checking if one set is a subset of another set can take O(m) in the worst case.

3. **Overall Comparison:**
   - Since each person's list is compared with every other list, the total complexity is O(n^2 * m), where `n` is the number of people and `m` is the average number of companies in each person's list.

4. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the result indices at the end takes O(n log n).

Combining these steps, the overall time complexity remains O(n^2 * m).
