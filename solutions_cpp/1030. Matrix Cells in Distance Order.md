[Leetcode 1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1030)
### Problem Statement

You are given four integers `rows`, `cols`, `rCenter`, and `cCenter`. There is a `rows x cols` matrix and you are sitting in the cell `(rCenter, cCenter)`.

Return the matrix cells in the order of their distances from `(rCenter, cCenter)` â€” ordered from the smallest distance to the largest distance. Here, the distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is defined as the Manhattan Distance: `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `rows`, `cols`, `rCenter`, and `cCenter`?**
   - `1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
   - `0 <= rCenter < rows`
   - `0 <= cCenter < cols`
   
2. **Can multiple cells have the same distance to `(rCenter, cCenter)`?**
   - Yes, multiple cells can have the same distance to the center cell.

3. **How should cells with the same distance be ordered?**
   - Any order works as long as cells are sorted by distance.

With these clarifications, let's proceed to the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Cells**: Create a list of all cells with their coordinates.
2. **Calculate Distances**: Compute the Manhattan Distance of each cell from `(rCenter, cCenter)`.
3. **Sort Cells**: Sort the list of cells based on their distances.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the sorted list of cells.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> allCellsDistOrder(int rows, int cols, int rCenter, int cCenter) {
        vector<vector<int>> cells;
        
        // Generate all cells in the matrix
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c) {
                cells.push_back({r, c});
            }
        }
        
        // Sort cells based on Manhattan distance
        sort(cells.begin(), cells.end(), [&](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            int distA = abs(a[0] - rCenter) + abs(a[1] - cCenter);
            int distB = abs(b[0] - rCenter) + abs(b[1] - cCenter);
            return distA < distB;
        });
        
        return cells;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating All Cells**: O(rows * cols), where we generate a list of size `rows * cols`.
- **Sorting Cells**: O((rows * cols) * log(rows * cols)), due to sorting the list of cells.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is O((rows * cols) * log(rows * cols)).

### Space Complexity

- **Space for Storing Cells**: O(rows * cols), as we store the list of all cells.

Thus, the space complexity is O(rows * cols).
