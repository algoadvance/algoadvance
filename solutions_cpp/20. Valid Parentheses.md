[Leetcode 20. Valid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l20)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{', '}`, `'['`, and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string be empty?
   - Yes, an empty string is considered valid.
2. What is the maximum length of the string?
   - There is no explicit constraint, but we can assume it fits in memory (typically, up to \(10^4\) characters).

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an empty stack to keep track of open brackets.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Traverse the input string character by character.
   - For each character:
     - If it's an opening bracket (`'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), push it onto the stack.
     - If it's a closing bracket (`')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), check the stack:
       - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the matching opening bracket, return `false`.
       - Otherwise, pop the stack.
   
3. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, return `true` (all open brackets were matched); otherwise, return `false`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>

bool isValid(std::string s) {
    std::stack<char> stack;
    std::unordered_map<char, char> matchingBrackets = {
        {')', '('},
        {'}', '{'},
        {']', '['}
    };

    for(char c : s) {
        if(matchingBrackets.count(c)) {
            if(stack.empty() || stack.top() != matchingBrackets[c]) {
                return false;
            }
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(c);
        }
    }

    return stack.empty();
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "()[]{}"; // Change the string according to your test case
    if(isValid(s)) {
        std::cout << "The string is valid." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The string is not valid." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse the string once, performing constant time operations for each character.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - In the worst case, all characters are pushed onto the stack.
