[Leetcode 279. Perfect Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l279)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `8` are not.

### Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: `n = 12`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4

- Example 2:
  - Input: `n = 13`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - Typical constraint on the problem can be assumed as `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

2. **Allowed Time Complexity**: Is there any guideline for the expected time complexity to solve the problem?
   - This problem typically expects a Polynomial or better complexity, dynamic programming solution with O(n √n) complexity is common.

3. **Output**: What should the function return if `n` is already a perfect square?
   - If `n` is a perfect square, it should return `1` because only one perfect square is needed to sum to `n`.

## Strategy

We will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. The idea is to build a DP table where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of perfect squares summing to `i`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0]` to `0` because 0 perfect squares sum up to `0`. Initialize other positions `dp[1]` to `dp[n]` to infinity (`INT_MAX`) as they are to be computed.

2. **Iterations**: For each number from `1` to `n`, we check all smaller perfect squares (e.g., `1`, `4`, `9`, ...) and update our `dp` array based on previous results.

3. **Transition Relation**: For a given `i`, the value of `dp[i]` can be derived from the minimum value of `dp[i - j*j] + 1` for each perfect square `j*j` less than or equal to `i`.

4. **Final Output**: The final value `dp[n]` will be our answer.

## Code

Let's implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numSquares(int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;  // Base case: 0 numbers to sum to 0
        
        // Precompute the square numbers
        vector<int> squares;
        for (int i = 1; i * i <= n; ++i) {
            squares.push_back(i * i);
        }
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int square : squares) {
                if (i - square >= 0) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1);
                } else {
                    break;  // No need to check further as squares are sorted
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n √n), where `n` is the input integer. This comes from the nested loops: the outer loop runs `n` times, and the inner loop (which iterates through perfect squares) runs up to √n times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), needed for the `dp` array to store computations for all intermediate results.

This solution guarantees that the problem is solved efficiently within the typical constraints for `n`.
