[Leetcode 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1584)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the Manhattan distance between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: How many points can we expect in the array?**
   - A: The length of the array can be up to 1000 points.

2. **Q: Can points have the same coordinates?**
   - A: No, each point will have unique coordinates.

3. **Q: Are negative coordinates allowed for the points?**
   - A: Yes, coordinates can be negative.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) approach, specifically Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm. Given the constraint, Prim's algorithm is more efficient, since Kruskal's requires edge sorting which could take `O(N^2 log N)` time due to the dense graph representation.

**Steps for Prim's algorithm**:
1. Initialize a min-heap to keep track of the minimum edge weight.
2. Start from an arbitrary point and add its edge weights to the heap.
3. Use a boolean array to keep track of visited points.
4. Continuously extract the minimum edge from the heap, and add its cost to the total cost.
5. For every extracted point, add all the unvisited points connected to it to the heap.
6. Repeat until all points are visited.

## Code

Here is the implementation of Prim's algorithm for this problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCostConnectPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Min-heap to store the edges and their costs
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> minHeap;

        // Array to keep track of visited points
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        // We start with the first point
        minHeap.emplace(0, 0); // cost 0, point index 0
        int totalCost = 0;
        int edgesUsed = 0;

        while (edgesUsed < n) {
            auto [cost, point] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();

            // If the point is already visited, continue to the next point
            if (visited[point]) continue;
            
            // Mark the point as visited
            visited[point] = true;
            totalCost += cost;
            edgesUsed++;

            // Add all non-visited points connected to the current point to the heap
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (!visited[i]) {
                    int manhattanDistance = abs(points[point][0] - points[i][0]) + abs(points[point][1] - points[i][1]);
                    minHeap.emplace(manhattanDistance, i);
                }
            }
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the min-heap**: In the worst case, we add each edge to the min-heap at most once, which takes \(O(N \log N)\).
- **Extracting from the min-heap**: Each extraction operation takes \(O(\log N)\) time. Since this occurs in a loop running \(N\) times, it also contributes \(O(N \log N)\).
- **Overall complexity**: The overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

In conclusion, this approach efficiently computes the minimum cost to connect all points using Prim's algorithm, ensuring all points are connected with minimal edge costs based on Manhattan distances.
