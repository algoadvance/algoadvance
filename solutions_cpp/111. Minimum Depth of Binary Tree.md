[Leetcode 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l111)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

A leaf is a node with no children.

For example, given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its minimum depth which is 2.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the binary tree be empty (i.e., the root is `nullptr`)?**
   - Yes, it's possible.
2. **What should be returned if the tree is empty?**
   - Return `0` since there are no nodes in the tree.

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - The BFS approach is ideal here as it explores nodes level by level.
   - We can use a queue to perform level-order traversal and stop as soon as we encounter the first leaf node.
   - This approach ensures that we find the shortest path to a leaf node efficiently.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Alternatively, we could consider a recursive DFS solution.
   - We would explore each path from the root to the leaves, keeping track of the minimum depth.

Let's implement the BFS approach for simplicity and efficiency in finding the shortest path.

### Code
```cpp
#include <queue>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;
        
        std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int depth = 1;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* currentNode = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                // Check if it's a leaf node
                if (currentNode->left == nullptr && currentNode->right == nullptr) {
                    return depth;
                }
                
                // Add left and right children to the queue if they exist
                if (currentNode->left != nullptr) q.push(currentNode->left);
                if (currentNode->right != nullptr) q.push(currentNode->right);
            }
            ++depth; // Increment depth at the end of each level
        }
        
        return depth;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(N) \)
  - Each node is visited once in the BFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(N) \)
  - In the worst case, the queue will hold nodes at the current level, potentially holding up to \( N/2 \) nodes if the tree is perfectly balanced.
