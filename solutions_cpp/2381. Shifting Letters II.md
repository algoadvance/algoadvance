[Leetcode 2381. Shifting Letters II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2381)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and a 2D integer array `shifts`, where `shifts[i] = [start_i, end_i, direction_i]`. For each `i`, shift the characters in `s` from the index `start_i` to the index `end_i` (inclusive) forward if `direction_i` is 1, or backward if `direction_i` is 0, by one unit.

Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next character in the alphabet (with 'z' wrapping around to 'a'), and shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous character in the alphabet (with 'a' wrapping around to 'z').

Return the final string after all such shifts are applied to `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of `s` and `shifts`?**
   - Each `shifts[i]` is of length 3.
   - The length of `s` can be up to \(10^5\).
   - The number of shifts (number of rows in `shifts`) can be up to \(10^5\).

2. **Can we assume lowercase English letters only in `s`?**
   - Yes.

3. **Can `start_i` and `end_i` values be out of order or in any sequence?**
   - Yes, they can be in any order.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a difference array:** This array will help us mark the start and end of the shifts efficiently.
2. **Apply shifts:** We'll iterate through the `shifts` array and update the difference array accordingly:
   - For shifting forward (direction 1), increment at `start_i` and decrement at `end_i + 1` (if within bounds).
   - For shifting backward (direction 0), decrement at `start_i` and increment at `end_i + 1` (if within bounds).
3. **Accumulate differences:** Convert the difference array into a cumulative sum to get the effective shift at each character position.
4. **Shift characters:** Finally, create the resulting string by shifting each character according to the values in the cumulative array.

### Time Complexity
- **Initializing and processing the difference array:** \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string and \(m\) is the number of shifts.
- **Updating the string according to shifts:** \(O(n)\).
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m)\).

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string shiftingLetters(string s, vector<vector<int>>& shifts) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> diff(n + 1, 0);  // Difference array for shift counts
        
        // Process each shift
        for (const vector<int>& shift : shifts) {
            int start = shift[0], end = shift[1], direction = shift[2];
            if (direction == 1) {
                diff[start]++;
                if (end + 1 < n) diff[end + 1]--;
            } else {
                diff[start]--;
                if (end + 1 < n) diff[end + 1]++;
            }
        }
        
        // Compute the cumulative shift
        int cumulativeShift = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cumulativeShift += diff[i];
            int shiftValue = cumulativeShift % 26;
            if (shiftValue < 0) shiftValue += 26;
            s[i] = 'a' + (s[i] - 'a' + shiftValue) % 26;
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
```

This code first sets up a difference array to keep track of shifts, then accumulates these shifts to apply the net effect on each character in the string, ensuring both efficiency and correctness.
