[Leetcode 1014. Best Sightseeing Pair](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1014)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `values` where `values[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` sightseeing spot. A pair of sightseeing spots `(i, j)` has a score defined as `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` (where `i < j`). 

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:** Are the values always positive integers?
   - Yes, the array `values` only contains positive integers.
   
2. **Size of `values`:** What can be the maximum size of the input array `values`?
   - The array `values` can have a length between 2 to 50,000, inclusive.

3. **Can `i` and `j` be the same index?**
   - No, `i` and `j` must be distinct indices with `i < j`.

4. **Can I use extra space?**
   - Yes, you can use extra space if needed, but the goal is to optimize both time and space complexity.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, consider breaking down the score formula:
\[ \text{score}(i, j) = values[i] + values[j] + i - j \]

This can be re-arranged as:
\[ \text{score}(i, j) = (values[i] + i) + (values[j] - j) \]

Here, instead of checking all possible pairs `(i, j)`, we maintain a running maximum of the term `(values[i] + i)` as we iterate through the array (for possible `values[j]`).

1. **Initialize a variable** `max_i_plus_i` to store the maximum value of `values[i] + i` found so far, starting from the first element.
2. **Iterate** through the array starting from the second element:
   - Calculate the score for the current index `j` using `max_i_plus_i + values[j] - j`.
   - Update the overall maximum score if the current score is higher.
   - Update `max_i_plus_i` if `values[j] + j` is greater than the current `max_i_plus_i`.

This strategy ensures we only pass through the array once, making the solution linear in time complexity.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxScoreSightseeingPair(vector<int>& values) {
        int max_i_plus_i = values[0]; // Initial value for previous maximum `values[i] + i`
        int max_score = INT_MIN;      // To track the maximum score
        
        for (int j = 1; j < values.size(); ++j) {
            // Calculate the score of the pair `i, j`
            int curr_score = max_i_plus_i + values[j] - j;
            // Update the maximum score if current is greater
            max_score = max(max_score, curr_score);
            // Update the max_i_plus_i for the next iteration
            max_i_plus_i = max(max_i_plus_i, values[j] + j);
        }
        
        return max_score;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the `values` array. This is because we make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures efficient computation of the maximum score for sightseeing pairs in linear time.
