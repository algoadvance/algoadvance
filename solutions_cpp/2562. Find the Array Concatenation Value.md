[Leetcode 2562. Find the Array Concatenation Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2562)
## Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, the concatenation value of `nums` is initially empty. Initially, the length of `nums` is `n`.

Perform the following steps until `nums` becomes empty:

1. If there is only one element in `nums`, move the final element to the concatenation value.
2. Otherwise, choose a pair of elements from `nums`, the first being the leftmost element and the second being the rightmost element.
3. Remove both elements from `nums` and add their concatenation to the concatenation value.

The concatenation of two integers means the concatenated form of their string representations. For example, if the left number is 12 and the right number is 34, the concatenation is "1234".

Return the concatenation value as an integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size:** What is the maximum possible size of the `nums` array?
2. **Input values:** Are the elements in `nums` always positive integers?
3. **Output specifics:** The final output should be an integer formed by concatenating pairs.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long findTheArrayConcVal(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size() - 1;
        string result = "";

        while (left <= right) {
            if (left == right) {
                result += to_string(nums[left]);
            } else {
                result += to_string(nums[left]) + to_string(nums[right]);
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return stoll(result);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    cout << sol.findTheArrayConcVal(nums) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end of the array.
2. **Loop until pointers cross:** 
   - If there is only one element left (i.e., `left` equals `right`), append this single element's string representation to the result.
   - Otherwise, concatenate the string representation of the leftmost and rightmost elements and append them to the result string.
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left to process the next pair of elements.
3. **Return the result:** Convert the final concatenated string to a number using `stoll()`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm processes each element exactly once, thus the time complexity is \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space excluding the input and output as we only use a few variables.

This algorithm efficiently concatenates pairs of integers from the array by leveraging string operations and handles edge cases where the array has an odd length naturally.
