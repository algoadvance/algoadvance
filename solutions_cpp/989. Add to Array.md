[Leetcode 989. Add to Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l989)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to perform addition on an array-form representation of an integer and another integer. Specifically:

The array-form of an integer `num` is an array representing its digits in left-to-right order. For example, for `num = 1234`, the array-form is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Given an array `num` and an integer `k`, return the array-form of the integer `num + k`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: num = [1, 2, 0, 0], k = 34
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: num = [2, 7, 4], k = 181
Output: [4, 5, 5]

Input: num = [2, 1, 5], k = 806
Output: [1, 0, 2, 1]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= num.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= num[i] <= 9
- `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for the number 0 itself.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is the `num` array guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. Should we consider leading zeros in the result?
3. Can `k` be negative, or is it always positive as stated in the constraints?

(Assuming the problem constraints and conditions are as per the problem statement: `num` is non-empty, positive integer `k`, and no leading zeros).

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can simulate the process of adding two numbers digit by digit, much like how you would perform addition manually. 

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:
1. Start from the least significant digit (end of the array `num`) and add `k` to it.
2. Use a carry mechanism to handle sums greater than 10.
3. Continue the process for all digits of `num`. If after processing all digits there is still a carry, continue processing the carry until it is zero.
4. Finally, as we might end up with digits in reverse order, reverse the result at the end before returning.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> addToArrayForm(std::vector<int>& num, int k) {
    int n = num.size();
    std::vector<int> result;
    int carry = k;

    // Process each digit from the end of the num array
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int sum = num[i] + carry;
        result.push_back(sum % 10);
        carry = sum / 10;
    }
    
    // Process remaining carry (if any)
    while (carry > 0) {
        result.push_back(carry % 10);
        carry /= 10;
    }
    
    // Since we added digits starting from the end, reverse the result
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the array `num` and `m` is the number of digits in the integer `k` (in the worst case, adding substantial carry might go beyond `n` to handle the carry digits).

- Iterating over the array `num` takes O(n).
- Processing the carry digits, if they exceed the length of `num`, adds up to O(m).

The space complexity is O(n + m) as well, to store the result which includes all digits of `num` plus potential additional carry digits.
