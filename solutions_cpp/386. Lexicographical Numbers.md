[Leetcode 386. Lexicographical Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l386)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return 1 to `n` in lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`? 
     - Assume `1 <= n <= 50000`.

2. **Output Format**:
   - Should the output be a vector of integers?
     - Yes, the output should be a vector of integers arranged in lexicographical order.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. This method allows us to traverse the numbers in lexicographical order naturally.

Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Create a result vector to store the lexicographical order numbers.
2. **DFS Function**:
   - Create a helper function `dfs` that takes the current number and performs the depth-first search.
   - If the current number exceeds `n`, terminate that path.
   - Add the current number to the result vector.
   - For every number from 0 to 9, recursively call the `dfs` function with the current number extended by that digit if it forms a valid number within the range of `n`.
3. **Starting DFS**:
   - Start the DFS traversal from numbers 1 to 9.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            dfs(i, n, result);
        }
        return result;
    }

private:
    void dfs(int current, int n, vector<int>& result) {
        if (current > n) return;
        result.push_back(current);
        for (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (current * 10 + i > n) return;
            dfs(current * 10 + i, n, result);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n = 13;  // Example usage
    vector<int> result = solution.lexicalOrder(n);
    for (int num : result) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` because we visit each number from 1 to `n` exactly once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage used for the result vector and the recursion stack during the DFS traversal.

By implementing this solution, you can efficiently generate the lexicographical numbers from 1 to `n`.
