[Leetcode 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1706)
### Problem Statement

You have a 2D grid of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or the left.

- A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented by `1`.
- A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented by `-1`.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the grid. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the `i-th` column at the top, or `-1` if the ball gets stuck in the box.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize the Result Array**:
   - We need an array to store the final positions of the balls.
   
2. **Simulate the Ball Drop**:
   - For each ball dropped at the top of each column, simulate its path through the grid cell by cell.
   - Update the current position of the ball and handle the redirection based on the board in the current cell.
   
3. **Boundary and Stuck Checks**:
   - Check for cases where the ball hits the boundaries of the grid or gets stuck between two boards.
   
4. **Store the Result**:
   - If the ball exits the bottom of the grid, record the column; otherwise, record `-1` if the ball gets stuck.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> findBall(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    std::vector<int> result(n, -1); // Result array initialized to -1

    // Function to simulate the path of a ball
    auto simulate = [&](int startCol) -> int {
        int col = startCol;
        
        for (int row = 0; row < m; ++row) {
            int nextCol = col + grid[row][col]; // Calculate the next column based on the board's direction
            
            // Check if the ball hits the boundary or gets stuck in the 'V' shape
            if (nextCol < 0 || nextCol >= n || grid[row][col] != grid[row][nextCol]) {
                return -1; // Ball gets stuck
            }
            
            col = nextCol; // Move to the next column
        }
        
        return col; // Ball exits from this column at the bottom
    };
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[i] = simulate(i); // Simulate the drop for each column
    }
    
    return result; // Return the final positions
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n), where `n` is the number of columns.
- **Simulation**: For each ball, we traverse all rows once, resulting in O(m * n) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Final Complexity**: The overall complexity is O(m * n).
