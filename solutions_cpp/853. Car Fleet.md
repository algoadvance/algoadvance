[Leetcode 853. Car Fleet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l853)
### Problem Statement

There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer arrays `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `i-th` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `i-th` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, forming a car fleet. A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same speed. Note that no other cars can join a fleet once it is formed.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of `position` and `speed`?**
   - Yes, according to typical problem constraints:
     - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
     - `0 <= position[i] < target <= 10^6`
     - `0 <= speed[i] <= 10^6`
   
2. **What should be done if two cars are at the same position but have different speeds?**
   - They will be treated as separate entities initially, but one might catch up with the other to form a fleet.

3. **Does the order of cars matter in the input arrays?**
   - No, the order of the cars in the `position` and `speed` arrays does not matter.

4. **What is the output if all cars are at the same position and have the same speed?**
   - They would form a single fleet since they are driving at the same speed.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Time to Reach the Destination**:
   - For each car, calculate the time it takes to reach the destination using:
     \[
     \text{time}[i] = \frac{\text{target} - \text{position}[i]}{\text{speed}[i]}
     \]

2. **Sort the Cars by Starting Position**:
   - Sort the cars by their position in descending order, so we can process them from the car closest to the destination to the farthest.

3. **Simulate the Formation of Fleets**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list, and use a stack (or just a variable) to keep track of the time it takes for the last fleet to reach the destination.
   - If a car takes more time than the last recorded fleet time, it starts a new fleet.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int carFleet(int target, std::vector<int>& position, std::vector<int>& speed) {
    int n = position.size();
    std::vector<std::pair<int, double>> cars(n);

    // Step 1: Calculate the time for each car to reach the target
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        double time = static_cast<double>(target - position[i]) / speed[i];
        cars[i] = {position[i], time};
    }

    // Step 2: Sort cars by starting position in descending order
    std::sort(cars.begin(), cars.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.first > b.first;
    });

    // Step 3: Count the number of fleets
    int fleets = 0;
    double last_time = 0.0;
    for (const auto& car : cars) {
        double current_time = car.second;
        if (current_time > last_time) {
            // Current car forms a new fleet
            fleets++;
            last_time = current_time;
        }
    }

    return fleets;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the cars by position takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the sorted list to count fleets takes \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.
