[Leetcode 115. Distinct Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l115)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`. 

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

### Example
```cpp
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from s.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `s` and `t` composed only of lowercase letters?**
   - Yes.
2. **What are the maximum lengths of `s` and `t`?**
   - `s` and `t` can be up to 1000 characters long.
3. **Is the solution expected to be optimal in terms of time complexity?**
   - Yes, an optimal solution is preferred.

## Strategy
We need to count how many distinct subsequences of `s` match `t`. This suggests a dynamic programming (DP) approach.

### Dynamic Programming Approach
1. **DP Table Definition**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of distinct subsequences of `s` from `0` to `i-1` that match `t` from `0` to `j-1`.
   
2. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for any `i` because an empty `t` can be a subsequence of any prefix of `s`.

3. **Transition**:
   - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
     ```
     - `dp[i-1][j-1]` represents the subsequences that include `s[i-1]`.
     - `dp[i-1][j]` represents the subsequences that exclude `s[i-1]`.
   - If `s[i-1] != t[j-1]`, then:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
     ```

4. **Result**:
   - `dp[m][n]` will give us the result where `m` and `n` are lengths of `s` and `t`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s` and `t` respectively.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) for the DP table.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int m = s.length();
        int n = t.length();

        // DP table
        vector<vector<long>> dp(m + 1, vector<long>(n + 1, 0));

        // Initialize base case
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Result is in dp[m][n]
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```

This code will efficiently count the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which match `t` using dynamic programming.
