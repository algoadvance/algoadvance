[Leetcode 2825. Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2825)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to determine whether you can make `t` a subsequence of `s` by incrementing characters in `s` in a cyclic manner. In this context, incrementing a character 'z' results in 'a'. 

For example, given `s = "abc"` and `t = "acd"`, you can increment:

- 'b' to 'c';
- 'c' to 'd';

So `t` can be made a subsequence of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the strings?**
   - Length of `s` and `t` can be up to $10^5$.

2. **Can `t` be longer than `s`?**
   - Yes, but we have to determine if it's possible to create `t` as a subsequence from `s`.

3. **Are the strings guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, both strings `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Technique:** Use two pointers to iterate through both strings simultaneously.
2. **Character Comparison and Cyclic Increment:** When the characters don't match, determine if you can cyclically increment the character in `s` to match the character in `t`. For example, 'a' can become 'b', or 'z' can become 'a' etc.
3. **Increment Necessary Character When Feasible:** If an increment converts the character in `s` to match that in `t`, move forward. If not, it might be impossible.

This approach ensures we can check each character in linear time.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool canBeSubsequence(string s, string t) {
    int m = s.size(), n = t.size();
    int i = 0, j = 0;
    
    while (i < m && j < n) {
        if (s[i] == t[j]) {
            j++; // Move to the next character in t
        } else {
            // Try cyclic increment
            char nextChar = s[i];
            do {
                nextChar = (nextChar == 'z' ? 'a' : nextChar + 1);
                if (nextChar == t[j]) {
                    j++;
                    break;
                }
            } while (nextChar != s[i]);
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    return j == n; // Check if we matched all characters in t
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    string s1 = "abc", t1 = "acd";
    cout << (canBeSubsequence(s1, t1) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl; // Output: Yes

    string s2 = "abc", t2 = "dbg";
    cout << (canBeSubsequence(s2, t2) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl; // Output: No

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(m * constant) -> O(m):** Here `m` is the length of string `s`. Each comparison and potential cyclic increment is constant time since there are a fixed number of characters (26 for lowercase English letters).
- **O(n):** Traversing characters in string `t`.

**Overall Complexity:** O(max(m, n)), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `s` and `t`, respectively. Translating to linear complexity relative to the larger of the two strings.
