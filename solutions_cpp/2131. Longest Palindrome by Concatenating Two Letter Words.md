[Leetcode 2131. Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2131)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `words` each representing a two-letter word, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be derived by concatenating these words. 

### Example:
- Input: `["lc", "cl", "gg"]`
- Output: `6`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the words in the input guaranteed to be exactly two characters long?**
   - Yes, each word is guaranteed to be exactly two characters long.

2. **Is it possible to use each word multiple times?**
   - No, each word can be used at most once.

3. **What if the array is empty?**
   - For an empty array, the length of the longest palindrome would be `0`.

## Strategy
The core idea to solve this problem is to utilize a hash map to keep track of the counts of each word. There are two main cases to consider:
1. **Matching Reversible Words**: If there exists a word that is the reverse of another word (e.g., "lc" and "cl"), these pairs can form palindromes.
2. **Symmetrical Words**: Words that are already palindromes themselves (e.g., "gg"), can be used to extend the palindrome.

### Steps:
1. Traverse the array and count the occurrences of each word using a hash map.
2. For each word, check if the reverse of it exists in the map.
3. Handle symmetrical words separately where both characters are the same.

### Detailed Approach:
1. **Count occurrences**: Use a hash map to count occurrences of each word.
2. **Pair matching**: Iterate through the hash map to find and count pairs of reversible words.
3. **Symmetrical words handling**: Keep track of the odd counts of symmetrical words for potentially placing one in the middle of the palindrome.
4. Calculate the total length of palindrome possible based on the pairs and symmetrical words appropriately.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
        // Hash map to keep track of word counts
        unordered_map<string, int> wordCount;
        
        for (string word : words) {
            wordCount[word]++;
        }
        
        int palindromeLength = 0;
        bool hasOddSymmetrical = false;
        
        for (auto& [word, count] : wordCount) {
            string reversedWord = { word[1], word[0] };
            
            if (word == reversedWord) { // Symmetrical word case
                if (count % 2 != 0) {
                    hasOddSymmetrical = true;
                }
                palindromeLength += (count / 2) * 4; // Each pair contributes 4 chars to palindrome
            } else { // Non-symmetrical word case
                if (wordCount.find(reversedWord) != wordCount.end()) {
                    int pairs = min(count, wordCount[reversedWord]);
                    palindromeLength += pairs * 4;
                    // Decrement counts to avoid re-use
                    wordCount[reversedWord] -= pairs;
                    wordCount[word] -= pairs;
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (hasOddSymmetrical) {
            palindromeLength += 2; // Add one symmetric word in the middle
        }
        
        return palindromeLength;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We make a single pass to count words and another pass to process the map. The size of the word list determines the complexity directly.

This approach ensures efficiency and clarity, making it suitable for interview settings and practical applications.
