[Leetcode 1046. Last Stone Weight](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1046)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 1046 - Last Stone Weight**

We are given a list of `stones` of various weights. In this problem, we will repeatedly smash the two heaviest stones together. Here are the rules:

1. Select the two heaviest stones, say `x` and `y`.
2. Smash them together.
   - If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed.
   - If `x != y`, the stone with weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone with weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

Repeat this process until there is at most one stone left. Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If no stones are left, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the weights of the stones always positive integers?
   - Yes, the weights are positive integers.
2. Is there a limit on the number of stones or their weights?
   - The number of stones (`n`) and their weights are within reasonable constraints for typical array operations in competitive programming.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we will utilize a **max-heap** data structure, which allows us to efficiently retrieve and remove the largest elements. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Insert all stones into a max-heap**: In C++, we can use a priority queue with a custom comparator to simulate a max-heap.
2. **Simulate the smashing process**:
   - Extract the two largest elements `x` and `y` (where `x >= y`).
   - If `x != y`, push the difference `x - y` back into the heap.
3. Repeat the process until at most one stone remains in the heap.
4. Return the weight of the last stone if there's any, otherwise return `0`.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

int lastStoneWeight(std::vector<int>& stones) {
    // Priority queue to act as a max-heap. 
    std::priority_queue<int> maxHeap(stones.begin(), stones.end());

    while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
        int stone1 = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        int stone2 = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        
        if (stone1 != stone2) {
            maxHeap.push(stone1 - stone2);
        }
    }

    return maxHeap.empty() ? 0 : maxHeap.top();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> stones = {2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1};
    std::cout << "The weight of the last remaining stone is: " << lastStoneWeight(stones) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion into the max-heap**: \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of stones.
- **Each extraction and insertion due to smashing**: \(O(\log n)\). In the worst case, we perform \(n - 1\) such operations.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by heap operations and is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution efficiently handles the problem using a priority queue to always access the largest elements quickly.
