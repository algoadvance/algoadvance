[Leetcode 3111. Minimum Rectangles to Cover Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3111)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a list of coordinates in a 2D plane. Your task is to cover all these points with the minimum number of axis-aligned rectangles. Each rectangle can cover any number of points, and the sides of the rectangles must be parallel to the X and Y axes.

### Input:
- A list of coordinates in the 2D plane, where each coordinate is represented as a pair of integers `(x, y)`.

### Output:
- An integer representing the minimum number of rectangles required to cover all the given points.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are there any constraints on the number of points?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but for practical purposes, we can assume the number of points is reasonable for handling in memory (e.g., at most a few thousand).

2. **Can the points have duplicate coordinates?**
   - Let's assume all points are distinct unless stated otherwise.

3. **Do the rectangles need to be as small as possible, or can they have any size as long as they cover the points?**
   - The rectangles need to be as small as possible while still covering all points.

4. **Can a rectangle be placed diagonally, or must it be aligned with the axes?**
   - The rectangles must be aligned with the axes (axis-aligned rectangles).

## Strategy:

1. **Initial Check**: If there are no points, return 0.

2. **Single Point**: If there's only one point, we only need one rectangle that effectively covers that single point.

3. **Divide and Cover**: 
    - Sort the points based on their x-coordinates, and then y-coordinates.
    - Use a greedy strategy to group points into the minimum number of rectangles. 
    - For each remaining point, attempt to expand the existing rectangles if possible to cover it, otherwise start a new rectangle.

Basically, the problem can be efficiently solved using a greedy approach where we iteratively place rectangles in a way to cover maximum points at each step.

## Code:

Here's a solution that works on the described approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minRectanglesCoverPoints(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& points) {
        if (points.empty()) return 0;
        if (points.size() == 1) return 1;
        
        std::sort(points.begin(), points.end());
        int rectangles = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < points.size()) {
            rectangles++;
            int maxX = points[i].first;
            int maxY = points[i].second;
            while (i < points.size() && points[i].first <= maxX && points[i].second <= maxY) {
                maxY = std::max(maxY, points[i].second);  // Extend the current rectangle upwards
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return rectangles;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> points = {{0,0}, {2,2}, {1,1}, {3,3}};
    int result = sol.minRectanglesCoverPoints(points);
    std::cout << "Minimum number of rectangles: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Sorting**: The sort operation will take `O(N log N)` where `N` is the number of points.
- **Rectangle Expansion**: Each point is considered exactly once, so this step will take `O(N)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(N log N)`. 

This approach leverages sorting for efficient grouping and a greedy strategy to minimize rectangles.
