[Leetcode 1654. Minimum Jumps to Reach Home](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1654)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `forbidden` that contains the positions of obstacles. We are given two integers `a` and `b`, and an integer `x`. We need to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach home, which is located at position `x`. The array `forbidden` contains positions we cannot land on. Our initial position is `0`.

- From position `i`, you can:
    1. Move forward to position `i + a` with a forward jump.
    2. Move backward to position `i - b` with a backward jump, but only if you haven't moved backward from `i - b` before.

We need to return the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the position `x`, or return `-1` if it is not possible to reach the position `x`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the elements in the `forbidden` array unique?
   **A:** Yes, they are unique.

2. **Q:** Can `a` be equal to `b`?
   **A:** Yes, `a` can be equal to `b`.

3. **Q:** What is the range of input values?
   **A:** The length of `forbidden` array is up to `1000`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `x` are between `1` and `2000`.

### Strategy

We can approach this problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

1. **Initialize**: Start from position `0` with 0 jumps. Use a queue to manage the BFS process and a set to manage visited positions.
2. **Queue Initialization**: Store tuples representing the current position, the number of jumps taken so far, and whether the last jump was a backward jump.
3. **Processing**:
    - For each position, calculate the next possible positions by making a forward jump and a backward jump.
    - Check if the new positions are valid (not in forbidden and within a reasonable bound, considering `2000 + a + b` base from examples).
    - Push valid positions into the queue. If the forward move is taken, don't allow immediately repeating a backward move to avoid infinite loops.
4. **Terminate**: If `x` is reached, return the number of jumps. If the queue is exhausted without reaching `x`, return `-1`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

int minimumJumps(vector<int>& forbidden, int a, int b, int x) {
    unordered_set<int> forbidden_set(forbidden.begin(), forbidden.end());
    queue<tuple<int, int, bool>> q; // {position, jumps, last was backward?}
    unordered_set<string> visited; // to track unique state {position, backward}
    
    q.push({0, 0, false});
    visited.insert("0,false");
    
    int farthest = 6000; // optimization bound based on constraints
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [position, jumps, lastBackward] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        if (position == x) return jumps;
        
        // Forward jump
        int forward = position + a;
        string forwardState = to_string(forward) + ",false";
        if (forward <= farthest && forbidden_set.find(forward) == forbidden_set.end() && visited.find(forwardState) == visited.end()) {
            q.push({forward, jumps + 1, false});
            visited.insert(forwardState);
        }
        
        // Backward jump
        int backward = position - b;
        string backwardState = to_string(backward) + ",true";
        if (backward >= 0 && !lastBackward && forbidden_set.find(backward) == forbidden_set.end() && visited.find(backwardState) == visited.end()) {
            q.push({backward, jumps + 1, true});
            visited.insert(backwardState);
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> forbidden = {14, 4, 18, 1, 15};
    int a = 3, b = 15, x = 9;
    cout << minimumJumps(forbidden, a, b, x) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the range in which we explore (up to 6000 based on constraints). BFS ensures each position is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for queue and visited set.
