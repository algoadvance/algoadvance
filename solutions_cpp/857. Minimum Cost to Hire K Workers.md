[Leetcode 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l857)
## Problem Statement:

You are given `n` workers. Each worker `i` has a quality `quality[i]` and a minimum wage expectation `wage[i]`.

Now, we want to hire exactly `k` workers to form a paid group. When hiring a group of `k` workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
1. Every worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their quality compared to other workers in the paid group.
2. Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.

Given these constraints, return the minimum cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

**Example:**

```
Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
Output: 105.00000
Explanation: We pay the first worker 70 and the third worker 35.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `quality` and `wage` arrays contain negative numbers? 
   - No, both arrays will contain only positive numbers.
2. Is it guaranteed that there will always be at least `k` workers available?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees there will be at least `k` workers.

## Strategy:

1. **Modeling the Ratio**: For each worker, compute the wage-to-quality ratio because this ratio helps in determining the minimum wage expectations while considering quality.
2. **Sorting by Ratio**: Sort workers based on their wage-to-quality ratio.
3. **Max-Heap for Quality**: Use a max-heap (priority queue in C++) to keep track of the `k` smallest qualities encountered so far while iterating through the sorted list.
4. **Minimizing Cost**: For each worker, after adding its quality to the heap, if the heap size exceeds `k`, remove the largest quality to minimize costs. Calculate the current cost by multiplying the sum of the `k` smallest qualities by the current ratio under consideration.
5. **Result Calculation**: Track the minimum cost encountered during the iteration.

This approach ensures that we maintain the requirement to hire exactly `k` workers with the minimum possible cost by dynamically adjusting the group while iterating.

## Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Worker {
public:
    int quality, wage;
    double ratio;
    Worker(int q, int w) : quality(q), wage(w), ratio((double)w/q) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    double mincostToHireWorkers(vector<int>& quality, vector<int>& wage, int k) {
        int n = quality.size();
        vector<Worker> workers;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            workers.emplace_back(quality[i], wage[i]);
        }
        
        // Sort workers by their wage-to-quality ratio
        sort(workers.begin(), workers.end(), [](Worker &a, Worker &b) {
            return a.ratio < b.ratio;
        });
        
        // Priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the k smallest qualities
        priority_queue<int> max_heap;
        int quality_sum = 0;
        double min_cost = 1e9;
        
        for (Worker &worker : workers) {
            max_heap.push(worker.quality);
            quality_sum += worker.quality;
            
            // If size of heap exceeds k, remove the largest quality
            if (max_heap.size() > k) {
                quality_sum -= max_heap.top();
                max_heap.pop();
            }
            
            // If we have exactly k workers, check the cost
            if (max_heap.size() == k) {
                double cost = quality_sum * worker.ratio;
                min_cost = min(min_cost, cost);
            }
        }
        
        return min_cost;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Sorting Workers**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of workers.
- **Max-Heap Operations**: O(n log k) due to insertion and removal operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + n log k). Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible.
