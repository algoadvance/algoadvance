### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1712: Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays

Given an array of integers `nums`, you need to find the number of ways to split the array into three non-empty contiguous subarrays `left`, `mid`, `right` such that:

- The sum of elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of elements in `mid`, and
- The sum of elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of elements in `right`.

Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9+7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the three subarrays have a size of one element?**
   - Yes, the subarrays can consist of just one element each as long as they are contiguous.

2. **What is the range of `nums`?**
   - The elements in `nums` can range from 1 to 10^4, and the length of `nums` can be up to 10^5.

3. **Do we need to handle negative numbers?**
   - No, based on the problem statement, all elements of `nums` are positive.

## Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate a prefix sum array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the sum of the elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[i]`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - For each possible `j` (end index of the `left` subarray and start index of the `mid` subarray), use binary search to find the valid range for the start and end of the `mid` subarray:
     - `i`: Find the smallest `i` where the sum of `left` subarray is less than or equal to the sum of `mid` subarray.
     - `k`: Find the smallest `k` where the sum of `mid` subarray is less than or equal to the sum of `right` subarray.

3. **Count Valid Splits:**
   - Count all valid `(i, j, k)` combinations where the sums meet the conditions.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Return the final count modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToSplit(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = nums.size();
        // Calculate prefix sums
        std::vector<int> prefix(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        // Iterate over possible js
        for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; ++j) {
            // Find the smallest i where prefix[i] <= prefix[j] - prefix[i]
            int left = std::lower_bound(prefix.begin() + 1, prefix.begin() + j + 1, 2 * prefix[j]) - prefix.begin();
            // Find the largest k where prefix[j] <= prefix[k] - prefix[j] <= prefix[n] - prefix[k]
            int right = std::upper_bound(prefix.begin() + j, prefix.end() - 1, (prefix[n] + prefix[j]) / 2) - prefix.begin();

            if (left <= j && right > j) {
                count = (count + right - j) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Compute the prefix sum to enable quick range sum calculation.
   
2. **Binary Search for `i` and `k`:**
   - Use `std::lower_bound` to find the left boundary and `std::upper_bound` to find the right boundary.
   
3. **Range Checking:**
   - Ensure the found indices meet the required conditions.
   
4. **Counting Valid Combinations:**
   - Count the valid splits and use the modulo operation to keep the result within the limits.

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** O(n)
- **Binary Search Operations:** For each `j`, finding `i` and `k` takes O(log n). Since `j` can range from 1 to n-2, the overall complexity for this part is O(n log n).
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n log n)
