[Leetcode 2595. Number of Even and Odd Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2595)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. Your task is to determine the number of bits set to 1 at even positions and the number of bits set to 1 at odd positions in the binary representation of `n`. Position indexes are 0-based from the least significant bit (rightmost bit).

Return an array where the first element is the number of 1 bits at even positions and the second element is the number of 1 bits at odd positions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is considered an even or odd position?**
   - **Even positions** are indexed as 0, 2, 4, ..., (0-based index).
   - **Odd positions** are indexed as 1, 3, 5, ..., (0-based index).

2. **What is the expected input size?**
   - The problem implies typical constraints for integers, so the upper limit is likely a 32-bit integer.

3. **Can we assume that the input is always valid?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies that `n` is a positive integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Initialize two counters that will count the number of 1 bits at even and odd positions respectively.
2. Loop through each bit of `n` using bitwise operations:
   - Check if the current bit (either 0 or 1 position) is set.
   - Based on the position (even or odd), update the respective counter.
3. Append the respective counts to the result array and return it.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> evenOddBitCounts(int n) {
    int evenCount = 0, oddCount = 0;
    int position = 0;
    
    while (n > 0) {
        if ((n & 1) == 1) { // Check if the least significant bit is set
            if (position % 2 == 0) {
                evenCount++;
            } else {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        n = n >> 1; // Right shift `n` to process the next bit
        position++;
    }
    
    return {evenCount, oddCount};
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) where `n` is the input number, because we are processing each bit of the number, and there are log(n) bits in the binary representation of n.
