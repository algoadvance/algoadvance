[Leetcode 1878. Get Biggest Three Rhombus Sums in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1878)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid of integers. A "rhombus sum" is defined as the sum of numbers on the border of a rhombus in the grid. The size of the rhombus is defined by the distance from its center to one of its four corners. A size 0 rhombus is simply a single cell at the center, and for size > 0, the border includes several cells forming a rhombus shape.

You need to find the unique three largest rhombus sums in the grid. If there are less than three unique sums, you can return as many as are available.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the dimensions of the grid and the values within the grid?**
   - The dimensions `m` and `n` can range from `1` to `50`.
   - The values within the grid are integers and can be any integer within the range of `-10^5` to `10^5`.

2. **How should we handle the grid cells at the edges where a rhombus can't be fully formed?**
   - These cells will naturally exclude larger rhombus sums since the rhombus cannot extend beyond the grid boundaries.

3. **Are we considering only positive sums or all (including negative sums)?**
   - We consider all sums as the grid can have negative values.

### Strategy

1. **Single Cell Rhombus (Size 0):**
   - These are simply the individual grid cells. We'll start by considering these as potential sums.

2. **Larger Rhombus Shapes:**
   - For rhombuses larger than size 0, we'll need to iterate and calculate the sum by exploring cells at various distances from the center.

3. **Set for Unique Sums:**
   - We'll use a set to keep track of unique sums.

4. **Iterate Efficiently:**
   - For each cell in the grid, attempt to form rhombuses of increasing size and compute the border sums. Ensure not to go out of bounds of the grid.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>

using namespace std;

int getRhombusSum(const vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i <= size; ++i) {
        sum += grid[x - i][y + size - i];
        sum += grid[x + i][y + size - i];
        sum += grid[x - i][y - size + i];
        sum += grid[x + i][y - size + i];
    }
    return sum - grid[x][y + size] - grid[x][y - size];
}

vector<int> getBiggestThree(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    set<int> uniqueSums;
    
    // Adding size 0 rhombus sums (single cell values)
    for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            uniqueSums.insert(grid[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Adding larger rhombus sums
    for(int size = 1; size < min(m, n) / 2; ++size) {
        for(int x = size; x < m - size; ++x) {
            for(int y = size; y < n - size; ++y) {
                int rhombusSum = getRhombusSum(grid, x, y, size);
                uniqueSums.insert(rhombusSum);
            }
        }
    }

    // Extract the top three largest unique sums
    vector<int> result(uniqueSums.rbegin(), uniqueSums.rend());
    if(result.size() > 3) {
        result.resize(3);
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop (Adding size 0 rhombus sums):** O(m * n)
- **Inner Loops for Larger Rhombus (Calculating and inserting sums):** Should be handled efficiently, verifying and processing each element for potential inclusion can have a time complexity close to O(m * n * size), where size is bounded by min(m, n)/2.
- **Overall:** Since bounds are small (max 50x50 grid), this is manageable even for nested iterations.

Using the efficiently structured algorithm mentioned above, we're handling the problem within reasonable limits for given constraints.
