[Leetcode 2809. Minimum Time to Make Array Sum At Most x](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2809)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can choose any subarray of `nums` and subtract `x` from all its elements. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the elements of the array at most `x`. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You can subtract x from the whole array in one operation to get [-2, -1, 0, 1] which sums to -2 which is less than or equal to x.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 10
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to make the sum of array elements less than or equal to x.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of elements in the array:** -10^9 to 10^9
2. **Range of x:** 0 to 10^9
3. **Length of the array (n):** 1 to 10^5
4. **Multiple operations on overlapping subarrays:** Allowed
5. **Expected time complexity:** Should aim for O(n) or O(n log n).

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to deduct the minimum elements sum from the array efficiently.

### Steps:
1. **Initial Sum Check:** Compute the initial sum of the array. If it is already less than or equal to `x`, return `0`.
2. **Sliding Window Approach:** 
    - We need to find the maximum length of a subarray whose sum is at least the difference between the array sum (`current_sum`) and `x`.
    - Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum subarray of such sum.
    - The minimum number of operations is the length of the array minus the length of this maximum subarray.

### Time Complexity:
- The sliding window approach will allow us to traverse the array in O(n) time.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.size();
        long long array_sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0LL);

        if (array_sum <= x) return 0;
        
        long long target = array_sum - x;
        long long curr_sum = 0;
        unordered_map<long long, int> prefix_sum_map;
        int max_len = -1;

        prefix_sum_map[0] = -1; // (curr_sum - target = 0 implies we start from beginning)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            curr_sum += nums[i];
            if (prefix_sum_map.find(curr_sum - target) != prefix_sum_map.end()) {
                int prev_index = prefix_sum_map[curr_sum - target];
                max_len = max(max_len, i - prev_index);
            }
            prefix_sum_map[curr_sum] = i;
        }

        return (max_len == -1) ? -1 : (n - max_len);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int x1 = 3;
    cout << "Result 1: " << solution.minOperations(nums1, x1) << endl;

    vector<int> nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int x2 = 10;
    cout << "Result 2: " << solution.minOperations(nums2, x2) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Sum Calculation:** Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. **Sliding Window Setup:** Determine the target sum as `current_sum - x`.
3. **Finding Subarray:** Use a sliding window with a hash map to keep track of current sums and their indices.
4. **Result:** Return the length of the array minus the maximum subarray length for the computed target sum.

This approach ensures efficient performance due to its linear time complexity.
