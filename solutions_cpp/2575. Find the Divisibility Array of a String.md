[Leetcode 2575. Find the Divisibility Array of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2575)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `word` consisting of digits, and an integer `m`. The divisibility array `div` of `word` is an array of the same length as `word` such that:

- `div[i] == 1` if the numeric value of the substring `word[0...i]` is divisible by `m`.
- `div[i] == 0` otherwise.
  
Return the divisibility array of `word`.

Example:
```
Input: word = "998244353", m = 3
Output: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `word`?
   - Is `word` guaranteed to be non-empty and only contain digits ('0'-'9')?
   
2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the output be returned as a vector of integers?

Assuming the following based on typical constraints:
- The length of `word` can be up to 10^5.
- `word` will contain only digits.
- The output will be a vector of integers.

## Strategy

1. **Modular Arithmetic:** We can't handle large numbers directly due to the potential size of `word`. Instead, we can build the number incrementally and use modular arithmetic to determine if it's divisible.
2. **Cumulative Calculation:** We will iterate through the string while maintaining the value of the number formed so far modulo `m`. If at any point this value is 0, it means the number formed so far is divisible by `m`.

Here's a rough plan:
- Initialize a variable to keep track of the current value modulo `m`.
- Iterate through the string `word`, continuously update the current value modulo `m`.
- Check if this cumulative value is divisible by `m` at each step and store the result in the `div` array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> divisibilityArray(const std::string& word, int m) {
    int n = word.size();
    std::vector<int> div(n, 0);
    long long current_value = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        current_value = (current_value * 10 + (word[i] - '0')) % m;
        if (current_value == 0) {
            div[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    return div;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `word`. This is because we are performing a constant amount of work (modular arithmetic and assignment) for each character in the string. Given the constraints, this should be efficient.
