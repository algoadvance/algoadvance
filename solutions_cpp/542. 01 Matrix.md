[Leetcode 542. 01 Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l542)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `0`s and `1`s, where each cell represents either land (`1`) or water (`0`). You need to find the distance of the nearest `0` for each cell. The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.

You need to return a matrix `ans` of the same size as `mat` such that `ans[i][j]` is the distance to the nearest `0` for cell `(i, j)`.

Example:
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],
              [0,1,0],
              [0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],
         [0,1,0],
         [0,0,0]]

Input: mat = [[0,0,0],
              [0,1,0],
              [1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],
         [0,1,0],
         [1,2,1]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple `0`s in the input matrix?**
   - Yes, the matrix can contain multiple `0`s.
   
2. **Can all cells in the matrix be `1`s or `0`s?**
   - Yes, the matrix can be fully `0`s or fully `1`s.
   
3. **What is the maximum size of the matrix?**
   - Typically the constraints might be around `m, n <= 10^3` for an efficient solution.

4. **Should we consider diagonal distances?**
   - No, only vertical and horizontal distances matter.

## Strategy

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an output matrix `ans` initially filled with a large value (e.g., `INT_MAX`), except for cells with `0`s in `mat`, which should have a value of `0`.
   - Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all `0` cells.

2. **BFS Execution**:
   - For each cell with `0`, push it into the queue.
   - For each cell in the queue, process its neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If a neighboring cell's current recorded distance is greater than the distance from the current cell plus one, update it and push the neighbor into the queue.

3. **Result**:
   - Once the BFS completes, `ans` will contain the shortest distances to the nearest `0`.

### Time Complexity
- Initializing and processing each cell results in `O(m * n)` time complexity due to BFS.
- Space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the queue and storage of distances.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation for the problem using the explained strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits> // For INT_MAX

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> updateMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
    int m = mat.size();
    int n = mat[0].size();
    
    vector<vector<int>> ans(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    
    // Initialize with all '0' cells
    for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if(mat[i][j] == 0) {
                ans[i][j] = 0;
                q.push({i, j});
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Directions for moving in the matrix (up, down, left, right)
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    
    // BFS from all '0' cells
    while(!q.empty()) {
        auto [x, y] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for(const auto& dir : directions) {
            int newX = x + dir.first;
            int newY = y + dir.second;
            
            if(newX >= 0 && newY >= 0 && newX < m && newY < n) {
                if(ans[newX][newY] > ans[x][y] + 1) {
                    ans[newX][newY] = ans[x][y] + 1;
                    q.push({newX, newY});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return ans;
}
```

This implementation ensures an efficient BFS approach, creating a matrix of shortest distances to the nearest `0` for each cell.
