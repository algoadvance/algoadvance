[Leetcode 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1758)
### Problem Statement
The problem is to determine the minimum number of changes needed to make a given binary string an alternating binary string. An alternating binary string is a string where no two adjacent characters are the same, i.e., it follows a pattern like "010101" or "101010".

Given a binary string `s`, you need to return the minimum number of changes needed to make the string alternating.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length range of the string?
     - The length of the string `s` is between `1` and `100,000`.
   - Is the string guaranteed to contain only characters '0' and '1'?
     - Yes, the string contains only characters '0' and '1'.
     
2. **Output**:
   - Should we return just the minimum number of changes or the modified string as well?
     - The minimum number of changes.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the number of changes required to convert the string `s` into two possible alternating patterns:
     - Pattern1: "010101..."
     - Pattern2: "101010..."
     
2. **Count Mismatches**:
   - Iterate through the string, comparing it with both patterns and count mismatches for each. 
   - For Pattern1, the characters at even indices should be '0' and at odd indices should be '1'.
   - For Pattern2, the characters at even indices should be '1' and at odd indices should be '0'.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result will be the minimum of the two mismatch counts.

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minChangesToMakeAlternatingBinaryString(std::string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count1 = 0, count2 = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((i % 2 == 0 && s[i] != '0') || (i % 2 == 1 && s[i] != '1')) {
            count1++;
        }
        if ((i % 2 == 0 && s[i] != '1') || (i % 2 == 1 && s[i] != '0')) {
            count2++;
        }
    }
    
    return std::min(count1, count2);
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "0100100010";
    std::cout << "Minimum changes to make the string alternating: " 
              << minChangesToMakeAlternatingBinaryString(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Initialization**: We initialize two counters, `count1` and `count2`, to keep track of mismatches for Pattern1 and Pattern2 respectively.
2. **Loop through the string**: For each character in the string, we check if it matches the expected character in both patterns and increment the respective mismatch counter if it doesn't match.
3. **Return Result**: The function returns the minimum of the two mismatch counts.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are making a single pass through the string to check each character against both patterns.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
