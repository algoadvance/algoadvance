[Leetcode 1203. Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1203)
### Problem Statement
You have `n` items, each belonging to one of `m` groups. Each group has varying dependencies that need to be sorted before completing their tasks. The items also have their individual dependencies that need to be respected within their group. Write a function to find a valid sorting of the items such that:

- Each item is completed after its dependencies.
- Items belonging to the same group maintain their group dependencies.

If no valid sort exists, return an empty list.

### Input
- `n`: Integer, the number of items.
- `m`: Integer, the number of groups.
- `group`: List of integers of size `n`, where `group[i]` is the group to which the `i-th` item belongs.
- `beforeItems`: List of lists of size `n`, where `beforeItems[i]` is a list containing items that must come before the `i-th` item.

### Output
- A list of integers representing the sorted order of items. If there is no valid sorting, return an empty list.

### Example
```python
n = 8
m = 2
group = [-1,-1,1,0,0,1,0,-1]
beforeItems = [[],[6],[5],[6],[3,6],[],[],[]]
Output: [6,3,4,1,5,2,0,7]
```

### Strategy
1. **Graph Construction:**
    - Construct a graph for items and another graph for groups.
    - Add edges both for individual item dependencies and group dependencies.

2. **Topological Sorting:**
    - Perform the topological sort on both graphs to ensure all dependencies are met.
    - Use Kahn's algorithm (BFS) or DFS for cycle detection and to linearize the order.

3. **Result Construction:**
    - Assemble the sorted result ensuring group constraints are maintained.

### Proposed Code in C++
Below is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortItems(int n, int m, vector<int>& group, vector<vector<int>>& beforeItems) {
        // Adjust the group labels to ensure unique group identifiers
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (group[i] == -1) {
                group[i] = m++;
            }
        }
        
        // Graph structures
        vector<vector<int>> itemGraph(n);
        vector<int> itemIndegree(n, 0);
        vector<vector<int>> groupGraph(m);
        vector<int> groupIndegree(m, 0);
        
        // Build the graphs
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int before : beforeItems[i]) {
                itemGraph[before].push_back(i);
                itemIndegree[i]++;
                
                if (group[before] != group[i]) {
                    groupGraph[group[before]].push_back(group[i]);
                    groupIndegree[group[i]]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Topological sort function using Kahn's algorithm (BFS)
        auto topologicalSort = [](const vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& indegree) -> vector<int> {
            vector<int> result;
            queue<int> q;
            
            // Start with nodes of indegree 0
            for (int i = 0; i < indegree.size(); ++i) {
                if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                    q.push(i);
                }
            }
            
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                result.push_back(node);
                
                for (int neighbors : graph[node]) {
                    indegree[neighbors]--;
                    if (indegree[neighbors] == 0) {
                        q.push(neighbors);
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Check if topological sort was possible (i.e., no cycles)
            if (result.size() != graph.size()) {
                return {};
            }
            return result;
        };
        
        // Topologically sort items and groups
        vector<int> sortedItems = topologicalSort(itemGraph, itemIndegree);
        vector<int> sortedGroups = topologicalSort(groupGraph, groupIndegree);
        
        if (sortedItems.empty() || sortedGroups.empty()) {
            return {};
        }
        
        // Group items by their group number
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> itemsInGroup;
        for (int item : sortedItems) {
            itemsInGroup[group[item]].push_back(item);
        }
        
        // Generate final sorted order
        vector<int> result;
        for (int grp : sortedGroups) {
            for (int item : itemsInGroup[grp]) {
                result.push_back(item);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction:** O(V + E), where V is the number of items and E is the total number of dependencies.
- **Topological Sort:** O(V + E) for both item and group graphs.
- **Result Assembly:** O(V).

Thus, the total complexity is O(V + E), which is efficient for typical problem constraints.
