[Leetcode 1655. Distribute Repeating Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1655)
## Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

You are given an integer array `nums` and an array of requests where `requests[i]` is an integer array `[start_i, end_i]`. The `start` and `end` values represent a range of indices in the nums array. For each request, you may rearrange the integers from the indicated range in any order. 

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the `nums` array after handling all requests. You may only apply each request once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Does the order of the numbers in the result array matter after fulfilling the requests, or is the sum the primary concern?
   - The sum is the primary concern.
2. Should we take into consideration the maximum constraints for input sizes?
   - Yes, you should consider the constraints, but typically these will be specified in the problem details (like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`).

## Strategy

1. **Identify Contribution of Elements**: First, determine how many times each element in `nums` is requested over all ranges. This can be done using a difference array and prefix sum.
2. **Sort for Maximum Contribution**: Since higher numbers should contribute to more frequently requested indices to maximize the sum:
   - Sort the frequency counts in descending order.
   - Sort `nums` in ascending order.
3. **Map High Values to High Frequencies**: Multiply the highest elements of `nums` by the highest frequencies to get the maximum sum.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumRangeQuery(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& requests) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<int> freq(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Calculate frequency of each index being requested
        for (const auto& req : requests) {
            int start = req[0], end = req[1];
            freq[start]++;
            if (end + 1 < n) {
                freq[end + 1]--;
            }
        }

        // Get the prefix sum to get the actual frequencies
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            freq[i] += freq[i - 1];
        }

        // Remove the extra element
        freq.pop_back();

        // Sort both nums and frequency arrays in descending order
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        std::sort(freq.begin(), freq.end());

        // Calculate the maximum sum
        long long maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            maxSum += static_cast<long long>(nums[i]) * freq[i];
        }

        // Return the result as modulo 10^9 + 7 for large results
        return static_cast<int>(maxSum % 1000000007);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step**: Sorting `nums` and `freq` both take \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Takes \(O(n)\)
- **Overall Complexity**: Dominated by sorting, hence \(O(n \log n)\)

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**: \(O(n)\) for storing the frequency array

This approach ensures we maximize the sum by efficiently mapping the largest numbers to the most frequently requested positions.
