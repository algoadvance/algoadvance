[Leetcode 2747. Count Zero Request Servers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2747)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of `requests`, where each request is represented as an integer `request[i]`. Each request corresponds to one of the servers, and the value of `request[i]` is the server's identifier. All identifiers are integer values from `0` to `n-1` where `n` is the number of servers.

You need to write a function `countZeroRequestServers` that returns the count of servers that have received zero requests.

### Function Signature
```cpp
int countZeroRequestServers(int n, vector<int>& requests);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the `requests` vector always contain valid server IDs (between 0 and n-1)?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the `requests` vector will only contain valid server IDs.
   
2. **Can the number of servers `n` be zero?**
   - Yes, there could potentially be zero servers, in which case the function should return 0.

3. **Is there a constraint on the length of the `requests` vector or the value of `n`?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints explicitly, but it is implied typical Leetcode input size constraints apply.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a vector to keep track of request counts for each server.**
   - Create a vector `requestCounts` of size `n` initialized to zero.

2. **Count the requests for each server.**
   - Iterate through the `requests` vector and increment the corresponding index in the `requestCounts` vector.

3. **Count the servers that have zero requests.**
   - Iterate through the `requestCounts` vector and count the number of zero entries.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is O(n + m), where `n` is the number of servers and `m` is the number of requests, since we have to initialize the server request count vector and iterate over the requests.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int countZeroRequestServers(int n, std::vector<int>& requests) {
    // Initialize a vector to count requests for each server
    std::vector<int> requestCounts(n, 0);
    
    // Count the requests for each server
    for (int request : requests) {
        if (request >= 0 && request < n) {
            requestCounts[request]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Count the number of servers with zero requests
    int zeroRequestCount = 0;
    for (int count : requestCounts) {
        if (count == 0) {
            zeroRequestCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return zeroRequestCount;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: A vector `requestCounts` of size `n` is initialized with zeros to track the number of requests each server gets.
2. **Counting Requests**: We iterate through the `requests` vector and for each request, increment the count of requests for the corresponding server.
3. **Counting Zero Requests**: Finally, we iterate through the `requestCounts` vector and count how many servers have received zero requests. The result is returned.

This solution efficiently handles the counting of zero-request servers with optimal time complexity given typical constraints on input sizes.
