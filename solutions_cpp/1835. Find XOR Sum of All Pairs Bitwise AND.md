[Leetcode 1835. Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1835)
## Problem Statement

Given two arrays of integers `arr1` and `arr2`, the XOR sum of all pairs `(arr1[i] & arr2[j])` (where `&` denotes the bitwise AND operation) is the result of the XOR over all pairs.

Return the XOR sum of all pairs `(arr1[i] & arr2[j])`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the input arrays?**
   - The arrays can be of different lengths and may vary from 1 to 10^5 elements each.

2. **What is the range of the integer values in the arrays?**
   - Each integer `arr1[i]` and `arr2[j]` can range from 0 to 10^9.

3. **Are there any specific constraints or special cases to handle?**
   - We should efficiently handle large arrays to avoid time-out issues.

## Strategy

1. **Bitwise Properties**:
   - Use the distributive property of XOR over addition to simplify our problem. This implies:
     ```
     (a & b) ⊕ (a & c) ⊕ (a & d) = a & (b ⊕ c ⊕ d)
     ```
   - We will leverage the above property to perform an efficient calculation.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Compute the XOR of all elements in `arr2`.
   - For each element in `arr1`, compute its AND with the result from the previous step and then XOR all these results.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Compute `XOR_sum_arr2 = arr2[0] ⊕ arr2[1] ⊕ ... ⊕ arr2[m-1]`
   - Compute the final result by iterating through `arr1` and accumulating the XOR of each element `arr1[i] & XOR_sum_arr2`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int getXorSum(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
        int XOR_sum_arr2 = 0;
        
        // Compute XOR sum of all elements in arr2
        for(auto num : arr2) {
            XOR_sum_arr2 ^= num;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        
        // Compute final XOR by XORing all arr1[i] & XOR_sum_arr2
        for(auto num : arr1) {
            result ^= (num & XOR_sum_arr2);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Calculation of `XOR_sum_arr2`**:
   - This takes `O(m)` where `m` is the length of `arr2`.

2. **Calculation of the final result**:
   - This takes `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `arr1`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`, which is efficient and should handle the upper limits of input sizes gracefully.
