[Leetcode 2734. Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2734)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, you can perform the following operation at most once:
1. Choose any non-empty delimiter substring `d` from `s`.
2. Replace `d` with its lexicographically next string.

The next string for any substring `d` is defined as the smallest lexicographic string that is greater than `d`. This basically means you find a substring `d` and increment its last character to make the new string. If the last character is 'z', we replace it with 'a' and propagate the carry to the left (the process is similar to incrementing a number).

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can get after performing the operation at most once.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint on the string `s`?**
   - It should be clarified if there is any upper limit on the length of `s` for performance considerations. Typically, it can be assumed to be in a manageable size given constraints in competitive programming.

2. **Can `d` be the entire string `s`?**
   - Yes, `d` can be the entire string or any non-empty substring from `s`.

3. **Is there any specific order in which the substrings should be chosen?**
   - The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest resultant string, so we should aim to make the transformation on the substring which gives us the smallest possible string.

## Strategy
To achieve the smallest lexicographic string:
1. Iterate through each possible `d`.
2. For each possible `d` (delimited substrings of different lengths starting from `s[i]` to `s[j]`), get the lexicographic next string and see if it gives a smaller overall string than previously recorded.
3. Track the smallest string observed and return it as the result.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string getNextString(std::string d) {
    int n = d.size();
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (d[i] < 'z') {
            d[i] = d[i] + 1;
            return d;
        } else {
            d[i] = 'a';
        }
    }
    // If all characters were 'z', the entire string becomes 'a's
    return std::string(n, 'a');
}

std::string getLexicographicallySmallestString(std::string s) {
    std::string result = s;
    for (int start = 0; start < s.size(); ++start) {
        for (int len = 1; len <= s.size() - start; ++len) {
            std::string original = s;
            std::string d = s.substr(start, len);
            std::string next_d = getNextString(d);

            std::string new_s = s.substr(0, start) + next_d + s.substr(start + len);
            result = std::min(result, new_s);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s;
    std::cout << "Enter the string: ";
    std::cin >> s;
    std::string result = getLexicographicallySmallestString(s);
    std::cout << "Lexicographically smallest string: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is better analyzed as follows:
1. **Nested Loop**: Two nested loops in the main function will consider every starting position and every possible substring length.
   - Outer loop runs `n` times where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - Inner loop runs in the worst case `n` times.
2. **getNextString**: This utility function runs in linear time based on the length of the substring `d`, which is at most `n`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^3)** in the worst case due to the triple nested nature of the operations:
1. Two nested loops O(n^2).
2. Substring and lexicographical operations within loop O(n).

This could likely be optimized with more advanced string manipulation or searching techniques, but the provided solution ensures correctness given typical constraint sizes in competitive programming.
