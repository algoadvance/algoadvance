[Leetcode 3017. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3017)
## Problem Statement
You are given a grid representing a neighborhood, where '1' represents a house and '0' represents an empty plot. Your task is to count the number of houses that are at an exact Manhattan distance, `d`, from a given target house.

The Manhattan distance between two points (i1, j1) and (i2, j2) is defined as `|i1 - i2| + |j1 - j2|`.

Given inputs:
- A 2D grid of size `m x n` containing '1's and '0's.
- The coordinates `(targetX, targetY)` of the target house.
- A distance `d`.

Return the number of houses that are exactly at distance `d` from the target house `(targetX, targetY)`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the grid guaranteed to always contain at least one '1' (house)?**
   - Yes, you can assume there is at least one house in the grid.

2. **Can the target coordinates `(targetX, targetY)` contain an empty plot (i.e., '0')?**
   - No, the target coordinates will always contain a house.

3. **Are there constraints on the size of the grid (m, n)?**
   - Typically, in LeetCode problems, you can expect constraints like 1 <= m, n <= 100.

4. **Is `d` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, `d` will be a non-negative integer.

## Strategy
1. **Input Parsing**: Load the input grid, target coordinates, and distance `d`.
2. **Manhattan Distance Calculation**: For each cell in the grid that contains a house ('1'):
   - Calculate the Manhattan distance between this cell and the target cell.
   - Count it if the distance is exactly `d`.
3. **Two-dimensional Traversal**: Traverse the grid using nested loops.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle the smallest grid sizes and ensure no out-of-bound errors.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countHousesAtDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int targetX, int targetY, int d) {
        int numHouses = 0;
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int distance = abs(i - targetX) + abs(j - targetY);
                    if (distance == d) {
                        ++numHouses;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return numHouses;
    }
};
```
### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with `numHouses` counting variable set to zero.
2. **Grid Traversal**: Use two nested loops to traverse the grid.
3. **Condition Check**: If `grid[i][j]` is 1, calculate the Manhattan distance from `(i, j)` to `(targetX, targetY)`.
4. **Distance Matching**: If the calculated distance matches `d`, increment the `numHouses`.

### Time Complexity
- **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We traverse the entire grid once, checking each cell.
- Space complexity is **O(1)**, excluding the input storage, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently counts the houses at an exact Manhattan distance `d` from the target house in the given grid.
