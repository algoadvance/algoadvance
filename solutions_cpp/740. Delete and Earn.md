[Leetcode 740. Delete and Earn](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l740)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After deleting it, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and `nums[i] + 1`.

Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation.

### Example
```cpp
Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted.
- Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points.
- 6 total points are earned.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array `nums` be empty?
   **A:** No, the constraints ensure that `nums` has at least one element.

2. **Q:** What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?
   **A:** Each element in `nums` is a positive integer within the range `[1, 10000]`.

3. **Q:** Can there be duplicates in `nums`?
   **A:** Yes, there can be duplicates in `nums`.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count:** Use a map to count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. **Transformed Array:** Use the frequencies to transform the problem into a simpler one, resembling the "House Robber Problem."
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Use dynamic programming to determine the maximum points that can be earned.

   - Let `points[i]` be the maximum points that can be earned considering elements up to `i`.
   - If we decide to take `i`, then we cannot take `i-1` (similar to the house robber problem).
   - Use the transformation: `earn[i] = i * count[i]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n + k)` where `n` is the length of the input array and `k` is the maximum element in the array (in this case, up to 10000).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)` due to the additional storage for dynamic programming arrays.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int maxNum = 0;

        // Count frequency of each number and find max element in nums
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num]++;
            maxNum = max(maxNum, num);
        }

        // Create the dp array
        vector<int> dp(maxNum + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxNum; ++i) {
            dp[i] = i * count[i];
        }

        // Apply house robbing DP logic
        for (int i = 2; i <= maxNum; ++i) {
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i] + dp[i - 2]);
        }

        return dp[maxNum];
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. We count the frequency of each number in the input array `nums` using an unordered map `count`.
2. We determine the maximum number `maxNum` in `nums`.
3. We create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the total points we can earn from taking all instances of `i`.
4. We then iterate through the array applying the house robber's logic: either take `i` and add the result of `i-2` or skip `i` and take the result of `i-1`.
5. The result is the value of `dp[maxNum]` which represents the maximum points we can earn.
