[Leetcode 834. Sum of Distances in Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l834)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `N` representing the number of nodes in a tree, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v]` represents a bidirectional edge between nodes `u` and `v`. A tree is an undirected connected acyclic graph which has `N` nodes and `N-1` edges.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between node `i` and all other nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Node Numbering**: Are the nodes numbered from `0` to `N-1`?
   - Yes, the nodes are numbered from `0` to `N-1`.
2. **Edge Constraints**: Can we assume that the input edges always form a valid tree?
   - Yes, you can assume that the given edges always form a valid tree (i.e., there are no cycles and it's connected).
3. **Output Format**: Should the output be an array of integers where the `i-th` element is the sum of distances from node `i` to all other nodes?
   - Yes, exactly.

### Strategy
1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.

2. **Two-Pass DFS**:
   - **First DFS**: Calculate the size of each subtree and sum of distances of each node from its subtree.
   - **Second DFS**: Use the information from the first DFS to compute the result for each node in linear time.

### Steps
1. Build the adjacency list for the tree from the edges.
2. Perform the first DFS to compute the size of each subtree and the initial distance sum for a root node.
3. Perform the second DFS to compute the distance sum for all other nodes using the results of the first DFS.

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing**: Building the adjacency list takes O(N).
- **DFS Traversals**: Each DFS traversal takes O(N).
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is O(N).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumOfDistancesInTree(int N, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> tree(N);
        for (auto& edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            tree[u].push_back(v);
            tree[v].push_back(u);
        }

        vector<int> res(N, 0);
        vector<int> count(N, 1); // Initially, each node count as 1 (itself)

        // First DFS to calculate the count of nodes and sum of distances for the root node
        dfs(0, -1, tree, count, res);
        
        // Second DFS to calculate the result for each node
        dfs2(0, -1, tree, count, res, N);

        return res;
    }

private:
    void dfs(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<int>>& tree, vector<int>& count, vector<int>& res) {
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            dfs(neighbor, node, tree, count, res);
            count[node] += count[neighbor];
            res[node] += res[neighbor] + count[neighbor];
        }
    }

    void dfs2(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<int>>& tree, const vector<int>& count, vector<int>& res, int N) {
        for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;

            res[neighbor] = res[node] - count[neighbor] + (N - count[neighbor]);
            dfs2(neighbor, node, tree, count, res, N);
        }
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int N = 6;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}};
    vector<int> result = sol.sumOfDistancesInTree(N, edges);
    
    for (int dist : result) {
        cout << dist << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Tree Representation**: We use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **First DFS (`dfs` function)**: Computes the count of nodes in each subtree and the initial sum of distances for the root node.
3. **Second DFS (`dfs2` function)**: Propagates the distance sums to compute the result for each node using the results from the first DFS.

This two-pass DFS ensures that every node's distance sum is calculated efficiently, leveraging the properties of the tree structure.
