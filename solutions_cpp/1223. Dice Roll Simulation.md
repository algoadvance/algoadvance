[Leetcode 1223. Dice Roll Simulation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1223)
## Problem Statement
An automatic weather station uses a single dice to input a random number from 1 to 6 to simulate weather patterns. However, to avoid overly repetitive patterns, the station imposes a restriction: no number can appear more than `rollMax[i]` times consecutively, where `rollMax` is a list of 6 integers representing the maximum allowable consecutive rolls for each number. 

Given the number of rolls `n` and the `rollMax` array, return the number of distinct sequences that can be generated. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of values for `n` and the entries in `rollMax`?
   - `1 <= n <= 5000`
   - `1 <= rollMax[i] <= 15`

2. **Output**: Do we need to return the number of distinct sequences directly?
   - Yes, and the result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

3. **Initial Conditions**: Are there any assumptions about the initial state of the dice?
   - No specific initial conditions apart from the given constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Define a 3-dimensional DP table `dp[n][6][max_roll]` where 
     - `n` is the number of rolls,
     - `6` represents the face of the dice (0 to 5 for 1 to 6),
     - `max_roll` is the count for the current roll face.
   - Use another 2D array `sum_dp[n][6]` to store cumulative sums for transitions to optimize the solution.
2. **Base Case**:
   - Initialize `dp[1][i][1]` to 1 for each face `i` (0 to 5), since we can roll any number once.
3. **Transition**:
   - For each face and for each valid consecutive roll up to `rollMax`, accumulate possible sequences from previous states.
   - Use modulo operation to prevent overflow.
4. **Final Sum**:
   - Sum up all valid sequences in the last roll.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    int dieSimulator(int n, std::vector<int>& rollMax) {
        // dp[n][6][maxRoll] - n rolls, for face i, maxRoll is the consecutive count
        std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> dp(n + 1, std::vector<std::vector<int>>(6, std::vector<int>(16, 0)));
        
        // Initialize base cases
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i) {
            dp[1][i][1] = 1;
        }
        
        // DP calculation
        for (int roll = 2; roll <= n; ++roll) {
            for (int face = 0; face < 6; ++face) {
                for (int prevFace = 0; prevFace < 6; ++prevFace) {
                    if (prevFace != face) {
                        for (int k = 1; k <= rollMax[prevFace]; ++k) {
                            dp[roll][face][1] = (dp[roll][face][1] + dp[roll - 1][prevFace][k]) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                // Case when the current face continues as the previous face
                for (int k = 1; k < rollMax[face]; ++k) {
                    dp[roll][face][k + 1] = dp[roll - 1][face][k];
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Summing up all possible ways to finish at roll[n]
        int result = 0;
        for (int face = 0; face < 6; ++face) {
            for (int k = 1; k <= rollMax[face]; ++k) {
                result = (result + dp[n][face][k]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 6 * 6 * K) where `N` is the number of rolls and `K` is the maximum value in `rollMax`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N * 6 * K) due to the 3-dimensional DP table.

By utilizing dynamic programming and careful state transitions, the solution efficiently computes the number of distinct sequences adhering to the given constraints.
