[Leetcode 1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1089)
## Problem Statement
Given a fixed-length integer array `arr`, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

**Note:**
- Elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.
- Do the above modifications to the input array in place and do not return anything.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should the function return anything?
   **A:** No, modifications should be made in place.
   
2. **Q:** Can the input array contain only zeros?
   **A:** Yes, any valid array of integers (including only zeros) will be considered.

3. **Q:** What is the range of the array length?
   **A:** Typically, constraints would fall within a reasonable integer bounds, e.g., `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`.

4. **Q:** Are there any non-zero constraints on the values inside the array?
   **A:** The prompt indicates itâ€™s an integer array, so typical values would be within the range of standard integers.

## Strategy
1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - We need to duplicate every `0` in the array.
   - Non-zero elements must be shifted to the right to make room for the duplicated zero.
   - Directly performing the shifts for each zero in a single pass will be inefficient.

2. **Two-Pass Approach:**
   - First pass: Determine the effective length of the final array including the duplicated zeros.
   - Second pass: Use a reverse strategy to place elements from the end to avoid overwriting elements while shifting.

**Steps:**
1. **First Pass:** Count the zeros and determine the final length including duplicates.
2. **Second Pass:** Fill the values backwards from the last valid index of the array to ensure elements are not overwritten prematurely.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

void duplicateZeros(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    
    int zerosToDuplicate = 0;
    int lengthOfNewArray = n;
    
    // First pass to count the number of zeros
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (arr[i] == 0) {
            if (i + zerosToDuplicate < n - 1) {
                zerosToDuplicate++;
            } else {
                lengthOfNewArray--;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (int i = lengthOfNewArray - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (arr[i - zerosToDuplicate] == 0) {
            if (i < n) {
                arr[i] = 0;
            }
            --i;
            if (i < n) {
                arr[i] = 0;
            }
        } else {
            arr[i] = arr[i - zerosToDuplicate];
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, because we are iterating over the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we are modifying the array in place with no extra space used proportional to the input size.
