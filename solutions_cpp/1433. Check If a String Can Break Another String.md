[Leetcode 1433. Check If a String Can Break Another String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1433)
### Problem Statement:
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length. You want to check if some permutation of string `s1` can break some permutation of string `s2` or vice-versa. In other words, `s1` can break `s2` (or vice-versa) if, for every `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, the `i-th` character in `s1` is greater than or equal to the `i-th` character in `s2` after sorting both `s1` and `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can we assume that `s1` and `s2` contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Is the length of `s1` equal to the length of `s2`?

2. **Output**:
   - What should be returned if it's not possible for any permutation of `s1` to break a permutation of `s2` and vice-versa? (Expected output is `false`).

### Strategy:
1. **Sort both Strings**: First, sort both `s1` and `s2`. 
2. **Comparison in One Direction**: Check if sorted `s1` can break sorted `s2`. This means for every character at position `i`, the character in `s1` is greater than or equal to the character in `s2`.
3. **Comparison in Other Direction**: Check if sorted `s2` can break sorted `s1`. This is similar but reversed.
4. **Final Decision**: If either of the conditions are true, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

bool canBreak(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    std::string first = s1;
    std::string second = s2;
    
    // Sort both strings
    std::sort(first.begin(), first.end());
    std::sort(second.begin(), second.end());
    
    // Check if first can break second
    bool canFirstBreakSecond = true;
    bool canSecondBreakFirst = true;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < first.size(); ++i) {
        if (first[i] < second[i]) {
            canFirstBreakSecond = false;
        }
        if (second[i] < first[i]) {
            canSecondBreakFirst = false;
        }
    }
    
    // Return if one of the break conditions hold
    return canFirstBreakSecond || canSecondBreakFirst;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "abc";
    std::string s2 = "xya";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << canBreak(s1, s2) << std::endl; // Output: true
    
    s1 = "abe";
    s2 = "acd";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << canBreak(s1, s2) << std::endl; // Output: false
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting each string takes \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string.
- Comparing the two sorted strings takes \( O(n) \).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

By following this approach, we ensure an efficient and clear solution to the problem.
