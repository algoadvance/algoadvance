[Leetcode 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1110)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value. After deleting all nodes with a value in a given array `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees). Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most `1000`.
- Each node has a distinct value between `1` and `1000`.
- `to_delete.length <= 1000`
- `to_delete` contains distinct values between `1` and `1000`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the data structure returned if the forest is empty after deletions?
   - Return an empty list.
2. Can `to_delete` contain values not present in the tree?
   - No, all values in `to_delete` will be present in the tree.
3. Should the output be in any specific order?
   - No, the output can be in any order.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and handle deletion operations. The main steps in our approach are:

1. **DFS Traversal**: Traverse the tree while checking and deleting nodes that are in the `to_delete` set.
2. **Managing Forest Roots**: Maintain a list of roots of the trees in the resulting forest. If we delete a node, add its children (if any) as new roots in the forest.
3. **Node Deletion**: Recursively check each node and if it needs to be deleted, handle its children.

An additional set `to_delete_set` will be created for O(1) lookups to quickly identify nodes to delete.

### Pseudo Code:
1. Start DFS from the root.
2. If the current node is in `to_delete_set`, add its children (if any) to the forest roots.
3. Recursively handle left and right children.
4. If the current node should not be deleted, it's either a new root (if coming from a deletion) or part of the existing tree.
5. Return the list of roots.

## Code
Here's the C++ implementation of the outlined strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> delNodes(TreeNode* root, vector<int>& to_delete) {
        unordered_set<int> to_delete_set(to_delete.begin(), to_delete.end());
        vector<TreeNode*> forest;
        root = deleteNodes(root, to_delete_set, forest);
        if(root != nullptr) { // if the root itself is not deleted, add it to forest
            forest.push_back(root);
        }
        return forest;
    }
    
    TreeNode* deleteNodes(TreeNode* node, unordered_set<int>& to_delete_set, vector<TreeNode*>& forest) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        node->left = deleteNodes(node->left, to_delete_set, forest);
        node->right = deleteNodes(node->right, to_delete_set, forest);
        
        if (to_delete_set.count(node->val)) {
            if (node->left != nullptr) {
                forest.push_back(node->left);
            }
            if (node->right != nullptr) {
                forest.push_back(node->right);
            }
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        return node;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:
- We visit each node once during the DFS traversal.
- The set operations (`count` and `insert`) are O(1) on average.
Hence, the majority of the operations are linear in terms of the number of nodes in the tree.
