[Leetcode 2601. Prime Subtraction Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2601)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer array `nums` of size `n`. Given a prime number `p`, you can perform the following operation:

- Choose an index `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n) and subtract `p` from `nums[i]`.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to make the array `non-decreasing` (i.e., each number is greater than or equal to the one before it) by performing the operation described above any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for the elements of `nums`?
2. Is there an upper limit on the value of `n`, the length of the array?
3. Can `p` be any prime number, or is it fixed for each test case?
4. What should be the output if the array is already non-decreasing?

## Strategy

1. **Identifying the Violations:** Traverse the array and identify where the array violates the non-decreasing order.
2. **Prime Subtraction:** For each violation, check if subtracting the prime number `p` from the larger element will either fix the violation or make the array non-decreasing.
3. **Validation:** Make sure to keep the integrity of the array non-decreasing even after multiple operations.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity will be **O(n)**, as we traverse the array once to identify violations and perform any necessary operations.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

bool canMakeNonDecreasing(vector<int>& nums, int p) {
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            // Prime subtraction
            while (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[i] += p;
                if (nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            // Check if nums[i] is still smaller after the maximum allowed prime subtraction
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {4, 6, 3, 8, 5};  // Example input
    int p = 3;  // Example prime number

    bool result = canMakeNonDecreasing(nums, p);
    cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code:
1. We traverse the array to identify violations of the non-decreasing order.
2. For each violation, we attempt to fix it by adding the prime number `p` to the offending element.
3. If any element after the maximum allowed changes still violates the non-decreasing order, we return false.
4. Otherwise, we return true indicating the array can be made non-decreasing.

**Note:** This approach assumes that adding `p` to a smaller value to match or exceed the previous larger value is allowed. If it is required that only subtraction is allowed, this strips the part of the functionality to keep within purely theoretical constraints.
