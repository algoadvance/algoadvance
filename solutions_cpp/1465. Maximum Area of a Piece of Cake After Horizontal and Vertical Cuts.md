[Leetcode 1465. Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1465)
## Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular cake of size `h x w` and two arrays of integers `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where:

- `horizontalCuts[i]` is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the `i`-th horizontal cut, and
- `verticalCuts[j]` is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the `j`-th vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is there any particular order in which the cuts are provided in the arrays? 
   - No, the cuts can be in any order.
  
2. Can there be duplicate cut positions in the input arrays?
   - No, each cut position is unique.

3. The input values for `h`, `w`, `horizontalCuts`, and `verticalCuts` are always valid?
   - Yes, the inputs are always within the problem constraints.

4. Should we consider the edges of the cake as potential cut points?
   - Yes, consider the edges implicitly by comparing distances to and from the edge.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Cuts**: 
   - To determine the maximum piece sizes based on the cuts, sort both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`.
   
2. **Find Maximum Gaps**:
   - Compute the maximum distance between subsequent cuts for both horizontal and vertical directions.
     - Include the edges of the cake by considering cuts from the start (0) and to the end (h for vertical and w for horizontal).

3. **Calculate the Maximum Area**:
   - Multiply the maximum horizontal gap by the maximum vertical gap.
   - Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the cuts takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of cuts.
- Finding maximum gaps takes \(O(n)\).
- Overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(int h, int w, std::vector<int>& horizontalCuts, std::vector<int>& verticalCuts) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        
        // Sort the cuts
        std::sort(horizontalCuts.begin(), horizontalCuts.end());
        std::sort(verticalCuts.begin(), verticalCuts.end());
        
        // Find maximum horizontal gap
        int maxHorizontalGap = std::max(horizontalCuts[0], h - horizontalCuts.back());
        for (int i = 1; i < horizontalCuts.size(); ++i) {
            maxHorizontalGap = std::max(maxHorizontalGap, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i - 1]);
        }
        
        // Find maximum vertical gap
        int maxVerticalGap = std::max(verticalCuts[0], w - verticalCuts.back());
        for (int i = 1; i < verticalCuts.size(); ++i) {
            maxVerticalGap = std::max(maxVerticalGap, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i - 1]);
        }
        
        // Calculate maximum area
        long long maxArea = (1LL * maxHorizontalGap * maxVerticalGap) % MOD;
        
        return (int) maxArea;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting both the `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` arrays.
2. **Finding Maximum Gaps**: 
   - For horizontal cuts, find the maximum gap between subsequent elements, considering edges.
   - Repeat the process for vertical cuts.
3. **Calculate and Return**: Multiply the maximum horizontal gap and vertical gap, then return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
