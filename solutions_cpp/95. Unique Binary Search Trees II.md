[Leetcode 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l95)
### Problem Statement
The task is to generate all unique binary search trees (BSTs) that store values 1 to n.

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, we should clarify a few things:
1. Are we guaranteed the input `n` is always a positive integer?
2. Is there an upper limit on the value of `n`?
3. Should the BSTs be returned in any specific order? (usually not necessary to ask, but good to double-check)
4. What should be the structure of the output?

For this problem, let's assume:
1. Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.
2. The value of `n` is reasonably small, typically up to about 9 or 10 for practical purposes.
3. No specific order is required for the output of BSTs.
4. The function should return a list/vector of pointers to the root nodes of the generated BSTs.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to generate all possible BST structures where the nodes store values from 1 to n. The key insight is to use a recursive approach where:
- Each number `i` from 1 to n can be considered as the root.
- Recursively generate all left subtrees with values less than `i`.
- Recursively generate all right subtrees with values greater than `i`.
- Combine each left subtree with each right subtree to form a BST with `i` as the root.

We will create a helper function that constructs the trees for a given range `[start, end]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<TreeNode*> generateTrees(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return {};
        return generateTreesInRange(1, n);
    }
    
private:
    vector<TreeNode*> generateTreesInRange(int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return {nullptr};
        }
        
        vector<TreeNode*> allTrees;
        
        for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
            // Generate all left and right subtrees
            vector<TreeNode*> leftTrees = generateTreesInRange(start, i - 1);
            vector<TreeNode*> rightTrees = generateTreesInRange(i + 1, end);
            
            // Combine them with the current node `i` as the root
            for (TreeNode* left : leftTrees) {
                for (TreeNode* right : rightTrees) {
                    TreeNode* currentTree = new TreeNode(i);
                    currentTree->left = left;
                    currentTree->right = right;
                    allTrees.push_back(currentTree);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return allTrees;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is somewhat intricate to analyze due to the recursive nature of the problem. However, for a given `n`, the number of unique BSTs corresponds to the `n`-th Catalan number, which grows exponentially. Therefore, the time complexity is approximately \(O(4^n / n^{3/2})\). The space complexity is also dominated by the recursion stack and the storage of the trees, which is also exponential in the worst case.
