[Leetcode 3254. Find the Power of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3254)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, the power of a k-size subarray is defined as the product of the elements in that subarray. Compute and return the sum of the power of all k-size subarrays in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the input array `nums`?**
    - Let's assume the input size can be reasonably large (up to 10^5 elements).
   
2. **What is the range of the integer values in `nums`?**
    - Assume the elements in the array are positive integers within the range [1, 1000].

3. **What are the constraints on `k`?**
    - The integer `k` will be positive and less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
    - Given that the array can be large, and computing the product of all k-size subarrays naively would be inefficient, a sliding window approach will be used.
    - This approach allows us to compute the product of the subarray in O(1) time after the initial product computation.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
    - Initialize the product of the first `k` elements.
    - For each subsequent subarray, adjust the product by dividing by the element that is sliding out and multiplying by the element that is sliding in.
    - Keep a running sum of all these products.

### Time Complexity

- The sliding window approach ensures that each element is processed a constant number of times, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    long long sumOfPowerOfKSizeSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        long long sum = 0;
        long long currentProduct = 1;
        
        // Initialize the product for the first k elements
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            currentProduct *= nums[i];
        }
        
        sum += currentProduct;
        
        // Slide the window across array
        for (int i = k; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            currentProduct = (currentProduct / nums[i - k]) * nums[i];
            sum += currentProduct;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k = 2;
    long long result = solution.sumOfPowerOfKSizeSubarrays(nums, k);
    std::cout << "Sum of power of k-size subarrays: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Compute the product of the initial `k` elements and add it to the sum.
- **Sliding Window**: For each new element in the array from `k` to `n`, update the product by removing the effect of the element that slides out and including the effect of the new element that slides in. Add the updated product to the sum.

This solution ensures efficient computation while maintaining clarity and correctness.
