[Leetcode 410. Split Array Largest Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l410)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` which consists of non-negative integers and an integer `m`, you can split the array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these `m` subarrays.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the values in the array `nums` always non-negative integers?
2. Is there a lower bound or an upper bound for the length of the array `nums` and the integer `m`?
3. Should the solution efficiently handle edge cases such as the smallest and largest possible values for `nums` and `m`?
4. Are there any constraints on the time complexity we need to consider due to large input sizes?

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, a binary search combined with a greedy method (or dynamic programming) is often adopted:

1. **Binary Search on the Answer**:
    - The key observation is that the minimum possible value of the largest sum among the subarrays (`min_largest_sum`) is the maximum value in the array (`max(nums)`). 
    - The maximum possible value of the largest sum (`max_largest_sum`) is the sum of the entire array (`sum(nums)`).
    - We will perform a binary search between `max(nums)` and `sum(nums)` to find the smallest possible value that allows us to split the array into at most `m` subarrays.

2. **Greedy Checking Feasibility**:
    - For a mid value in our binary search, check if we can split the array into `m` or fewer parts such that no part has a sum greater than `mid`.
    - This is done by iterating through the array and greedily creating subarrays while their sums are less than or equal to `mid`.

3. **Implementation**:
    - Use binary search to narrow down the possible values for the answer.
    - Use a helper function to check whether a given value can serve as a valid threshold to split the array into `m` or fewer subarrays.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    int splitArray(std::vector<int>& nums, int m) {
        // Helper function to determine if mid can be the max sum of one of the m subarrays
        auto canSplit = [&](int mid) -> bool {
            int current_sum = 0;
            int subarrays_required = 1; // Start with at least one subarray

            for (int num : nums) {
                if (current_sum + num > mid) {
                    // Need a new subarray
                    subarrays_required++;
                    current_sum = num; // Start new subarray with the current element
                    if (subarrays_required > m) {
                        return false; // More subarrays than allowed
                    }
                } else {
                    current_sum += num;
                }
            }
            return true;
        };

        // Binary search between maximum element in nums and sum of all elements
        int left = *std::max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int right = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        int result = right;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canSplit(mid)) {
                result = mid; // mid can be the maximum sum of subarrays
                right = mid - 1; // try for a smaller maximum sum
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // mid is too small, try a larger maximum sum
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The binary search step will run in \(O(\log S)\), where \(S\) is the sum of the array because we are searching between the maximum element and the total sum of the array.
- **Greedy Splitting Check**: Each check to see if we can split the array (the `canSplit` function) runs in \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log S)\).
