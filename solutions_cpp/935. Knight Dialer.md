[Leetcode 935. Knight Dialer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l935)
## Problem Statement

The problem involves a knight on an infinite chessboard moving between digits; the goal is to determine the number of distinct phone numbers of length n that can be dialed, starting from any digit using valid knight moves.

A knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square in a perpendicular direction. The knight cannot move outside the normal 3x4 grid containing the digits 0-9 as follows:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
  0
```

Your goal is to count how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` can be dialed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints are there on the value of n?**
    Typically, in an interview problem, this will be around `1 <= n <= 5000`.

2. **Are all digits valid starting points?**
    Yes, for this problem the knight can start from any digit.

3. **Do repeated visits to the same number in the sequence count as distinct?**
    Yes, each sequence is independent of others.

## Strategy

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Define `dp[i][j]` to be the number of distinct sequences of length `i` that end at digit `j`.

- Initialize `dp[1][j] = 1` for all `j` because each digit alone is a sequence of length 1.
- Use a predefined array to handle the knight moves efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Create a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` means the number of distinct phone numbers of length `i` ending with the digit `j`.
2. Initialize the base case: for length 1, `dp[1][j] = 1`.
3. For `i` from `2` to `n`, update `dp[i][j]` for each digit `j` by summing up the valid moves from the previous length, `dp[i-1][k]` for each `k` that can move to `j`.
4. Sum up all `dp[n][j]` for `0 <= j <= 9` for the final result.

### Movement Mapping
Create a dictionary that maps each digit to the possible digits it can move to:
```
{
    0: [4, 6],
    1: [6, 8],
    2: [7, 9],
    3: [4, 8],
    4: [0, 3, 9],
    5: [],      # The knight cannot move to or from 5 directly
    6: [0, 1, 7],
    7: [2, 6],
    8: [1, 3],
    9: [2, 4]
}
```

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int knightDialer(int n) {
    if (n == 1) return 10; // there are 10 possible one-digit numbers

    vector<vector<int>> moves = {
        {4, 6},    // 0 can move to 4, 6
        {6, 8},    // 1 can move to 6, 8
        {7, 9},    // 2 can move to 7, 9
        {4, 8},    // 3 can move to 4, 8
        {0, 3, 9}, // 4 can move to 0, 3, 9
        {},        // 5 cannot move anywhere
        {0, 1, 7}, // 6 can move to 0, 1, 7
        {2, 6},    // 7 can move to 2, 6
        {1, 3},    // 8 can move to 1, 3
        {2, 4}     // 9 can move to 2, 4
    };

    vector<vector<long long>> dp(n + 1, vector<long long>(10, 0));

    for (int j = 0; j <= 9; ++j) dp[1][j] = 1;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 9; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = 0;
            for (int move : moves[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][move]) % 1000000007;
            }
        }
    }

    long long result = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j <= 9; ++j) {
        result = (result + dp[n][j]) % 1000000007;
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the length of the phone numbers: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Total distinct phone numbers of length " << n << " is: " << knightDialer(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n * 10 * moves), where `moves` is a constant (maximum 3 in this case). Simplified, the complexity is O(n), which is efficient.

The space complexity is also O(n * 10), which is manageable for large n within the given constraint (`n <= 5000`).
