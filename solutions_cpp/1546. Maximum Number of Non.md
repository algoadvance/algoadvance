[Leetcode 1546. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1546)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` and an integer `target`. You want to find the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays such that the sum of the elements in each subarray is equal to `target`.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 non-overlapping subarrays [1,1] [1,1] with sum equals to 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the subarrays overlap?
   **A:** No, the subarrays must be non-overlapping.
   
2. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

3. **Q:** What is the length range of the array `nums`?
   **A:** The length can vary from very small to up to `10^5`.

4. **Q:** What is the range of elements in `nums`?
   **A:** Elements can be negative, zero, or positive.

## Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum and HashMap:** 
   - Use a prefix sum and a hash map to track the sum of elements up to the current index.
   - Use the hash map to find if there is a subarray that sums to `target` by taking advantage of the difference between current prefix sum and previous prefix sums.

2. **Non-Overlapping Subarrays:**
   - Use a pointer or variable to mark the endpoint of the last found valid subarray to ensure non-overlapping.

3. **Algorithm Overview:**
   - Initialize `prefix_sum` as 0 and a hash map with an entry `{0: -1}`.
   - Traverse the array while maintaining the `prefix_sum`.
   - For each element, check if `prefix_sum - target` exists in the hash map and if the corresponding subarray ends before the last valid endpoint.
   - If such a subarray is found, increment the count and update the latest endpoint.
   - Update the hash map with the current `prefix_sum`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxNonOverlapping(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumIndices;
        prefixSumIndices[0] = -1;

        int prefix_sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int lastEnd = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            prefix_sum += nums[i];

            if (prefixSumIndices.find(prefix_sum - target) != prefixSumIndices.end()) {
                int start_of_subarray = prefixSumIndices[prefix_sum - target] + 1;
                if (start_of_subarray > lastEnd) {
                    count++;
                    lastEnd = i;
                }
            }

            prefixSumIndices[prefix_sum] = i;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, due to the storage needed for the hash map containing prefix sums.

This approach ensures that we can find the maximum number of non-overlapping subarrays with a sum equal to the target efficiently within linear time.
