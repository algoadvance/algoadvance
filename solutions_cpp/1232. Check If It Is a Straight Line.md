[Leetcode 1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1232)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `coordinates`, `coordinates[i] = [x, y]`, where `coordinates[i]` represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the `coordinates` array?**
   - The number of points and hence the length of `coordinates` will be at least 2 (since a line requires at least two points) but can go up to a reasonably large number, typically in the range \( [2, 10^4] \).

2. **Can the coordinates contain negative values?**
   - Yes, coordinates can be negative as well as positive since they represent points in a 2D Cartesian plane.

3. **What is the expected output?**
   - The function should return `true` if the points form a straight line, otherwise `false`.

### Strategy

To determine if a set of points lies on a straight line, we can use the concept of slope. For any three points \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\), they are collinear (form a straight line) if and only if the slopes between the points are equal.

The slope between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

To avoid division and possible division by zero errors, we can cross-multiply to compare the slopes:
\[ (y_2 - y_1) \times (x_3 - x_2) = (y_3 - y_2) \times (x_2 - x_1) \]

If this condition holds true for every set of three consecutive points, then all the points are collinear.

### Code

We will implement this strategy in the function `checkStraightLine`. Here's how it can be coded in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkStraightLine(vector<vector<int>>& coordinates) {
        int x0 = coordinates[0][0], y0 = coordinates[0][1];
        int x1 = coordinates[1][0], y1 = coordinates[1][1];
        int dx = x1 - x0, dy = y1 - y0;
        
        for (int i = 2; i < coordinates.size(); ++i) {
            int xi = coordinates[i][0], yi = coordinates[i][1];
            if (dy * (xi - x1) != dx * (yi - y1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm traverses the list of points once, performing a constant time calculation for each pair of points. Therefore, it has a time complexity of \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of points.
- **Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is \( O(1) \).
