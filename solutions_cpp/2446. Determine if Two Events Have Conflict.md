[Leetcode 2446. Determine if Two Events Have Conflict](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2446)
## Problem Statement

You are given two events in the form of two pairs of strings: `event1` and `event2`. Each string represents an event time in the format `"HH:MM"`. Your goal is to determine if these two events conflict with each other. Two events conflict if they overlap in time.

For example:
- `event1 = ["10:00", "11:00"]`
- `event2 = ["10:30", "12:00"]`

In this case, the two events have a conflict because they overlap from 10:30 to 11:00.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Time format:** Is the time format always guaranteed to be in `"HH:MM"` and in 24-hour time format?
   - Yes.

2. **Same time events:** If two events start or end exactly at the same time, do they conflict?
   - Yes, if one event starts at the same time another ends, they are considered to conflict.

3. **Order of events:** Is `event1` always before `event2` in the input order?
   - Input order does not matter. The events may or may not be in any time order.

## Strategy

1. **Convert Time to Minutes:**
   - Convert the `"HH:MM"` format to total minutes from `00:00` for easy comparison.

2. **Compare Events:**
   - Check if the two events overlap by comparing their start and end times.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Function to convert "HH:MM" to minutes from "00:00"
int convertToMinutes(const string &time) {
    int hours = stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
    int minutes = stoi(time.substr(3, 2));
    return hours * 60 + minutes;
}

// Function to determine if two events have a conflict
bool haveConflict(vector<string>& event1, vector<string>& event2) {
    int start1 = convertToMinutes(event1[0]);
    int end1 = convertToMinutes(event1[1]);
    int start2 = convertToMinutes(event2[0]);
    int end2 = convertToMinutes(event2[1]);
    
    // Check if the events do not overlap
    // If one event starts after the other ends, they do not overlap
    if (end1 <= start2 || end2 <= start1) {
        return false;
    }

    // They overlap otherwise
    return true;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> event1 = {"10:00", "11:00"};
    vector<string> event2 = {"10:30", "12:00"};
    
    bool conflict = haveConflict(event1, event2);
    cout << (conflict ? "Conflict" : "No Conflict") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Conversion Function:**
   - The `convertToMinutes` function converts a time string in `"HH:MM"` format to the total minutes from midnight.
   
2. **Conflict Function:**
   - The `haveConflict` function calculates the start and end times of both events in minutes.
   - It then checks if the intervals `[start1, end1)` and `[start2, end2)` do not overlap. If `end1 <= start2` or `end2 <= start1`, the events do not overlap. Otherwise, they do.

3. **Main Function:**
   - We use `main` to test our solution with sample inputs.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is **O(1)**, as all operations (converting time, comparing intervals) take constant time.
