[Leetcode 2708. Maximum Strength of a Group](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2708)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers representing the strengths of individuals in a group. You need to select some (at least one) individuals such that the product of their strengths is maximized. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the input size:** 
   - What is the maximum number of integers in the list?
   
2. **Range of integers:** 
   - Are the strengths all positive, or can they be negative as well?
   
3. **Output:** 
   - Should the output be the maximum strength product as an integer?
   
4. **Selection of elements:** 
   - Does selection mean choosing consecutive elements, or can they be any subset of elements?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - If the list contains negative numbers, their inclusion can make the product higher if paired properly.
   - If the list has zeros, including them would bring the product to zero.
   - If the list contains only one element, return that element as it is the maximum product.
   
2. **Handling odd number of negatives:**
   - If the count of negative numbers is odd, we can either include all but the one with the least absolute value or exclude that one from the selection to maximize the product.
   
3. **Handling zeros:**
   - Zeros should be excluded unless the entire list is zero or it is the only available selection.
   
4. **Algorithm:**
   - We will iterate through the list and separate the positives, negatives, and zeros.
   - For the product calculation:
     - If all numbers are non-positive, handle it based on counts.
     - If all numbers are zeros, the maximum strength is zero.
     - If a mix, compute the product, considering the negatives' parity to determine inclusion.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

long long maxStrength(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() == 0) return 0;
    int neg_count = 0, zero_count = 0;
    vector<int> negatives, positives;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num == 0) {
            ++zero_count;
        } else if (num < 0) {
            negatives.push_back(num);
            ++neg_count;
        } else {
            positives.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    // If all elements are zeros
    if (zero_count == nums.size()) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // If all are non-positive, special handling
    if (zero_count + neg_count == nums.size() && (neg_count == 1 || positives.empty())) {
        if (neg_count == 1) return *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    }
    
    // Sort negatives to handle odd count
    sort(negatives.begin(), negatives.end());
    if (neg_count % 2 != 0) {
        negatives.pop_back(); // Remove the smallest magnitude negative.
    }
    
    // Calculate product
    long long product = 1;
    for (int num : positives) {
        product *= num;
    }
    for (int num : negatives) {
        product *= num;
    }
        
    return product;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Iterating through the array:** \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n) + O(n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).

The above approach ensures that the function runs efficiently even for large inputs up to typical constraints in competitive programming and coding interviews.
