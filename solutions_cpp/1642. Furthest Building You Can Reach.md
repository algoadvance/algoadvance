[Leetcode 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1642)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`. You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by either using bricks or ladders. While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (for `i < n-1`), if the height of building `i+1` is greater than the height of building `i`, you must use bricks. The number of bricks you use equals the difference in heights (`heights[i+1] - heights[i]`). If you do not have enough bricks, you can use a ladder.

Your goal is to reach the furthest building possible. Given the heights array, bricks, and ladders, return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the number of bricks and ladders always non-negative?
   - Yes, the number of bricks and ladders are non-negative integers.
   
2. Can the heights of buildings be negative?
   - No, the heights of buildings are non-negative integers.
   
3. What should the function return if it is possible to reach the last building or further?
   - The function should return the index of the last building if it is possible to reach it.

### Strategy

1. We'll iterate over the array and for each step from building `i` to building `i+1`, calculate the difference in heights.
2. If the difference is negative (i.e., the next building is shorter or of equal height), simply move to the next building.
3. If the difference is positive (i.e., the next building is taller), we need to decide whether to use bricks or ladders:
   - Always try to use bricks first.
   - Keep track of the used bricks in a min-heap so that we can replace the smallest brick usage with a ladder later if needed.
4. If we run out of bricks, replace the smallest brick usage with a ladder.
5. If we run out of both bricks and ladders, return the current building index.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int furthestBuilding(vector<int>& heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> min_heap; // Min-heap to track smallest jumps
    int n = heights.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i];
        if (diff > 0) {
            min_heap.push(diff);
        }
        
        if (min_heap.size() > ladders) {
            bricks -= min_heap.top();
            min_heap.pop();
        }

        if (bricks < 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return n - 1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm mainly involves iterating over the `heights` array and maintaining a min-heap. The operations on the min-heap (insert and extract-min) each take \(O(\log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of elements in the heap.
  - In the worst case, where we traverse the entire array and the number of ladders or jumps (heap size) goes up to \(O(n)\), the time complexity will be \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is dominated by the space needed to maintain the min-heap, which in the worst case can contain \(O(n)\) elements, resulting in \(O(n)\) space complexity.
