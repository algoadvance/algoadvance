[Leetcode 2597. The Number of Beautiful Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2597)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`. 

A subset of `nums` is called `beautiful` if it does not contain two integers with an absolute difference equal to `k`.

Return the number of `beautiful` subsets of the array `nums`.

A subset is a non-empty subset that can be derived from `nums` without changing the order of elements.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 4, 6], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
The beautiful subsets are: [2], [4], [6], [2, 6], and [4, 6].
Subsets [2, 4] and [2, 4, 6] are not beautiful because the absolute difference between 2 and 4 is 2 (which equals k).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
    - What range of values can elements in `nums` take?
    - What is the maximum value of `k`?

2. **Output Details**:
    - Should the output be a count of the subsets, or do we also need to provide the subsets themselves?

Let's assume the maximum length of `nums` is 1000, elements range from -1000 to 1000, and `k` will also be a positive integer up to 1000. The output is only the count of the beautiful subsets.

## Strategy

We can use a backtracking approach to generate all subsets and count the beautiful ones. Here's the plan:

1. Use a recursive function to explore all subsets.
2. For each subset, check if it is beautiful.
3. Count how many of the subsets are beautiful.

### Steps:

1. Sort the input array `nums` to facilitate the absolute difference check.
2. Use a recursive function to generate all subsets.
3. Use a helper function to check if a subset is beautiful.
4. Count valid subsets and return the count.

### Backtracking Approach:

- For each element in `nums`, decide to either include it in the current subset or exclude it.
- If including an element violates the beautiful condition (due to `k` difference), skip that path.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int beautifulSubsets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        vector<int> currentSubset;
        backtrack(nums, k, 0, currentSubset, count);
        return count - 1; // -1 to exclude the empty subset
    }

private:
    void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, int k, int start, vector<int>& currentSubset, int& count) {
        if (isBeautiful(currentSubset, k)) {
            count++;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            currentSubset.push_back(nums[i]);
            backtrack(nums, k, i + 1, currentSubset, count);
            currentSubset.pop_back();
        }
    }

    bool isBeautiful(vector<int>& subset, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < subset.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < subset.size(); j++) {
                if (abs(subset[i] - subset[j]) == k) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {2, 4, 6};
    int k = 2;

    int result = sol.beautifulSubsets(nums, k);
    printf("Number of beautiful subsets: %d\n", result); // 4

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Subset Generation:** We generate all subsets, which takes `O(2^n)` time where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Checking Beautiful Condition:** For each subset, checking the pairwise differences takes `O(n^2)` in the worst case (where `n` is the subset size, at most `n`).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(2^n * n^2)`. Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough.
