[Leetcode 1849. Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1849)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that consists of only digits.

Your task is to determine if you can split the string into two or more non-empty substrings such that the numerical values of these substrings form a consecutive decreasing sequence.

For example, if the string is "54321", you can split it as ["5", "4", "3", "2", "1"]. The numerical values of these substrings (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) form a consecutive decreasing sequence.

If it is possible, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "54321"
Output: true
Explanation: "54321" can be split into ["5", "4", "3", "2", "1"] which are consecutive descending values.
```

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, here are a few questions to clarify the problem statement:

1. **Can the input string `s` have leading zeros?**
   - The string should not have leading zeros as it contains only numerical values.

2. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - Let's assume it can be as long as typical constraints on input strings in competitive programming, potentially up to 10^5 characters.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the substrings?**
   - The substrings must be non-empty, and the split should result in a consecutive decreasing series.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Split Point**: The key idea is to try every possible initial split of the string to pick the first number and then check if the rest of the string can be split into a consecutive decreasing sequence.
  
2. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try to find such a sequence by decreasing from the first number.

3. **Recursion**: Define a recursive function that attempts to validate the sequence by passing the expected next decreasing value during each recursive call.

### Code

We'll implement a solution using recursion:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool canSplit(string s, long long prev) {
    // Base case: if we have exhausted the string
    if (s.empty()) return true;

    // Try splitting the string into the next number
    for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); ++i) {
        string nextStr = s.substr(0, i);
        long long nextNum = stoll(nextStr);
        
        // If nextNum + 1 equals prev, we proceed with the remaining string
        if (nextNum + 1 == prev) {
            if (canSplit(s.substr(i), nextNum)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

bool splitString(string s) {
    // Try each possible first number in the string
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        string firstStr = s.substr(0, i);
        long long firstNum = stoll(firstStr);
        
        if (canSplit(s.substr(i), firstNum)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int main() {
    string s = "54321";
    cout << (splitString(s) ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution can be approximated by considering the recursive splitting of the string:
  - For each starting position, we check splits iterating from length 1 to the end of the string.
  - In the worst case, the time complexity of this approach can be exponential, i.e., `O(2^n)`.

However, this approach should be optimized further for practical use-cases, especially with larger strings. Typically, constraints and additional optimization strategies, such as dynamic programming or memoization, can be employed to enhance performance.
