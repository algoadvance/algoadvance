[Leetcode 2018. Check if Word Can Be Placed In Crossword](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2018)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an `m x n` matrix `board`, representing a crossword puzzle. Additionally, you receive a string `word`. The rules for inserting the word into the crossword are as follows:
- The word must be placed either horizontally or vertically.
- The word can be placed from left to right or from top to bottom.
- The word can be placed from right to left or from bottom to top.
- The spaces in the `board` marked with "#" are obstacles, and the word cannot go through these spaces.
- The spaces marked with " " are empty and can be filled with the characters from the word.
- The spaces in the board marked with lowercase English letters are pre-filled and must match the corresponding letters in the word when placed.

Your task is to determine if you can place the word in the crossword according to the rule above.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can the word overlap with existing characters on the board?
   **A:** Yes, but only if the characters match exactly.
   
2. **Q:** Can the word be placed backwards or upside down?
   **A:** Yes, the word can be placed from left to right, right to left, top to bottom, or bottom to top.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the board or the length of the word?
   **A:** Based on typical constraints:
    - `1 <= m, n <= 200`
    - `1 <= word.length <= min(m, n)`

### Strategy:
1. **Check Horizontal Placements:**
   - For each row, check all possible substrings where the word can fit.
   - Validate if the word matches or can fit into the substring based on the game rules (considering pre-filled characters).

2. **Check Vertical Placements:**
   - For each column, check all possible substrings where the word can fit.
   - Similar validation as in horizontal placements.

3. **Inverse checks for backwards or upside-down placements**
   - Consider checking for the reversed word in both horizontal and vertical placements.

### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceWord(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word, string target) {
        int m = board.size();
        int n = board[0].size();
        
        // Check each row for target match
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n - target.size(); ++j) {
                bool match = true;
                for (int k = 0; k < target.size(); ++k) {
                    if (board[i][j + k] != ' ' && board[i][j + k] != target[k]) {
                        match = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (match && (j == 0 || board[i][j - 1] == '#') && (j + target.size() == n || board[i][j + target.size()] == '#')) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check each column for target match
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= m - target.size(); ++j) {
                bool match = true;
                for (int k = 0; k < target.size(); ++k) {
                    if (board[j + k][i] != ' ' && board[j + k][i] != target[k]) {
                        match = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (match && (j == 0 || board[j - 1][i] == '#') && (j + target.size() == m || board[j + target.size()][i] == '#')) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    bool placeWordInCrossword(vector<vector<char>>& board, string word) {
        string reversedWord = word;
        reverse(reversedWord.begin(), reversedWord.end());
        return canPlaceWord(board, word, word) || canPlaceWord(board, word, reversedWord);
    }
};
```
### Time Complexity:
- **Horizontal Check:** O(m * n * word_length)
- **Vertical Check:** O(m * n * word_length)
- Total Complexity: O(m * n * word_length)

This complexity is manageable within the typical constraints provided (1 <= m, n <= 200 and 1 <= word.length <= min(m, n)). Each check for placement involves scanning part of the board, making it efficient enough for the constraints.
