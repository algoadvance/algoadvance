[Leetcode 2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2139)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer `1` and you want to reach the integer `target` using a certain set of moves. In each move, you can either:
1. Add `1` to your current integer.
2. Multiply the integer by `2`.

You can perform the "multiply by 2" operation at most `maxDoubles` times. Given two integers `target` and `maxDoubles`, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach the `target`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is the target always guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1?
   - Yes, the problem constraints typically ensure that `target` will be a positive integer.

2. Can `maxDoubles` be zero?
   - Yes, `maxDoubles` can be zero, in which case you can only add `1` in each move.

3. What is the range of `target` and `maxDoubles`?
   - This is typically provided in the problem constraints, but we can assume a large range, e.g., up to \(10^9\) for `target`.

## Strategy

To minimize the number of moves, we should use the "multiply by 2" operation as effectively as possible because it significantly reduces the number of moves compared to repeated additions.

Thus, the strategy will be to work backwards from the target:
1. If `target` is even and we still have remaining `maxDoubles`, divide the target by `2`.
2. If `target` is odd or we have exhausted `maxDoubles`, subtract `1` from the target.

Continue this process until we reach `1`. Each operation corresponds to a move, and we'll count these moves to get our result.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
// Efficient approach by tracing back from target to 1.
#include <iostream>

int minMoves(int target, int maxDoubles) {
    int moves = 0;
    
    // Loop until we reduce the target to 1
    while (target > 1) {
        // If maxDoubles are used up, we can only add 1
        if (maxDoubles == 0) {
            moves += (target - 1); // Add the remaining distance to the moves
            break;
        }
        
        // If target is even, we will use a double
        if (target % 2 == 0) {
            target /= 2;
            maxDoubles--;
        } 
        // If target is odd, we will make it even
        else {
            target -= 1;
        }
        
        moves++; // each loop iteration represents one move
    }
    
    return moves;
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     std::cout << minMoves(10, 4) << std::endl; // Output should be 4
//     return 0;
// }
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(\log target)\) because each division by 2 operation significantly reduces the size of the problem. In the worst case, when we cannot divide by 2 at all (no remaining `maxDoubles`), we would subtract `1` to reach `1`, which is \(O(target)\). However, effectively using the "multiply by 2" will lead to much faster convergence, reducing the complexity practically to logarithmic time.

Therefore, the efficient use of "multiply by 2" operations is crucial for minimizing the number of moves.
