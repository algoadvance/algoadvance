[Leetcode 2079. Watering Plants](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2079)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `plants` of positive integers. The integer at each index represents how much water that plant needs. Initially, you have a water can with a capacity of `capacity` units, which you can refill at a river. The river is positioned right before the first plant. 

Your task is to determine the minimum number of steps to water all the plants. You start at the river (position -1) and can only move to an adjacent plant to water it. If you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, you need to return to the river to refill the water can.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can you assume that you can only water each plant once?
   - Yes.
2. Is the river always right before the first plant?
   - Yes, the river is always at position `-1`.
3. Are the values in the `plants` array always positive integers?
   - Yes, the problem specifies that the `plants` array consists of positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will simulate the process of watering the plants:

1. Start at the river (position -1).
2. Move to the first plant and attempt to water it.
3. If there is sufficient water in the can to water the plant, decrement the water available and move to the next plant.
4. If there is not enough water to water the plant, return to the river to refill the can and move back to the plant (this will take twice the distance to the river).
5. Continue this process until all the plants are watered.

Record and sum the steps taken during each movement to get the minimum number of steps required.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int wateringPlants(vector<int>& plants, int capacity) {
    int steps = 0;
    int currentCapacity = capacity;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < plants.size(); ++i) {
        if (plants[i] <= currentCapacity) {
            // Water the plant and move to the next one
            currentCapacity -= plants[i];
            steps++;
        } else {
            // Move back to the river to refill (2 * i steps)
            steps += 2 * i;
            // Refill the water can
            currentCapacity = capacity;
            // Water the plant and move to the next one
            currentCapacity -= plants[i];
            steps++;
        }
    }
    
    return steps;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> plants = {2, 4, 5, 1, 2};
    int capacity = 6;
    cout << "Minimum steps: " << wateringPlants(plants, capacity) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of plants. This is because each plant is processed exactly once, and in the worst case, we move back to the river and then to the plant, which still results in a linear number of operations relative to the number of plants.

### Explanation:
1. The loop iterates over each plant.
2. If the water can has enough capacity to water the plant, decrement the capacity and increment the steps by 1.
3. If not, return to the river, refill, increment the steps by twice the current position (to account for forward and return trip), then decrement capacity and increment steps by 1 after refilling.
