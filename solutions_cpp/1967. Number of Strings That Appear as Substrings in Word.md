[Leetcode 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1967)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`, return the number of strings in `patterns` that appear as substrings in `word`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length for the `word` and for each string in `patterns`?**
   - Suppose the length of the `word` can be up to \(10^3\) and the length of each pattern can be up to \(100\).
   
2. **Can the strings in `patterns` be empty?**
   - No, each string in `patterns` will be non-empty.

3. **Are the strings case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, strings are case-sensitive.

4. **Can `patterns` contain duplicate strings?**
   - Yes, it can contain duplicates.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Over Patterns**: Iterate over each string in `patterns`.
2. **Check Substring**: For each string, check if it appears as a substring in `word`.
3. **Count Matches**: Increment a counter for each pattern that appears as a substring in `word`.
4. **Return Result**: Return the counter.

#### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfStrings(std::vector<std::string>& patterns, std::string word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const std::string& pattern : patterns) {
            if (word.find(pattern) != std::string::npos) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<std::string> patterns = {"a", "abc", "bc", "d"};
    std::string word = "abc";
    std::cout << sol.numOfStrings(patterns, word) << std::endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding Substring**: Checking if one string is a substring of another can be done in \(O(n \cdot m)\) time in the worst case (`n` is the length of `word` and `m` is the length of pattern) using the `find` method in C++ STL.
- **Total Complexity**: Since we do this for each pattern, the overall time complexity is \(O(k \cdot n \cdot m)\) where `k` is the number of patterns, `n` is the length of `word`, and `m` is the maximum length of any pattern.

### Conclusion

This solution iterates through each pattern and checks if it exists in the `word` by leveraging the `find` method from the C++ STL, making it straightforward and easily understandable.
