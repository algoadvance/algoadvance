[Leetcode 830. Positions of Large Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l830)
### Problem Statement
The problem is as follows:

In a string `s` of lowercase letters, a "large group" is a group that has 3 or more consecutive identical characters.

Write a function `largeGroupPositions` that takes the string `s` as input and returns the starting and ending positions of every large group in the string. The positions should be returned as a list of lists where each list contains two integers [start, end].

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3, 6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with starting and ending positions [3, 6].

Input: s = "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: There are no large groups in the string.
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- `s` contains lowercase English letters only.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if there are no large groups in the string?**
   - An empty list should be returned.
2. **Are overlapping large groups possible?**
   - No, as large groups consist of consecutive identical characters, overlapping is not possible.
3. **Do we need to handle edge cases for input constraints (minimum and maximum lengths)?**
   - Yes, the function should work for the smallest input (length 1) and the largest (length 1000).

### Strategy
1. **Iteration and Count**: We will iterate through the string and count consecutive identical characters.
2. **Check Length**: When current character != next character, we check if the count of consecutive characters is 3 or more.
3. **Record Positions**: If the count is 3 or more, we store the starting and ending indices.
4. **Reset Counter**: Reset the counter for the next new character sequence and continue.
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases like strings shorter than 3 where large groups are not possible, and strings where all characters are the same.

### Code
Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string s) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        int n = s.size();
        int i = 0; // Initialize the starting pointer

        while (i < n) {
            int j = i;
            // Move j to the end of the current group of same characters
            while (j < n && s[j] == s[i]) {
                j++;
            }
            // If the length of this group is 3 or more, add to result
            if (j - i >= 3) {
                result.push_back({i, j - 1});
            }
            // Move i to the next new character
            i = j;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the string. Each character in the string is processed once, and operations inside the loop are constant time operations.

### Example Execution
For `s = "abbxxxxzzy"`, this implementation would produce the output `[[3, 6]]`:
1. `i = 0`: `s[0] != s[1]`, so `j = 1`. Move `i` to `1`.
2. `i = 1`: `s[1] == s[2] != s[3]`, `j = 3`, `i` to `3`.
3. `i = 3`: `s[3] == s[4] == s[5] == s[6] != s[7]`, `j = 7`, large group `xxxx` from 3 to 6, add `[3, 6]` to result, `i` to `7`.
4. Process continues for the rest of the string.

If something is unclear or an edge case is missing, feel free to ask for further clarifications!
