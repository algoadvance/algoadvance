[Leetcode 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2220)
### Problem Statement
Given two integers `start` and `goal`, determine the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can `start` and `goal` be negative numbers?**
   - **A: No, both `start` and `goal` are non-negative integers.**
2. **Q: What is the range of `start` and `goal`?**
   - **A: Both `start` and `goal` are within the range of 0 to 10^9.**
3. **Q: Do I need to consider the binary representation size?**
   - **A: No, standard integer handling and binary manipulation are sufficient for this problem.**

### Strategy
The problem can be solved using bit manipulation. Here's the step-by-step strategy:
1. **XOR Operation**: Using XOR (exclusive OR), compare `start` and `goal`. The XOR operation between two bits results in 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. Thus, `start XOR goal` will give us a number whose binary representation has bits set to 1 wherever `start` and `goal` differ.
2. **Count Set Bits**: Count the number of set bits (1s) in the result from the XOR operation. Each set bit represents a position where the bits of `start` and `goal` differ.
3. **Result**: The count of set bits is the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
    // XOR start and goal to find differing bits
    int xorResult = start ^ goal;
    
    // Count the number of set bits in xorResult
    int count = 0;
    while (xorResult > 0) {
        count += xorResult & 1;  // Increment count if the least significant bit is 1
        xorResult >>= 1;         // Right shift to process the next bit
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int start = 10;  // Example input
    int goal = 7;    // Example input
    
    std::cout << "Minimum bit flips required: " << minBitFlips(start, goal) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is **O(b)**, where `b` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the maximum of `start` and `goal`. In this problem, `b` is bounded by the maximum bit length of the given integers (log2(10^9) which is approximately 30), so it effectively runs in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
