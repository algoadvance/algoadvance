[Leetcode 2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2002)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find two **non-overlapping** palindromic subsequences of `s` such that the product of their lengths is maximized. You may return the maximum product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string s?**
   - To determine the potential computational complexity and feasibility of different strategies.

2. **Can the two subsequences overlap?**
   - According to the problem statement, they must be non-overlapping.

3. **Is the string guaranteed to contain palindromic subsequences?**
   - Yes, every string containing single characters inherently has palindromic subsequences.

4. **What characters are allowed in the string?**
   - Assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Subsequences:**
   - We can generate all possible subsequences of the string `s`.

2. **Check for Palindromes:**
   - For each subsequence, check whether it is a palindrome.

3. **Maximize Product:**
   - Iterate through each pair of non-overlapping palindromic subsequences and calculate the product of their lengths. Keep track of the maximum product.

### Code

To solve this, we will need helper functions to: 
1. Generate subsequences.
2. Check if a subsequence is a palindrome.
3. Ensure two subsequences are non-overlapping.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Function to check if a given string is a palindrome
bool isPalindrome(const string& s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to generate all subsequences of a given string
void generateSubsequences(const string& s, int index, string current, vector<string>& subsequences) {
    if (index == s.size()) {
        subsequences.push_back(current);
        return;
    }
    generateSubsequences(s, index + 1, current + s[index], subsequences);
    generateSubsequences(s, index + 1, current);
}

// Function to check if two subsequences are non-overlapping
bool nonOverlapping(const vector<int>& seq1, const vector<int>& seq2) {
    unordered_set<int> indices(seq1.begin(), seq1.end());
    for (int idx : seq2) {
        if (indices.count(idx)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Function to generate subsequences with their indices
void generateSubsequencesWithIndices(const string& s, int index, vector<int> currentIndices, vector<string> currentStrings, vector<pair<string, vector<int>>>& subsequencesWithIndices) {
    if (index == s.size()) {
        for (const string& str : currentStrings) {
            subsequencesWithIndices.push_back({ str, currentIndices });
        }
        return;
    }
    currentIndices.push_back(index);
    
    for (string& str : currentStrings) {
        str.push_back(s[index]);
    }
    
    vector<string> newCurrentStrings = currentStrings;
    generateSubsequencesWithIndices(s, index + 1, currentIndices, newCurrentStrings, subsequencesWithIndices);
    
    generateSubsequencesWithIndices(s, index + 1, currentIndices, currentStrings, subsequencesWithIndices);
}

int maxProduct(const string& s) {
    vector<vector<int>> subsequencesWithIndices;
    vector<string> subsequences;
    // Generate all subsequences with their original indices
    generateSubsequencesWithIndices(s, 0, {}, {""}, subsequencesWithIndices);

    // Filter out palindromic subsequences
    vector<pair<string, vector<int>>> palindromicSubsequences;
    for (const auto& p : subsequencesWithIndices) {
        if (isPalindrome(p.first)) {
            palindromicSubsequences.push_back(p);
        }
    }

    int maxProduct = 0;
    int n = palindromicSubsequences.size();
    // Check each pair of palindromic subsequences
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (nonOverlapping(palindromicSubsequences[i].second, palindromicSubsequences[j].second)) {
                int product = palindromicSubsequences[i].first.size() * palindromicSubsequences[j].first.size();
                maxProduct = max(maxProduct, product);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxProduct;
}

int main() {
    string s = "ababa";
    cout << maxProduct(s) << endl;  // Expected output: 9
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is largely determined by the generation of all subsequences, \(O(2^n)\), and then checking each pair of subsequences (which also involves checking if they are non-overlapping), this results in an overall complexity of approximately \(O(2^n \cdot 2^n) = O(4^n)\). Given the exponential nature, this solution is most feasible for smaller value of \(n\). For larger values of \(n\), a more optimized approach with dynamic programming might be necessary.
