[Leetcode 2127. Maximum Employees to Be Invited to a Meeting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2127)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `favorite` where `favorite[i]` denotes the person that the `i-th` person likes. 
A person `x` is said to be **invited** to the meeting if one of the following two conditions is met:

1. Person `x` likes person `y` and `y` likes `x` (both are mutual friends).
2. A cycle of other people is formed where each person likes the next person in the cycle such that `x` is included in the cycle.

Your task is to calculate the maximum number of people that can be invited to the meeting.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the maximum size of the `favorite` array?
      - The size can be up to `10^5` elements.
    
2. **Output:**
    - What is the expected type and format of the output?
      - The output should be a single integer indicating the maximum number of people that can be invited.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify the two possible patterns that can form the basis for inviting people:

1. **Mutual Likes:** A pair of people who like each other (forming a small group of two). These need to be detected and counted.
2. **Cycles:** Directed cycles where each person is linked to another in such a way that they all eventually loop back to the start. These need to be expanded as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Detect Mutual Likes:** Use a map to count pairs where `favorite[i] == j` and `favorite[j] == i`.
2. **Detect Cycles:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles and their sizes.
3. **Combine Results:** Sum the sizes of the largest possible mutual-like chains and cycles.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumInvitations(vector<int>& favorite) {
        int n = favorite.size();
        vector<int> indegree(n, 0);
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        vector<int> longest_path_to(n, 0);
        stack<int> st;

        // Calculate in-degrees
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            indegree[favorite[i]]++;
        }

        // Process nodes with zero in-degree
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                st.push(i);
            }
        }

        while (!st.empty()) {
            int node = st.top();
            st.pop();
            visited[node] = true;
            int next_node = favorite[node];
            --indegree[next_node];
            longest_path_to[next_node] = max(longest_path_to[next_node], longest_path_to[node] + 1);
            if (indegree[next_node] == 0) {
                st.push(next_node);
            }
        }

        int max_circle_size = 0;
        int max_chain_size = 0;

        // Detect cycles and chains
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (visited[i]) continue;

            int len = 0;
            int node = i;
            while (!visited[node]) {
                visited[node] = true;
                node = favorite[node];
                len++;
            }

            if (len == 2) {
                max_chain_size += longest_path_to[i] + longest_path_to[favorite[i]] + 2;
            } else {
                max_circle_size = max(max_circle_size, len);
            }
        }

        return max(max_chain_size, max_circle_size);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm primarily involves iterating through the list of favorite indices and performing a DFS-based cycle detection, leading to a time complexity analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** 
    - Building in-degrees and processing zero in-degree nodes in a linear pass: \(O(n)\)
    - Cycle detection using DFS also involves traversing each node and edge at most once: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity:**
    - The additional space mostly involves hashmaps and auxiliary arrays like `visited` and `indegree`, each of which requires \(O(n)\) space.

Overall, the solution is efficient given the constraints.
