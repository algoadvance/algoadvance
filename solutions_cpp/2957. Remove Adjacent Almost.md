[Leetcode 2957. Remove Adjacent Almost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2957)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given a positive integer `k`. You need to identify and remove any adjacent characters in the string that are "almost-equal." Two characters `a` and `b` are considered almost-equal if their absolute difference in ASCII values is less than or equal to `k`.

You should keep removing adjacent almost-equal characters until no more such characters are present. Return the final string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if the string becomes empty?**
   - Return an empty string.
   
2. **Are the characters compared pairwise or should we consider an entire sequence of characters?**
   - We only consider adjacent pairs of characters for almost-equal comparison and removal.

3. **What constraints should be considered for `s` and `k`?**
   - The length of `s` can be up to `100,000` characters.
   - `k` will always be a positive integer and within a reasonable range (e.g., `1 <= k <= 25`).

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a stack** to keep track of the characters as we iterate through the string.
2. **Iterate through the string**, for each character:
   - Compare it with the top of the stack (if the stack is not empty).
   - If the absolute difference of their ASCII values is less than or equal to `k`, pop the stack (removes the almost-equal characters).
   - Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
3. **Convert the stack to the resulting string**.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently handling the removal process with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because each character is processed at most twice (once pushed and once popped from the stack).

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Each character in the string is processed at most twice (push and pop).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - In the worst case, the stack will contain all characters of the string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <cmath>  // For std::abs

std::string removeAlmostEqualChars(const std::string& s, int k) {
    std::stack<char> charStack;

    for (char c : s) {
        if (!charStack.empty() && std::abs(charStack.top() - c) <= k) {
            charStack.pop();
        } else {
            charStack.push(c);
        }
    }

    // Convert stack to resultant string
    std::string result;
    while (!charStack.empty()) {
        result.push_back(charStack.top());
        charStack.pop();
    }

    // The stack will give us the reversed order of characters
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "acbdc";
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << "Result: " << removeAlmostEqualChars(s, k) << std::endl;  // Output should be: "acd"
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialize a stack** to keep track of characters.
2. **Iterate through each character** in the input string:
   - If the stack is not empty and the top character of the stack is almost-equal to the current character (their absolute difference is less than or equal to `k`), pop the stack (remove both characters).
   - Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
3. **Form the result string** by popping characters from the stack and reversing the result as the stack stores characters in reverse order of their appearance.
4. **Return the result**.

This ensures that all almost-equal adjacent pairs are removed effectively.
