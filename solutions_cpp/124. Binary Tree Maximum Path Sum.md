[Leetcode 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l124)
## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.

### Example
- **Input:** [1,2,3]
- **Output:** 6

- **Input:** [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- **Output:** 42

The path may start and end at any node in the tree, and must contain at least one node.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a path?:**
   A path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
   
2. **Can the node values be negative?**
   Yes, the node values can be negative as well as positive.

3. **Do we have to consider paths that start and end at any node?**
   Yes, the path can start and end at any node in the binary tree.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree and keep track of the maximum path sum. We'll implement a helper function that computes the maximum path sum that goes through a node and also returns the maximum path sum that can be extended to its parent.

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the global maximum path sum.
2. Use a recursive helper function to calculate the maximum gain from each node.
3. For each node, calculate the maximum path sum as the sum of the node's value, the maximum gain from the left child, and the maximum gain from the right child.
4. Update the global maximum path sum if the current path sum is higher.
5. Return the maximum gain that can be extended to the parent node.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above logic:

```cpp
#include <algorithm> // for std::max
#include <limits>    // for std::numeric_limits

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int globalMax = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();
        maxGain(root, globalMax);
        return globalMax;
    }

private:
    int maxGain(TreeNode* node, int &globalMax) {
        if (node == nullptr) return 0;

        // Get the maximum gain from the left and right subtrees
        int leftGain = std::max(maxGain(node->left, globalMax), 0);
        int rightGain = std::max(maxGain(node->right, globalMax), 0);

        // The maximum path sum through the current node
        int currentMax = node->val + leftGain + rightGain;

        // Update the global maximum path sum
        globalMax = std::max(globalMax, currentMax);

        // Return the maximum gain that can be extended to the node's parent
        return node->val + std::max(leftGain, rightGain);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the traversal.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the binary tree. This is the space required for the recursion stack. In the worst case, the space complexity could be \(O(N)\) if the binary tree is completely unbalanced.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the maximum path sum for any binary tree.
