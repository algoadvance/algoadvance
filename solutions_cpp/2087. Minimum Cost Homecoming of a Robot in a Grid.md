[Leetcode 2087. Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2087)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integers `startPos` and `homePos`, which represent the coordinates of your starting and home positions, respectively, in (x, y) format in a 2D grid. Each move you make transfers you either one step left, right, up, or down. 
The cost of moving in each of the four directions is given in the integer array `[costX, costY]`, where:
- `costX[0]` is the cost of moving left.
- `costX[1]` is the cost of moving right.
- `costY[0]` is the cost of moving up.
- `costY[1]` is the cost of moving down.

You need to find the minimum cost required to reach your home position from your starting position.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the costs be negative or zero?
   **A:** The problem statement implies non-negative costs, as costs are typically non-negative in path-finding problems.
   
2. **Q:** Are the coordinates in `startPos` and `homePos` always valid integers?
   **A:** Yes, they can be assumed to be valid integers.

3. **Q:** Do you return the minimum cost if the start position is the same as the home position?
   **A:** Yes, if `startPos` is equal to `homePos`, the minimum cost should be 0.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can calculate the horizontal and vertical distances separately and multiply them by the corresponding movement costs to get the total cost:

1. **Horizontal Movement**:
    - If moving left is needed (when `homePos[0] < startPos[0]`), add the cost of moving left multiplied by the distance.
    - If moving right is needed (when `homePos[0] > startPos[0]`), add the cost of moving right multiplied by the distance.

2. **Vertical Movement**:
    - If moving up is needed (when `homePos[1] < startPos[1]`), add the cost of moving up multiplied by the distance.
    - If moving down is needed (when `homePos[1] > startPos[1]`), add the cost of moving down multiplied by the distance.

## Code
Here's a sample implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int minCostHomecoming(vector<int>& startPos, vector<int>& homePos, vector<int>& costX, vector<int>& costY) {
    int cost = 0;

    // Calculate the horizontal movement cost
    if (homePos[0] < startPos[0]) {
        cost += (startPos[0] - homePos[0]) * costX[0]; // moving left
    } else if (homePos[0] > startPos[0]) {
        cost += (homePos[0] - startPos[0]) * costX[1]; // moving right
    }

    // Calculate the vertical movement cost
    if (homePos[1] < startPos[1]) {
        cost += (startPos[1] - homePos[1]) * costY[0]; // moving up
    } else if (homePos[1] > startPos[1]) {
        cost += (homePos[1] - startPos[1]) * costY[1]; // moving down
    }

    return cost;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because the computation only involves basic arithmetic operations and does not depend on the size of the input. The space complexity is also `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of additional space.
