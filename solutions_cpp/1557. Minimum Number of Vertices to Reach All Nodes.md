[Leetcode 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1557)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph can be reached. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we move on to the coding part, let's clarify a few points to understand the problem better.

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - `n` (number of nodes) where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
   - `edges` should have a length `m` where `0 <= m <= 10^5`.
   
2. **Output**:
   - The smallest set of vertices from which all nodes can be reached.

With these points in mind, let's derive the strategy.

### Strategy

In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a node that has no incoming edges should be included in the smallest set of vertices. These nodes are necessary because there is no other way to reach them from other nodes.

To solve the problem, the steps are:

1. **Initialize** an array `in_degree` of size `n` with all values set to `0`.
2. **Traverse the edges** and update the `in_degree` array such that `in_degree[toi]` is incremented by 1.
3. **Collect the nodes** which have `in_degree` equal to `0`. These nodes have no incoming edges.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    vector<int> in_degree(n, 0);
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        in_degree[edge[1]]++;
    }
    
    vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the in-degree array**: We traverse each edge once which takes O(m) time, where m is the number of edges.
- **Collecting the result nodes**: We traverse the `in_degree` array which takes O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n + m)**, making the algorithm efficient given the input constraints.
