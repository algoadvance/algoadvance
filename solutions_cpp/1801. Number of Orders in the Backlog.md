[Leetcode 1801. Number of Orders in the Backlog](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1801)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [price_i, amount_i, orderType_i]` denotes that `price_i` is the price of `amount_i` units for an order of type `orderType_i`.

- `orderType_i` can be either:
  - `0` meaning a **buy** order, or
  - `1` meaning a **sell** order.

There is an order backlog that consists of orders that have not been fully processed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:

- If the order is a buy order, you look at all sell orders in the backlog. If the order's price is greater than or equal to the lowest priced sell order, they will match and you will proceed with the transaction:
  - The amounts of units unmatched in the sell order, if any, remain in the backlog.
  - If the buy order amount is greater, the remaining units of the buy order remain in the backlog.
- If the order is a sell order, you look at all buy orders in the backlog. If the order's price is less than or equal to the highest priced buy order, they will match and you will proceed with the transaction:
  - The amounts of units unmatched in the buy order, if any, remain in the backlog.
  - If the sell order amount is greater, the remaining units of the sell order remain in the backlog.

Return the total number of units in the backlog after processing all the orders. Since the number of units could be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Confirm Input Range and Constraints**:
    - Is it guaranteed that `price_i`, `amount_i`, and `orderType_i` are always non-negative integers?
    - What is the maximum length of the `orders` array?
    - Can we assume the prices are always within a realistic trading range (e.g., non-negative and not too large)?

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
    - Use a priority queue (min-heap) for sell orders to easily get the lowest-priced sell order.
    - Use a priority queue (max-heap) for buy orders to easily get the highest-priced buy order.

2. **Processing Logic**:
    - For each buy order, match it with the minimum sell order until no more matches can be made.
    - For each sell order, match it with the maximum buy order until no more matches can be made.
    - Adjust the orders' amounts accordingly and manage the backlogs.

3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
    - Use heaps to keep insertion and extraction operations efficient.
    - Avoid excess complexity by ensuring only matching orders are processed in loops.

### Code

Here's the complete implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int getNumberOfBacklogOrders(vector<vector<int>>& orders) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        // Min-heap for sell orders (price, amount)
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> sellOrders;

        // Max-heap for buy orders (price, amount)
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> buyOrders;

        for (auto& order : orders) {
            int price = order[0];
            int amount = order[1];
            int type = order[2];

            if (type == 0) { // Buy Order
                while (amount > 0 && !sellOrders.empty() && sellOrders.top().first <= price) {
                    auto [sellPrice, sellAmount] = sellOrders.top();
                    sellOrders.pop();
                    int matchAmount = min(amount, sellAmount);
                    amount -= matchAmount;
                    sellAmount -= matchAmount;
                    if (sellAmount > 0) {
                        sellOrders.push({sellPrice, sellAmount});
                    }
                }
                if (amount > 0) {
                    buyOrders.push({price, amount});
                }
            } else { // Sell Order
                while (amount > 0 && !buyOrders.empty() && buyOrders.top().first >= price) {
                    auto [buyPrice, buyAmount] = buyOrders.top();
                    buyOrders.pop();
                    int matchAmount = min(amount, buyAmount);
                    amount -= matchAmount;
                    buyAmount -= matchAmount;
                    if (buyAmount > 0) {
                        buyOrders.push({buyPrice, buyAmount});
                    }
                }
                if (amount > 0) {
                    sellOrders.push({price, amount});
                }
            }
        }

        long backlog_units = 0;
        while (!buyOrders.empty()) {
            backlog_units = (backlog_units + buyOrders.top().second) % MOD;
            buyOrders.pop();
        }

        while (!sellOrders.empty()) {
            backlog_units = (backlog_units + sellOrders.top().second) % MOD;
            sellOrders.pop();
        }

        return backlog_units;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Order Processing**: Each order can potentially be processed `O(log N)` times, where `N` is the number of current orders in the backlog, due to priority queue operations (insertion/extraction).
- **Overall Complexity**: Each of the `M` orders (where `M` is the size of `orders`) undergoes operations that are logarithmic in the size of current orders, making the time complexity `O(M log N)`.

This provides an efficient solution for managing and processing the order backlog.
