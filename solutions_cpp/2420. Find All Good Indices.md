[Leetcode 2420. Find All Good Indices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2420)
## Problem Statement
The problem is titled "2420. Find All Good Indices". Given an array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`, we need to find all the good indices. An index `i` is considered a "good index" if the subarray `nums[i-k:i]` is non-increasing, and the subarray `nums[i+1:i+k+1]` is non-decreasing, provided such subarrays exist.

- An array is non-increasing if `arr[j] >= arr[j+1]` for all valid `j`.
- An array is non-decreasing if `arr[j] <= arr[j+1]` for all valid `j`.

Return a list of all such indices `i`. The solution should have a linear time complexity.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Values**: What are the constraints on the length of `nums` and the value of `k`?
    - Let's assume `1 <= k <= n` and `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
2. **Edge Cases**: Do we need to handle the cases where the array size or `k` is too small to have a valid index?
    - Yes, if `k` is greater than `n`, then it's not possible to have any good indices.
3. **Input Values**: Are the values in `nums` integers? Are they within a certain range?
    - Assume `nums` contains integers, and they can be either positive or negative.

## Strategy
1. **Prefix Arrays for Non-increasing/Non-decreasing Subarrays**:
    - We will use two auxiliary arrays, `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing`. 
    - `non_increasing[i]` will tell us the length of the longest non-increasing subarray ending at index `i`.
    - `non_decreasing[i]` will tell us the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray starting at index `i`.

2. **Fill Auxiliary Arrays**:
    - For `non_increasing`, traverse from left to right.
    - For `non_decreasing`, traverse from right to left.

3. **Identify Good Indices**:
    - An index `i` will be good if `non_increasing[i-1]` is at least `k` and `non_decreasing[i+1]` is at least `k`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> goodIndices(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> result;
    
    // Edge case when k is too large to have valid indices
    if (n < 2*k + 1) {
        return result;
    }
    
    vector<int> non_increasing(n, 1);
    vector<int> non_decreasing(n, 1);

    // Fill the non_increasing array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
            non_increasing[i] = non_increasing[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Fill the non_decreasing array
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]) {
            non_decreasing[i] = non_decreasing[i + 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Find all good indices
    for (int i = k; i < n - k; ++i) {
        if (non_increasing[i - 1] >= k && non_decreasing[i + 1] >= k) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing the Auxiliary Arrays**: Both `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing` arrays are filled in O(n) time.
- **Finding Good Indices**: This also takes O(n) time by iterating through the array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

## Summary
This approach correctly identifies good indices by leveraging auxiliary arrays to store the lengths of non-increasing and non-decreasing subarrays. The solution is both time-efficient and adheres to the constraints provided.
