[Leetcode 2862. Maximum Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2862)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

A subset of indices is considered complete if every integer between the minimum and maximum index of this subset is also in this subset.

You need to find the maximum sum of elements in `nums` for any complete subset of indices that has size exactly `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the range of the length of `nums`?
   - What is the value range for the integers in `nums` and the value of `k`?

2. **Edge cases**:
   - What should the function return if no complete subset of size `k` can be formed (e.g., if `k` > length of `nums`)?
   - Are there any constraints regarding the order of elements in `nums`?

Based on a typical Leetcode problem, let's assume:
- The length of `nums` will be between 1 and 100,000.
- Elements in `nums` are positive integers up to 1,000,000.
- `k` will be a positive integer not greater than the length of `nums`.

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem is using the sliding window technique:

1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - We want to find the maximum sum of any subarray (complete subset of indices) of size exactly `k`.
   - We can use a sliding window of size `k` to traverse the array while maintaining the sum of the current window.
   - For each position of the window, update the maximum sum if the current window sum is greater than the previous maximum.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the proposed strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for std::max

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumSumOfCompleteSubset(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Edge case: k should not be greater than the length of the array
        if (k > n) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int maxSum = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        
        // Initialize the first window sum
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            currentSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        maxSum = currentSum;
        
        // Slide the window across the array
        for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
            currentSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            maxSum = std::max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The sliding window approach ensures that each element is added and subtracted from the sum exactly once:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as only a few variables are used for computation regardless of the size of `nums`.

This solution is efficient and suitable for the problem's constraints.
