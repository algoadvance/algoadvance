[Leetcode 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1252)
## Problem Statement

You are given `m` x `n` matrix `indices`, where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates a row number `ri` and a column number `ci`. Each time you are given a row and column, you increment all elements in the row `ri` and column `ci` by 1. Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying all the increments to the matrix.

### Example
```
Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
After applying the second increment it becomes [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `m` or `n` be zero?
2. What is the size range of `indices`?
3. Can the entries in `indices` be out of bounds with respect to `m` and `n`?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create an `m` x `n` matrix initialized to zero.
2. **Apply Increments**: For each pair `[ri, ci]` in indices, increment all elements in row `ri` and column `ci`.
3. **Count Odd Values**: Iterate through the matrix to count the number of cells with odd values.
4. **Optimized Approach**: Instead of maintaining and updating a full m x n matrix, use arrays to track the number of increment operations for each row and each column, reducing the complexity.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int oddCells(int m, int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& indices) {
        // Arrays to track the number of increments for each row and column
        std::vector<int> row_increments(m, 0);
        std::vector<int> col_increments(n, 0);
        
        // Apply increments as specified by indices
        for (const auto& index : indices) {
            int ri = index[0];
            int ci = index[1];
            row_increments[ri]++;
            col_increments[ci]++;
        }

        // Count the number of odd-value cells
        int odd_count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                // The value at cell (i, j) is the sum of row and column increments
                if ((row_increments[i] + col_increments[j]) % 2 != 0) {
                    odd_count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return odd_count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity Analysis:**

- Initializing row and column increment vectors: O(m + n).
- Iterating through the `indices` list to update row and column increments: O(k), where `k` is the length of `indices`.
- Counting the odd values by iterating through the matrix: O(m * n).

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(m * n + k), but since k is expected to be much smaller compared to m*n, the primary complexity is O(m * n).
