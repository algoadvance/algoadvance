[Leetcode 2697. Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2697)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of only lowercase English letters, convert it into a palindrome by changing some (possibly zero) characters such that the resulting palindrome is lexicographically smallest among all possible palindromes you can obtain in this way.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
        - Assume that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
    - Can `s` be an empty string?
        - No, it will have a length of at least 1.

2. **Output Requirements:**
    - Should the output also be a string of lowercase English letters?
        - Yes.
    - What if the input string is already a palindrome? Should we still apply any changes?
        - If itâ€™s already the smallest lexicographical palindrome, no changes are required.

### Strategy
1. **Palindrome Property**:
    - A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. For `s` to be a palindrome, `s[i]` must equal `s[n-1-i]`.
  
2. **Lexicographically Smallest**:
    - To ensure the palindrome is lexicographically smallest, whenever matching characters from each end (i.e., `s[i]` and `s[n-1-i]`), change them to the smallest possible character if they do not match.

3. **Two-Pointer Approach**:
    - Initialize two pointers: `left` at 0 and `right` at `n-1`.
    - Traverse towards the center:
        - If `s[left]` != `s[right]`, set both to the minimum of the two.
        - Choose the minimum character for both `s[left]` and `s[right]`.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to accomplish the task:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string makeSmallestPalindrome(std::string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) {
            char minChar = std::min(s[left], s[right]);
            s[left] = s[right] = minChar;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return s;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "egcfe"; // Example input
    std::string result = makeSmallestPalindrome(s);
    std::cout << "Lexicographically smallest palindrome: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We iterate through the string with two pointers, each making at most `n/2` steps. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the string.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
    - **O(1)**: We modify the string in place, so no additional space proportional to the input size is needed apart from a few variables.
