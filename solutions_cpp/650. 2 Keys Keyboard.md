[Leetcode 650. 2 Keys Keyboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l650)

## Problem Statement

You have a text editor with only two operations:

1. "Copy All": You can copy all the text present on the screen (copy operation does not delete the text that's already on the screen).
2. "Paste": You can paste the text which was last copied.

Initially, you have only one character 'A' on the screen. You need to get exactly `n` 'A's on the screen by performing the minimum number of operations.

Write a function `minSteps` that takes an integer `n` and returns the minimum number of operations to get `n` 'A's on the screen.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem constraints usually ensure that `n` is a positive integer. For this problem, `1 <= n <= 1000`.

2. **Is there any initial number of operations or state?**
   - The only character initially on the screen is one 'A'.

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) or prime factorization technique to minimize the operations.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

1. **Define DP array:** 
   - Create a DP array `dp` of size `n+1`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to get exactly `i` 'A's.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `dp[1] = 0`, since we already have one 'A' on the screen.

3. **Transition:**
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, determine the minimum operations by checking for all possible j (1 <= j < i) such that `i` is divisible by `j`. This means we can generate `i` from `j` by copying `j` and pasting `(i/j)-1` times.

4. **Formula:** 
   - `dp[i] = dp[j] + (i/j)` for every `j` that divides `i`.

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2) in the worst case due to nested loops.

## Code

Here's how the solution can be implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = i; // Initialize with maximum operations possibly required.
            for (int j = 1; j <= i / 2; ++j) {
                if (i % j == 0) {
                    dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[j] + i / j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**
1. Initialize a DP array `dp` with `n+1` elements, all set to 0.
2. Iterate from `2` to `n`.
3. For each `i`, initialize `dp[i]` with `i` assuming the worst case (only pasting each step).
4. For each `i`, check all possible `j` from 1 to `i/2` to see if `i` is divisible by `j`.
5. Update `dp[i]` with the minimum value found by performing the necessary operations.

This solution efficiently determines the minimum steps required to achieve exactly `n` 'A's on the screen.
