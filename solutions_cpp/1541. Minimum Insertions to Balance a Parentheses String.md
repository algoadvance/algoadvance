[Leetcode 1541. Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1541)
### Problem Statement
Given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `'('` and `')'`. A parentheses string is balanced if:

- It is the empty string, or
- It can be written as `AB` (A concatenated with B), where `A` and `B` are balanced strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a balanced string.

You are asked to insert the minimum number of parentheses (either `'('` or `')'`, and in any positions) so that the resulting parentheses string is balanced.

Return the minimum number of insertions needed to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - The length of `s` will be between 1 and 10^5.
2. Is the string allowed to contain any characters other than `'('` and `')'`?
   - No, the string will only contain `'('` and `')'`.

### Strategy
1. **Track Unbalanced Parentheses**: We'll use a counter to track how many closing parentheses `)` are needed to balance the string.
2. **Handle Each Character**:
   - If the character is `'('`, we will expect two `)` characters to balance it (since each `'('` needs to be closed by two `))`).
   - If the character is `')'`, decrement the counter for expected `)` characters. If another `)` is needed and not found, we'll consider it an unbalanced closing parenthesis.
3. **Manage Counters**:
   - If we encounter more `)` than expected after a `'('`, track these as needing one more `)`.
   - If we run out of the ')' needed for a pair, insert an extra '('.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>

int minInsertions(std::string s) {
    int needRight = 0;   // To track needed closing parentheses
    int insertions = 0;  // Number of insertions

    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '(') {
            needRight += 2;  // Each '(' requires two ')'
            if (needRight % 2 != 0) {
                // If needRight is odd after adding 2, it means there was an unconsumed ')'
                insertions++;
                needRight--;  // One ')' is now considered consumed
            }
        } else {
            needRight--;  // Each ')' decreases the need for right parentheses
            if (needRight == -1) {
                // If we're in deficit, it means we have a lone ')'
                insertions++;
                needRight = 1;  // Balance with one '(' and expect one more ')'
            }
        }
    }
    return insertions + needRight;  // Add any remaining ')' that are needed
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Counting Logic**: `needRight` keeps track of how many closing parentheses `)` are required. For every opening parenthesis `(`, we need two closing parentheses `))`. When we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`, we decrement the `needRight` counter.
2. **Odd `needRight` Adjustments**: If after an addition, `needRight` is odd, we increment `insertions` and adjust `needRight` because a `(` implies an expectation of two `)` to balance.
3. **Deficit Handling**: If `needRight` goes negative, it indicates that we have more `)` than expected. We adjust by adding an extra `(` and resetting the balance need.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We traverse the string once, resulting in linear processing, making it efficient for the provided constraints.
