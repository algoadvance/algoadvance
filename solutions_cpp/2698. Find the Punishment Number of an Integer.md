[Leetcode 2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2698)
## Problem Statement

For a given integer `n`, you are to compute its "punishment number". The punishment number is defined by the following steps:
1. For each number i from 1 to n (inclusive), if `i` can be expressed as the sum of non-decreasing positive integers whose total is equal to the square of `i`, then add the square of `i` to a running total.
2. The final running total will be the punishment number of `n`.

In simpler terms, you will iterate through each integer up to `n`, and check if the square of that integer can be split into parts that sum back to the integer itself. If it can be split in such a manner, you add the square of the integer to the punishment number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Sum decomposition definition**: Should the sum decomposition parts be non-decreasing and positive integers?
   - Yes.

2. **Example for better understanding**: Can you provide an example?
   - For `n = 10`, we need to check if 1^2, 2^2, ..., 10^2 can be written as the sum of non-decreasing positive integers that form the number itself. If true, add the square to the punishment number.

3. **Bounds of `n`**: Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 100`.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we will:

1. **Iterate** through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.
2. **Square** the number `i`.
3. **Check** if the square of `i` can be split into non-decreasing positive integers that sum back to `i`.
4. If the condition is met, **accumulate** the square of `i` to the punishment number.
5. **Return** the punishment number after the iteration.

To check if the square of `i` can be expressed as required:

- Define a recursive function that subtracts progressively smaller possible digits and checks if the remaining sum can still be partitioned appropriately.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool canBePartitioned(int num, std::string str) {
    if (num == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    for (size_t i = 1; i <= str.length(); ++i) {
        int part = std::stoi(str.substr(0, i));
        if (part > num) break;
        if (canBePartitioned(num - part, str.substr(i))) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

int punishmentNumber(int n) {
    int punishmentNumber = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        int square = i * i;
        if (canBePartitioned(i, std::to_string(square))) {
            punishmentNumber += square;
        }
    }
    return punishmentNumber;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example input
    std::cout << "Punishment Number: " << punishmentNumber(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The main loop runs `n` times.
- `canBePartitioned` in the worst case can explore all prefixes of the string representation of `square`:
  - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, we explore sums of digits up to log(S(i)) where S(i) is the number of digits in `square`.
  - Given the limiting factor of its recursive nature, checking each digit incurs O(d) operations where d is the number of digits.

Thus, the overall complexity can be considered approximately **O(n * d)** where `d` is the number of digits in the largest square number `n^2`.

For `n = 100`, this approach will be efficient enough under typical constraints.
