[Leetcode 2161. Partition Array According to Given Pivot](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2161)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. Rearrange the elements of `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:
- All elements less than `pivot` appear before all elements greater than `pivot`.
- All elements equal to `pivot` appear in between the elements less than and greater than `pivot`.
- The relative order of the elements less than `pivot`, the elements equal to `pivot`, and the elements greater than `pivot` should remain the same.

Return the rearranged array.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the array contains at least one element?**
   - Yes, you can assume the array contains at least one element.

2. **Can there be negative numbers in the array?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

3. **Do we need to return a new array or modify the existing one?**
   - We need to return a new array with elements rearranged according to the given rules.

4. **Is maintaining the relative order of subarrays important?**
   - Yes, the relative order of the elements less than pivot, equal to pivot, and greater than pivot should remain the same.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using a simple approach. Create three separate lists to collect:
- Elements less than the pivot.
- Elements equal to the pivot.
- Elements greater than the pivot.

Finally, merge these lists to form the rearranged array.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize three vectors: `less_than`, `equal`, and `greater_than`.
2. Traverse through the original array and append each element to one of the three vectors based on its comparison with the pivot.
3. Concatenate the three vectors to form the final rearranged array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> pivotArray(vector<int>& nums, int pivot) {
    vector<int> less_than, equal, greater_than;
    
    // Partition the elements into three different lists
    for(int num : nums) {
        if(num < pivot) {
            less_than.push_back(num);
        } else if(num == pivot) {
            equal.push_back(num);
        } else {
            greater_than.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Concatenate the results
    vector<int> result;
    result.reserve(nums.size()); // Reserve enough space
    result.insert(result.end(), less_than.begin(), less_than.end());
    result.insert(result.end(), equal.begin(), equal.end());
    result.insert(result.end(), greater_than.begin(), greater_than.end());
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. We traverse the array once to partition the elements and then concatenate the lists.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the elements in the three separate lists and the final result array.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, maintaining the relative order of the elements as required.
