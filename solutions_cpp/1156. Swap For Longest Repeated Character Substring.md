[Leetcode 1156. Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1156)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `text`, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in `text`. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length of the input string `text`?
    - Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should the output be just the length of the longest substring or also the substring itself?

### Assumptions
1. The input string will have a length of at most 10^5.
2. The input string is non-empty.
3. The output is the length of the longest possible repeated-character substring we can obtain by making at most one swap of any two characters in `text`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to determine the longest contiguous substring of repeated characters after making at most one character swap. We'll use the following approach:

1. Identify all segments of contiguous repeated characters and store their lengths.
2. Use a hashmap to keep track of the total frequency of each character in the string.
3. Analyze for each segment if a swap can improve the length of a segment:
   - Look at adjacent segments with the same characters and see if combining them with a single swap increases the substring length.
   - Consider the possibility of making the segment longer by including characters from other parts of the string.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxRepOpt1(string text) {
    // Step 1: Calculate the total frequency of each character in the text
    unordered_map<char, int> char_freq;
    for (char c : text) {
        char_freq[c]++;
    }

    // Step 2: Find segments of consecutive same characters
    vector<pair<char, int>> segments;
    int n = text.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n;) {
        char current_char = text[i];
        int length = 0;
        while (i < n && text[i] == current_char) {
            length++;
            i++;
        }
        segments.push_back({current_char, length});
    }

    // Step 3: Analyze segments to find the maximum possible length after one swap
    int max_length = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < segments.size(); ++i) {
        char current_char = segments[i].first;
        int current_length = segments[i].second;
        
        // Option 1: Without combining with adjacent segments
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length + (char_freq[current_char] > current_length ? 1 : 0));
        
        // Option 2: Combining with adjacent segments if applicable
        if (i > 0 && i < segments.size() - 1 && segments[i - 1].first == current_char && segments[i + 1].first == current_char && segments[i].second == 1) {
            int combined_length = segments[i - 1].second + segments[i + 1].second;
            max_length = max(max_length, combined_length + (char_freq[current_char] > combined_length ? 1 : 0));
        } else {
            // Edge of the string or non-combinable segments
            if (i > 0 && segments[i - 1].first == current_char) {
                int combined_length = segments[i - 1].second + current_length;
                max_length = max(max_length, combined_length + (char_freq[current_char] > combined_length ? 1 : 0));
            }
            if (i < segments.size() - 1 && segments[i + 1].first == current_char) {
                int combined_length = current_length + segments[i + 1].second;
                max_length = max(max_length, combined_length + (char_freq[current_char] > combined_length ? 1 : 0));
            }
        }
    }

    return max_length;
}

int main() {
    string text = "ababa";
    int result = maxRepOpt1(text);
    cout << "The length of the longest repeated character substring after one swap is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n)
  - Building the character frequency hashmap takes O(n).
  - Identifying segments also takes O(n).
  - Analyzing segments to find the maximum length also takes O(n).

This makes our solution efficient and scalable to large input sizes as allowed by the problem constraints.
