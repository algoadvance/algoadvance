[Leetcode 1569. Number of Ways to Reorder Array to Get Same BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1569)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` that represents the preorder traversal of a binary search tree (BST), return the number of ways to reorder the array to get the same BST. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2,1,3]`
Output: `1`
Explanation: There is only one way to reorder `nums` to get the same BST: `[2,1,3]`.

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`
Output: `5`
Explanation: There are 5 ways to reorder `nums` to get the same BST: `[3,1,2,4,5]`, `[3,1,4,2,5]`, `[3,1,4,5,2]`, `[3,4,1,2,5]`, and `[3,4,1,5,2]`.

### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`
Output: `0`
Explanation: There are no other ways to reorder `nums` to get the same BST.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** What is the size range of the input array `nums`?
   - The number of nodes in the given array will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
   
2. **Element Range:** Are the elements in `nums` unique?
   - Yes, all the elements in `nums` are unique.

3. **Modulo Requirement:** Should every intermediate result consider the modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - Yes, to prevent overflow, every intermediate result should be taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **Binary Search Tree Properties:** The structure of a BST does not change based on the order of insertion as long as the relative positions of the elements with respect to the root element remain the same.
2. **Divide and Conquer:** Use a recursive function to simulate the process of constructing the BST. For each subtree, count the number of ways we can order its left and right subtrees independently, and then multiply these counts.
3. **Combinatorial Count:** For each node, we can choose positions for the left and right subtrees using combinations (binomial coefficients). For example, if we have to choose `k` elements out of `n`, the number of ways to choose these positions is given by `C(n, k)`.
4. **Precomputations:** We need to precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently compute combinations.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

long long modInverse(long long x, long long p) {
    long long result = 1;
    while (p > 0) {
        if (p % 2 == 1) {
            result = result * x % MOD;
        }
        x = x * x % MOD;
        p /= 2;
    }
    return result;
}

vector<long long> factorial;
vector<long long> inverseFactorial;

void initializeFactorials(int n) {
    factorial.resize(n + 1);
    inverseFactorial.resize(n + 1);
    factorial[0] = factorial[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD;
    }
    inverseFactorial[n] = modInverse(factorial[n], MOD - 2);
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        inverseFactorial[i] = inverseFactorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD;
    }
}

long long comb(int n, int k) {
    if (n < k) return 0;
    return factorial[n] * inverseFactorial[k] % MOD * inverseFactorial[n - k] % MOD;
}

long long countWays(vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.size() <= 2) {
        return 1;
    }

    int root = nums[0];
    vector<int> left, right;

    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] < root) {
            left.push_back(nums[i]);
        } else {
            right.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
    }

    long long leftWays = countWays(left);
    long long rightWays = countWays(right);
    
    long long totalWays = comb(left.size() + right.size(), left.size());

    return leftWays * rightWays % MOD * totalWays % MOD;
}

int numOfWays(vector<int>& nums) {
    initializeFactorials(nums.size());
    return (countWays(nums) - 1 + MOD) % MOD;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Precomputations:** O(n) for factorials and their inverses, where `n` is the size of the input array.
- **Recursive Counting:** Each recursive call divides the problem into smaller subproblems, akin to the QuickSort algorithm. The average case is O(n log n), but the worst case is O(n^2) if the tree is unbalanced.
- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by O(n log n) in the average case.
