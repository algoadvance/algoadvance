[Leetcode 100. Same Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l100)
## Problem Statement
Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not. Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

### Example:

#### Input:
```
    Tree 1:     1         Tree 2:     1
               / \                  / \
              2   3                2   3
```
#### Output: true

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if both trees are empty?**
   - Return `true` because two empty trees are considered the same.
2. **What does the function need to return if only one of the trees is empty?**
   - Return `false` because an empty tree cannot be structurally identical to a non-empty tree.
3. **Can the nodes have negative values?**
   - Yes, nodes can have any integer value.
4. **Is there a constraint on the tree's height or number of nodes within the tree?**
   - The problem statement does not specify any constraints, so general solutions should handle typical binary trees.

## Strategy
1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - If both trees are empty, return true.
   - If one of the trees is empty and the other is not, return false.
   - Recursively compare the root values of both trees.
   - Recursively compare the left subtrees.
   - Recursively compare the right subtrees.
   
   If all these conditions are met, the trees are the same.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        // If both trees are null, they are same
        if (!p && !q) return true;
        // If one of them is null, they are not same
        if (!p || !q) return false;
        // If values of current nodes are different, they are not same
        if (p->val != q->val) return false;
        // Recursively check left and right subtrees
        return isSameTree(p->left, q->left) && isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once.

**Space Complexity:** O(h), where `h` is the height of the trees. This is the maximum depth of the recursion stack.

The provided solution correctly determines if two binary trees are the same by using a recursive function. Each step involves checking the node values and recursively checking the left and right subtrees for equality.
