[Leetcode 2598. Smallest Missing Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2598)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `value`, you need to perform the following operations until you cannot:

1. Select an element `num` in the array.
2. Subtract the `num` from `value` if `num` is less than or equal to the `value`.
3. Otherwise, subtract the `value`.

Your task is to find the smallest non-negative integer that cannot be represented as the sum of elements of the array after any number of these operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain negative numbers or zeros?
2. Is there any constraint on the size of the array or the values within?
3. Can `value` be zero or negative?

Assuming:
- The array can contain zero or negative numbers.
- The size of the array is up to `10^5` and the values within are within the range of 32-bit signed integers.
- `value` is a positive integer.

### Strategy

- The goal is to find the smallest non-negative integer that cannot be expressed using a combination of the array's elements and multiples of `value`.
- This problem resembles a variant of the smallest missing positive solution, adjusted for modulo constraints.

Steps:
1. Reduce all elements in the array modulo `value` as `nums[i] % value`.
2. Use a frequency array to count occurrences of each possible residue modulo `value`.
3. Iterate from `0` to `value-1` to identify the first missing non-negative integer `x` that cannot be formed. If all residues are present within bounds, then `value` itself is missing.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int findSmallestMissing(std::vector<int>& nums, int value) {
    std::vector<int> modVals(value, 0);

    // Reduce elements by modulo and count frequencies
    for (int num : nums) {
        int modVal = (num % value + value) % value; // Handling negative numbers
        modVals[modVal]++;
    }

    // Find the smallest missing integer
    for (int i = 0; i < value; ++i) {
        if (modVals[i] == 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    // If all residues from 0 to value-1 are present, return the next possible value
    return value;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 5, 3};
    int value = 4;
    std::cout << "Smallest Missing Non-negative Integer: " << findSmallestMissing(nums, value) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity:** O(value) for the `modVals` array.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) for traversing `nums` once and populating the `modVals` array, followed by an O(value) check, making the total complexity O(n + value). 

This should be efficient given the constraints typically expected in interview and practical scenarios.
