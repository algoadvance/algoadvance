[Leetcode 2208. Minimum Operations to Halve Array Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2208)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose any number `x` from `nums` and replace it with `x / 2`. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce the sum of the array by at least half its original sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` contain any negative or zero elements?**
   - No, the problem states it contains only positive integers.

2. **What if all elements are equal?**
   - The solution approach remains the same; just follow the process of replacing the largest number in each step until the required condition is met.

3. **Is the array size constrained?**
   - The typical constraints will be provided on the platform. Assume a reasonable size constraint for typical LeetCode problems (e.g., 1 ≤ `nums.length` ≤ `10^5`).

### Strategy

The primary approach to solve this problem efficiently is to use a max-heap (priority queue) to always reduce the maximum element, which has the most significant impact on reducing the total sum. Here’s the step-by-step strategy:

1. Calculate the sum of the original array.
2. Initialize a max-heap with negative values from the array to simulate a max-heap using `std::priority_queue`.
3. Continually halve the largest element (root of the heap), update the running sum, and track the number of operations.
4. Stop the process once the running sum is reduced to half or less of the original sum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <numeric>

int minOperationsToHalveArraySum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    double targetSum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0.0) / 2.0;
    double currentSum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0.0);
    
    std::priority_queue<double> maxHeap;
    for (int num : nums) {
        maxHeap.push(static_cast<double>(num));
    }
    
    int operations = 0;
    while (currentSum > targetSum) {
        double largest = maxHeap.top();
        maxHeap.pop();
        currentSum -= largest / 2.0;  // Reduce the total sum by half of the largest element
        maxHeap.push(largest / 2.0);  // Push the halved element back to the heap
        operations++;
    }
    
    return operations;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {5, 19, 8, 1};
    std::cout << "Minimum operations to halve array sum: " << minOperationsToHalveArraySum(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Construction:** \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Halving Operations:** Each pop and push operation in the heap takes \(O(\log n)\). In the worst case, we may need to perform the operations for each element multiple times, but empirically the number of operations should be much less.

Thus, the overall time complexity is roughly \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for typical input sizes in the context of competitive programming and interviews.
