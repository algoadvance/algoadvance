[Leetcode 2800. Shortest String That Contains Three Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2800)
## Problem Statement

You are given three strings: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Your task is to find the shortest string that contains all the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as subsequences. If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Subsequence Definition**: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
2. **String Constraints**: What are the constraints on the lengths of strings `a`, `b`, and `c`?
3. **Input Examples**: Can you provide specific examples and their corresponding outputs?
4. **Output Characteristics**: Should the output be only one shortest string or can it be multiple?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the idea is to consider all possible concatenations of the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` in different orders while ensuring that each combination contains the other two as subsequences. The steps are as follows:

1. Consider all permutations of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. For each permutation, concatenate the three strings.
3. Check if the resulting string contains all three strings as subsequences.
4. Among all valid permutations, choose the one with the shortest length.
5. If there's a tie in length, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to check if `sub` is a subsequence of `str`
bool isSubsequence(const std::string &sub, const std::string &str) {
    int m = sub.size(), n = str.size();
    int j = 0; // For index of sub
    // Traverse str and sub
    for (int i = 0; i < n && j < m; ++i) {
        if (sub[j] == str[i]) {
            ++j;
        }
    }
    // If all characters of sub were found in str as a subsequence
    return (j == m);
}

// Function to find shortest string containing a, b, c as subsequences
std::string shortestStringContainingABC(std::string a, std::string b, std::string c) {
    std::vector<std::string> permutations = {a + b + c, a + c + b, b + a + c, 
                                             b + c + a, c + a + b, c + b + a};
    
    std::string shortest = permutations[0];
    for (const auto &perm : permutations) {
        if (isSubsequence(a, perm) && isSubsequence(b, perm) && isSubsequence(c, perm)) {
            if (perm.size() < shortest.size() || (perm.size() == shortest.size() && perm < shortest)) {
                shortest = perm;
            }
        }
    }
    return shortest;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::string a = "abc";
    std::string b = "ac";
    std::string c = "bc";  
    std::string result = shortestStringContainingABC(a, b, c);
    std::cout << "Shortest string: " << result << std::endl; // Output: "abc"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **isSubsequence Function**: Each call to this function takes \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of the string being checked.
- **Number of Permutations**: There are only 6 permutations of three strings.
- **Overall Complexity**: Given the limited number of permutations (6), and each call to isSubsequence being \(O(n)\), the overall time complexity is \(O(6n) = O(n)\), where \(n\) is the maximum length of the resulting string.

This approach should efficiently provide the correct and optimal shortest string containing all three given strings as subsequences.
