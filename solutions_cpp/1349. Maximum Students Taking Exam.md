[Leetcode 1349. Maximum Students Taking Exam](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1349)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` binary matrix `seats` representing a classroom where:
- `seats[i][j] = 0` represents an empty desk,
- `seats[i][j] = 1` represents a desk that is occupied,
Determine the maximum number of students that can take the exam without any two students cheating. Two students are considered to be cheating if they are:
1. Sitting next to each other in the same row.
2. Sitting diagonally adjacent in any direction (i.e., both `seats[i-1][j-1]` and `seats[i-1][j+1]`).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - What are the dimensions of the matrix? (m x n)
   - What is the maximum value for `m` and `n`?

2. **Output:**
   - What form should the output be? (e.g., integer representing the maximum number of students)

3. **Constraints:**
   - Can students be moved to any seat, or do they need to be placed sequentially based on the available seats?
   
4. **Edge cases:**
   - What if all desks are occupied (`1`) or all are empty (`0`)?

For example:
```
Input:
[[1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0]]
Output:
4
```

### Strategy

To maximize the number of students without violating the constraints, we can use Dynamic Programming. Each row can be considered independently to avoid direct conflicts, and we can track valid placements based on the previous rows' configurations.

#### Steps:
1. **Pre-process Rows:**
   - Generate all valid seating arrangements for each row based on the given constraints and the initial `seats` matrix.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of students that can take the exam up to row `i` with configuration `j`.

#### Detailed Approach:
1. Use bitmasks to represent seating configurations.
2. For each configuration in row `i`, check compatibility with row `i-1` and the current seat constraints.
3. Update the DP array to reflect the best possible placement.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <bitset>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxStudents(vector<vector<int>>& seats) {
        int m = seats.size();
        int n = seats[0].size();
        vector<int> valid_masks;
        
        // Identify valid masks for each row
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); ++i) {
            bool valid = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if ((i & (1 << j)) && !(seats[0][j])) { // Check if placing student in `j-th` seat of the first row
                    valid = false; 
                }
                if (j > 0 && (i & (1 << j)) && (i & (1 << (j - 1)))) { // No two students should sit next to each other in the same row
                    valid = false;
                }
            }
            if (valid) {
                valid_masks.push_back(i);
            }
        }

        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(1 << n, 0));

        // Fill DP array
        for (int r = 0; r < m; ++r) {
            for (int mask : valid_masks) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int b = 0; b < n; ++b) {
                    if (mask & (1 << b)) count++;
                }
                for (int prev_mask : valid_masks) {
                    bool valid = true;
                    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                        if ((mask & (1 << j)) && (
                            (j > 0 && (prev_mask & (1 << (j - 1)))) || 
                            (j < n - 1 && (prev_mask & (1 << (j + 1))))
                        )) {
                            valid = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (valid) {
                        dp[r + 1][mask] = max(dp[r + 1][mask], dp[r][prev_mask] + count);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return *max_element(dp[m].begin(), dp[m].end());
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> seats = {
        {1, 0, 0, 0},
        {0, 0, 1, 0},
        {1, 0, 0, 0}
    };
    
    Solution sol;
    cout << "Max students: " << sol.maxStudents(seats) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot 2^n \cdot 2^n)\)
  - Preprocessing valid configurations: \(2^n\)
  - DP recurrence: For each row \(m\), and each possible state \(2^n\), consider the transitions from all states in the previous row \(2^n\).
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot 2^n)\)
  - DP array size.

This solution uses exponential time and space relative to the number of columns, which can be practical for small values of `n` but may not scale well for large classroom sizes.
