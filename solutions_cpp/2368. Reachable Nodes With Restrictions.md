[Leetcode 2368. Reachable Nodes With Restrictions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2368)
### Problem Statement

You are given a connected undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges. The graph is represented as a list of edges where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. You are also given an array `restricted` which represents a list of restricted nodes. Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach starting from the node `0` without visiting any restricted node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - The number of nodes `n` is at most 100,000.
   - The `edges` array contains `n - 1` edges (indicating a tree structure).
   - The node values range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - All `restricted` nodes are guaranteed to be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **Output**:
   - Return an integer representing the maximum number of nodes that can be reached starting from node `0`.

3. **Other Assumptions**:
   - The node `0` is not restricted.
   - There are no duplicate edges, and the graph is connected (tree structure).

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: To explore all reachable nodes starting from node `0`.
3. **Restriction Check**: Ensure that while exploring, restricted nodes are not visited.
4. **BFS/DFS Details**:
   - Use a queue for BFS or a stack for DFS.
   - Use a set for quick lookup of restricted nodes and visited nodes.

### Code

Here is the C++ code achieving the solution using BFS:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int reachableNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& restricted) {
    // Create adjacency list
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    // Create a set for restricted nodes for quick lookup
    unordered_set<int> restrictedSet(restricted.begin(), restricted.end());
    unordered_set<int> visited;
    
    // BFS initialization
    int reachableCount = 0;
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);
    visited.insert(0);
    
    // BFS traversal
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        reachableCount++;
        
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (visited.count(neighbor) == 0 && restrictedSet.count(neighbor) == 0) {
                visited.insert(neighbor);
                q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return reachableCount;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {3, 4}};
    vector<int> restricted = {4};
    int n = 5;
    
    cout << "Reachable Nodes Count: " << reachableNodes(n, edges, restricted) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the graph**: `O(n)` because there are `n - 1` edges.
- **Traversing the graph (BFS/DFS)**: `O(n)` since each node and edge is visited once.
- **Set operations**: Inserting and looking up restricted/visited nodes takes approximately `O(1)` time.

Overall, the complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient given the constraints.
