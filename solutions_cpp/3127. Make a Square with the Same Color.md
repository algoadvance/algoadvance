[Leetcode 3127. Make a Square with the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3127)
### Problem Statement
You are given a matrix `grid` of size `n x n` filled with integers from 1 to 10 representing different colors. Your task is to determine the minimum number of recoloring operations needed to turn this `n x n` grid into an `n x n` grid where every element in the grid has the same color.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`? (`1 <= n <= 50`)
   - Can we assume the grid will always have at least one element?

2. **Output**:
   - Do we need to return the minimum number of operations, or should we also return the final grid? (Return only the minimum number of operations.)

3. **Operations**: 
   - Are we allowed to recolor any cell in one operation?

Given the constraints, let's proceed to outline the solution.

### Strategy
To determine the minimum recoloring operations:

1. **Count Colors**:
   - We'll count the frequency of each color in the grid.
   
2. **Identify Target Color**:
   - The optimal color to recolor the entire grid to will be the color that already has the highest frequency.

3. **Calculate Operations**:
   - Calculate the minimum number of operations needed to change all the cells in the grid to this most frequent color.
   
### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int minOperationsToOneColor(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    unordered_map<int, int> colorCount;
    int n = grid.size();
    
    // Count the frequency of each color in the grid
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            colorCount[grid[i][j]]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Find the color with the maximum frequency
    int maxColorFrequency = 0;
    for (const auto& entry : colorCount) {
        if (entry.second > maxColorFrequency) {
            maxColorFrequency = entry.second;
        }
    }
    
    // The minimum number of operations needed is to convert
    // all other cells to the color with the highest frequency.
    return n * n - maxColorFrequency;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {
        {1, 2, 1},
        {1, 3, 2},
        {3, 2, 1}
    };
    
    cout << "Minimum operations to make the grid one color: " 
         << minOperationsToOneColor(grid) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Counting the frequency of each color: O(n^2) since we traverse the entire `n x n` grid.
- Finding the color with the maximum frequency: O(1) because there are only at most 10 unique colors.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of recoloring operations required to make the grid uniform in color.
