[Leetcode 2520. Count the Digits That Divide a Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2520)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `num`. Count the number of digits in `num` that divide `num`.

A digit divides `num` if `num % digit == 0`.

Return the number of digits that divide `num`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `num`?**
   - It's mentioned that `num` is a positive integer. Let's assume it fits within the range of standard integer types in C++.

2. **What should be done if there is a digit '0' in `num`?**
   - Since '0' cannot divide any number, it should be skipped in the count.

3. **Is it guaranteed that `num` will be a non-zero positive integer?**
   - Yes, it's explicitly mentioned as a positive integer.

### Strategy

1. Convert the number `num` to its string representation to easily iterate over each digit.
2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of digits that divide `num`.
3. For each digit in the string:
   - Convert the character to its integer form.
   - Check if the digit is not zero and if `num` is divisible by this digit.
   - If true, increment the counter.
4. Return the counter's value after iterating through all digits.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int countDigitsThatDivide(int num) {
    std::string numStr = std::to_string(num);
    int count = 0;
    
    for (char c : numStr) {
        int digit = c - '0'; // Convert char to int
        if (digit != 0 && num % digit == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int num = 124; // Example input
    std::cout << "Number of digits in " << num << " that divide the number: " << countDigitsThatDivide(num) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in `num`. This is because we are performing a single pass through each digit in the number.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)** excluding the input and output because we only use a few extra variables regardless of the size of `num`.

This solution effectively handles the problem requirements and constraints as specified.
