[Leetcode 1888. Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1888)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you need to determine the minimum number of character flips required to make the string alternating. An alternating binary string is either of the form "010101..." or "101010...". The binary string is considered alternating if:
1. It does not contain two adjacent characters that are the same.
2. One possible form alternates starting with '0', and the other with '1'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
     - The problem usually specifies the maximum possible length in its constraints section.
   
   - Can the input string be empty?
     - Typically, edge cases are specified, but we should assume non-empty strings unless otherwise stated.

2. **Output type**:
   - The output should be a single integer value representing the minimum number of flips required.

Assuming edge cases should be handled within reason, let's proceed to the strategy.

## Strategy

1. **Understand Alternating Patterns**:
   - Generate two possible alternating patterns of the same length as `s`.
   - Pattern1: Starts with '0'. For example, if `s` is of length 6, `Pattern1` will be "010101".
   - Pattern2: Starts with '1'. Using the same example, `Pattern2` will be "101010".

2. **Flip Counting**:
   - Compare the input string `s` to both `Pattern1` and `Pattern2`:
     - Compute the number of flips required to convert `s` into `Pattern1`.
     - Compute the number of flips required to convert `s` into `Pattern2`.

3. **Result**:
   - The minimum of the two computed values will be the answer as it represents the least number of flips needed to make `s` alternating.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int minFlips(string s) {
    int flipsStartingWith0 = 0;
    int flipsStartingWith1 = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        // Pattern starting with '0'
        char expectedCharForFirstPattern = (i % 2 == 0) ? '0' : '1';
        if (s[i] != expectedCharForFirstPattern) {
            ++flipsStartingWith0;
        }
        
        // Pattern starting with '1'
        char expectedCharForSecondPattern = (i % 2 == 0) ? '1' : '0';
        if (s[i] != expectedCharForSecondPattern) {
            ++flipsStartingWith1;
        }
    }
    
    return min(flipsStartingWith0, flipsStartingWith1);
}

int main() {
    string s = "01001001101";
    cout << "Minimum flips required: " << minFlips(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we only need to iterate over the string once, performing constant time operations at each step.

## Space Complexity
- **O(1)**: Since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of flips needed to make the binary string alternating.
