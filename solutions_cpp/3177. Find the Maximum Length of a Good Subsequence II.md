[Leetcode 3177. Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3177)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. A subsequence of `nums` is called good if:

- The bitwise XOR of all the elements in the subsequence is a non-negative power of 2.

Return the maximum length of a good subsequence of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` contain repeated elements?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain repeated integers.
2. **Is it guaranteed that `nums` will contain at least one element?**
   - Yes, `nums` will contain at least one element as per typical constraints.
3. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?**
   - The problem might specify constraints (e.g., `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`). For this approach, I will assume reasonably small constraints unless specified.
4. **Is there an upper limit to the length of `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints would be provided, but I will assume a reasonably large size unless noted.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two numbers yields a power of 2 only if the XOR operation results in a number with exactly one bit set.
   
2. **Subsequence Formation**:
   - To maximize the length of a good subsequence, it will often make sense to include as many different bits as possible. Since XOR aggregates bits, we need a strategy to systematically explore subsequences.

3. **Dynamic Programming / Recursive Approach**:
   - We can utilize a backtracking approach to explore subsequences while maintaining the condition of XOR being a power of 2.

### Code

First, let's define a helper function to check if a number is a power of 2. Then implement a recursive function to explore all subsequences and track the maximum length meeting the condition.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Helper function to check if a number is a power of 2
bool isPowerOf2(int x) {
    return x > 0 && (x & (x - 1)) == 0;
}

// Recursive function to explore subsequences
void findMaxGoodSubsequence(const std::vector<int>& nums, int index, int currentXOR, int currentLength, int& maxLength) {
    // If currentXOR is a power of 2, check and update maxLength
    if (isPowerOf2(currentXOR)) {
        maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
    }
    
    // Explore further subsequences
    for (int i = index; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        findMaxGoodSubsequence(nums, i + 1, currentXOR ^ nums[i], currentLength + 1, maxLength);
    }
}

int maxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    findMaxGoodSubsequence(nums, 0, 0, 0, maxLength);
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // Example input
    std::cout << "Maximum length of a good subsequence: " << maxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The main consideration here is that the recursive function explores all subsequences:
- **Number of Subsequences**: There are \(2^n\) subsequences for an array of length \(n\).
- **Operations per Subsequence**: Each subsequence check is an \(O(1)\) operation due to the constant-time check for power of 2.

Thus, in the worst-case scenario, the time complexity is \(O(2^n)\).

1. **Recursive Depth**: The recursion goes up to depth \(n\).
2. **Subsequence Generation**: Each call either includes an element or skips it.

While \(O(2^n)\) is exponential and might not be feasible for large \(n\), this approach works for reasonably small values which are typical in interview settings unless otherwise specified.
