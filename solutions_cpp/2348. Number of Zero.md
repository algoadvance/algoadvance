[Leetcode 2348. Number of Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2348)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums`. A subarray is considered "zero-filled" if all elements in the subarray are `0`. Your task is to return the number of non-empty zero-filled subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
   - Typical constraint for LeetCode problems could be up to `10^5`.
2. **Element Values**: Can elements be negative or is it strictly non-negative integers?
   - Assuming integers can be both negative and positive, but only zeros matter for subarray counting.
3. **Output**: Should the output be a single integer representing the number of zero-filled subarrays?

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we need to count all subarrays filled with zeros. A key observation is that if we find a sequence of consecutive zeros of length `k`, this sequence contributes `k * (k + 1) / 2` zero-filled subarrays. This is because:
- A sequence of length `k` contains 1 subarray of length `k`, 2 subarrays of length `k-1`, ..., up to `k` subarrays of length 1.

Using this formula, we can keep track of the lengths of consecutive zero sequences and calculate the subarrays in a single pass through the array.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    long long zeroFilledSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        long long count = 0;
        long long zeroSeqLen = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                zeroSeqLen++;
            } else {
                count += (zeroSeqLen * (zeroSeqLen + 1)) / 2;
                zeroSeqLen = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // If the last segment is zero-filled, add its count as well
        if (zeroSeqLen > 0) {
            count += (zeroSeqLen * (zeroSeqLen + 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. We only go through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no extra space required except for a few variables to keep track of counts and lengths.
