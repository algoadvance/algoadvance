[Leetcode 2762. Continuous Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2762)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the length of the longest continuous subarray containing at most two unique elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the range of values for `n` (size of the array)?
   - This helps in understanding if the algorithm considerations need to be made for large inputs.
   
2. **Values in `nums`**: What range of values can elements in `nums` take?
   - This could influence the choice of data structures.

3. **Duplicates**: Can the elements in `nums` be duplicate?
   - This affects how we would handle the inclusion of elements in the subarray.

In absence of explicit constraints, let's assume typical constraints: 
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Strategy

Given that we need to find the length of the longest subarray with at most two unique elements, we can use the sliding window (or two-pointer) approach. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Sliding Window Initialization**: Start with two pointers (`left` and `right`) at the beginning of the array.
2. **Window Expansion**: Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to include new elements until the condition (subarray having at most two unique elements) is violated.
3. **Condition Violation Handling**: When the condition is violated (i.e., the subarray has more than two unique elements), move the `left` pointer to shrink the window from the left side until the condition is satisfied again.
4. **Tracking Maximum Length**: Throughout the process, track the maximum length of the valid subarray.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int longestSubarrayWithTwoDistinct(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> hashmap;
    int left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;

    while (right < nums.size()) {
        hashmap[nums[right]]++;
        
        while (hashmap.size() > 2) {
            hashmap[nums[left]]--;
            if (hashmap[nums[left]] == 0) {
                hashmap.erase(nums[left]);
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        right++;
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4};
    cout << "Length of longest subarray with at most 2 distinct elements: " << longestSubarrayWithTwoDistinct(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**:
- **Sliding Window Movement**: Both pointers `left` and `right` traverse the array at most once.
- **HashMap Operations**: Insertions, deletions, and lookups in the hash map have an amortized time complexity of **O(1)**.

Thus, the algorithm is efficient and should work well within the constraints.
