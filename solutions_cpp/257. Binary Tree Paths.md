[Leetcode 257. Binary Tree Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l257)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A leaf is a node with no children.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of a leaf node?**
   A leaf node is a node that has no left or right child.
   
2. **What should the output look like?**
   The output should be a list of strings where each string represents a path from the root to a leaf node.
   
3. **Are there any constraints on the tree?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
   - The tree is a binary tree, meaning each node has at most two children.
   - The value of each node is between `-100` and `100`.

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal:** 
   - Perform a DFS traversal of the binary tree.
   - Keep track of the current path from the root to the current node.
   - When reaching a leaf node, convert the current path to the required format and add it to the result list.
   
2. **String Construction:**
   - Start from the root, and for each node visited, append its value to the path string.
   - Use recursion to traverse to the left and right children.
   - On reaching a leaf node, append the complete path string to the result list.
   
3. **Backtracking:**
   - After exploring both the children of a node, backtrack to explore other paths, ensuring the path string is appropriately managed between recursive calls.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> binaryTreePaths(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<string> result;
        if (root) {
            findPaths(root, "", result);
        }
        return result;
    }

private:
    void findPaths(TreeNode* node, string path, vector<string>& result) {
        if (node) {
            path += to_string(node->val);
            
            // If it's a leaf, add the path to result
            if (!node->left && !node->right) {
                result.push_back(path);
            } else {
                path += "->"; // Add delimiter
                if (node->left) {
                    findPaths(node->left, path, result);
                }
                if (node->right) {
                    findPaths(node->right, path, result);
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), which accounts for the space used by the recursion stack and the storage required for the result list. In the case of a completely unbalanced tree, the recursion stack will hold up to N recursive calls.

This strategy ensures that all paths from the root to the leaves are found and formatted correctly.
