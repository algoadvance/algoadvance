[Leetcode 2973. Find Number of Coins to Place in Tree Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2973)
## Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 2973: Find Number of Coins to Place in Tree Nodes-out. Given a binary tree, you are tasked with distributing some coins to the nodes in such a way that every node has exactly one coin. The rule is that you can move a coin from any node to any of its subtree or to its parent. Determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve this.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Will the input always be a non-empty binary tree?
   - **Clarification**: Yes, the input will always be a valid (non-empty) binary tree.
   
2. **Coin Information**: How will the information about the coins in the nodes be presented?
   - **Clarification**: Each node of the tree will have an integer value representing the number of coins in that node initially.

3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the number of coins within each node?
   - **Clarification**: Each node can start with any number of coins (including zero).

We can assume that the tree nodes are defined as follows:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};
```

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to understand the following:
1. **Excess Calculation**: Each node might have an excess of coins (+ve or -ve). We need to redistribute these coins such that each node ends up with exactly one coin.
2. **DFS Traversal**: Performing a Depth-First Search (DFS) allows us to start considering leaf nodes and work our way up to the root, adjusting as we go.
3. **Counting Moves**: As we traverse, we count the number of moves required to balance each subtree's excess coins at each step.

**Details**:
1. **Excess Calculation**: For each node:
    - Calculate the excess coins: `excess = current node coins + left excess + right excess - 1`.
2. **Move Counting**: Each excess coin either moved to/from the parent or among siblings counts as one move.

## Code
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        int moves = 0;
        dfs(root, moves);
        return moves;
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int& moves) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        int leftExcess = dfs(node->left, moves);
        int rightExcess = dfs(node->right, moves);
        
        // Calculate total excess coins
        int totalExcess = node->val + leftExcess + rightExcess - 1;
        
        // The number of moves required to balance this node
        moves += abs(totalExcess);
        
        return totalExcess;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because in the DFS traversal, each node is visited exactly once.

The space complexity can be considered O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursive call stack space.

This solution should efficiently solve cases within the constraints typically found in coding interview problems.
