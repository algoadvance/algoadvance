[Leetcode 2925. Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2925)
## Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`. The tree is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n-1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`.

Each node has a value associated with it, given by an integer array `values` of length `n`. You want to perform some operations on the tree to maximize the score. 

In one operation, you can:

- Choose a node `i` and add the value of node `i` to your score.
- Remove node `i` and all edges connected to it.
- What is the maximum score you can achieve after performing any number of such operations?

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any restrictions on the values of the nodes?**
   - No, the value of nodes can be any integer, positive, negative, or zero.
   
2. **If a node is removed, can we still perform operations on any of its child nodes?**
   - No, once a node and its edges are removed from the tree, any node that was dependent (i.e., only accessible through this node) is no longer accessible.
   
3. **Are the edges bidirectional?**
   - Yes, the edges are bidirectional.

## Example

Given:
- `values = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]]`

Tree structure:
```
   0
   |
   1
  / \
 2   3
```
You can perform operations in different order to maximize the score, considering the tree structure.

## Strategy

1. **Tree Decomposition:** Treat the problem by decomposing it into subproblems via DFS (Depth First Search).

2. **Subtree Sum Calculation:** For each node, calculate the sum of values in its subtree (including itself).

3. **Dynamic Programming:** Use DP to store maximum scores for each subtree from bottom-up.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int node, int parent, vector<int>& values, vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
        int subtreeSum = values[node];
        for (int child : adj[node]) {
            if (child != parent) {
                subtreeSum += dfs(child, node, values, adj);
            }
        }
        return subtreeSum;
    }

    int maxScore(vector<int>& values, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = values.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);

        // Build adjacency list
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        // Calculate subtree sums
        int maxScore = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = dfs(i, -1, values, adj);
            maxScore = max(maxScore, sum);
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Building the adjacency list takes `O(n)`.
- The DFS traversal for sum calculation takes `O(n)` for each node since each edge is visited twice at most.
- Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n^2)` for the nested DFS.

While the problem can be further optimized in terms of space complexity, this basic approach should help understand and frame the solution.
