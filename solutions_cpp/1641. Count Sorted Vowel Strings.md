[Leetcode 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1641)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels (i.e., 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and are lexicographically sorted.

A string `s` is lexicographically sorted if for all valid `i`, where `1 <= i < s.length`, `s[i]` is not less than `s[i - 1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`? (1 <= n <= 50)

2. **Input/Output**:
   - Is the input always valid (within the constraints)?
   - Should we focus on optimization in terms of time and space?

3. **Output**:
   - The output should be an integer representing the count of lexicographically sorted strings of length `n`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach where we systematically calculate the number of valid strings for each length up to `n` and for each vowel position.

Let's define a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the string, and `j` represents the number of vowels up to the `j-th` vowel (1-based, mapping to 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The value in `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of lexicographically sorted strings of length `i` using the first `j` vowels.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize the base case: For `i = 1` (length of the string is 1), there are exactly `j` lexicographically sorted strings (`j` here is the number of vowels we are using).
2. Populate the DP table based on the recurrence relation:
   - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`
   - This means the number of valid strings of length `i` using `j` vowels can be derived by adding:
     - The number of valid strings of length `i-1` using `j` vowels (keep adding the same `j-th` vowel).
     - The number of valid strings of length `i` using `j-1` vowels (append the new `j-th` vowel).

3. Return `dp[n][5]` as the result because this will account for all vowels up to 'u'.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int countVowelStrings(int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(6, 0));
    
    // Base case: For a single character string
    for (int j = 1; j <= 5; ++j) {
        dp[1][j] = j;  // "a" - 1 way, "ae" - 2 ways, "aei" - 3 ways, etc.
    }

    // Fill DP table
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 5; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][5];
}

int main() {
    int n = 2;  // Example input
    cout << countVowelStrings(n) << endl;  // Output should be 15
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for filling the DP table is \(O(n \times 5)\) since we have nested loops iterating over `n` and fixed 5 vowels. Hence, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(n \times 5)\) for the DP table since we are using a 2D array to store intermediate results. Hence, it is \(O(n)\).
