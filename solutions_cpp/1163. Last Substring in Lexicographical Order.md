[Leetcode 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1163)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. You need to find the last substring of `s` in lexicographical order.

**Example:**
```
Input: "abab"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: The substrings in lexicographical order are ["a", "ab", "abab", "b", "ba", "bab"]. The largest of these is "bab".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input string contain any non-alphabetic characters?
   **A:** No, the problem specifies that the string consists of lowercase English letters only.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
   **A:** The length of the string `s` can be up to 5 * 10^5.

3. **Q:** Should the output be the substring or its lexicographical position?
   **A:** The output should be the substrings themselves.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently given the constraints, we can't afford to generate all substrings and sort them due to the potential size. Instead, we need to utilize a more analytical approach:

1. **Initialization:** Start by initializing two pointers: `i` at the beginning of the string and `j` just ahead.
2. **Comparison:** Compare the substrings starting at `i` and `j`:
   - If the substring starting at `i` is lexicographically less than the substring starting at `j`, then move `i` to `j`.
   - If the substring starting at `i` is greater, then move `j` ahead.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** For cases where characters might be the same for an extended stretch, have a separate pointer `k` to handle comparison within these substrings.
4. **Result:** At the end of the process, the pointer `i` will point to the starting position of the last substring in lexicographical order.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string lastSubstring(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int i = 0, j = 1, k = 0;

    while (j < n) {
        // Compare the substrings starting at i and j
        if (s[i + k] == s[j + k]) {
            k++;
        } else {
            if (s[i + k] < s[j + k]) {
                i = (i + k + 1);  // Move i to j
            } else {
                j = j + k + 1;    // Move j ahead
            }
            // Reset k
            k = 0;
        }
        // Ensure i is always before j
        if (i >= j) {
            j = i + 1;
        }
    }

    return s.substr(i);
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abab";
    std::cout << "Last substring: " << lastSubstring(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each comparison operation potentially moves one of the pointers forward, ensuring linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are only using a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

This algorithm is efficient and works within the constraints provided in the problem.
