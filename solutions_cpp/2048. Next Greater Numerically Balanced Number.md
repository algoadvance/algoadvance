[Leetcode 2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2048)
### Problem Statement

A numerically balanced number is a number where the frequency of each digit present in the number is equal to the digit itself. For example, `122333` is a numerically balanced number because it contains one `1`, two `2`s, and three `3`s.

Given a positive integer `n`, you need to find the smallest numerically balanced number that is greater than `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - Typically, it could be constrained by the problem, for example, within 1 to 10^9.

2. **Single digit condition**: Is a single digit itself considered a numerically balanced number since it may trivially meet the criteria?
   - Yes, single digit numbers (1-9) are often considered numerically balanced as they implicitly have the condition met.

3. **Output Format**: Should the return type be an integer or string representation?
   - The output should be an integer, as the input `n` is an integer.

### Strategy

1. **Incremental Search**: Start from `n + 1` and increment the number.
2. **Check Balanced**: For each number, check if it is numerically balanced.
   - Convert the number to a string to count each digit's occurrences.
   - Check if the frequency of each digit matches the digit itself.
3. **Efficient Counting**: Use an integer array to count occurrences of each digit (0-9).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Function to determine if a number is numerically balanced
bool isNumericallyBalanced(int num) {
    // Convert the number to a string
    string numStr = to_string(num);
    
    // Initialize a vector to count occurrences of each digit (0-9)
    vector<int> digitCount(10, 0);
    
    // Count the digits
    for (char ch : numStr) {
        digitCount[ch - '0']++;
    }
    
    // Check the frequency matches the digit itself
    for (int digit = 0; digit <= 9; digit++) {
        if (digitCount[digit] != 0 && digitCount[digit] != digit) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

// Function to find the next numerically balanced number
int nextGreaterNumericallyBalanced(int n) {
    int num = n + 1;
    while (true) {
        if (isNumericallyBalanced(num)) {
            return num;
        }
        num++;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 1234;
    cout << "Next numerically balanced number after " << n << " is: " << nextGreaterNumericallyBalanced(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Checking if a single number is numerically balanced involves counting digits and can be done in O(d), where d is the number of digits.
- In the worst case, we may check multiple numbers sequentially. Given that checking each number is O(d), the overall complexity depends on the distance to the next balanced number.
- Hence, while hard to precisely bound in general without further analysis, it's pragmatic to expect typical inputs to iterate a manageable number of steps, each costing O(d).

This solution should work efficiently for moderate values of `n`.
