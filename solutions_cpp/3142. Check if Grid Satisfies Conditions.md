[Leetcode 3142. Check if Grid Satisfies Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3142)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n` containing integers. You need to check whether the grid satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Strictly Increasing Rows:** Each row in the grid must have strictly increasing values from left to right.
2. **Strictly Increasing Columns:** Each column in the grid must have strictly increasing values from top to bottom.

Return `true` if the grid satisfies both conditions, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:** What are the constraints on the dimensions of the grid (`m` and `n`) and the values within the grid?
    - Usually, constraints on the dimensions and values would determine the efficiency of the solution.
  
2. **Edge Cases:** Should we handle cases when the grid is empty or has only one row/column?
    - Specifically, grids with dimensions `0 x 0`, `1 x n`, and `m x 1`.

## Strategy

1. **Strictly Increasing Rows:** 
   - Iterate through each row and check if every subsequent element is greater than the previous one.
  
2. **Strictly Increasing Columns:** 
   - Iterate through each column and ensure that every subsequent element is greater than the one above it.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the grid has only one row or one column, it trivially satisfies the conditions.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

bool checkGridConditions(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    if (m == 0) return true; // An empty grid trivially satisfies the conditions
    int n = grid[0].size();
    if (n == 0) return true; // An empty grid trivially satisfies the conditions

    // Check strictly increasing rows
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] <= grid[i][j-1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check strictly increasing columns
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            if (grid[i][j] <= grid[i-1][j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}

```

## Time Complexity

- Checking strictly increasing rows: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- Checking strictly increasing columns: `O(m * n)`.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

This solution iterates through each element of the grid a constant number of times, making it efficient and appropriate even for larger grids within typical competitive programming constraints.
