[Leetcode 1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1601)
## Problem Statement

You are given `n` buildings and an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents a request to transfer a tenant from building `from_i` to building `to_i`.

We say that the i-th request is achievable if by granting that request, it does not cause any of the buildings to have a net tenant change that East-West offsets resulting from the net number of tenants received or transferred.

Your goal is to find the maximum number of achievable requests.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarifications on Building Count and Requests:**
   - What are the constraints on `n` (the number of buildings)?
   - What are the constraints on the number of requests?
   - What should be the return type of the solution function?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle cases where there are no buildings (`n = 0`) or no requests?
   - Is it possible to have requests that start and end in the same building (i.e., `from_i == to_i`)? If so, how should these be handled?

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should we optimize the solution for time or space complexity, or is a brute-force approach acceptable given the constraints?

Given the constraints and edge cases, let's move on to the approach.

## Strategy

### Approach
1. **Generate All Possible Combinations:**
   - Iterate through all possible subsets of requests. There are `2^m` subsets where `m` is the number of requests.
   
2. **Check Net Change for Each Combination:**
   - For each subset, calculate the net change in the number of tenants for each building.
   - Validate if the combination results in no net change for all buildings.

3. **Track the Maximum Valid Requests:**
   - Keep track of the maximal length of valid subsets.

### Steps to Implement
1. Use bit manipulation to generate all subsets of `requests`.
2. For each subset, update the net change of tenants in an array `balance`.
3. Verify if all entries in `balance` are zero.
4. Track and return the size of the largest subset that satisfies the condition.

### Time Complexity
- Checking all combinations yields a time complexity of \(O(2^m \times m)\), where `m` is the number of requests. This is manageable for small values of `m` (typically up to 20-25).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumRequests(int n, vector<vector<int>>& requests) {
        int m = requests.size();
        int maxAchievable = 0;

        // Iterate over all subsets of requests
        for (int subset = 0; subset < (1 << m); ++subset) {
            vector<int> balance(n, 0);
            int count = 0;
            
            // Check the net change in tenancy for this subset
            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                if (subset & (1 << i)) {
                    balance[requests[i][0]]--;
                    balance[requests[i][1]]++;
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            // Verify if this subset results in zero net change for all buildings
            bool valid = true;
            for (int b : balance) {
                if (b != 0) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (valid) {
                maxAchievable = max(maxAchievable, count);
            }
        }
        
        return maxAchievable;
    }
};
```

## Explanation
1. **Bit Manipulation to Generate Subsets:**
   - We iterate from `0` to `2^m - 1`. Each `i` represents a subset.
   - Inside this loop, we determine if a particular request is included in the subset via bit-checking (`subset & (1 << i)`).

2. **Balance Calculation:**
   - For each included request, update the `balance` array.
   - For each building, `balance[i]` should end up being `0` if the subset is valid.

3. **Validation and Maximum Tracking:**
   - If the subset is valid, update `maxAchievable` with the subset's size if itâ€™s the largest found so far.

This solution efficiently tests all combinations to find the maximum number of achievable requests, providing a clear and comprehensible approach.
