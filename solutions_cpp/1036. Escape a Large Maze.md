[Leetcode 1036. Escape a Large Maze](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1036)
## Problem Statement
**1036. Escape a Large Maze**

In a 1 million by 1 million grid, the coordinates of each point are (x, y) where 0 <= x, y < 10^6.

We start at the source point (sourc[0], source[1]) and we want to reach the target point (target[0], target[1]). There are some blocked cells represented as coordinates in the `blocked` list.

We want to determine if it's possible to escape the maze, i.e., reach the target point from the source point while bypassing the blocked cells.

### Input:
- `blocked`: A list of blocked coordinates.
- `source`: The source coordinate.
- `target`: The target coordinate.

### Output:
- Return `true` if it is possible to escape from the source to the target, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Blocked Cells**: What is the range and size of the blocked cells?
   - The maximum number of blocked cells is 200.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider cases where the source or target itself is blocked?
   - It's guaranteed that neither the source nor the target will be blocked.

3. **Path Movement**: Are movements restricted to horizontal and vertical, or can we move diagonally?
   - Moves are restricted to horizontal and vertical only.

4. **Grid Constraints**: Is the grid size fixed, or do we need to consider dynamic resizing?
   - The grid size is fixed at 1 million by 1 million.

## Strategy

Given that the problem space is vast (`10^6 x 10^6`) but the number of blocked cells is small (200), the key idea is to leverage BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore possible paths while avoiding blocked cells. BFS will help us explore the closest nodes first and maintain a queue for exploration frontier.

We will perform the following steps:

1. **Early Termination Check**: If the source or target is deeply enclosed by blocked cells, movement will be restricted early in the search.
2. **Bidirectional BFS**: This approach can be more efficient by searching from both the source and target simultaneously, meeting in the middle.

## Code

Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

class Solution {
public:
    // Custom hasher for the unordered_set<pair<int, int>>
    struct pair_hash {
        template <class T1, class T2>
        std::size_t operator () (const std::pair<T1, T2> &pair) const {
            return std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) ^ std::hash<T2>()(pair.second);
        }
    };

    bool isEscapePossible(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& blocked, std::vector<int>& source, std::vector<int>& target) {
        if (blocked.size() < 2)
            return true;
        
        // Convert blocked cells into a set of pairs for faster lookup
        std::unordered_set<std::pair<int, int>, pair_hash> blocked_set;
        for (const auto& b : blocked)
            blocked_set.insert({b[0], b[1]});

        // Use BFS for both source and target
        return bfs(source, target, blocked_set) && bfs(target, source, blocked_set);
    }

private:
    bool bfs(const std::vector<int>& start, const std::vector<int>& finish, std::unordered_set<std::pair<int, int>, pair_hash>& blocked_set) {
        const int LIMIT = 20000; // based on max possible enclose
        std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> q;
        std::unordered_set<std::pair<int, int>, pair_hash> visited;
        
        std::vector<int> directions = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        
        q.push({start[0], start[1]});
        visited.insert({start[0], start[1]});
        
        while (!q.empty() && visited.size() < LIMIT) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
                int nx = x + directions[i];
                int ny = y + directions[i + 1];
                
                if (nx < 0 || ny < 0 || nx >= 1e6 || ny >= 1e6)
                    continue;
                
                std::pair<int, int> next = {nx, ny};
                if (blocked_set.find(next) != blocked_set.end() || visited.find(next) != visited.end())
                    continue;
                
                if (nx == finish[0] && ny == finish[1])
                    return true;
                
                q.push(next);
                visited.insert(next);
            }
        }
        
        return visited.size() >= LIMIT;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(B) to process `blocked` where B is the number of blocked cells.
- **BFS**: In the worst-case scenario, each BFS might expand up to `LIMIT = 20000` cells, so the complexity is O(LIMIT).

Thus, the overall time complexity will be `O(B + LIMIT)`, which is efficient given the constraints provided (B â‰¤ 200).
