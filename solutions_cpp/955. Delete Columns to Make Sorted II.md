[Leetcode 955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l955)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length. The strings can be rearranged in any order you want, but the objective is to keep them lexicographically sorted. You need to find the minimum number of columns that need to be deleted to make the strings sorted.

A matrix is considered sorted row-wise if for every row `j`, we have `row[j] â‰¤ row[j+1]`.

**Example:**
```
Input: strs = ["ca","bb","ac"]
Output: 1
Explanation: After deleting column 1, the final row sequence becomes ["c","b","c"], and they are sorted.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input always valid? (e.g., all strings have the same length)**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that all strings have the same length.
2. **Can the input strings be empty or of length 1?**
   - No, since the problem assumes non-empty strings and an array containing at least two strings.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, the general approach involves:
1. **Column Deletions:** Iteratively check each column to determine if deleting the column helps in keeping the strings lexicographically sorted.
2. **Lexicographical Check:** For each column, check the condition whether all previous columns combined with the current one keep everything lexicographically sorted.
3. **Tracking Sorted Rows:** Maintain an array that tracks which rows are already sorted based on previous columns, which helps in deciding whether additional columns keep the result sorted after deletions.

### Code
Below is the C++ code to achieve the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(std::vector<std::string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        int m = strs[0].size();
        int deleteCount = 0;
        
        std::vector<bool> sortedRows(n - 1, false);
        
        for (int col = 0; col < m; ++col) {
            bool deleteColumn = false;
            for (int row = 0; row < n - 1; ++row) {
                if (!sortedRows[row] && strs[row][col] > strs[row + 1][col]) {
                    deleteColumn = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (deleteColumn) {
                ++deleteCount;
            } else {
                for (int row = 0; row < n - 1; ++row) {
                    if (strs[row][col] < strs[row + 1][col]) {
                        sortedRows[row] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return deleteCount;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization:**
  - `n` for the number of strings.
  - `m` for the length of each string.
  - `deleteCount` to keep track of the number of columns deleted.
  - `sortedRows`, a boolean array, to track rows that are sorted up to the current column.

- **Column Iteration:**
  - Iterate column by column.
  - For each column, check if it violates the sorted order condition. If a column violates it for any unsorted rows, mark it for deletion and increase `deleteCount`.
  - If no violation occurs, update `sortedRows` to mark rows that are definitively sorted due to the current column.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)`
  - We are iterating over all columns (`m`) for all rows (`n`), and each operation inside these loops is `O(1)`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We use additional space for the array `sortedRows`, which tracks the sorting status of the rows.

This solution ensures that you can systematically determine the minimum columns to delete while maintaining readability and efficiency.
