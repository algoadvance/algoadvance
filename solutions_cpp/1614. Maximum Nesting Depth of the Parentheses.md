[Leetcode 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1614)
## Problem Statement

Given a valid parentheses string `s` (a string consisting of `(` and `)` only), we need to compute the maximum depth of valid nested parentheses.

Example:
- Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
- Output: 3

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Will the input string always be valid?
   - **A:** Yes, the input string is guaranteed to be valid.
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the string?
   - **A:** Typically, constraints are not explicitly given in the problem statement, but you can assume the string could be as long as the typical constraints for a LeetCode problem, up to 10^4 characters.

## Strategy
To find the maximum depth of nested parentheses:
1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. Initialize a counter to keep track of the current depth.
3. Every time you encounter an opening parenthesis `(`, increase the depth counter.
4. Every time you encounter a closing parenthesis `)`, decrease the depth counter.
5. Keep a record of the maximum depth encountered during the traversal.
6. Return the maximum depth as the result.

## Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(std::string s) {
        int current_depth = 0;
        int max_depth = 0;

        for (char ch : s) {
            if (ch == '(') {
                current_depth++;
                max_depth = std::max(max_depth, current_depth);
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                current_depth--;
            }
        }

        return max_depth;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we only perform a single traversal of the string.

## Explanation
- We initialize two variables `current_depth` and `max_depth` to 0.
- We iterate over each character in the string `s`.
- For each opening parenthesis `(`, we increment `current_depth` and update `max_depth` if the current depth exceeds the previous `max_depth`.
- For each closing parenthesis `)`, we decrement `current_depth`.
- At the end of traversal, `max_depth` will hold the maximum depth of the nested parentheses in the string.

This approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the maximum nesting depth in a single pass through the input string.
