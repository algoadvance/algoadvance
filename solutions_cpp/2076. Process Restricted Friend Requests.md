[Leetcode 2076. Process Restricted Friend Requests](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2076)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` indicating the number of people, and a list of `pairs`, where each `pairs[i] = [a, b]` indicates that person `a` and person `b` are friends. You are also given a list of `restrictions`, where each `restrictions[i] = [x, y]` indicates that person `x` and person `y` cannot be friends. You are to return a boolean array `results` where each `results[i]` is `true` if the friend request can be accepted, and `false` if it cannot be accepted.

A friend request `request[j] = [u, v]` can be accepted if:
- `u` and `v` are not already friends.
- There is no restriction such that it would be violated by accepting this friend request.

### Example

```plaintext
Input:
n = 5
pairs = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
restrictions = [[0, 2], [2, 4]]
requests = [[1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

Output:
[true, false, true]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the indices in pairs and requests zero-based?**
   - Yes, all indices in the problem are zero-based.

2. **Are there constraints on the lengths of pairs, restrictions, and requests?**
   - Typically, the constraints can range from relatively small to moderately large, but they aren't specified here. Assume they fit within standard competitive programming limits.

3. **Can the same restriction appear more than once in the restrictions list?**
   - No, assume all restrictions and pairs are unique.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) with additional checks to handle the restrictions. Here are the main steps:

1. **Initialize Union-Find Data Structure:** We'll maintain the connected components of people using Union-Find.
2. **Handle Each Request:** For each friend request, we need to check if accepting it would violate any restriction.
3. **Check for Restrictions:** Use the union operation only if adding the friend does not create a restricted scenario:
    - Temporarily perform the union and check if it violates restrictions.
    - Roll back the union if it violates any restriction.
4. **Update Results:** Populate the `results` array based on the feasibility of each friend request.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for iota

class Solution {
    struct UnionFind {
        std::vector<int> parent, rank;

        UnionFind(int n) {
            parent.resize(n);
            rank.resize(n, 1);
            std::iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
        }
        
        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }
        
        bool unionSets(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        
        void rollbackUnion(int x, int y, int rootY) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            parent[rootY] = rootY;
            rank[rootX]--;
        }
    };
    
public:
    std::vector<bool> friendRequests(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& restrictions, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& requests) {
        UnionFind uf(n);
        std::vector<bool> results;
        
        for (const auto& req : requests) {
            int u = req[0];
            int v = req[1];
            int rootU = uf.find(u);
            int rootV = uf.find(v);
            bool canBeFriends = true;
            
            if (rootU != rootV) {
                // Temporarily union u and v
                uf.unionSets(u, v);
                for (const auto& res : restrictions) {
                    int x = res[0];
                    int y = res[1];
                    int rootX = uf.find(x);
                    int rootY = uf.find(y);
                    // Check if any restriction is violated
                    if (rootX == rootY) {
                        canBeFriends = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                // Rollback if it can't be a friend
                if (!canBeFriends) {
                    uf.rollbackUnion(u, v, rootV);
                }
            } else {
                canBeFriends = false; // They are already friends
            }
            results.push_back(canBeFriends);
        }
        
        return results;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Union-Find (Initialization):** O(n)
- **Finding roots:** O(α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, very close to constant for practical purposes.
- **Union operation:** O(α(n))
- **Checking restrictions per request:** O(R) where R is the number of restrictions.

Overall, for `m` requests and `R` restrictions, the time complexity should be effectively **O(m * R * α(n))**, which is efficient for large inputs within realistic constraints.
