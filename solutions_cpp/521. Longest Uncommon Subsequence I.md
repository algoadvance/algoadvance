[Leetcode 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l521)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence is a subsequence that is a substring of one of the strings but not a substring of the other.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of `a` and `b`?**
   - The length of both strings `a` and `b` will be between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   
2. **Can `a` and `b` be the same?**
   - Yes, `a` and `b` can be the same string.

3. **What should be returned if the strings `a` and `b` are equal?**
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, return `-1` because there will be no uncommon subsequence.

### Strategy
1. Check if the strings `a` and `b` are equal.
   - If `a == b`, return `-1` because there's no uncommon subsequence.
2. If `a` and `b` are not equal, the longest uncommon subsequence would simply be the longer string itself.
   - If the two strings are different, the entire string `a` (or `b`) cannot be a subsequence of the other string unless they are identical, which we already checked for.
   
### Time Complexity
- The solution involves basic string comparison and length determination, so the time complexity is `O(1)`.

### C++ Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int findLUSlength(std::string a, std::string b) {
    if (a == b)
        return -1;
    return std::max(a.length(), b.length());
}

int main() {
    std::string a = "abc";
    std::string b = "cdc";
    std::cout << findLUSlength(a, b) << std::endl; // Output: 3

    a = "aaa";
    b = "bbb";
    std::cout << findLUSlength(a, b) << std::endl; // Output: 3

    a = "abc";
    b = "abc";
    std::cout << findLUSlength(a, b) << std::endl; // Output: -1

    return 0;
}
```

In the provided code, the `findLUSlength` function implements the strategy described. It first checks if the two strings are equal and returns `-1` if they are. If they are not equal, it returns the length of the longer string, which is the length of the longest uncommon subsequence.
