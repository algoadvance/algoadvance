[Leetcode 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l976)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `nums` Array**: What is the range of values for the length of the array `nums`?
   - **Answer**: According to LeetCode, the length of `nums` will be between 3 and 10,000.

2. **Range of Elements in `nums`**: What is the range of each element in `nums`?
   - **Answer**: Each element in `nums` will be a positive integer less than or equal to `10^6`.

3. **Handling Duplicates**: Is it possible to have duplicate lengths in the `nums` array?
   - **Answer**: Yes, duplicates are allowed.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `nums` array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: To form a triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and `c`, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
3. **Iterating**: Start checking from the end of the sorted array and look for the largest triplet that satisfies the triangle inequality. Specifically, if the array after sorting is `a ≤ b ≤ c`, then `a + b > c` must hold to form a triangle.
4. **Return**: Return the perimeter of the first valid triangle found; if none is found, return `0`.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity of sorting the array is `O(n log n)`.
- **Iteration**: The time complexity of iterating through the array is `O(n)` in the worst case.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int largestPerimeter(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 2; --i) {
            if (nums[i-1] + nums[i-2] > nums[i]) {
                return nums[i] + nums[i-1] + nums[i-2];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: The vector `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Triangle Formation**: Starting from the largest possible side (`i` from the end of the sorted array), check if the largest side can form a triangle with the two preceding sides. The check `nums[i-1] + nums[i-2] > nums[i]` ensures the triangle inequality theorem is satisfied.
3. **Return Perimeter**: If a valid triangle is found, return its perimeter. If no valid triangle is found by the end of the loop, return `0`.

This approach ensures that we get the largest perimeter triangle efficiently.
