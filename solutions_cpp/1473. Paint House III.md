[Leetcode 1473. Paint House III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1473)
### Problem Statement
`1473. Paint House III`:

There is a row of `m` houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the `n` colors (labeled from `1` to `n`), some houses are already painted, so you cannot change the color of those houses.

A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

- For example, houses `[1,2,2,3,3,3,2]` contain `5` neighborhoods `[1], [2,2], [3,3,3], [2]`.

Given an array `houses`, an `m x n` matrix `cost` and an integer `target` where:
- `houses[i]`: is the color of the house `i`, and `0` if the house is not painted yet.
- `cost[i][j]`: is the cost of painting house `i` with color `j + 1`.

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses such that there are exactly `target` neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `m` (number of houses) reach the size of 100 as given in the constraint?
   - Yes, `m` can be at most 100.
2. What are the constraints for `n` (number of colors)?
   - `n` can be at most 20.
3. Are we considering the cost for houses that are already painted?
   - No, for houses that are already painted, no painting cost is required.

### Strategy
This is a dynamic programming problem where the states must keep track of:
1. The current house index.
2. The number of neighborhoods formed so far.
3. The color of the last neighborhood.

We can create a DP table `dp[i][j][k]` where:
- `i` is the current house index,
- `j` is the number of neighborhoods formed so far,
- `k` is the last color used in the neighborhood.

We will iterate over each house and update the table based on the previous values. Initially, the DP table will be filled with infinity indicating that the state is unreachable.

### Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& houses, vector<vector<int>>& cost, int m, int n, int target) {
        constexpr int INFINITY = 1000000000;
        int dp[m][target + 1][n + 1];
        memset(dp, INFINITY, sizeof(dp));
        
        // If the first house is painted
        if (houses[0] != 0) {
            dp[0][1][houses[0]] = 0;
        } else {
            // If the first house is not painted, try painting it with any possible color
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[0][1][j + 1] = cost[0][j];
            }
        }
        
        // Processing all houses
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int t = 1; t <= target; ++t) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= n; ++k) {
                    if (houses[i] != 0 && houses[i] != k) continue;  // Already painted with a different color
                    int currCost = (houses[i] == 0) ? cost[i][k - 1] : 0;
                    for (int p = 1; p <= n; ++p) {
                        if (k == p) {
                            dp[i][t][k] = min(dp[i][t][k], dp[i - 1][t][k] + currCost);
                        } else if (t > 1) {
                            dp[i][t][k] = min(dp[i][t][k], dp[i - 1][t - 1][p] + currCost);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = INFINITY;
        for (int k = 1; k <= n; ++k) {
            result = min(result, dp[m - 1][target][k]);
        }
        
        return (result == INFINITY) ? -1 : result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * target * n^2)`:
- `m` for iterating over the houses,
- `target` for the number of neighborhoods,
- `n^2` for evaluating painting each house with each color and transitioning between colors.
