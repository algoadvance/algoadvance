[Leetcode 2423. Remove Letter To Equalize Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2423)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `word`, you have to remove exactly one character from the string so that the frequency of each character in the string becomes the same. Return `true` if it's possible to achieve that, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "abcc"
Output: true
Explanation: Removing 'c' from "abcc" will make the frequency of 'a' and 'b' both 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "aazz"
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the input string?**
   - The string `word` will have a length in the range [2, 10^5].

2. **What characters does the string `word` contain?**
   - The string contains only lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').

3. **Is it necessary to remove exactly one character, or can we choose not to remove any at all?**
   - You must remove exactly one character to achieve the equal frequency condition.

4. **Are there any edge cases to consider, such as an extremely short string?**
   - Since the length range is [2, 10^5], the minimum length will be 2, so an empty string or a single-character string is not a concern.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:
1. Calculate the frequency of each character in the input string.
2. Maintain a frequency counter for these frequencies.
3. Check whether it's possible to get either exactly one or two unique frequencies such that removing one character equalizes the frequency.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Count the frequency of each character.
2. Use another count map to keep track of how many times each frequency appears.
3. There are a few scenarios where removal of exactly one character can make all characters have the same frequency:
   - If there's only one unique frequency (already balanced).
   - If there are two frequencies, one of them should be `1` and should appear exactly once. Removing a character with this frequency will balance the string.
   - If there are two frequencies, and their difference is exactly `1`, removing any one character from the higher frequency group should balance the string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

bool equalFrequency(std::string word) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> charFreq;
    for (char c : word) {
        charFreq[c]++;
    }

    std::unordered_map<int, int> freqCount;
    for (auto& cf : charFreq) {
        freqCount[cf.second]++;
    }

    if (freqCount.size() == 1) {
        // All characters already have the same frequency or all except one
        return true;
    } else if (freqCount.size() == 2) {
        // There are exactly two different frequencies
        auto it1 = freqCount.begin();
        auto it2 = it1;
        ++it2;

        // Ensure that the first frequency is the smaller one
        if (it1->first > it2->first) {
            std::swap(it1, it2);
        }

        // Now it1 is the smaller frequency
        if (it1->first == 1 && it1->second == 1) {
            // Case where there's exactly one character with frequency 1
            return true;
        }
        
        if (it2->first == it1->first + 1 && it2->second == 1) {
            // Case where removing one character from the higher frequency
            return true;
        }
    }
  
    return false;
}

int main() {
    std::string word1 = "abcc";
    std::string word2 = "aazz";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << equalFrequency(word1) << std::endl; // true
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << equalFrequency(word2) << std::endl; // false
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
- Counting the frequency of each character takes \(O(n)\).
- Counting the frequency of these frequencies takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique characters and \(m\) is at most 26.
- Both operations combined are \(O(n)\).
