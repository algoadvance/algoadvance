[Leetcode 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l712)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return the minimum ASCII delete sum for two strings such that the resulting two strings are equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length for `s1` and `s2`? 
     - Up to 1000 characters each.
   - Are the characters limited to lowercase English alphabets?
     - It generally includes any printable ASCII character.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How do we handle empty strings?
     - If either `s1` or `s2` is empty, the cost will be the sum of ASCII values of the other string.
   - What should be returned if both strings are already equal?
     - Return 0 as no deletions are necessary.

### Strategy

We'll solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to use a 2D table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII deletion sum to make the substrings `s1[0...i-1]` and `s2[0...j-1]` equal.

**DP Table Initialization**:
- `dp[0][0] = 0`: No characters to delete when both substrings are empty.
- `dp[i][0]`: The sum of ASCII values of the first `i` characters of `s1`, representing deleting all characters from `s1`.
- `dp[0][j]`: The sum of ASCII values of the first `j` characters of `s2`, representing deleting all characters from `s2`.

**DP Formula**:
- If `s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
- If `s1[i-1] != s2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + ASCII(s1[i-1]), dp[i][j-1] + ASCII(s2[j-1]))`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumDeleteSum(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
    int m = s1.size();
    int n = s2.size();
    
    // Create a dp table 
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m + 1, std::vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    
    // Initialize the table
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + s1[i-1];
    }
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + s2[j-1];
    }
    
    // Fill the dp table
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i-1][j] + s1[i-1], dp[i][j-1] + s2[j-1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The answer is in dp[m][n]
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of string `s1` and `n` is the length of string `s2`. This is because we fill up a DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the storage required for the DP table. 

By leveraging dynamic programming, we efficiently solve the problem in a reasonable time frame and memory usage given the constraints.
