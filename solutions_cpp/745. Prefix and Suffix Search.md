[Leetcode 745. Prefix and Suffix Search](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l745)
### Problem Statement

Design a class `WordFilter` that supports the following functions:

- `WordFilter(vector<string>& words)`: The constructor takes a list of words and initializes the class. 
- `f(string prefix, string suffix) -> int`: This function returns the index of the word in the `words` list which has the given `prefix` and `suffix`. If there are multiple valid words, it returns the index of the word with the largest index. If no such word exists, it returns `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How large can the `words` vector be?
   - How long can each word in the `words` vector be?
   - Are there any special characters or just lowercase English letters?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - What should be returned if no word matches both the prefix and suffix criteria?

3. **Performance:**
   - Is there any specific constraint on the time complexity for the functions?

For this problem, it is best to assume that:
- The number of words `n` in the list can be **up to 10^4**.
- The length of each word can be **up to 10** characters.
- Only lowercase English letters are used.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Preprocess the input list of words and store mappings for quick lookup.

2. **Combination Storage:**
   - Use a hashmap (unordered_map) to store combinations of prefixes and suffixes. The key will be a string combining the prefix and suffix, and the value will be the index of the word.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - In the constructor, preprocess each word and generate all possible prefix and suffix combinations and store their indexes.
   - The `f` function will then use these precomputed mappings to return the desired index efficiently.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class WordFilter {
private:
    unordered_map<string, int> combinationMap;
    
public:
    WordFilter(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        for (int index = 0; index < n; ++index) {
            string word = words[index];
            int wordLength = word.size();
            for (int prefix_length = 1; prefix_length <= wordLength; ++prefix_length) {
                for (int suffix_length = 1; suffix_length <= wordLength; ++suffix_length) {
                    string prefix = word.substr(0, prefix_length);
                    string suffix = word.substr(wordLength - suffix_length, suffix_length);
                    combinationMap[prefix + "|" + suffix] = index;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    int f(string prefix, string suffix) {
        string key = prefix + "|" + suffix;
        if (combinationMap.find(key) != combinationMap.end()) {
            return combinationMap[key];
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Constructor:** 
  - Processing each word would take `O(m^2)` where `m` is the maximum length of a word (since we are iterating over all possible prefix and suffix combinations for each word).
  - This results in a total complexity of `O(n * m^2)` where `n` is the number of words.

- **f Function:**
  - Performing a lookup in the hashmap takes `O(1)` average time complexity.

Overall, the preprocessing step is efficient enough given the constraints, and the `f` function runs in constant time.

This strategy ensures that once the initial preprocessing is done, any prefix-suffix query can be answered in constant time.
