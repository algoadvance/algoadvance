[Leetcode 1916. Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1916)
### Problem Statement

A new ant colony is building its nest, which can be seen as a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles). The nest consists of `n` rooms and is built in such a way that there is exactly one way to travel between any two rooms.

To decorate the rooms, the ants will build corridors connecting exactly one pair of rooms. Each room can only be visited once. The decoration starts in room 0 and the corridors and rooms must comply with the rule that if a room `u` can only be decorated after room `v`, then the corridor between `u` and `v` must be decorated after decorating both rooms `u` and `v`.

Given the number of rooms `n` and the connections between the rooms, you need to count the different valid ways to build the nestâ€”i.e., ways to choose the order in which to decorate the rooms and corridors under the given constraints. Return this number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation:** Model the rooms and corridors as a tree. The constraints simplify traversal and decorating the tree since it's acyclic.
  
2. **DFS Traversal:** Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the tree starting from room 0. Track subtree sizes to understand the structure.
  
3. **Factorials and Modulo Arithmetic:** Use factorials to calculate the number of ways to decorate subtrees, combined with modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

4. **Combination Formula:** Use combinations and dynamic programming to compute the valid ways of arranging decorations efficiently.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is dominated by the DFS traversal and the computation of combinations and factorial computations, generally \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of rooms.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

typedef long long ll;

vector<ll> fact, invFact;  // To store factorials and inverse factorials for combinations
vector<int> sz;  // To store sizes of subtrees
vector<vector<int>> adj;  // Adjacency list of rooms graph

ll power(ll x, ll y) {
    ll res = 1;
    x = x % MOD;
    while (y > 0) {
        if (y & 1)
            res = (res * x) % MOD;
        y = y >> 1;
        x = (x * x) % MOD;
    }
    return res;
}

void precomputeFactorials(int n) {
    fact.resize(n + 1);
    invFact.resize(n + 1);
    fact[0] = invFact[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % MOD;
    invFact[n] = power(fact[n], MOD - 2);
    for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i)
        invFact[i] = (invFact[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % MOD;
}

ll comb(int n, int k) {
    if (k > n)
        return 0;
    return fact[n] * invFact[k] % MOD * invFact[n - k] % MOD;
}

int dfs(int u, int parent) {
    sz[u] = 1;
    ll ways = 1;
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (v == parent) continue;
        ways = (ways * dfs(v, u)) % MOD;
        ways = (ways * comb(sz[u] + sz[v] - 1, sz[v])) % MOD;
        sz[u] += sz[v];
    }
    return ways;
}

int countWays(int n, vector<vector<int>>& connections) {
    adj.resize(n);
    sz.resize(n);
    for (auto& edge : connections) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    precomputeFactorials(n);
    return dfs(0, -1);
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    vector<vector<int>> connections = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}};
    cout << countWays(n, connections) << endl; // Output the number of ways
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Room indexing:** Are rooms indexed from 0 to n-1?
2. **Connections format:** Are connections always given as pairs of integers indicating connected rooms?

With these clarifications, you can better understand the input format and constraints, ensuring the implementation meets the problem requirements.
