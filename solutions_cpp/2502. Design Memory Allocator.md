[Leetcode 2502. Design Memory Allocator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2502)
## Problem Statement

You are designing a memory allocator. The allocator should support the following operations:

1. **Allocate** a block of memory of specified size to a given program ID, ensuring no conflicts with other program memory blocks.
2. **Free** memory allocated to a specific program ID.

Here's the detailed description of the two main operations:
- **allocate(size, programID)**: Reserves `size` units of memory for the program `programID` and returns the starting index of the allocated memory block. If there is not enough consecutive free memory to allocate, return `-1`.
- **free(programID)**: Releases all memory allocated to the program with `programID` and returns the size of the freed memory.

You should initialize an allocator of a specified total memory size during the construction.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the behavior if multiple allocate or free requests are made for the same program ID?
2. Should the `allocate` and `free` operations be made efficient for large sequences of operations?
3. Are there specific constraints or edge cases, such as maximum memory size or specific program IDs, that need to be considered?

## Strategy

We will use a vector to simulate memory allocation:
1. Create a vector `memory` of fixed size during initialization, where each element represents a unit of memory.
2. Use the vector to keep track of occupied memory units, where a value of `0` indicates free memory and any positive integer represents the program ID occupying that unit.
3. For the `allocate` function:
   - Scan the `memory` vector for a contiguous block of free units equal to or greater than the requested `size`.
   - If such a block is found, allocate these units to the given `programID` and return the starting index.
   - If no block can accommodate the request, return `-1`.
4. For the `free` function:
   - Iterate through the `memory` array and free all units allocated to the specified `programID`.
   - Return the total number of units freed.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Allocator {
private:
    std::vector<int> memory;
    
public:
    Allocator(int totalSize): memory(totalSize, 0) {}
    
    int allocate(int size, int programID) {
        int n = memory.size();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - size; ++i) {
            bool canAllocate = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                if (memory[i + j] != 0) {
                    canAllocate = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (canAllocate) {
                for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
                    memory[i + j] = programID;
                }
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    int free(int programID) {
        int freedCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < memory.size(); ++i) {
            if (memory[i] == programID) {
                memory[i] = 0;
                ++freedCount;
            }
        }
        return freedCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    Allocator allocator(10);
    std::cout << allocator.allocate(3, 1) << std::endl; // Should return the starting index, e.g., 0
    std::cout << allocator.allocate(4, 2) << std::endl; // Should return the starting index, e.g., 3
    std::cout << allocator.free(1) << std::endl;       // Should return the size of freed memory, e.g., 3
    std::cout << allocator.allocate(2, 3) << std::endl; // Should return the starting index, e.g., 0 or 3
    std::cout << allocator.free(2) << std::endl;       // Should return the size of freed memory, e.g., 4
    std::cout << allocator.free(3) << std::endl;       // Should return the size of freed memory, e.g., 2
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Allocate Operation**: In the worst-case scenario, you might need to scan the entire memory to find a suitable block. This takes `O(n * s)` time, where `n` is the size of the memory and `s` is the requested size. In practice, it should be closer to `O(n)`.
- **Free Operation**: This operation iterates through the entire memory once, making its time complexity `O(n)`.

These time complexities should be acceptable for typical usage scenarios, but further optimizations could include segment trees or doubly linked lists to improve efficiency for large-scale applications.
