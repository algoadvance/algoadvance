[Leetcode 1453. Maximum Number of Darts Inside of a Circular Dartboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1453)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the i-th dart on a 2D plane. A dartboard is represented by a circle with a fixed radius `r`. Your task is to determine the maximum number of darts that can be inside or on the boundary of a single circular dartboard of radius `r`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Coordinates:** What are the possible ranges for the coordinates in `points`? (Typically large integers, but confirming helps.)
2. **Circle Radius (r):** Is the radius `r` guaranteed to be a positive value and is it given as a float or integer?
3. **Output Requirements:** Should the function return the count as an integer?

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we need to leverage computational geometry and mathematical properties related to circles:

1. **Iterate Through Points:**
   - For each pair of dart points, calculate the circle centers formed with the given radius that pass through these two points.
   
2. **Count Points Inside Circle:**
   - For each circle center calculated, count how many dart points lie inside or on the boundary of this circle.
   
3. **Maximize the Count:**
   - Keep track of the maximum number of dart points counted for any circle center computed.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Given two points (xi, yi) and (xj, yj), if the distance between them is less than or equal to `2*r`, only then it's possible to have a circle of radius `r` passing through both points.
   
2. **Circle Center Calculation:**
   - When the distance between two points is valid, calculate the potential centers of the circle using basic geometric formulae.
   
3. **Point Inside Circle:**
   - Check if other points lie inside or on these circles by calculating the distance from the point to the circle center and comparing it with the radius.

### Code
Here is the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points, int r) {
        int n = points.size();
        int max_count = 1; // since one point can always be inside the circle

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                double dist = distance(points[i], points[j]);
                if (dist > 2 * r)
                    continue; // no circle of radius r can pass through both points

                auto centers = getCenters(points[i], points[j], r);
                for (const auto& center : centers) {
                    max_count = max(max_count, countPoints(points, center, r));
                }
            }
        }
        return max_count;
    }

private:
    double distance(const vector<int>& p1, const vector<int>& p2) {
        return sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0]) * (p1[0] - p2[0]) + (p1[1] - p2[1]) * (p1[1] - p2[1]));
    }

    vector<pair<double, double>> getCenters(const vector<int>& p1, const vector<int>& p2, double r) {
        // Midpoint between p1 and p2
        double midX = (p1[0] + p2[0]) / 2.0;
        double midY = (p1[1] + p2[1]) / 2.0;
        double dist = distance(p1, p2) / 2;

        double h = sqrt(r * r - dist * dist);

        double dx = (p2[1] - p1[1]) / (2 * dist);
        double dy = (p1[0] - p2[0]) / (2 * dist);
        
        vector<pair<double, double>> centers;
        centers.emplace_back(midX + h * dx, midY + h * dy);
        centers.emplace_back(midX - h * dx, midY - h * dy);
        return centers;
    }

    int countPoints(const vector<vector<int>>& points, const pair<double, double>& center, double r) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            if (sqrt((point[0] - center.first) * (point[0] - center.first) +
                     (point[1] - center.second) * (point[1] - center.second)) <= r) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pairwise Comparison:** \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of points.
- **Calculation for Each Pair:** Calculating centers and counting points inside the circle involves constant time operations \(O(1)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^3)\).

This solution should be efficient given typical constraints for competitive programming problems (usually up to \(n \approx 1000\)).
