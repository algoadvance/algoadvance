[Leetcode 647. Palindromic Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l647)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.

A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: "a", "b", and "c" are palindromic substrings.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", and "aaa" are palindromic substrings.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - The length of `s` will be between 1 and 1000.
   - `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

2. **Are there any special characters or spaces in the string?**
   - No, the string `s` will consist solely of lowercase English letters.

3. **Should I count overlapping palindromic substrings separately?**
   - Yes, each palindromic substring should be counted.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use two main approaches:

1. **Expand Around Center:**
   - Every palindrome has a center. The center can be one character (odd-length palindromes) or two consecutive characters (even-length palindromes).
   - We can expand around each possible center and count how many palindromes we get.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
   - Fill this table and count the true values.

For simplicity and efficiency, we will use the **Expand Around Center** approach.

### Implementation in C++

Here's the code for the `Expand Around Center` approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int countSubstrings(std::string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        
        // Helper function to count palindromes around a center.
        auto countPalindromesAroundCenter = [&](int left, int right) {
            while (left >= 0 && right < n && s[left] == s[right]) {
                count++;
                left--;
                right++;
            }
        };
        
        // Expand around each character and each pair.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            countPalindromesAroundCenter(i, i); // Odd length palindromes
            countPalindromesAroundCenter(i, i + 1); // Even length palindromes
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string s1 = "abc";
    std::string s2 = "aaa";
    
    std::cout << "Number of palindromic substrings in " << s1 << " is " << sol.countSubstrings(s1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of palindromic substrings in " << s2 << " is " << sol.countSubstrings(s2) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this method is \(O(n^2)\) because for each character and pair of characters, we potentially expand up to the length of the string in both directions.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we only use a few extra variables for counting and expanding around centers.
