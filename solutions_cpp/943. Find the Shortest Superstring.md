[Leetcode 943. Find the Shortest Superstring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l943)
## Problem Statement:

Given an array of strings `A`, find the shortest string that contains each string in `A` as a substring. We may assume that no string in `A` is a substring of another string in `A`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the order of the strings in `A` be preserved in the superstring?
   - No, the order does not need to be preserved.
2. Is there any constraint on the length of the strings in `A`?
   - You should assume that lengths of strings and the size of the array `A` are manageable within typical competitive programming constraints.
3. What should be returned if one of the strings in `A` is an empty string?
   - It can be assumed that there are no empty strings in `A`.

## Strategy:
The problem can be visualized as a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where each node represents a string, and the cost of traveling between two nodes is the overlap between the corresponding strings. 

### Steps:
1. **Calculate Overlaps**: Compute the overlap between every pair of strings. Define `overlap(A, B)` as the maximum length of the suffix of `A` that is a prefix of `B`.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to find the shortest superstring. The state dp[mask][i] will represent the minimum length of the superstring which ends with `i-th` string and mask represents the set of strings used in the superstring.
3. **Bitmask Representation**: Use bitmasking to efficiently handle subsets of strings.

### Detailed Explanation:
- **Overlap Calculation**: Create a function to calculate the maximum overlap between any two strings.
- **DP Initialization and Transition**: Initialize the DP table. For each subset of strings, update the DP table by trying to add another string to the subset and update the corresponding cost.
- **Reconstruct Path**: After populating the DP table, reconstruct the shortest superstring by backtracking through the DP table.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate the maximum overlap between two strings
int overlap(const string &a, const string &b) {
    int max_overlap = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= min(a.size(), b.size()); ++i) {
        if (a.substr(a.size() - i) == b.substr(0, i)) {
            max_overlap = i;
        }
    }
    return max_overlap;
}

// Function to find the shortest superstring
string shortestSuperstring(vector<string>& A) {
    int n = A.size();
    vector<vector<int>> overlaps(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

    // Precompute overlaps between all pairs of strings
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i != j) {
                overlaps[i][j] = overlap(A[i], A[j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Initialize DP and parent tracking
    int N = 1 << n;
    vector<vector<int>> dp(N, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    vector<vector<int>> parent(N, vector<int>(n, -1));

    // Base case
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[1 << i][i] = A[i].size();
    }

    // DP state transition
    for (int mask = 0; mask < N; ++mask) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!(mask & (1 << i))) continue;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i == j || !(mask & (1 << j))) continue;
                int prev_mask = mask ^ (1 << i);
                int len = dp[prev_mask][j] + (int)A[i].size() - overlaps[j][i];
                if (len < dp[mask][i]) {
                    dp[mask][i] = len;
                    parent[mask][i] = j;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Find the minimum length superstring ending at any string
    int min_len = INT_MAX, last = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (dp[N-1][i] < min_len) {
            min_len = dp[N-1][i];
            last = i;
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct the superstring from parent table
    string result;
    int mask = N - 1;
    vector<int> path;
    while (last != -1) {
        path.push_back(last);
        int temp = last;
        last = parent[mask][last];
        mask ^= (1 << temp);
    }

    reverse(path.begin(), path.end());

    result = A[path[0]];
    for (int k = 1; k < path.size(); ++k) {
        int i = path[k-1], j = path[k];
        result += A[j].substr(overlaps[i][j]);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> A = {"catg", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca", "atgcatc"};
    cout << "Shortest Superstring: " << shortestSuperstring(A) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2 * 2^n)`, where `n` is the number of strings in the input array `A`.
- Calculating the overlaps for all pairs of strings takes `O(n^2 * L)`, where `L` is the maximum length of the strings in `A`.
- The DP table update and path reconstruction also take `O(n^2 * 2^n)`.
