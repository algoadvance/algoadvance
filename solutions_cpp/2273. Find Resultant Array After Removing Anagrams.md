[Leetcode 2273. Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2273)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed string array `words`, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can select any index `i` and remove `words[i]` if `words[i - 1]` and `words[i]` are anagrams of each other. You need to return the resultant array after applying the operation any number of times.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Question**: Can `words` contain duplicate strings which are not at adjacent positions?
   - **Answer**: Yes, `words` can contain duplicate strings, but we only consider removal when adjacent strings are anagrams.
   
2. **Question**: Are we allowed to directly create a new array for result or do we need to do in-place modification?
   - **Answer**: Direct creation of a new array is acceptable.

3. **Question**: Is the order of words important in the resultant array?
   - **Answer**: Yes, we need to preserve the original order of words that are not removed.

### Strategy
1. **Comparison function**: We need a function to compare if two strings are anagrams. One efficient way is to sort both strings and check if they are equal.
   
2. **Iteration**: Iterate through the list of words and build the resultant array by only adding words that are not anagrams of the previous word in the resultant array.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Define a helper function to check if two words are anagrams of each other using sorted strings.
   - Iterate through the list `words`, and at each step, check if the current word is an anagram of the last word added to the resultant array.
   - If it is not an anagram, add the current word to the resultant array.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting each word takes \(O(k \log k)\) where \(k\) is the length of the word.
- Since we compare each word once, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot k \log k)\) where \(n\) is the number of words.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // for sort
#include <iostream>

// Helper function to check if two strings are anagrams
bool areAnagrams(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
    // Sort both strings and compare
    std::string sorted_s1 = s1;
    std::string sorted_s2 = s2;
    std::sort(sorted_s1.begin(), sorted_s1.end());
    std::sort(sorted_s2.begin(), sorted_s2.end());
    return sorted_s1 == sorted_s2;
}

std::vector<std::string> removeAnagrams(std::vector<std::string>& words) {
    if (words.empty()) return {};
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    result.push_back(words[0]);
    for (size_t i = 1; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        if (!areAnagrams(result.back(), words[i])) {
            result.push_back(words[i]);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> words = {"abba", "baba", "bbaa", "cd", "cd"};
    std::vector<std::string> result = removeAnagrams(words);

    std::cout << "Resultant words:";
    for (const auto& word : result) {
        std::cout << " " << word;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **areAnagrams Function**: Checks if two strings are anagrams by sorting and comparing them.
2. **removeAnagrams Function**:
   - Initialize the result with the first word.
   - Iterate through the words, adding each word to the result if it is not an anagram of the last word in the result.
3. **Main Function**: Demonstrates usage with an example list of words.
