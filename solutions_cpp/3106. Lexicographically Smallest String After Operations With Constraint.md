[Leetcode 3106. Lexicographically Smallest String After Operations With Constraint](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3106)
## Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` of even length consisting of digits from `0` to `9`, and two integers `a` and `b`, you can perform the following operations any number of times:
1. Add `a` to any of the odd-indexed digits of the string (0-indexed). The digit can wrap around (i.e., after `9`, it becomes `0`).
2. Rotate the string to the right by `b` positions.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on `s`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the string `s` contain only numeric characters?
   - Yes, the string `s` contains only digits from `0` to `9`.
2. Is the length of the string always even?
   - Yes, the length of the string is always even.
3. Can we add `a` multiple times to the same digit?
   - Yes, you can add `a` any number of times to any of the odd-indexed digits.
4. Do the operations have to alternate, or can they be applied in any order?
   - The operations can be applied in any order and any number of times.

## Strategy:
1. **Odd-Indexed Add Operation**: Since we can add `a` any number of times to any of the odd-indexed digits, we will explore the possibilities for each odd-indexed digit modulo `10` after repeatedly adding `a`.
2. **Rotation Operation**: We can rotate the string by `b` positions any number of times which means we consider all rotations of the string. Since rotating `n` times (where `n` is the length of the string which is even) results in the original string, we only need to explore rotations up to `n` positions.
3. **Combine Both Operations**: For each possible modified string generated from the odd-indexed add operation, perform all possible rotations to find the lexicographically smallest string.

## Code:
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

string findLexSmallestString(string s, int a, int b) {
    string res = s;
    queue<string> q;
    unordered_set<string> seen;
    
    q.push(s);
    seen.insert(s);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        string cur = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        if (cur < res) res = cur;
        
        // Operation 1: Add a to all odd indexed digits
        string tempOdd = cur;
        for (int i = 1; i < cur.size(); i += 2) {
            tempOdd[i] = ((tempOdd[i] - '0') + a) % 10 + '0'; 
        }
        
        if (seen.find(tempOdd) == seen.end()) {
            seen.insert(tempOdd);
            q.push(tempOdd);
        }
        
        // Operation 2: Rotate the string to the right by b positions
        string tempRot = cur.substr(cur.size() - b) + cur.substr(0, cur.size() - b);
        
        if (seen.find(tempRot) == seen.end()) {
            seen.insert(tempRot);
            q.push(tempRot);
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: Since we are performing a BFS and exploring all unique configurations of the string, in the worst case scenario, for each configuration, it would take O(n) time for modifications and rotations where n is the length of the string. So, the overall complexity can be difficult to bound strictly but is generally O(n * unique states).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the space needed for the queue and the set to store the seen configurations, with n being the length of the string. However, due to control over a finite number of states, the space grows concerning all possible states of the string configurations influenced by operations.
