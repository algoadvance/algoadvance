[Leetcode 995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l995)
## Problem Statement
You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`.

A **k-bit flip** is choosing a subarray of `k` consecutive bits and flipping every bit in the subarray (i.e., changing `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).

Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no `0` in the array. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

## Example
Given:
- `nums = [0,1,0]`
- `k = 1`

Output: `2`

Explanation:
- Flip `nums[0]`, thus `nums = [1,1,0]`
- Flip `nums[2]`, thus `nums = [1,1,1]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the size of the array `nums`?
     - The size of `nums` can be up to `10^5`.
   - What are the elements of the array `nums`?
     - The elements of `nums` are either `0` or `1`.
   - Can `k` be greater than the size of the array `nums`?
     - No, `1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a greedy approach with the help of an auxiliary array to keep track of the flips:
1. We iterate through the array to find where the flip should start.
2. Use a flip array to efficiently manage the flip state.
3. If a `0` is encountered, flip the next `k` elements and update the flip array and resulting flip count.
4. If flipping such `k` elements would exceed the bounds of the array, return `-1`.

This strategy ensures that each element in the `nums` array is checked at most twice, providing an efficient solution.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minKBitFlips(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> flip(n + 1, 0);
        int flip_count = 0, result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            flip_count ^= flip[i];
            
            if (nums[i] == flip_count) {
                if (i + k > n) {
                    return -1;
                }
                flip_count ^= 1;
                flip[i + k] ^= 1;
                ++result;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {0, 1, 0};
    int k = 1;
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.minKBitFlips(nums, k) << endl;  // Output: 2
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm iterates through the array `nums` once, resulting in a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- The additional space complexity is `O(n)` due to the flip array.

This approach ensures efficient processing of the array with minimal overhead, meeting problem constraints effectively.
