[Leetcode 2903. Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2903)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to return all indices `i` such that `i` is equal to `nums[i]`. Return the list of indices in ascending order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we return if there are no indices that satisfy the condition?
   - **A:** We should return an empty list.
   
2. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers or duplicates?
   - **A:** The problem doesn't specify that the input will contain negative numbers or duplicates, but we can assume typical integer array constraints unless explicitly stated otherwise.

3. **Q:** What is the size range of the input array `nums`?
   - **A:** The problem is theoretical, but typically LeetCode problems might include arrays from size 0 (empty) to 10^5 elements. We will write our solution with this size range in mind for performance considerations.

## Strategy

The problem requires us to identify all indices `i` such that the value at `nums[i]` is equal to `i`. This problem can be solved using a straightforward linear scan of the array.

Steps:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2. Iterate through the array with an index from 0 to the length of the array minus one.
3. For each index `i`, if `nums[i]` equals `i`, add `i` to the result list.
4. Return the result list.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> findIndicesWithIndexAndValueDifference(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == i) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Test case
    std::vector<int> nums = {0, 2, 2, 3, 4};
    std::vector<int> result = findIndicesWithIndexAndValueDifference(nums);

    std::cout << "Indices: ";
    for (int index : result) {
        std::cout << index << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are traversing the array once to check the condition for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) auxiliary space, excluding the space required for the output list. The space complexity for the output list is O(k), where `k` is the number of indices that satisfy the condition `nums[i] == i`.

The above solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a single pass through the array to achieve the desired result.
