[Leetcode 1674. Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1674)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 1674: Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary**

You are given an integer array `nums` of even length `n` and an integer `limit`. In one move, you can replace any integer from `nums` with another integer between `1` and `limit`, inclusive.

The array `nums` is called complementary if for all indices `i` (`0 <= i < n / 2`), `nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]` equals the same number. 

Return the minimum number of moves required to make the array `nums` complementary.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in the array always within the bounds 1 to `limit`?**
   - Yes, all elements in the array are within the range from 1 to `limit`.

2. **Is the length of the array always even?**
   - Yes, the length of the array `n` is always even.

3. **What is the range of values for `n` and `limit`?**
   - Typical constraints are `1 <= nums[i], limit <= 10^5` and `2 <= n <= 10^5`.

### Strategy

The problem is essentially trying to find how many moves are needed to make the sums of pairs from the two ends of the array (`nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]`) the same.

1. **Observation**: For each pair `(nums[i], nums[n - 1 - i])`, their sum can lie between `2` (minimum sum 1+1) and `2 * limit` (maximum sum `limit + limit`).

2. **Approach**: 
   - Use a sweep-line algorithm or differential array.
   - For each pair `(a,b)`, determine ranges of sums and how many changes are needed:
     - Minimum possible sum: `2`
     - Maximum possible sum: `2 * limit`
     - For a given pair `(a, b)`, the sum ranges from `min(a + b)` to `max(a + b)` with different strategies to determine the changes needed to reach each possible sum.
     - Maintain `delta` array where `delta[sum]` records net changes needed.

3. **Delta Array Operations**:
   - Initialize a delta array of size `2 * limit + 2`.
   - Traverse through each pair `(nums[i], nums[n - 1 - i])` to update the delta array.
   - Calculate minimum moves from the delta array.

By the end:
   - Traverse the delta array to compute the cumulative sum and find the minimal move at each point.

### Code

Here is how we can implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int minMoves(std::vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> delta(2 * limit + 2, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
        int a = nums[i], b = nums[n - 1 - i];
        int low = std::min(a, b) + 1;
        int high = std::max(a, b) + limit + 1;
        
        delta[2] += 2;  // Every sum starts needing 2 changes
        delta[low] -= 1; // Becoming valid sum, one less change
        delta[low + a + b] -= 1; // Becoming sum of the specific pair, one less change
        delta[a + b + 1] += 1; // Exceeding specific pair sum, one more change
        delta[high] += 1; // Exceeding max valid sum, one more change
    }
    
    int result = INT_MAX, current = 0;
    for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * limit; ++i) {
        current += delta[i];
        result = std::min(result, current);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 4, 3};
    int limit = 4;
    std::cout << "Minimum moves: " << minMoves(nums, limit) << std::endl;  // Output should be 1
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the delta array**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- **Processing the delta array**: O(limit) to find the minimal move.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + limit), which is efficient given the constraints.
