[Leetcode 2824. Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2824)
### Problem Statement

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:** 
   - What is the range and limit of the integer values in `nums` and the `target`?
   - Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - Are there any duplicate numbers in `nums`?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function only count pairs without returning the pairs themselves?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to count all pairs `(i, j)` such that the sum of the elements at these indices is less than `target`. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Use a nested loop to check every possible pair.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, where `0 <= i < j < n`, check if `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.
   - If the condition holds true, increment the count.

2. **Optimized Approach (Optional for Interview):**
   - Sort the array `nums`.
   - Use two pointers to find pairs in a more efficient way than the brute force approach.
   - One pointer starts at the beginning (left) and the other at the end (right).
   - Move the pointers towards each other based on the sum comparison with the `target`.

Given typical constraints in coding interviews, starting with the brute force solution to illustrate understanding and then optimizing if required is a good approach.

### Code

Here's the brute force solution to count the pairs:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairsLessThanTarget(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] < target) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force Approach:** 
  - **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) because we use two nested loops each running up to `n`.
  - **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we only use a few extra variables for the count and loop indices.

### Discussion

- The brute force approach is straightforward and easy to understand but may not be efficient for very large arrays.
- If higher efficiency is required, sorting and using a two-pointer technique can reduce the time complexity, usually to \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting and \(O(n)\) for the two-pointer traversal, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\) overall.

Would you need the optimized solution with two pointers as well?
