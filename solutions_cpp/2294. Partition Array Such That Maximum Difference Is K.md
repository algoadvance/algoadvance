[Leetcode 2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2294)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, partition the array into the minimum number of subsequences such that the difference between the maximum and minimum element in each subsequence is at most `k`.

Return the minimum number of subsequences needed.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the expected output if the array contains only one element?
   - **A:** With one element, the difference between max and min is zero, so the answer would be 1 subsequence.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the range of the numbers in the `nums` array?
   - **A:** The problem description does not provide specific constraints, but typical LeetCode constraints apply, such as reasonable sizes and integer values.

3. **Q:** Is the input array guaranteed to contain at least one element?
   - **A:** Yes, as per typical problem constraints unless stated otherwise.

4. **Q:** Can the same number appear multiple times in the array?
   - **A:** Yes, the same number can appear multiple times in the array.

## Strategy
We need to partition the array such that the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum element in each partition is at most `k`. Generally, sorting the array first helps in minimizing the number of partitions because we can then sequentially group the closest elements together.

**Steps:**
1. Sort the array `nums`.
2. Initialize counters for the number of partitions and the start of the current partition.
3. Traverse the array from the start, and for each element:
   - If the difference between the current element and the start of the current partition exceeds `k`, then:
     - Increment the partition count.
     - Start a new partition from the current element.
4. Return the partition count.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int partitionArray(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int partitions = 1;
        int start = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] - start > k) {
                ++partitions;
                start = nums[i];
            }
        }

        return partitions;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Linear Scan:** The traversal of the sorted array takes \(O(n)\).
- **Total:** The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
