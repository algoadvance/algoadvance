[Leetcode 2259. Remove Digit From Number to Maximize Result](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2259)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `number` representing a positive integer and a character `digit`. Your task is to remove **exactly one occurrence** of `digit` from `number` so that the resulting value is the **largest possible**.

Return the resulting string representing the largest possible value.

#### Example
- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: number = "123", digit = "3"
  Output: "12"
  ```
- Example 2:
  ```
  Input: number = "1231", digit = "1"
  Output: "231"
  ```
- Example 3:
  ```
  Input: number = "551", digit = "5"
  Output: "51"
  ```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can `digit` appear multiple times in `number`?
   **A**: Yes, `digit` can appear multiple times in `number`.
   
2. **Q**: What constraints should we consider regarding the length of `number`?
   **A**: Typically, constraints would be mentioned in the problem. Assuming reasonable constraints (like `number` not longer than `10‚Åµ`).

3. **Q**: Is the input always a valid positive integer string and a single digit character?
   **A**: Yes, the input constraints ensure `number` is a non-empty string of digits (`'0'`-`'9'`) and `digit` is a single character digit (`'0'`-`'9'`).

### Strategy
1. Iterate over the string `number` and identify all occurrences of `digit`.
2. For every identified occurrence, create a new potential result by removing that occurrence of `digit`.
3. Track the maximum value string seen so far.
4. Return the maximum value string after all iterations.

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <string>

std::string removeDigit(std::string number, char digit) {
    std::string maxResult = "";
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < number.size(); ++i) {
        if (number[i] == digit) {
            // Create a new string without the i-th occurrence of 'digit'
            std::string newNumber = number.substr(0, i) + number.substr(i + 1);
            
            // Check if it's the largest we've seen
            if (newNumber > maxResult) {
                maxResult = newNumber;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxResult;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the length of `number`:
- We iterate over `number` once, so \(O(n)\).
- For each digit removal, we perform string concatenation, which in the worst case takes \(O(n)\).

### Edge Cases
- When `digit` appears at the beginning, middle, or end of the string.
- Handling large sizes of `number` efficiently.

### Testing
We should test the function with the following cases:
1. Single occurrence of `digit`.
2. Multiple occurrences of `digit`.
3. `number` being at its minimal size (e.g., "1" and `digit`="1").

This provides a robust check across the range of expected inputs.
