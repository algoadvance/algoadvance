[Leetcode 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l108)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?**
   - Typically, the array size is within the range of typical interview problems and should efficiently fit in memory.
   
2. **Is the array guaranteed to have unique elements?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, it's assumed that all elements in the sorted array are unique.
   
3. **What should be the return structure of the function?**
   - The function should return the root of the resulting height-balanced BST.

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - To create a height-balanced BST, the middle element of the array/subarray should be used as the root. 
   - The left half of the array will form the left subtree, and the right half will form the right subtree.
   - Recursively repeat this process for each subtree.

2. **Steps**:
   - Find the middle element of the array.
   - Create a new tree node with the middle element as the root.
   - Recursively do the same for the left subarray to get the left child and the right subarray to get the right child.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This follows because every element in the array is processed once.
- The space complexity is \(O(\log n)\) due to the recursion stack depth, given the balanced nature of the tree.

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation for converting a sorted array to a height-balanced BST:

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        return sortedArrayToBSTHelper(nums, 0, nums.size() - 1);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBSTHelper(const std::vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left > right) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // Find the middle element of the current subarray
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        // Create a tree node with the middle element
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        
        // Recursively build the left and right subtrees
        node->left = sortedArrayToBSTHelper(nums, left, mid - 1);
        node->right = sortedArrayToBSTHelper(nums, mid + 1, right);
        
        return node;
    }
};
```

This implementation ensures that the BST is height-balanced by picking the middle element of the current array/subarray to be the root of the tree. The left and right components are handled recursively to form subtrees.
