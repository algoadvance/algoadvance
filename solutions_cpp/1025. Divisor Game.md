[Leetcode 1025. Divisor Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1025)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

1. Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
2. Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the value of `N`?
   - Yes. Typically, `1 <= N <= 1000`.

2. Should we account for any specific input verification or can we assume the input is always valid?
   - We can assume the input is always valid as per usual LeetCode problem constraints.

## Strategy

To determine whether Alice wins given she starts first, we can consider the parity of `N`:

1. **If N is even:** 
    - Alice can always choose `x=1`, which would make `N` an odd number for Bob's turn.
    - An odd number always has at least one divisor `1`, and following this strategy, Bob would eventually have to deal with an even number, switching back to Alice in a better position.
    - Thus, Alice can always maintain a winning position by forcing Bob to play an odd `N`.

2. **If N is odd:**
    - Any move Alice makes would result in Bob dealing with an even number (since subtracting an odd number from an odd number results in an even number).
    - Given the same strategy, Bob can always ensure Alice faces an odd number in subsequent turns until Alice loses.

This pattern suggests that Alice wins if and only if `N` is even.

## Code

Here is the implementation following the described strategy:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool divisorGame(int N) {
        return N % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(1)** since we are just checking the parity of the number, which is a constant time operation.

This solution effectively utilizes the observation about even and odd numbers in this specific game context, ensuring optimal performance.
