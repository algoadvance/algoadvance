[Leetcode 1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1722)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `source` and `target`, both of length `n`. You are also given an array `allowedSwaps` where each `allowedSwaps[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you can swap the elements at index `ai` and index `bi` of the `source` array any number of times.

The Hamming distance between two arrays of the same length is the number of positions where the elements are different.

Return the minimum Hamming distance between `source` and `target` after performing any number of swaps in `allowedSwaps`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `source` and `target` arrays?**
   - Both arrays have the same length, denoted as `n`.
   - `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

2. **What are the constraints on the values within `source` and `target`?**
   - The elements of `source` and `target` are integers between `1` and `10^5`.

3. **What about the length of `allowedSwaps`?**
   - `0 <= allowedSwaps.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= ai, bi < n`

4. **Can indices in `allowedSwaps` be repeated or have self-loops?**
   - Yes, indices can be repeated and can have self-loops though self-loops don't affect the output.

### Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**
   - Use Union-Find to group indices that can be swapped among each other.
   - Each group will then contain indices that can be permuted freely.

2. **Map Elements in Groups**
   - For each group of indices found using Union-Find, count the frequencies of the elements both in `source` and `target`.
   - The minimum Hamming distance can be computed by comparing these frequencies.

### Time Complexity

- Building the Union-Find data structure: O(`n + k*α(n)`) where `k` is the length of `allowedSwaps` and `α` is the inverse Ackermann function.
- Grouping and counting elements: O(`n log n`)
- Comparing frequency count: O(`n`)

Overall, the time complexity is O(`n log n`), which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 1) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x]) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    void unionSet(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;
};

int minimumHammingDistance(vector<int>& source, vector<int>& target, vector<vector<int>>& allowedSwaps) {
    int n = source.size();
    UnionFind uf(n);
    
    // apply union operations for all swaps
    for (const auto& swap : allowedSwaps) {
        uf.unionSet(swap[0], swap[1]);
    }
    
    unordered_map<int, unordered_multiset<int>> sourceGroups;
    unordered_map<int, unordered_multiset<int>> targetGroups;
    
    // group elements by their root representative
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int root = uf.find(i);
        sourceGroups[root].insert(source[i]);
        targetGroups[root].insert(target[i]);
    }
    
    int minHammingDistance = 0;
    
    // compute minimum Hamming distance by comparing frequencies in groups
    for (const auto& pair : sourceGroups) {
        auto& sourceGroup = pair.second;
        auto& targetGroup = targetGroups[pair.first];
        
        for (const auto& elem : targetGroup) {
            auto it = sourceGroup.find(elem);
            if (it != sourceGroup.end()) {
                sourceGroup.erase(it);
            } else {
                minHammingDistance++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return minHammingDistance;
}
```

This solution leverages the Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage and group indices that can be swapped among themselves. It calculates the minimal Hamming distance by processing each group of swappable indices separately.
