[Leetcode 1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1608)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of non-negative integers. `nums` is considered special if there exists a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`. Notice that `x` does not have to be an element in `nums`.

Return `x` if the array is special, otherwise return `-1`. It can be proven that if `nums` is special, then there is a unique `x` that satisfies the condition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What range of values can the elements of `nums` take?
   **A**: The elements in `nums` are non-negative integers, i.e., they can range from `0` to a large positive value subject to the problem constraints.

2. **Q**: What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   **A**: The size of `nums` can vary, but usually, in such problems, we can expect it to follow standard constraints like up to `10^4` elements unless specified otherwise.

3. **Q**: Is there any specific edge case we need to consider?
   **A**: Edge cases could include an empty array or an array with all elements being the same.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. This allows us to easily determine how many numbers are greater than or equal to any given number.

2. **Iterate and Check**: Iterate through the array to check at each position if the count of elements greater than or equal to the current element matches the condition.

3. **Binary Search Optimization**: Since the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search to optimize the check for the condition if required.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int specialArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            auto it = std::lower_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), i);
            int count = nums.end() - it;
            if (count == i) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We sort `nums` to make it easier to find the count of elements greater than or equal to a given value.
2. **Iteration**: We iterate through possible values of `x` from `0` to `n` (length of `nums`).
3. **Count Check**: Use `std::lower_bound` to find the first element not less than `i`. The number of elements greater than or equal to `i` is then calculated by `nums.end() - it`.
4. **Return Result**: If `count == i`, then we return `i` as it satisfies the condition. If no such `i` is found, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
2. **Iteration with Lower Bound**: Each call to `lower_bound` is \(O(\log n)\). Hence, iterating from `0` to `n` results in \(O(n \log n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient enough for typical input sizes in competitive programming.
