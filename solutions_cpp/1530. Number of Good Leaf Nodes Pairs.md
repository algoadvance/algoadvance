[Leetcode 1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1530)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance, return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

A pair of two different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the shortest path between them is less than or equal to distance.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints on the binary tree, such as the number of nodes or the range of node values?
2. **Leaf Nodes Definition**: Are leaf nodes explicitly defined as nodes with no children?
3. **Distance Metric**: Is the distance between nodes the number of edges in the shortest path?
4. **Node Values**: Do node values play any role in determining the pairs, or are they irrelevant?

Iâ€™ll proceed with the interpretation that:
- Leaf nodes have no children.
- The distance refers to the number of edges in the path.
- The number of tree nodes can be up to 1000, as per typical problem constraints in such competitive programming problems.

## Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Traverse the tree using a DFS approach.
   - For each node, recursively find the distances to all leaf nodes in its subtrees.

2. **Distance Aggregation**:
   - Maintain a list of counts of leaf nodes at each distance for the left and right subtrees.
   - For a given node, combine the distances from its left and right subtrees to determine the number of good leaf pairs.

3. **Combining Distances**:
   - For each pair of distances \(i\) and \(j\) from the left and right subtree, check if \(i + j + 2 \leq \text{distance}\). (The `+2` accounts for the path going up to the current node and down to the leaf in the other subtree.)

4. **Accumulate Results**:
   - Accumulate the number of valid pairs.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \(O(n \cdot d)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes and \(d\) is the distance.
   - The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot d)\) due to the storage used for distance aggregation per node.

## Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(TreeNode* root, int distance) {
        int count = 0;
        dfs(root, distance, count);
        return count;
    }

private:
    vector<int> dfs(TreeNode* node, int distance, int &count) {
        if (!node) return {};
        
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            // Leaf node case, return a vector with one element: [1] representing distance 0 (itself).
            return {1};
        }
        
        vector<int> leftDistances = dfs(node->left, distance, count);
        vector<int> rightDistances = dfs(node->right, distance, count);
        
        // Count all pairs of distances from the left and right subtrees.
        for (int ld : leftDistances) {
            for (int rd : rightDistances) {
                if (ld + rd + 2 <= distance) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> currentDistances;
        // Collect current distances
        for (int ld : leftDistances) {
            if (ld + 1 <= distance) {
                currentDistances.push_back(ld + 1);
            }
        }
        for (int rd : rightDistances) {
            if (rd + 1 <= distance) {
                currentDistances.push_back(rd + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return currentDistances;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot d)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes and \(d\) is the given distance.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot d)\) for maintaining the distances from root to leaves.

This approach ensures we capture the required leaf-node pairs efficiently and within the problem's constraints.
