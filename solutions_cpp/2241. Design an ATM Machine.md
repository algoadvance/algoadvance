[Leetcode 2241. Design an ATM Machine](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2241)
### Problem Statement

Design an ATM machine that supports the following operations:

1. `deposit(int banknotesCount[])`:
   - Takes a list of integers representing the number of banknotes to deposit at the ATM.
   - The order of denominations is `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`.

2. `withdraw(int amount)`:
   - Attempts to withdraw the given amount of money from the ATM.
   - Returns a list of integers representing the number of each banknote type used to fulfill the withdrawal, or `[-1]` if it is not possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the banknotes always represented in the order `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`?**
   - Yes.

2. **What should be the initial state of the ATM in terms of banknotes?**
   - The ATM should start with zero banknotes of each denomination.

3. **Do we need to handle large values of deposit/withdrawal requests efficiently?**
   - Yes. The solution should be efficient.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use an array of size 5 to hold the count of each type of banknote present in the ATM, maintaining the order `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`.

2. **Deposit Operation**:
   - Simply add the counts from the input array to the corresponding counts in the ATM's array.

3. **Withdraw Operation**:
   - Starting from the highest denomination, attempt to dispense the required number of banknotes until the desired amount is met.
   - If it is not possible to dispense the exact amount, return `[-1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <array>

class ATM {
private:
    std::array<long long, 5> banknotesCount; // Use long long to avoid overflow

public:
    ATM() {
        banknotesCount = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
    }

    void deposit(std::vector<int> banknotesCountInput) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
            banknotesCount[i] += banknotesCountInput[i];
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> withdraw(int amount) {
        std::array<int, 5> banknotesToUse = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
        std::array<int, 5> denominations = {20, 50, 100, 200, 500};

        for (int i = 4; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (amount >= denominations[i] && banknotesCount[i] > 0) {
                int numNotes = amount / denominations[i];
                numNotes = std::min((long long)numNotes, banknotesCount[i]);
                amount -= numNotes * denominations[i];
                banknotesToUse[i] = numNotes;
            }
        }

        if (amount != 0) {
            return {-1};  // Indicating failure to withdraw exact amount
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
            banknotesCount[i] -= banknotesToUse[i];
        }

        return std::vector<int>(banknotesToUse.begin(), banknotesToUse.end());
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Deposit Operation**:
   - Time Complexity: O(1), as it involves adding five elements.

2. **Withdraw Operation**:
   - Time Complexity: O(1), because it involves iterating over a fixed number of five denominations.

This complexity allows for efficient handling of both deposit and withdrawal operations.
