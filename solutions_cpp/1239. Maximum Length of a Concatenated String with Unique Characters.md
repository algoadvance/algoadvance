[Leetcode 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1239)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `arr`. A string `s` is formed by concatenating a subsequence of `arr` that has unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of `s`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 16`
- `1 <= arr[i].length <= 26`
- `arr[i]` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input strings in `arr` contain duplicate characters?** 
   - No, each string in `arr` contains only unique characters as specified in the initial problem statements.
   
2. **What should the function return if no unique string can be formed?**
   - Technically, this situation won't occur since every string in `arr` has only unique characters, and the problem constraints ensure that.

3. **Is there any upper bound on the length of strings in `arr`?**
   - Yes, the maximum length of any string in `arr` is 26.

## Strategy

To tackle this problem, we will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible subsequences of the input array `arr` and keep track of the length of the string formed with unique characters. If at any point the characters in the concatenated string are not unique any more, we discard that path and backtrack.

### Steps:
1. Iterate over all elements of the array.
2. Use a helper function for backtracking and recursion.
3. In each recursive call, check if adding the current string keeps the characters unique.
4. Track the maximum length of a valid unique-character string.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxLength(vector<string>& arr) {
        return backtrack(arr, "", 0);
    }

private:
    int backtrack(vector<string>& arr, string current, int index) {
        // If the current string has duplicate characters, return 0
        if (!isUnique(current)) return 0;

        // Initialize the max length with the length of the current string
        int maxLength = current.length();

        // Explore further concatenations
        for (int i = index; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, backtrack(arr, current + arr[i], i + 1));
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    bool isUnique(const string& s) {
        unordered_set<char> chars;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (chars.count(c)) {
                return false; // Duplicate character found
            }
            chars.insert(c);
        }
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<string> arr = {"un", "iq", "ue"};
    cout << sol.maxLength(arr) << endl; // Output: 4 ("uniq")

    arr = {"cha","r","act","ers"};
    cout << sol.maxLength(arr) << endl; // Output: 6 ("chaers")

    arr = {"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"};
    cout << sol.maxLength(arr) << endl; // Output: 26

    arr = {"aa","bb"};
    cout << sol.maxLength(arr) << endl; // Output: 0

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Backtracking Approach**: Since we are generating all possible subsequences of the array `arr`:
  - The complexity is \(O(2^N)\) due to the exponential number of subsets where \(N\) is the length of `arr`.
  - In each subset's concatenation step, verifying the uniqueness of characters takes \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the average length of the string being checked.
- **Overall Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot 2^N)\) where \(N\) is the length of the input array `arr`.

This exponential time complexity is feasible given the constraint \(1 \leq arr.length \leq 16\).
