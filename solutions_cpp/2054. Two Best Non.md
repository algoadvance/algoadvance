[Leetcode 2054. Two Best Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2054)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `events` where `events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei]`, you need to determine the maximum sum of values of any two non-overlapping events. Two events are considered non-overlapping if the end time of one event is less than the start time of the other event.

Return the maximum sum of the values of any two non-overlapping events.

### Example
- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
  Output: 4
  Explanation: Pick the events (1, 3, 2) and (4, 5, 2).
  ```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be multiple non-overlapping intervals?**
   - Yes, but we need to find only the maximum sum of values of any two non-overlapping intervals.

2. **Can the events have the same time intervals?**
   - Events in the input do not necessarily have unique time intervals.

3. **What is the range of values for `startTime`, `endTime`, and `value`?**
   - It is not explicitly mentioned, but typically these values are within standard integer range.

4. **Would there be any empty input case?**
   - Typically not, we assume the input list will always have at least two events.

## Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **Sort Events**: First, sort the events by their end time.
2. **Use a Max Heap / Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (max-heap) to keep track of the maximum event values encountered up to a given point.
3. **Iterate Through Events**: As we iterate through each event, for each event determine if it can be combined with any previous event to form a non-overlapping pair.
4. **Tracking the Best Value**: Maintain a variable to keep track of the highest possible value sum of any two non-overlapping events encountered so far.

### Steps:
1. Sort the list of events by their end time.
2. Use a priority queue to keep track of the maximum value of an event up to a point in time.
3. Iterate through the sorted events and for each event, check if it can be combined with any previous non-overlapping event. Update the maximum sum accordingly.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the events takes `O(n log n)`.
- Iterating through the events and maintaining the heap will take `O(n log n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

## Code
Here's a possible implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int maxTwoEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
    // Sort events by the end time
    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[1] < b[1];
    });
    
    int maxSum = 0;
    int bestEventValue = 0;
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq; // max-heap -> stores (value, end time)
    
    for (auto& event : events) {
        int start = event[0];
        int end = event[1];
        int value = event[2];
        
        // Remove events from the heap that end after the current event starts
        while (!pq.empty() && pq.top().second >= start) {
            pq.pop();
        }
        
        // If there exists a previous event that does not overlap
        if (!pq.empty()) {
            // Calculate the potential maximum sum
            maxSum = max(maxSum, pq.top().first + value);
        }
        
        // Update the bestEventValue
        bestEventValue = max(bestEventValue, value);
        
        // Insert the current event into the heap
        pq.push({ value, end });
    }
    
    return maxSum;
}
```

This implementation efficiently finds the maximum sum of two non-overlapping events by making use of sorting and a priority queue to maintain the highest value non-overlapping event seen so far.
