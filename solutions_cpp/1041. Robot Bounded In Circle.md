[Leetcode 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1041)
### Problem Statement
From LeetCode Problem 1041: "Robot Bounded In Circle"

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:
- `G` (go straight 1 unit),
- `L` (turn 90 degrees to the left),
- `R` (turn 90 degrees to the right).

The robot performs the instructions given in a sequence repeatedly forever. Determine if there is a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

The robot ends up bounded in a circle if and only if there are only two types of configurations:
1. The robot returns to the origin `(0, 0)` after one cycle of instructions, or
2. The robot doesn't return to the origin but doesn't end up facing north after one cycle of instructions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the sequence be empty?**
   - No, the sequence will always contain at least one instruction.
2. **Can the sequence contain invalid characters?**
   - No, the sequence will only consist of the characters `G`, `L`, and `R`.
3. **What are the limits on the length of the instruction sequence?**
   - The length of the instruction sequence ranges from `1` to `100`.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Configuration**: The robot starts at the coordinate `(0, 0)` facing north, which we will represent by `(0, 1)` direction.
2. **Simulation**:
   - Track the position of the robot using coordinates `(x, y)`.
   - Track the direction using a tuple `(dx, dy)`. Initialize with north `(0, 1)`.
   - Apply the instructions once.
   - Evaluate if either:
     - The robot is back at the origin `(0, 0)`, or
     - The robot is not facing north `(0, 1)` after processing the instructions. This would ensure that over repeated executions, the robot will eventually form a loop.

### Time Complexity
- We iterate through the sequence of moves once, doing constant-time operations in each iteration. Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the instruction sequence.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
        // Starting coordinates (x, y) and facing direction (dx, dy) north (0, 1)
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        int dx = 0, dy = 1;
        
        // Iterate through the instructions
        for (char instruction : instructions) {
            if (instruction == 'G') {
                x += dx;
                y += dy;
            } else if (instruction == 'L') {
                // Turn left: (0,1) -> (-1,0) -> (0,-1) -> (1,0) -> (0,1)
                int temp = dx;
                dx = -dy;
                dy = temp;
            } else if (instruction == 'R') {
                // Turn right: (0,1) -> (1,0) -> (0,-1) -> (-1,0) -> (0,1)
                int temp = dx;
                dx = dy;
                dy = -temp;
            } 
        }
        
        // Check if the robot returns to the origin or is not facing north
        return (x == 0 && y == 0) || !(dx == 0 && dy == 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    // Test case example
    string instructions = "GGLLGG";
    cout << (solution.isRobotBounded(instructions) ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
This solution effectively checks both conditions mentioned: returning to the origin or changing direction from the initial north facing. This ensures the robot will be bounded in a circle based on repeating instructions.
