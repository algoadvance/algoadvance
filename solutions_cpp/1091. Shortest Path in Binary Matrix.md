[Leetcode 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1091)
### Problem Statement
Given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return `-1`.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (0, 0) to the bottom-right cell (n-1, n-1) such that:
1. All the visited cells of the path are `0`.
2. All adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and share an edge or a corner).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the start or end cells be `1`?**
   - No, if either the start or the end cell is `1`, there is no valid path.

2. **What are the possible grid sizes?**
   - The grid is an `n x n` matrix where `1 <= n <= 100`.

3. **What does it mean by 8-directional movement?**
   - It means you can move up, down, left, right, or along the diagonals. Thus, from any cell `(i,j)`, you can move to `(i+1,j)`, `(i-1,j)`, `(i,j+1)`, `(i,j-1)`, `(i+1,j+1)`, `(i-1,j-1)`, `(i+1,j-1)`, and `(i-1,j+1)`.

### Strategy
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach is suitable due to the shortest path requirement in an unweighted grid.
- We'll use a queue to explore each cell level-wise, starting from the top-left corner.
- We'll also keep track of visited cells to prevent cycles and repeated work.
- If we reach the bottom-right corner, we'll return the count of moves made.
- If the queue is exhausted without reaching the end, we'll return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        
        // Check the initial and final cell
        if (grid[0][0] != 0 || grid[n-1][n-1] != 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1}};
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        
        q.push({0, 0});
        grid[0][0] = 1; // mark as visited and start path length at 1
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            int path_length = grid[x][y];
            q.pop();
            
            // Check if we've reached the bottom-right corner
            if (x == n-1 && y == n-1) {
                return path_length;
            }
            
            for (auto dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0];
                int ny = y + dir[1];
                
                if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < n && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] == 0) {
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                    grid[nx][ny] = path_length + 1; // mark as visited with distance
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If we exhaust the queue without finding a path
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
  - Each cell is enqueued and dequeued exactly once.
  - Checking all 8 possible moves from each cell takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
  - To store the queue and the visited status of each cell.
