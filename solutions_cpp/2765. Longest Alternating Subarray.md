### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2765: Longest Alternating Subarray

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the length of the longest subarray with alternating even and odd numbers. An alternating subarray starts with an even number and alternates between even and odd numbers until the end.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Size**: What is the range of the size of the `nums` array?
   - Typically, constraints on the problem will define this, but we will assume it can be reasonably large (potentially up to \(10^5\) elements).

2. **Data Range**: What values can the integers in the array take?
   - Usually not an issue, but integers are assumed to cover the typical range of 32-bit integers.

3. **Output**: Are we just returning the length of the longest alternating subarray, or do we need to return the subarray itself?
   - The problem asks only for the length of the longest alternating subarray.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize variables to store the maximum length (`max_len`) found so far.
   - Another variable to keep track of the current length (`curr_len`) of the alternating subarray as we traverse the array.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Iterate through the array starting from the first element.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements, check if one is even and the other is odd.
   - If the pair alternates, increase the `curr_len`.
   - If not, compare `curr_len` to `max_len` to update the latter if necessary, then reset `curr_len`.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - Single element arrays and arrays without any alternating pattern should be considered. 

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, a final comparison between `curr_len` and `max_len` is necessary to check if the longest alternating subarray ends at the last element.

### Time Complexity

- **O(N)**: We need to make a single pass through the array to determine the longest alternating subarray. 

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int longestAlternatingSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    
    if (n == 0) return 0; // edge case: empty array
    
    int max_len = 1; // Minimum length of an alternating subarray is 1
    int curr_len = 1; // Starting with the first element
    
    // Traverse through the array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((nums[i-1] % 2 == 0 && nums[i] % 2 != 0) || (nums[i-1] % 2 != 0 && nums[i] % 2 == 0)) {
            // They alternate
            curr_len++;
        } else {
            // They do not alternate, update max_len and reset curr_len
            max_len = max(max_len, curr_len);
            curr_len = 1; // Start a new subarray from the current element
        }
    }
    
    // Final check in case the longest subarray ends at the last element
    max_len = max(max_len, curr_len);
    
    return max_len;
}
```

In this implementation, we leverage a single pass through the input array while maintaining counts of alternating subarray lengths and adjusting as necessary. This solution handles the primary task efficiently with linear complexity.
