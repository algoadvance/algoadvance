[Leetcode 1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1689)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `n` that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to `n`.

A deci-binary number is a number consisting of digits 0 and 1 only, without any leading zeros. For example, `101` and `110` are deci-binary numbers, but `112` and `3001` are not.

**Example:**
1. Input: `n = "32"`
   Output: `3`
2. Input: `n = "82734"`
   Output: `8`
3. Input: `n = "27346209830709182346"`
   Output: `9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string `n` contain leading zeros?
   - No, since `n` represents a positive integer, it will have no leading zeros.
2. What is the length constraint of the input string?
   - The length of `n` can be up to `10^5` digits.

## Strategy
The minimum number of deci-binary numbers required to sum up to `n` is equal to the maximum digit in the string `n`. This is because each deci-binary number can only contribute 1 to each of its digit positions in the sum.

### Steps:
1. Read through each character in the string `n`.
2. Track the highest digit encountered.
3. Return this highest digit as the result.

By following these steps, we ensure that the solution leverages the properties of deci-binary numbers, making it both efficient and straightforward.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the length of the string `n`.
- This is because we need to scan through each character of the string exactly once.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(std::string n) {
        char max_digit = '0';
        for(char ch : n) {
            if(ch > max_digit) {
                max_digit = ch;
            }
            // Optimization: if we found '9', we can return immediately as 9 is the max in decimal.
            if(max_digit == '9') {
                return 9;
            }
        }
        return max_digit - '0';
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::string input;
    std::cout << "Enter the number string: ";
    std::cin >> input;
    int result = solution.minPartitions(input);
    std::cout << "Minimum number of deci-binary numbers: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code implements the above strategy efficiently. It iterates through the string `n` to find the maximum digit and returns it, which determines the minimum number of deci-binary numbers required.
