[Leetcode 679. 24 Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l679)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of four integers `cards` where each card has a value between 1 and 9. You need to judge whether they could operate to get the value of 24 using the basic arithmetic operations `(+, -, *, /)` and each card must be used exactly once. You are allowed to use parentheses to change the order of operations.

Write a function that returns `true` if you can get the value 24, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the input array always contains exactly four integers, and all are in the range [1, 9] as described?**
   - Yes, the input will always meet these constraints.
   
2. **Is division supposed to be integer or floating-point division?**
   - Division should be floating-point.

3. **Can we combine any two numbers in any order and any operations?**
   - Yes, you can freely combine the numbers using the four operations and parentheses.

With these clarifications, let's proceed to the strategy.

## Strategy

We'll use a recursive approach to attempt every possible combination of operations and order of operations. The steps involved are:

1. **Base Case**: If the list has only one number, check if it equals 24 (account for floating-point precision errors).
2. **Recursive Case**: For each pair of numbers in the list, perform all four operations and then recursively call the function with the resulting list of three numbers. Repeat this until the list size is down to one number.
3. We must consider the precision issue while comparing floating-point numbers. We will use a small tolerance value (like 1e-6) for comparison.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    bool judgePoint24(std::vector<int>& cards) {
        std::vector<double> nums(cards.begin(), cards.end());
        return helper(nums);
    }

private:
    bool helper(std::vector<double>& nums) {
        // Base case: if there's only one number, check if it's 24 within a small tolerance
        if (nums.size() == 1) {
            return std::abs(nums[0] - 24.0) < 1e-6;
        }
        
        // Try all combinations of numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
                if (i != j) {
                    std::vector<double> nextNums;
                    for (int k = 0; k < nums.size(); ++k) {
                        if (k != i && k != j) nextNums.push_back(nums[k]);
                    }
                    
                    for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
                        if (k < 2 && j > i) continue;  // To avoid duplicate combinations for + and *.
                        
                        double opResult;
                        if (k == 0) opResult = nums[i] + nums[j];
                        if (k == 1) opResult = nums[i] * nums[j];
                        if (k == 2) opResult = nums[i] - nums[j];
                        if (k == 3 && nums[j] != 0) opResult = nums[i] / nums[j];
                        else if (k == 3) continue;

                        nextNums.push_back(opResult);
                        if (helper(nextNums)) return true;
                        nextNums.pop_back();  // Undo the push to try the next operation
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is quite complex to analyze due to the recursive branching, but it can be roughly considered exponential. In the worst case, it has to explore all possible combinations of numbers and operations, making the complexity approximate O(4^N * N!), where N is the number of cards (in this case, 4). However, due to aggressive pruning (not continuing when zero-division happens or repeated combinations with addition and multiplication), the practical runtime is manageable within typical input constraints.
