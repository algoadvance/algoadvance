[Leetcode 275. H](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l275)
### Problem Statement:

Imagine you have a sorted array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` represents the number of citations a researcher has received for their `i-th` paper. Your task is to compute the researcher's `h-index`.

The `h-index` is defined as follows:
- A scholar has an `index h` if `h` of their `N` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `N-h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

Given that the `citations` array is sorted in ascending order, design an algorithm to compute the `h-index`. 

You must write an efficient algorithm with a time complexity less than or equal to `O(log N)`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size for the citations array?
   - Typically, LeetCode problems handle arrays up to 10^5 elements.
   
2. **Type of Elements**: Are the elements in the citations array guaranteed to be integers?
   - The problem statement implies they will be.
   
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle cases where the citations array is empty?
   - If the array is empty, the `h-index` should be 0. 

With these clarifications, we're ready to devise a solution.

### Strategy:
Given the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search to find the h-index efficiently. The idea is to factor in the position of each paper in the array relative to its citation count, given the definition of the h-index.

1. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the start and end of the array.
   - For each middle element, compute if it can be the `h-index`.
   - Adjust the search based on whether the computed values meet the `h-index` criteria.

### Code:

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int n = citations.size();
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            // Number of papers with at least citations[mid] citations is (n - mid)
            if (citations[mid] == n - mid) {
                return citations[mid];
            } else if (citations[mid] < n - mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return n - left;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to the last index of the array.
2. Perform binary search until `left` exceeds `right`:
   - Calculate the mid-point of the array.
   - Determine if the citation count at `mid` index satisfies the condition of the `h-index` (i.e., there are at least `n - mid` papers with `citations[mid]` or more citations).
   - If true, return `citations[mid]`.
   - If `citations[mid]` is less than `n - mid`, it means there are not enough papers with at least `mid` citations, move the `left` pointer to mid + 1.
   - Otherwise, move the `right` pointer to mid - 1.
3. If no exact match is found, return `n - left`, which will be the h-index.

### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in `O(log N)` time because it uses binary search.
- Space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This efficient approach ensures that the `h-index` is computed quickly even for large arrays.
