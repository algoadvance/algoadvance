[Leetcode 2347. Best Poker Hand](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2347)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `ranks` and a character array `suits`. You have `5` cards where the `i-th` card has a rank of `ranks[i]` and a suit of `suits[i]`. Return the best possible "poker hand" that you can play with the given cards.

Here are the types of poker hands you can make, ordered from best to worst:

1. "Flush": Five cards of the same suit.
2. "Three of a Kind": Three cards of the same rank.
3. "Pair": Two cards of the same rank.
4. "High Card": Any single card.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is the input size always 5 cards?
   - Yes, the input size is always exactly 5 cards.

2. **Rank Range**: What is the range of card ranks?
   - Card ranks range from 1 to 13.

3. **Suit Range**: What are the possible values for the suits?
   - The suits can be 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'.

4. **Output Format**: What should the output be?
   - The output should be a string representing the best possible hand: "Flush", "Three of a Kind", "Pair", or "High Card".

### Strategy

1. **Check for Flush**: All 5 cards need to have the same suit.
2. **Check for Three of a Kind**: Any rank should appear at least 3 times.
3. **Check for Pair**: Any rank should appear at least 2 times.
4. **If None of the Above**: Return "High Card".

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

std::string bestHand(std::vector<int>& ranks, std::vector<char>& suits) {
    // Check for Flush
    if (std::count(suits.begin(), suits.end(), suits[0]) == 5) {
        return "Flush";
    }
    
    // Count ranks
    std::unordered_map<int, int> rank_count;
    for (int rank : ranks) {
        rank_count[rank]++;
    }
    
    // Check for Three of a Kind and Pair
    bool three_of_a_kind = false;
    bool pair = false;
    
    for (const auto& pair : rank_count) {
        if (pair.second >= 3) {
            three_of_a_kind = true;
        }
        if (pair.second >= 2) {
            pair = true;
        }
    }
    
    if (three_of_a_kind) {
        return "Three of a Kind";
    }
    
    if (pair) {
        return "Pair";
    }
    
    // If none of the above, return High Card
    return "High Card";
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Flush Check**: Checking all suits to see if they are the same takes `O(1)` because there are always exactly 5 suits.
- **Rank Count and Check**: Building the rank frequency map takes `O(5)`, or `O(1)` because the input size is constant. Checking the map also takes `O(1)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(1)`, which is efficient given the fixed input size.
