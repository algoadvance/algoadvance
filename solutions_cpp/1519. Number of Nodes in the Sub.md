[Leetcode 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1519)
### Problem Statement

Given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. The root of the tree is the node `0`, and each node has a label which is a lowercase character given in the string `labels` (where `labels[i]` is the label of the `i-th` node).

The tree is represented by an array `edges` of size `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the `i-th` node that have the same label as node `i`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the input arrays `edges` and `labels`?**
   - The length of `edges` will be `n - 1`, and the length of `labels` will be `n`.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the values of `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` will be up to a maximum of `10^5` based on common problem constraints for similar problems on LeetCode.
   
3. **Can the tree be unbalanced?**
   - Yes, the tree can be unbalanced.

4. **Are there duplicates in the labels?**
   - Yes, labels can be duplicated among the tree's nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
   
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Perform a DFS traversal to count occurrences of each label in the subtrees.
   - Use a `count` array where `count[i]` will store the frequency of label `i` in the subtree rooted at that node.
   - Use backtracking to merge counts from child nodes to their parents.

3. **Result Compilation**:
   - The result for each node will be derived from the `count` array updated during the DFS traversal.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countSubTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, string labels) {
        // Step 1: create the adjacency list for the tree
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        // Step 2: initialize the result vector and a visited vector
        vector<int> result(n, 0);
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);

        // Step 3: perform DFS from the root (node 0)
        dfs(0, adj, labels, visited, result);
        
        return result;
    }

private:
    vector<int> dfs(int node, vector<vector<int>>& adj, string& labels, vector<bool>& visited, vector<int>& result) {
        // Mark the current node as visited
        visited[node] = true;

        // count array to store frequency of each character in the subtree
        vector<int> count(26, 0);

        // increment the count for the current node's label
        count[labels[node] - 'a']++;

        // Traverse all its adjacent nodes
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                // Aggregate the count from the subtree of the neighbor
                vector<int> subCount = dfs(neighbor, adj, labels, visited, result);

                // Merge subCount into the current count
                for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
                    count[i] += subCount[i];
                }
            }
        }

        // Set the result for the current node
        result[node] = count[labels[node] - 'a'];
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
   - Building the adjacency list takes `O(n)` time.
   - The DFS traversal of the tree also takes `O(n)` time because each node and edge is visited once.
   
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
   - The adjacency list takes `O(n)` space.
   - The recursion stack depth is `O(n)` in the worst case of an unbalanced tree.
   - The `count` array and visited array also require `O(n)` space.
