[Leetcode 998. Maximum Binary Tree II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l998)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a maximum binary tree and a value to insert into the tree, you need to insert the value into the maximum binary tree and return the updated tree.

You can assume that the maximum binary tree is built using the following algorithm:
1. The root is the maximum number in the array.
2. The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the left part subarray divided by the maximum number.
3. The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from the right part subarray divided by the maximum number.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 100
- The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
- 0 <= val <= 100

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input/Output Format:**
   - **Input:** A TreeNode pointer representing the root of the tree, and an integer `val` representing the value to be inserted.
   - **Output:** Return the root of the modified tree.

2. **Behavior in corner cases:**
   - What should we do if the value to be inserted is smaller than all the values in the tree?
   - What should we do if the value to be inserted is larger than the current root value?

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - How exactly should we insert the value according to the problem statement rules?
   
## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll follow a recursive approach with the following steps:

1. If the value `val` is greater than the root value, then `val` becomes the new root.
2. If not, recursively work on the right subtree to insert `val` such that the maximum binary tree property is maintained.

### Detailed Steps:

1. Initialize a new node with the given value `val`.
2. Compare `val` with the root's value:
   - If `val` is greater than the root's value:
     - Create a new node with `val` and make the current tree the left subtree of this new node.
   - Else, recursively insert `val` into the right subtree of the current root.
3. Return the modified root of the tree.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode* root, int val) {
        if (!root || val > root->val) {
            TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(val);
            newNode->left = root;
            return newNode;
        }
        root->right = insertIntoMaxTree(root->right, val);
        return root;
    }
};

// Helper function to print in-order traversal of the tree (for verification)
void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
    if (root == nullptr)
        return;
    inOrderTraversal(root->left);
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    inOrderTraversal(root->right);
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(4, new TreeNode(3), nullptr);
    
    Solution sol;
    TreeNode* newRoot = sol.insertIntoMaxTree(root, 6);
    
    std::cout << "In-order traversal of the new tree: ";
    inOrderTraversal(newRoot);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, because in the worst case, we might have to traverse all the way down to the rightmost node (if `val` is the smallest) or even replace the entire tree (if `val` is the largest).
