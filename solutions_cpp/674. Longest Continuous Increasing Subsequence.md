[Leetcode 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l674)
## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

### Example:
```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, itâ€™s not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
```

### Example:
```
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the input numbers always integers?**
   - Yes, they are.
   
2. **Can the input contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes, the input can contain any integer values.
   
3. **What is the expected size of the input array?**
   - The size of the array can vary, typically within the constraints of typical online coding problems, might be up to 10^4.

4. **What should be returned if the input array is empty?**
   - If the input array is empty, the function should return 0.

## Strategy

This problem can be effectively solved using a single pass (O(n) time complexity) algorithm. We can maintain a variable to keep track of the current length of the increasing subsequence and another variable to store the maximum length found so far.

1. Initialize two variables, `maxLen` and `currLen`, to 1 since the minimum length for any subsequence with at least one element is 1.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
   - If the current element is larger than the previous element, increase `currLen` by 1.
   - Otherwise, compare `currLen` with `maxLen` and update `maxLen` if necessary, then reset `currLen` to 1.
3. After the loop, do a final comparison between `currLen` and `maxLen` in case the longest subsequence is at the end of the array.
4. Return `maxLen`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For std::max

class Solution {
public:
    int findLengthOfLCIS(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        
        int maxLen = 1;
        int currLen = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                ++currLen;
            } else {
                maxLen = std::max(maxLen, currLen);
                currLen = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Final comparison in case the longest sequence ends at the last element
        maxLen = std::max(maxLen, currLen);
        
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the size of the input array. This is because we only make a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
