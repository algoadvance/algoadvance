[Leetcode 1743. Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1743)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `adjacentPairs` representing the pairs of adjacent elements in an array. The array is duplicated exactly once in `adjacentPairs`.

For example, if `adjacentPairs` is `{{2,1},{3,4},{3,2}}`, then the array which was duplicated is `[1,2,3,4]` or `[4,3,2,1]`.

Return the original array before the duplication happened. The returned array's size should be `(adjacentPairs.length + 1)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of `adjacentPairs`?**
    - Yes, the length of `adjacentPairs` should be such that it forms a single contiguous array when restored.
  
2. **Can there be more than one solution?**
    - No, there will be exactly one valid solution.

3. **Are all input arrays guaranteed to be valid and form a single contiguous array?**
    - Yes, you can assume the input is guaranteed to form one contiguous valid array.

## Strategy

1. **Build an Adjacency List:**
    - Construct an adjacency list (a hashmap where each key (number) maps to a list of its adjacent numbers).

2. **Identify the Starting Point:**
    - Find the starting point of the array. The starting and ending points will be the elements that have only one adjacent pair.

3. **Restore the Array:**
    - Use the adjacency list to restore the array by starting from one of the endpoints and performing a depth-first search (DFS) or iterative traversal using the adjacency list.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <stdexcept> // For std::runtime_error

using namespace std;

vector<int> restoreArray(vector<vector<int>>& adjacentPairs) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adjList;
    
    // Construct the adjacency list
    for (const auto& pair : adjacentPairs) {
        adjList[pair[0]].push_back(pair[1]);
        adjList[pair[1]].push_back(pair[0]);
    }

    // Find the start of the array (it will have only one neighbor)
    int start = 0;
    for (const auto& item : adjList) {
        if (item.second.size() == 1) {
            start = item.first;
            break;
        }
    }

    // Restore the array
    vector<int> result;
    unordered_set<int> visited;
    int current = start;

    while (result.size() < adjList.size()) {
        result.push_back(current);
        visited.insert(current);

        for (int neighbor : adjList[current]) {
            if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                current = neighbor;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Adjacency List:** O(n)
    - We iterate through the `adjacentPairs` once to build the adjacency list.
  
- **Restoring the Array:** O(n)
    - We perform a single traversal through the list of unique elements.
  
Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of pairs in `adjacentPairs`. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the storage required for the adjacency list and visited set.
