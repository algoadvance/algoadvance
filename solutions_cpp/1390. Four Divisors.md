### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1390: Four Divisors

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. If there is no such integer in the array, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input array have negative numbers?
   **A:** No, the problem explicitly states the input array consists of positive integers.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum size of the input array?
   **A:** The array size can be up to \(10^4\), and the value of each integer in the array can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Q:** Should we consider the number itself and 1 as its divisors?
   **A:** Yes, 1 and the number itself are always considered divisors.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, our approach involves:

1. **Checking Each Number**: For each number in the array, we need to determine its divisors.
2. **Counting Divisors**: We need to count how many divisors each number has.
3. **Sum of Divisors**: If a number has exactly four divisors, add their sum to the total result.

**Steps**:
1. Iterate through each number in the input array.
2. For each number, find all its divisors up to the square root of the number (to avoid redundant checks).
3. Add the corresponding divisor pairs and count them.
4. If the number of divisors equals four, add their sum to the result.
5. Return the total sum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int sumFourDivisors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            vector<int> divisors;
            for (int i = 1; i <= sqrt(num); ++i) {
                if (num % i == 0) {
                    divisors.push_back(i);
                    if (i != num / i) { // Avoid adding the square root twice
                        divisors.push_back(num / i);
                    }
                }
                if (divisors.size() > 4) {
                    break; // No need to continue if already more than 4 divisors
                }
            }
            if (divisors.size() == 4) {
                totalSum += accumulate(divisors.begin(), divisors.end(), 0);
            }
        }
        
        return totalSum;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {21, 4, 7};
    cout << sol.sumFourDivisors(nums) << endl;  // Output: 32 (divisors of 21 are {1, 3, 7, 21} and their sum is 32)
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding divisors**: For each number (N), we find its divisors. Finding divisors up to the square root has a complexity of \(O(\sqrt{n})\).
- **Overall Complexity**: Given an array of size \(n\), the overall complexity is \(O(n \sqrt{m})\), where \(m\) is the maximum value in `nums`.

Since the constraints are manageable, this approach will work efficiently within the given limits.
