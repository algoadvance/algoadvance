[Leetcode 3144. Minimum Substring Partition of Equal Character Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3144)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, partition it into some number of substrings such that the frequency of each character is the same in every substring. Return the fewest number of substrings in such a partition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the characters in the string lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the problem typically assumes `s` consists of only lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').

2. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?**
   - The constraints are not clearly mentioned, but LeetCode problems generally handle input strings up to size 10^5 efficiently.

3. **Is the frequency of characters expected to be exactly the same for each character in the substring partitions?**
   - Yes, each character should appear the same number of times in every substring.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency of Characters:**
   - First, count the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.

2. **Determine Minimum Equal Partition:**
   - Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the frequency counts to determine the minimum number of partitions that can be made.

3. **Form the Result:**
   - Use the GCD to determine how many subparts each character's frequency can be divided evenly and construct the resulting substrings.

### Time Complexity

Calculating the frequency of characters in the string is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. Finding the GCD of at most 26 numbers (one for each lowercase letter) takes a constant time (specifically `O(1)` due to the fixed alphabet size). Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minEqualFreqPartitions(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c]++;
        }
        
        // Extract frequencies into a vector
        vector<int> frequencies;
        for (const auto& entry : freq) {
            frequencies.push_back(entry.second);
        }
        
        // Calculate the GCD of all frequencies
        int gcd = frequencies[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < frequencies.size(); ++i) {
            gcd = gcd_func(gcd, frequencies[i]);
        }
        
        // The number of partitions is the length of the string divided by the GCD
        int numPartitions = s.size() / gcd;
        return numPartitions;
    }
    
private:
    int gcd_func(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Counting:**
   - A hash map (or unordered_map) is used to count each character's frequency in the string `s`.

2. **Vector of Frequencies:**
   - Extract the frequencies into a vector for ease of GCD calculation.

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The GCD of all the frequency values is computed to find the largest number that can divide all frequencies evenly.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - The minimum number of partitions is determined by dividing the length of the string by the GCD value.

This approach ensures efficient handling of the problem within the given constraints, yielding the fewest number of substrings with equal character frequencies.
