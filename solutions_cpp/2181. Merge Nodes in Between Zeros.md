[Leetcode 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2181)
## Problem Statement
You're given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by zeroes. The beginning and end of the linked list are represented by a `0`, and each time the linked list contains zero, the values between zeros form a segment. 

The goal is to return the linked list with the sum of each segment between zeros in place of the segments. This means you need to change the linked list such that each zero and the numbers following it until the next zero are replaced by the sum of these numbers.

Example:
- Input: `0 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 0`
- Output: `0 -> 4 -> 11 -> 0`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input be an empty list?**
   - No, the input will always start with a `0` and end with a `0`, and have at least two `0`s.
2. **Can the segments between zeros be empty?**
   - No, as per the problem statement, there are always some integers between zeros.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will traverse the linked list while summing the numbers between the zeros. Once we encounter a zero (indicating the end of the current segment), we will:
1. Create a new node with the sum of the current segment.
2. Link this node to the resulting linked list.

We will use a dummy node to simplify the handling of the resulting list and a current pointer to build the resultant list. After processing, we return the next node of the dummy node as the result.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list once to compute the sum and construct the new list.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeNodes(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode* current = dummy;
        ListNode* iter = head->next;  // Skip the initial zero
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (iter != nullptr) {
            if (iter->val == 0) {
                // We've hit a zero, so we need to create a new node with the sum
                current->next = new ListNode(sum);
                current = current->next;
                // Reset sum for the next segment
                sum = 0;
            } else {
                // Add value to the current sum
                sum += iter->val;
            }
            iter = iter->next;
        }
        
        return dummy->next;  // Skip the dummy node
    }
};

// Helper function to print the linked list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    ListNode* temp = head;
    while (temp != nullptr) {
        std::cout << temp->val << " -> ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    std::cout << "nullptr" << std::endl;
}

// Helper function to create a linked list from vector
ListNode* createList(std::vector<int> vars) {
    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode();
    ListNode* current = dummy;
    for(int var : vars) {
        current->next = new ListNode(var);
        current = current->next;
    }
    return dummy->next;
}

int main() {
    // Example
    std::vector<int> input = {0, 3, 1, 0, 4, 5, 2, 0};
    ListNode* head = createList(input);
    Solution solution;
    ListNode* newHead = solution.mergeNodes(head);
    
    // Print the new list
    printList(newHead);
    
    return 0;
}
```

This code correctly processes the input linked list, creates a new list with the sum of values between zeros, and returns the new list.
