[Leetcode 2390. Removing Stars From a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2390)
Sure, let's solve the problem "2390. Removing Stars From a String" from LeetCode.

## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:
- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.

### Example
**Input:** `s = "leet**cod*e"`
**Output:** `lecoe`

**Explanation:**
- The first `*` in the string removes the character `t`.
- The second `*` removes the character `e`.
- After removal, the string becomes `"lecoe"`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the string contain only stars?**
   - No, `s` will always have at least one non-star character.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   - The length of `s` is up to 100,000.

## Strategy
1. We can solve this problem by using a stack.
2. We'll iterate through each character in the string `s`.
3. If the character is a star `*`, we pop the top character from the stack.
4. If the character is not a star, we push it onto the stack.
5. By the end of the iteration, the characters left in the stack (in order) form the final string after all star removals.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently processing each character with a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

std::string removeStars(std::string s) {
    std::stack<char> charStack;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '*') {
            if (!charStack.empty()) {
                charStack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            charStack.push(c);
        }
    }
    
    std::string result;
    while (!charStack.empty()) {
        result += charStack.top();
        charStack.pop();
    }
    
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "leet**cod*e";
    std::string output = removeStars(input);
    std::cout << "Output: " << output << std::endl; // Output: lecoe
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once and perform constant-time operations (push/pop) for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` in the worst case, we are using a stack to store the characters, which in the worst case can be equal to the length of the string if there are no stars.
