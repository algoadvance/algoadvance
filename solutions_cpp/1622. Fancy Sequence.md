[Leetcode 1622. Fancy Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1622)
## Problem Statement

You are given a sequence of integers. You can perform the following operations on this sequence:
1. Append an integer to the end of the sequence.
2. Multiply all the elements of the sequence by a given integer.
3. Add a given integer to all the elements of the sequence.

Implement the `Fancy` class:
- `Fancy()`: Initializes the object with an empty sequence.
- `void append(int val)`: Appends an integer `val` to the sequence.
- `void addAll(int inc)`: Adds an integer `inc` to all elements of the sequence.
- `void multAll(int m)`: Multiplies all elements of the sequence by an integer `m`.
- `int getIndex(int idx)`: Returns the current value at index `idx` (0-indexed) of the sequence, or -1 if the index is out of range.

The operations must be efficient.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is there a maximum length for the sequence, or should we assume it could be very large?
2. How often are the `addAll` and `multAll` operations called relative to `append` and `getIndex` calls?
3. Are there constraints on the values that can be appended, added, or multiplied? (e.g., within a specific integer range)

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, a direct approach of iterating through the sequence for each operation might be too slow, especially if the sequence becomes very large.

### Approach:
1. **Lazy Propagation of Operations:**
   - Keep track of the current addition (`add_factor`) and multiplication (`mul_factor`) to be applied to all elements of the sequence.
   - Whenever the sequence is appended, modify the element with the current factors.
   - Use modular arithmetic (e.g., modulo \(10^9 + 7\)) to prevent overflow and ensure results are within the required limits.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:** 
   - Since operations can result in large numbers, maintain results modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Pseudo Code
```cpp
class Fancy {
private:
    vector<long long> sequence;
    long long add_factor = 0;
    long long mul_factor = 1;
    const long long MOD = 1e9 + 7;

public:
    Fancy() {}

    void append(int val) {
        // Adjust the new value with the current factors
        sequence.push_back((val * mul_factor + add_factor) % MOD);
    }

    void addAll(int inc) {
        // Update the addition factor
        add_factor = (add_factor + inc) % MOD;
    }

    void multAll(int m) {
        // Update the multiplication factor and adjust the addition factor
        mul_factor = (mul_factor * m) % MOD;
        add_factor = (add_factor * m) % MOD;
    }

    int getIndex(int idx) {
        if (idx >= sequence.size()) return -1;
        long long inv_mul = modInverse(mul_factor, MOD);
        return (sequence[idx] - add_factor + MOD) * inv_mul % MOD;
    }

private:
    // Function to calculate the multiplicative inverse using the modular exponentiation
    long long modInverse(long long a, long long m) {
        return power(a, m - 2, m);
    }

    long long power(long long x, long long y, long long m) {
        if (y == 0) return 1;
        long long p = power(x, y / 2, m) % m;
        p = (p * p) % m;
        return (y % 2 == 0) ? p : (x * p) % m;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- `append`: O(1)
- `addAll`: O(1)
- `multAll`: O(1)
- `getIndex`: O(log M), where M is a constant representing the modulo value for the modular inverse calculation.

This solution ensures that each operation is handled efficiently even for very large sequences.
