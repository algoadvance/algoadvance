[Leetcode 2813. Maximum Elegance of a K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2813)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string of lowercase English letters and an integer `k`. Find the "maximum elegance" of a k-length subsequence of the string. The "elegance" of a string is defined as the length of the longest substring which contains unique characters.

### Example
For example, if the input string is `s = "abcabc"` and `k = 3`, one possible 3-length subsequence is "abc", which is a substring with unique characters. Hence the "elegance" value for this subsequence is 3.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   Usually, the constraint on string length will help determine the feasibility of potential algorithms.

2. **Are all characters lowercase English letters?**
   This will confirm the domain of input characters which could affect implementation details.

3. **Can we assume `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of the input string?**
   Ensuring this assumption will avoid edge cases where `k` is greater than the string length, which isn't meaningful.

Let's assume:
- The maximum length of the string input `s` is reasonably large but within workable limits.
- All characters in the string `s` are lowercase English letters.
- `k` is always less than or equal to the length of the input string.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to find the longest substring of unique characters within any k-length subsequence. Here is a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Generate all Subsequences of Length k**: Generate all possible subsequences of length k.
2. **Evaluate Elegance**: For each subsequence, evaluate its "elegance" by determining the longest substring with unique characters.
3. **Maximize Elegance**: Track the maximum elegance found among all k-length subsequences.

Given that generating all subsequences and checking for unique characters can be computationally expensive, we need to use an optimized approach. Therefore, we will use the sliding window technique to maintain a window of size up to k while dynamically checking for unique characters.

## Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxEleganceOfKLengthSubsequence(const string& s, int k) {
    if (k == 0) return 0;
    unordered_set<char> window;
    int max_elegance = 0, left = 0, right = 0, n = s.length();
    
    while (right < n) {
        if (window.find(s[right]) == window.end()) {
            // Character not in window, add it
            window.insert(s[right]);
            // If window size exceeds k, slide the window from left
            if (window.size() > k) {
                window.erase(s[left]);
                left++;
            }
            max_elegance = max(max_elegance, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        } else {
            // Character is a duplicate, move left pointer
            window.erase(s[left]);
            left++;
        }
    }
    return max_elegance;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcabc";
    int k = 3;
    
    int result = maxEleganceOfKLengthSubsequence(s, k);
    cout << "Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm essentially slides a window across the string, adjusting for each character. Each character is added and potentially removed from the window once.
- Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, as each character is processed at most twice.
- The space complexity is also O(k) due to the storage of characters in the set `window`.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the maximum elegance of a k-length subsequence.
