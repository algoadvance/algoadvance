[Leetcode 2122. Recover the Original Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2122)
Sure, let's go through this problem step by step.

### Problem Statement

You're given an integer array `nums` of even length. Split the array into two equal halves such that the difference between one half and the other half is minimized. Return the original array before the shuffle and removal of some elements.

For example:

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [2,4,6,8,10,12]
Explanation: The original array was [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12] and then it was shuffled and had one element removed.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,5,7]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,7]
Explanation: The original array was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7] and then it was shuffled and had one element removed.
```

### Clarifying Questions

To understand the problem better, here are some clarifying questions:

1. What properties do the 'recovered' original arrays possess?
2. Are the input arrays always of even length ensuring it can be split into two?
3. Can there be negative integers or zeros?

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Given Array**: Sorting will help in managing pairs.
2. **Finding the Difference**: Find the possible minimum `k` such that when the array is divided into pairs, `nums[i+len/2] - nums[i] = k`.
3. **Reconstruct the Array**:
    - Use a multiset or similar data structure to count and remove pairs while validating and ensuring the sorted resultant valid pairs form the original array.
 
### Time Complexity
The primary operations involve sorting the array and iterating through it to find pairs, resulting in a complexity of O(n log n).

### Code

Hereâ€™s the potential implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> recoverArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> result;
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    int n = nums.size();
    int half = n / 2;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if ((nums[i] - nums[0]) % 2 != 0) continue;
        int k = (nums[i] - nums[0]) / 2;
        if (k == 0) continue;
        
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (int x : nums) ++freq[x];
        
        vector<int> temp;
        bool valid = true;
        
        for (int x: nums) {
            if (freq[x] == 0) continue;
            if (freq[x + 2 * k] <= 0) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
            
            temp.push_back(x + k);
            --freq[x];
            --freq[x + 2 * k];
        }
        
        if (valid) return temp;
    }
    
    return result; // Should never reach here since solution always exists.
}

int main() {
    vector<int> test1 = {2, 10, 6, 4, 8, 12};
    vector<int> result1 = recoverArray(test1);
    for (int x : result1) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    vector<int> test2 = {1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7};
    vector<int> result2 = recoverArray(test2);
    for (int x : result2) {
        cout << x << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting the Array**: The given array is sorted.
2. **Finding `k`**: By iterating through the array we find pairs and compute a possible `k`.
3. **Validating Pairs**: Construct possible valid pairs and check if removing pairs from the array aligns with `2*k` difference.

In the implementation, a map helps count and manage elements to ensure we generate a valid original list. If the conditions meet, the resultant array is returned. If certain checks fail, the algorithm iterates to find the next valid `k`.

This approach ensures capturing the minimal difference for pairs and reconstructing the original sorted list that matches the criteria of the given problem.
