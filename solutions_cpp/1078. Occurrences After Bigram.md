[Leetcode 1078. Occurrences After Bigram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1078)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `first` and `second`, consider all the occurrences of the first and second words appearing one after the other in the text. Return the list of words that appear immediately after the sequence of `first` and `second`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student", first = "a", second = "good"
Output: ["girl", "student"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: text = "we will we will rock you", first = "we", second = "will"
Output: ["we", "rock"]
```

**Constraints:**
- The text is guaranteed to contain at least one occurrence of the pair (`first`, `second`).
- The words in the text are separated by a single space.
- The length of each word and the number of words in `text` is between 1 and 1000.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can we assume that `text`, `first`, and `second` are all lowercase?
   **A:** Yes.
2. **Q:** Will the words in `text` only be composed of alphabetic characters?
   **A:** Yes.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the `text` into individual words using space as the delimiter.
2. Iterate through the list of words and look for occurrences of the sequence of `first` followed by `second`.
3. Whenever we find such a sequence, record the word immediately after the `second` word, if it exists.
4. Return the list of words found in step 3.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>

using namespace std;

vector<string> findOcurrences(string text, string first, string second) {
    vector<string> result;
    vector<string> words;
    stringstream ss(text);
    string word;
    
    // Split the input text into words
    while (ss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }
    
    // Iterate through the words and find occurrences of first and second followed by another word
    for (int i = 0; i < words.size() - 2; ++i) {
        if (words[i] == first && words[i + 1] == second) {
            result.push_back(words[i + 2]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    // Example 1
    string text1 = "alice is a good girl she is a good student";
    string first1 = "a";
    string second1 = "good";
    vector<string> result1 = findOcurrences(text1, first1, second1);
    for (const string &word : result1) {
        cout << word << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    // Example 2
    string text2 = "we will we will rock you";
    string first2 = "we";
    string second2 = "will";
    vector<string> result2 = findOcurrences(text2, first2, second2);
    for (const string &word : result2) {
        cout << word << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the Text:** The time complexity for splitting the text string into words is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the text.
- **Finding Occurrences:** Iterating through the list of words takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of words.
- Overall Time Complexity: Since \(m \leq n\), the total time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This solution processes the input efficiently and meets the given constraints.
