[Leetcode 2582. Pass the Pillow](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2582)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` and `time` representing the number of people in a circle and the time for passing the pillow respectively. The people are numbered from 1 to `n` in a clockwise direction.

The pillow starts from person 1. Every second, the pillow is passed to the next person in the clockwise direction. After person `n`, it goes back to person 1.

Determine who will have the pillow after `time` seconds.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 4, time = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- At time 0: The pillow is with person 1.
- At time 1: The pillow is with person 2.
- At time 2: The pillow is with person 3.
- At time 3: The pillow is with person 4.
- At time 4: The pillow is again with person 1.
- At time 5: The pillow is with person 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will `n` always be greater than 1?
2. Can `time` be zero or negative?
3. Are the integers `n` and `time` guaranteed to be within a certain range?

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        // The person who will have the pillow after "time" seconds can be calculated using the modulus operation.
        // Since they are numbered from 1 to n, we'll adjust time by n and add 1 to convert 0-based index to 1-based index.
        return (time % n) + 1;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Identify the cycle in positions**: Since the numbering is from `1` to `n`, after `n` seconds, the pillow returns back to person 1.
2. **Modulus Operation**: The modulus operation (`time % n`) will give us the cycle position, but since the modulus operation gives a `0`-based result, adding `1` will adjust it to `1`-based index.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1`, regardless of `time`, the result will always be `1`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the calculation involves basic arithmetic operations. There are no loops or recursive calls involved, making it extremely efficient even for large values of `n` and `time`.
