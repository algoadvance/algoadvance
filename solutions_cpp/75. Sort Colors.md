[Leetcode 75. Sort Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l75)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. Here, we use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length of `nums`? Is there a constraint on `n`?
   - Are there other values besides `0`, `1`, and `2` in the array?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the sorted array be returned, or is it sufficient to modify the input array `nums`?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Can the input array be empty?
   - Can all elements in the input array be of the same color?

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize the Dutch National Flag algorithm proposed by Edsger W. Dijkstra. This algorithm uses three pointers to partition the array into three sections:

- All elements to the left of the `low` pointer should be `0`.
- All elements between the `low` pointer and the `mid` pointer should be `1`.
- All elements between the `high` pointer and the end of the array should be `2`.

We can achieve this in one pass through the array with a linear time complexity `O(n)` and constant space complexity `O(1)`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

void sortColors(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] == 0) {
            std::swap(nums[low], nums[mid]);
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
            mid++;
        } else {
            std::swap(nums[mid], nums[high]);
            high--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` starts at the beginning of the array and will track where the next `0` should go.
   - `mid` starts at the beginning too and will traverse the array.
   - `high` starts at the end of the array and will track where the next `2` should go.

2. **Traversal**:
   - If `nums[mid]` is `0`, swap it with `nums[low]`, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is `1`, just move the `mid` pointer forward.
   - If `nums[mid]` is `2`, swap it with `nums[high]`, then decrement `high`, without moving `mid` because the swapped element at `mid` needs to be examined.

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm goes through the list once, so the time complexity is `O(n)`.

## Space Complexity
- It uses constant extra space, so the space complexity is `O(1)`.
