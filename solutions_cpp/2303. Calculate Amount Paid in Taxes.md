[Leetcode 2303. Calculate Amount Paid in Taxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2303)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `brackets` where `brackets[i] = [upper_i, percent_i]` means that the `i-th` tax bracket has an upper bound of `upper_i` and is taxed at a rate of `percent_i`. The brackets are sorted by `upper_i` in ascending order.

An integer `income` represents the amount of money you made. You need to compute the total amount of taxes you need to pay based on the given tax brackets.

The tax is calculated progressively: 
- The portion of income that falls within the first tax bracket is taxed at its rate.
- The portion of income that falls within the second tax bracket, that is beyond the first tax bracket's upper bound, is taxed at the second rate, and so on.

Return the total amount of taxes you need to pay as a double.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Question**: What is the input range for `income` and the values within `brackets`?
   **Answer**: Typically, problems like these are constrained to reasonable financial values, but we would need to check the problem constraints explicitly for limits.
   
2. **Question**: Are the `percent_i` values given as integers or floating-point numbers?
   **Answer**: They are integer percentages. For example, `percent_i = 10` means a 10% tax rate.

3. **Question**: Should the final tax amount be rounded or formatted to a specific precision?
   **Answer**: Typically, such problems expect at least two decimal places precision, but we should confirm based on the problem statement.

## Strategy

1. Initialize `totalTax` as 0.0 to store the accumulated tax.
2. Define `previousUpper` as 0 to represent the lower bound of the current bracket being processed.
3. Iterate through each bracket:
   - Calculate the taxable portion within the current bracket: `currentUpper - previousUpper`.
   - If the current income is less than or equal to the current bracket's upper bound, calculate the tax for the remaining income, and then break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, calculate the tax for the full bracket range and update the `previousUpper`.
4. Return the accumulated `totalTax`.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation for the given strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double calculateTax(vector<vector<int>>& brackets, int income) {
        double totalTax = 0.0;
        int previousUpper = 0;

        for (const auto& bracket : brackets) {
            int currentUpper = bracket[0];
            int percent = bracket[1];

            if (income <= currentUpper) {
                totalTax += (income - previousUpper) * percent / 100.0;
                break;
            } else {
                totalTax += (currentUpper - previousUpper) * percent / 100.0;
                previousUpper = currentUpper;
            }
        }

        return totalTax;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of tax brackets. This is because we iterate through each bracket once to calculate the tax. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as no extra space is required aside from a few variables.

We should test the solution with various cases, including edge cases like `income` being exactly on bracket thresholds, being 0, and more to ensure complete robustness.
