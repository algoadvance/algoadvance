[Leetcode 1954. Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1954)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `neededApples` which represents the number of apples you need to collect. Gardens grow in concentric square rings. The first ring contains 12 apples, the second ring contains 20 apples, and so on. The pattern of growth continues such that each subsequent ring contains 8 more apples than the previous ring.

The problem is to find the minimum perimeter of the square garden from which you can collect at least the number of apples given by `neededApples`.

**Constraints:**
- \(1 \leq neededApples \leq 10^{15}\)

## Clarifying Questions
To approach this problem, let's clarify the following:

1. **Growth Pattern Confirmation**: Each concentric square ring adds to the previous perimeter. Does it follow the pattern exactly as described?
2. **Perimeter Calculation**: Should the perimeter be calculated as 4 times the side of the square, considering it to be the distance around the outside?

Assuming the details are correct, let's proceed with the solution.

## Strategy
1. **Identify the pattern of apples growth**: Each concentric square ring adds a linearly increasing number of apples.
2. **Derive the formula for total apples**: Given the linear pattern, accumulate apples until the total meets or exceeds `neededApples`.
3. **Calculate the perimeter**: Perimeter of a garden level is just the outermost square perimeter, which is essentially the steps taken multiplied by 8 (since the sides increase linearly).

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Apples Growth Pattern**:
    - The first ring (side length 1) includes 12 apples.
    - The second ring (side length 2) includes 20 apples.
    - The third ring (side length 3) includes 28 apples.
    - The nth ring will therefore include \( 8n + 4 \times 4 = 8n(2n + 1) \) apples since each new side adds on 8 more apples.

2. **Total Apples Calculation**:
   Accumulate the total number of apples in concentric rings until it reaches or exceeds `neededApples`.

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   The formula for the perimeter of the nth concentric ring would be \(8 \times n\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumPerimeter(long long neededApples) {
        long long apples = 0;
        long long n = 0;
        
        while (apples < neededApples) {
            n++;
            apples += 12 * n * n;
        }
        
        return 8 * n;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    long long neededApples = 1000000000000LL; // Example input
    std::cout << "Minimum Perimeter: " << solution.minimumPerimeter(neededApples) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\sqrt{N})\) where \(N\) is neededApples. This is because the summation increases quadratically and the loop will run approximately until \(\sqrt{N}\).

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we are using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

This solution ensures that the minimum perimeter is calculated by continuously accumulating apples in concentric rings and calculating the corresponding perimeter until the condition is satisfied.
