[Leetcode 1994. The Number of Good Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1994)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` good if its product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers.

For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then:
- `[2, 3]` is a good subset because the product is `2 * 3 = 6` (both 2 and 3 are primes).
- `[2]` is a good subset because the product is `2`.
- `[1, 4]` is not a good subset because the product is `4` which is not a product of distinct primes (4 is `2 * 2`).

Return the number of different good subsets in `nums`. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain duplicate values?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicates.
2. What is the maximum length of `nums`?
   - The length of `nums` can be up to `10^4`.
3. What is the range of the values in `nums`?
   - Each value in `nums` is between `1` and `30`, inclusive.
4. Is `1` considered a good subset since `1` is not a prime number?
   - No, subsets containing `1` are not considered good subsets.
5. Are we looking for the number of such subsets or the count of how many unique good subsets exist? 
   - We want the number of different good subsets in `nums`.

## Strategy
1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The problem revolves around subsets of numbers between 1 and 30, which is manageable given the constraints.
   - Good subsets must be products of distinct primes; thus, combinations of numbers must not repeat prime factors.

2. **Prime Factorization and Masking**:
   - We can use a bitmask to represent the prime factors involved in each subset.
   - We note the prime numbers less than or equal to 30: `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]`.

3. **Combination Counting**:
   - Use dynamic programming to count the number of valid subsets that can be formed by iterating through the `nums` array.
   - Maintain an array where each index represents a bitmask of selected primes.

4. **Handling `1`'s Separately**:
   - Any valid subset can be potentially multiplied by any number of `1`s, thus we need to multiply the count of good subsets by `2^(count of 1s)`.

5. **Efficient Counting with MOD Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step of the calculation.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const vector<int> primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29};

int numberOfGoodSubsets(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Count occurrences of each number in nums
    unordered_map<int, int> count;
    for (int num : nums) {
        count[num]++;
    }

    // Dynamic programming table
    vector<long> dp(1 << primes.size(), 0);
    dp[0] = 1; // Base case: the empty subset
    
    // Helper function to get bitmask of primes for a given number
    auto getMask = [](int num) {
        int mask = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < primes.size(); ++i) {
            int prime = primes[i];
            if (num % (prime * prime) == 0) return -1; // Non distinct prime factors
            if (num % prime == 0) mask |= (1 << i);
        }
        return mask;
    };
    
    // Process each number from 2 to 30
    for (int num = 2; num <= 30; ++num) {
        if (!count.count(num)) continue;
        int mask = getMask(num);
        if (mask == -1) continue;

        // Update dp table in reverse to avoid recomputation
        for (int i = (1 << primes.size()) - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if ((i & mask) == 0) {
                dp[i | mask] = (dp[i | mask] + dp[i] * count[num]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    // All valid subsets excluding the empty set
    long result = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < (1 << primes.size()); ++i) {
        result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
    }

    // Handle different combinations involving '1's
    if (count.count(1)) {
        long power = count[1];
        result = (result * static_cast<long>(pow(2, power))) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
**Time Complexity**: \(O(N + P \cdot 2^P) \approx O(3072)\)
- \(N\) is the size of `nums`, iterating through it once.
- \(P\) is the number of primes less than 30.
- \(2^P\) is the maximum subset mask for primes, which is a constant (1024 in this problem).
   
**Space Complexity**: \(O(2^P)\)
- Space used for the DP array which has a length of \(2^P\).

This solution is efficient even for the upper constraints of the problem.
