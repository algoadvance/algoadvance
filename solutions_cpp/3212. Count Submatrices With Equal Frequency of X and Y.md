[Leetcode 3212. Count Submatrices With Equal Frequency of X and Y](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3212)
## Problem Statement

Given a 2D matrix `mat` of size `m * n` and two integers `X` and `Y`, count the number of submatrices where the frequencies of `X` and `Y` are equal. The submatrix is defined as any contiguous block within the 2D matrix.

Example:
```
Input:
mat = [
  [1, 2, 2],
  [2, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 2]
]
X = 1
Y = 2

Output: 4 
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values of `m` and `n`?**
   - Typical constraints for a matrix size in LeetCode can go up to `1000 x 1000`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values contained within the matrix?**
   - The values are likely to be integers within a typical range, possibly constrained to specific values (e.g., `1` and `2`).

3. **Is the condition `X` and `Y` always different?**
   - For the problem to make sense, `X` and `Y` must be different.

4. **Edge cases to consider:**
   - A matrix with all values the same.
   - A matrix where no submatrices meet the condition.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through all possible submatrices**:
   - Use a nested loop to fix the starting point at `(i, j)`.
   - Use another nested loop to fix the ending point `(k, l)` and consider all submatrices from `(i, j)` to `(k, l)`.

2. **Count the frequencies of `X` and `Y` in each submatrix**:
   - For each submatrix defined by the starting and ending points, count how many times `X` and `Y` appear.

3. **Check the equality condition**:
   - If the counts of `X` and `Y` are equal, increment the count of valid submatrices.

4. **Optimize the counting process**:
   - To avoid redundant counting, use prefix sums or another efficient counting mechanism.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int countSubmatrices(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int X, int Y) {
    int m = mat.size();
    int n = mat[0].size();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Sum[i][j] will be a hashmap that tracks differences in counts of X and Y up to row i, col j
    vector<vector<unordered_map<int, int>>> sum(m + 1, vector<unordered_map<int, int>>(n + 1));

    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
            sum[i][j][0] = 1;
        }
    }

    for (int top = 0; top < m; ++top) {
        for (int bot = top; bot < m; ++bot) {
            int diff = 0;
            for (int col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
                diff += (mat[bot][col] == X) - (mat[bot][col] == Y);

                if (top > 0) {
                    diff += (mat[top-1][col] == Y) - (mat[top-1][col] == X);
                }

                count += sum[bot+1][col+1][-diff];
                sum[bot+1][col+1][-diff]++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {
        {1, 2, 2},
        {2, 1, 2},
        {1, 1, 2}
    };
    int X = 1, Y = 2;
    cout << "Number of submatrices: " << countSubmatrices(mat, X, Y) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Nested Loops to Consider Submatrices**: Each possible top and bottom row combination is considered, resulting in O(m^2) combinations.
- **Inner Loop to Process Columns**: Each combination processes n columns, resulting in O(m^2 * n) complexity.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(m^2 * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This should be feasible given typical constraints.
