[Leetcode 1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1178)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of words and a list of puzzles, return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of words in the given word list that are valid for the ith puzzle.

A word is valid for a puzzle if both of the following are true:
1. The word contains the first letter of the puzzle.
2. For each letter in the word, that letter is in the puzzle.

- Each puzzle is a string of 7 letters.
- Each word is a string comprising 1 to 50 letters.
- Neither words nor puzzles contain repeated letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: How large can the list of words and puzzles be?
   - **Response**: Both can each be in the range of \(10^4\).
  
2. **Character Set**: Are there only lowercase English letters in the words and puzzles?
   - **Response**: Yes, only lowercase English letters are used.

3. **Output**: Is the output expected as an array of integers corresponding to each puzzle?
   - **Response**: Yes, each integer represents the count of valid words for the respective puzzle.

### Strategy

1. **Bitmask Representation**: Since puzzles and words contain no repeated letters and we need to check letter presence efficiently, we can use bitmasks to represent each word and each puzzle:
   - Each letter can be represented by a bit in a 26-bit integer, where bit 0 corresponds to 'a', bit 1 to 'b', and so on.

2. **Word Filtering**: Convert each word into a bitmask and store how often each bitmask occurs.
  
3. **Puzzle Validation**: For each puzzle:
   - Generate the bitmask.
   - Ensure that the first letter of the puzzle is part of the valid word bitmasks.
   - Generate all possible submasks of the puzzle bitmask (that still includes the first letter) and check against the word bitmasks.

4. **Count Matching Words**: Count how many word bitmasks match the submasks for each puzzle and sum these counts.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findNumOfValidWords(vector<string>& words, vector<string>& puzzles) {
    unordered_map<int, int> wordCount;
    
    // Function to convert a word or puzzle into its bitmask representation
    auto getBitmask = [](const string& s) -> int {
        int mask = 0;
        for (char c : s) {
            mask |= (1 << (c - 'a'));
        }
        return mask;
    };
    
    // Build the frequency map of word bitmasks
    for (const string& word : words) {
        int mask = getBitmask(word);
        wordCount[mask]++;
    }
    
    vector<int> result;
    
    for (const string& puzzle : puzzles) {
        int puzzleMask = getBitmask(puzzle);
        int firstLetterMask = (1 << (puzzle[0] - 'a'));
        int submask = puzzleMask;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all submasks of the puzzle bitmask
        while (submask) {
            // Check if submask includes the first letter
            if (submask & firstLetterMask) {
                if (wordCount.count(submask)) {
                    count += wordCount[submask];
                }
            }
            submask = (submask - 1) & puzzleMask;
        }
        
        // Include the puzzle itself
        if (wordCount.count(firstLetterMask)) {
            count += wordCount[firstLetterMask];
        }
        
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing:** Transforming each word into a bitmask — \(O(W \cdot L)\), where \(W\) is the number of words and \(L\) is the average length of a word.
- **Main Calculation:** For each puzzle:
  - Generating all possible submasks of a 7-bit number (which is \(2^7 = 128\)).
  - For each submask, we perform a hash table lookup, which is expected \(O(1)\).
  - Thus, for each puzzle — \(O(128) = O(1)\) constant time operations per puzzle.
  
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(W \cdot L + P)\), where \(W\) is the number of words, \(L\) is the average length of the words, and \(P\) is the number of puzzles.
