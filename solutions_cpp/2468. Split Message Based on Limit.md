[Leetcode 2468. Split Message Based on Limit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2468)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `message` and an integer `limit`.

You need to split `message` into parts such that each part is of length at most `limit`. Additionally, each part must be suffixed with a marker indicating its position in the split sequence. The format for the marker is: "<part-number>/<total-parts>".

Output a list of parts that satisfy the conditions above. If it's not possible to split the message with the given constraints, return an empty list.

- The `message` should be split at a word boundary, i.e., you cannot split a word into two different parts.
- No part should have a length that exceeds `limit`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the maximum length of the entire message?
2. Are there any restrictions on the characters within the message?
3. What constitutes a "word"? Is it separated by spaces, punctuation marks, or other delimiters?
4. Are there any constraints on the separators or delimiters within the message?

Assuming:
- The message can contain any printable characters.
- Words are separated by spaces.
- There are no other delimiters.

### Strategy

1. First, determine the maximum number of characters that a part can have after accounting for the markers.
2. Utilize this information to dynamically decide how many parts will be needed and construct each part within the constraints.
3. Ensure that each part adheres to word boundaries.
4. If, at any point, it becomes impossible to adhere to the length constraints, return an empty list.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>

std::vector<std::string> splitMessage(std::string message, int limit) {
    int len = message.length();
    int max_parts = len / (limit - 5);  // estimating max parts conservatively
    for (int parts = 1; parts <= max_parts + 1; ++parts) {
        std::vector<std::string> result;
        std::string part;
        std::stringstream ss(message);
        std::string word;

        int part_number_length = std::to_string(parts).length();
        int suffix_length = 3 + part_number_length + part_number_length;  // Length of suffix part "/<part>/<parts>"
        int remaining_limit = limit - suffix_length;

        if (remaining_limit <= 0) continue;

        while (ss >> word) {
            if (word.length() > remaining_limit) return {};  // A single word is too long to fit any part

            if (part.size() + word.size() + (part.empty() ? 0 : 1) <= remaining_limit) {
                if (!part.empty()) part += " ";
                part += word;
            } else {
                result.push_back(part);
                part = word;
            }

            if (result.size() >= parts) break;
        }
        if (!part.empty()) result.push_back(part);
        if (result.size() == parts) {
            for (int i = 0; i < parts; ++i) {
                result[i] += "<" + std::to_string(i + 1) + "/" + std::to_string(parts) + ">";
            }
            return result;
        }
    }
    return {};
}

int main() {
    std::string message = "This is an example message that needs splitting.";
    int limit = 15;
    std::vector<std::string> parts = splitMessage(message, limit);

    for (const std::string &part : parts) {
        std::cout << "\"" << part << "\"" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where `n` is the length of the message and `m` is the number of parts being tested. 

This should be efficient enough for reasonably sized messages and conservative limit values.
