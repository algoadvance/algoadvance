[Leetcode 2521. Distinct Prime Factors of Product of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2521)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return the number of distinct prime factors in the product of the elements of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input values**: What is the maximum value that an element in the array `nums` can take? What is the maximum length of the array?
2. **Edge cases**: Should we consider cases where an element in the array is 1, or the array is empty?
3. **Output constraints**: Are there any specific constraints on the output format or range?

### Strategy

1. **Prime Factorization**: Each element in the array can be prime factorized. We need to collect all prime factors from these factorizations.
2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: To efficiently factorize the numbers, we precompute all prime numbers up to the largest number in the array using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
3. **Use Sets for Distinct Primes**: We utilize a set to store prime factors in order to automatically handle duplicates.
4. **Iterate and Factorize**: For each number in the array, factorize it and insert its prime factors into the set.
5. **Count Distinct Primes**: The size of the set at the end will give the number of distinct prime factors.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> sieve_of_eratosthenes(int max_num) {
    std::vector<bool> is_prime(max_num + 1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= max_num; ++i) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= max_num; j += i) {
                is_prime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    std::vector<int> primes;
    for (int i = 2; i <= max_num; ++i) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            primes.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    return primes;
}

void factorize(int num, const std::vector<int>& primes, std::unordered_set<int>& prime_factors) {
    for (int prime : primes) {
        if (prime * prime > num) break;
        if (num % prime == 0) {
            prime_factors.insert(prime);
            while (num % prime == 0)
                num /= prime;
        }
    }
    if (num > 1) {
        prime_factors.insert(num);
    }
}

int countDistinctPrimeFactors(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_num = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    std::vector<int> primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(max_num);
    std::unordered_set<int> prime_factors;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        factorize(num, primes, prime_factors);
    }
    return prime_factors.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 4, 3, 7, 10}; // Example input
    std::cout << "Number of distinct prime factors: " << countDistinctPrimeFactors(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: We use this algorithm to generate all prime numbers up to the maximum number in the array `nums`.
2. **Factorize Function**: This function takes a number, uses the precomputed primes to factorize the number, and stores the factors in the set.
3. **Distinct Prime Factors Count**: We process each number in the array, factorize it, and track all unique primes encountered. The result is the size of this set.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: `O(n log log n)` for n being the largest number in the array.
2. **Factorization**: Since factorizing each number involves dividing by smaller prime factors, the complexity is roughly `O(n log n)` for each number.
3. **Overall Complexity**:
   - Pre-computation of primes: `O(n log log n)`
   - Factorization of each number in the array: `O(m * log n)` where `m` is the number of elements in `nums`.

The overall complexity is thus `O(n log log n + m * log n)`, where `n` is the maximum number in `nums` and `m` is the size of `nums`. This ensures efficient handling of prime factorization and counting.
