[Leetcode 44. Wildcard Matching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l44)
## Problem Statement

The problem "Wildcard Matching" asks you to implement a function `isMatch` that uses wildcard characters `?` and `*` to match strings. The `?` character matches any single character, while the `*` character matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The method signature to implement is:
```cpp
bool isMatch(string s, string p);
```

- `s` is the input string.
- `p` is the pattern which may contain `?` and `*`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the maximum lengths of `s` and `p`?
     - Assume `s` and `p` have a maximum length of 2000.
   
2. **Character Set**:
   - What characters does `s` contain?
     - Assume `s` contains lowercase English letters only.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned for empty strings and patterns?
     - If `p` contains only `*`, it should match any `s` including an empty string.
     - If `p` is empty and `s` is not, it should return `false`.
     - If both `s` and `p` are empty, it should return `true`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming (DP). Our approach involves creating a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if the first `i` characters in string `s` match the first `j` characters in pattern `p`, and `false` otherwise.

Here are the steps for building the DP table:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][0]` should be `true` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - For the first row `dp[0][j]` where `j > 0`, this should be `true` if `p[j-1]` is `*`.

2. **Filling the Table**:
   - If `p[j-1] == s[i-1]` or `p[j-1] == '?'`, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If `p[j-1] == '*'`, set `dp[i][j]` to `dp[i-1][j] (consider `*` as characters matching) or `dp[i][j-1]` (consider `*` as empty sequence).

3. **Final Result**:
   - The final answer is `dp[s.length()][p.length()]`.

## Code

Here is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
    int m = s.length(), n = p.length();
    
    // DP table where dp[i][j] means the first i chars in `s` match the first j chars in `p`
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(m + 1, vector<bool>(n + 1, false));
    
    // Empty pattern matches empty string
    dp[0][0] = true;
    
    // Handle patterns with '*' at the start
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
        if (p[j - 1] == '*') {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1];
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Fill the rest of the table
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (p[j - 1] == '?' || p[j - 1] == s[i - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else if (p[j - 1] == '*') {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The answer is whether the full strings match
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the length of `s` and \(n\) is the length of `p`, since we're iterating through a 2D DP table of size \(m \times n\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) due to the DP table.

This approach ensures that all possible scenarios, including edge cases, are considered efficiently using dynamic programming.
