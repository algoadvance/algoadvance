[Leetcode 3012. Minimize Length of Array Using Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3012)
**Problem Statement**
---
Given an array `nums`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:
- Choose two **consecutive** identical elements in the array and remove them.

Return the minimum possible length of the array after performing the operation any number of times.

**Clarifying Questions**
---
1. Are elements only positive integers, or can they be negative and zeros as well?
2. Does the order of the elements in the original array matter?
3. Should the solution affect the original array, or should we work on a copy?
4. Is there a constraint on the size of the array, such as a maximum length?

**Code**
---
Here is a C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int minimizeLengthOfArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> stack;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (!stack.empty() && stack.back() == nums[i]) {
            stack.pop_back(); // remove identical consecutive elements
        } else {
            stack.push_back(nums[i]);
        }
    }
    return stack.size(); // return the size of the modified array
}
```

**Strategy**
---
1. **Using a Stack Simulation:** The method uses a stack-like approach to handle the removal of consecutive elements.
2. **Initial Iteration:** Iterate through each element in the array.
3. **Check for Consecutive Elements:** For each element, check if it is the same as the last element pushed onto the stack (`stack.back()`).
4. **Remove Consecutive Elements:** If it is the same, remove the last element from the stack (which effectively removes both).
5. **Keep Non-Consecutive Elements:** If it is not the same, push the current element onto the stack.
6. **Return Result:** After processing the entire array, the length of the stack will be the length of the array after all possible operations have been performed, which is the minimal possible length.


**Time Complexity**
---
The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the original array. This is because we iterate through the array once, and each operation on the stack (push/pop) is O(1).
