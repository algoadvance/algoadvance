[Leetcode 633. Sum of Square Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l633)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c \]

Return `true` if such a pair exists, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `c` be zero?**
   - Yes, `c` can be zero.
   
2. **What is the range of `c`?**
   - Typically, `c` ranges from \(0\) to \(2^{31} - 1\) as it is a non-negative integer type.

3. **Do we need to consider negative values for `a` and `b`?**
   - No, as per the problem statement, we are considering non-negative integers only.

### Strategy

1. **Use the Two-pointer Technique:**
   - Since the problem involves checking sums of squares, a common approach is using two pointers or two variables to iterate through possible values.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Set `a` to `0` and `b` to the integer part of the square root of `c`.

3. **Loop and Check:**
   - While `a` is less than or equal to `b`, calculate `a^2 + b^2`.
   - If the sum equals `c`, return `true`.
   - If the sum is less than `c`, increment `a`.
   - If the sum is greater than `c`, decrement `b`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        long long a = 0;
        long long b = static_cast<long long>(std::sqrt(c));
        
        while (a <= b) {
            long long sum = a * a + b * b;
            if (sum == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < c) {
                ++a;
            } else {
                --b;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int testValue = 5;
    if (sol.judgeSquareSum(testValue)) {
        std::cout << "True" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "False" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:**
  - Calculating the square root of `c` takes \(O(\log c)\).

- **Loop Execution:**
  - Each iteration adjusts one of the variables \(a\) or \(b\). In the worst case, the numbers move from `0` to \(\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the loop runs for \(O(\sqrt{c})\) iterations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:

\[O(\sqrt{c})\]

This efficient approach allows determining if there are two integers whose squares sum up to `c` without resorting to more computationally expensive methods.
