[Leetcode 2954. Count the Number of Infection Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2954)
### Problem Statement

You are given a number of cities and flights between them. Each flight connects two different cities and is described by an undirected graph. An infected city will infect other cities directly connected to it. Given an initial set of infected cities, count how many sequences of infections are possible until no new city can be infected.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does the input structure look like?**
    - There will be an integer `n`, representing the number of cities.
    - There will be a list of lists/tuples containing pairs of integers representing the flights (edges) between cities.
    - There will be a list of integers representing the initially infected cities.

2. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
    - No, the graph may consist of more than one connected component.

3. **Are there any constraints on the number of cities or the number of flights?**
    - Typically constraints will be based on what's common for graph problems, but if not specified, assume up to `10^5` for cities and flights.

4. **Do we need to consider the permutation of infection sequences?**
    - Yes, we need to count distinct sequences of infections.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **DFS/BFS Traversal:** To explore all possible infection sequences.
3. **Combinatorial Counting:** As sequences matter and each infected node can directly influence its neighbors, we need to check all permutations of infections.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>

// Function to count the number of infection sequences
void countInfectionSequences(std::unordered_set<int>& infected, std::unordered_set<int>& visited, 
                             std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>& adjList, int &count) {
    bool newInfection = false;
    for (int city : infected) {
        for (int neighbor : adjList[city]) {
            if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                newInfection = true;
                visited.insert(neighbor);
                infected.insert(neighbor);
                countInfectionSequences(infected, visited, adjList, count);
                infected.erase(neighbor);
                visited.erase(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    if (!newInfection) {
        count++;
    }
}

int countSequences(int n, std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& flights, std::vector<int>& initial) {
    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> adjList;
    for (const auto& flight : flights) {
        adjList[flight.first].push_back(flight.second);
        adjList[flight.second].push_back(flight.first);
    }

    std::unordered_set<int> infected(initial.begin(), initial.end());
    std::unordered_set<int> visited(initial.begin(), initial.end());

    int count = 0;
    countInfectionSequences(infected, visited, adjList, count);
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> flights = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}};
    std::vector<int> initial = {0};
    int result = countSequences(n, flights, initial);
    std::cout << "Number of infection sequences: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Representation:** Created using an adjacency list.
2. **DFS/BFS Traversal:** We use a recursive function to explore infection sequences:
    - `infected` to keep track of current infected cities.
    - `visited` to ensure we don't re-infect a city.
    - The function recursively infects connected nodes and backtracks to find all possible sequences.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is potentially exponential (`O(2^n)`) in the number of cities due to checking all permutations of infections. However, memoization and pruning can help reduce the effective number of states traversed in real-world scenarios.

### Conclusion

This algorithm works by exploring all possible infection sequences using a backtracking approach. This ensures all distinct infection paths are counted, adhering to the problem requirements.
