[Leetcode 2572. Count the Number of Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2572)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, you need to count the number of non-empty subsets of `nums` that are square-free. A subset is square-free if the product of its elements is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values in the array `nums`?**
   - This helps in understanding how large our factors can be.
2. **What is the size range of the array?**
   - Knowing this helps to determine feasible strategies based on time and space complexity.
3. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - This might affect how we handle the subsets.
   
### Example
Given `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the square-free subsets could be `[[1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]`, but not `[1, 4]`, `[2, 4]`, `[3, 4]` or `[4]` because 4 is a perfect square.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Square-Free Property**: First, we need to identify the square-free condition which can be determined by ensuring the product of the subset elements is not divisible by any perfect square larger than 1.
2. **Subsets Generation**: We can generate all possible subsets of `nums`.
3. **Check for Square-Free**: For each subset, we have to ensure that the product of the subset elements is square-free.
4. **Efficient Check**: Factorization or a predefined set of prime square factors might help in reducing runtime complexity.

### Code
Here is the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

bool isSquareFree(int product) {
    for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(product); ++i) {
        if (product % (i * i) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int countSquareFreeSubsets(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Generate all subsets
    int total_subsets = 1 << n;
    for (int i = 1; i < total_subsets; ++i) {
        int product = 1;
        bool valid = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (i & (1 << j)) {
                product *= nums[j];
                if (product > INT_MAX || !isSquareFree(product)) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (valid) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << "Number of square-free subsets: " << countSquareFreeSubsets(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Generating Subsets**: `O(2^n)` since we are generating all possible subsets.
- **Checking Square-Free**: For each subset, checking if it is square-free involves factoring which can take up to `O(sqrt(N))` time.
- **Overall Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n * sqrt(max_product))`, making it computationally expensive for larger arrays or larger element values.

### Space Complexity
- **Subsets Storage**: `O(1)` additional space is used, given that we can check subsets without storing them explicitly beyond simple iteration indices.
- **Auxiliary Storage**: The space required for maintaining factors (limited to small square roots) is `O(sqrt(N))`.

The proposed solution accurately combines subset generation and factor checking to solve the problem within typical constraints.
