[Leetcode 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l930)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to `goal`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the length of the array `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to 30,000.

2. **What values can elements of `nums` take?**
   - `nums` is a binary array, so it contains only `0`s and `1`s.

3. **Is the goal always a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, `goal` is a non-negative integer and is typically within the possible sum bounds of the given `nums`.

4. **Can the goal be larger than the length of the array?**
   - Yes, if the array is all `1`s, the largest sum is the length of the array. The goal can be any value within this range or less.

5. **What should be returned if no subarray fulfills the requirement?**
   - Return `0` in that case.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a hash map to track the cumulative sum of elements as we iterate through the array. This hash map will help us quickly determine how many times a given cumulative sum has occurred previously.

The approach involves:

1. Calculating a running cumulative sum while iterating through the array.
2. For each cumulative sum, checking if `cumulative sum - goal` exists in our hash map. If it does, the value in the hash map represents the number of subarrays ending at the current index which sum to `goal`.
3. Updating the hash map to include the current cumulative sum.

By leveraging this method, we avoid the inefficiency of examining all possible subarrays directly.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numSubarraysWithSum(vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        unordered_map<int, int> sumCount;
        sumCount[0] = 1; // Base case to handle a subarray that starts from the beginning.
        int cumulativeSum = 0;
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            cumulativeSum += num;
            if (sumCount.find(cumulativeSum - goal) != sumCount.end()) {
                result += sumCount[cumulativeSum - goal];
            }
            sumCount[cumulativeSum]++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. 
  - The algorithm only passes through the array once, and each hash map operation (insert, find) is average-case O(1).

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` in the worst-case scenario when all cumulative sums are unique, and we need to store each in the hash map. However, in practice, the space complexity tends to be much lower due to limited number of distinct sums (because we are dealing with a binary array).
