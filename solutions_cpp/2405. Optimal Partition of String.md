[Leetcode 2405. Optimal Partition of String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2405)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`, and you need to partition the string into the minimum number of substrings such that no letter appears more than once in any substring.

Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

Example:
- Input: `s = "abacaba"`
- Output: `4`
  Explanation: The Substrings are `["a", "b", "ac", "aba"]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input string `s` guaranteed to only contain lowercase English letters?
2. What should be the expected behavior if the input string is empty?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach with the help of a set to keep track of characters that have already appeared in the current substring. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of characters in the current substring.
2. Iterate over each character in the string `s`.
3. For each character, check if it is already in the set:
   - If it is, it implies the current substring needs to end here. Increment the partition count and reset the set.
   - Add the current character to the set.
4. After the loop, the partition count will be the result of the minimum substrings required.

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm runs in linear time \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string. This is because we are making a single pass through the string and performing constant-time operations for each character.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

int partitionString(std::string s) {
    std::unordered_set<char> seenChars;
    int partitionCount = 1;

    for (char c : s) {
        if (seenChars.find(c) != seenChars.end()) {
            // Character already seen, so start a new partition
            partitionCount++;
            seenChars.clear();
        }
        seenChars.insert(c);
    }

    return partitionCount;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "abacaba";
    std::cout << "Minimum partitions: " << partitionString(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code will correctly compute the minimum number of substrings required such that no letter appears more than once in any substring, effectively solving the given problem.
