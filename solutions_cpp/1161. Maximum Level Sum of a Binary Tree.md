[Leetcode 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1161)
Sure, let's tackle the problem "Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree" from LeetCode.

## Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, the task is to return the level (1-indexed) with the maximum sum of values. If there is a tie, return the smallest level number.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we start writing the code, let's clarify a few details:

1. **Input Constraints**: Can I assume that the input binary tree will have at least one node?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the binary tree has at least one node.

2. **Node Values**: Can the node values be negative?
   - Yes, node values can be negative, zero, or positive.

3. **Tree Height**: Is there any limit on the height of the tree?
   - No explicit limit provided, so our solution should handle arbitrarily large trees within practical constraints.

4. **Expected Output**: Should the output always be a valid level number?
   - Yes, it should always be a valid level number since the tree has at least one node.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can perform a level-order traversal (Breadth-First Search) of the binary tree using a queue. During the traversal, we will keep track of the sum of node values at each level. We will maintain a record of the maximum sum encountered and the corresponding level number. Here are the steps in detail:

1. Initialize a queue for level-order traversal.
2. Use a variable to keep track of the current level number.
3. For each level, compute the sum of node values.
4. Update the maximum sum and the corresponding level if the current level's sum is greater.
5. Continue this process until all levels are processed.
6. Return the level number with the maximum sum.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the level with the maximum sum.

## Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;

        int maxSum = INT_MIN;
        int maxLevel = 1;
        int currentLevel = 1;

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            int currentLevelSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                currentLevelSum += node->val;
                
                if (node->left != nullptr) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right != nullptr) q.push(node->right);
            }

            if (currentLevelSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = currentLevelSum;
                maxLevel = currentLevel;
            }

            ++currentLevel;
        }

        return maxLevel;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the level-order traversal.

The space complexity is also \(O(N)\) due to the queue used for level-order traversal, which at most will hold nodes at the deepest level (in the worst case, \(N/2\) nodes).
