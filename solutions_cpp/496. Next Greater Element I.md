[Leetcode 496. Next Greater Element I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l496)
### Problem Statement:

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`, return an array representing the Next Greater Element for each element in `nums1` in the order of their appearance in `nums1`.

The Next Greater Element for an element `x` in `nums1` is the first greater element on the right of `x` in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for that number.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Are the elements in `nums1` and `nums2` unique?
   - Yes, all elements are unique.
   
2. What is the maximum value for the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - The length of `nums1` and `nums2` will not exceed 1000.

### Strategy:

1. Utilize a stack to track the Next Greater Element.
2. Traverse `nums2` from right to left. Maintain a stack that stores elements in decreasing order.
3. For each element in `nums2`:
   - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current element, pop from the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, it means there's no greater element to the right, so store -1.
   - Otherwise, the top of the stack is the next greater element, so store it.
4. Store the results in a hash map to quickly lookup results for elements in `nums1`.
5. Iterate through `nums1` and use the hash map to build the result array.

### Code:

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    unordered_map<int, int> ngeMap;
    stack<int> s;
    
    // Traverse nums2 from right to left
    for (int i = nums2.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        int num = nums2[i];
        // Maintain a decreasing stack
        while (!s.empty() && s.top() <= num) {
            s.pop();
        }
        // If stack is empty, no next greater element
        if (s.empty()) {
            ngeMap[num] = -1;
        } else {
            // Top of stack is the next greater element
            ngeMap[num] = s.top();
        }
        // Push the current num onto the stack
        s.push(num);
    }
    
    // Prepare the result for nums1 based on the hashmap
    vector<int> result;
    for (int num : nums1) {
        result.push_back(ngeMap[num]);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Building the map**: O(n) where n is the length of `nums2` because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Generating the result**: O(m) where m is the length of `nums1` by simply looking up in the hash map.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**.

### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is **O(n)** for the hash map and stack used to store elements of `nums2`. Here, `n` is the length of `nums2`.

The suggested approach efficiently handles the problem by combining the stack data structure for next greater element calculation and hash map for quick lookups.
