[Leetcode 2718. Sum of Matrix After Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2718)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix initially filled with all 0's and a list of queries. Each query is represented by a four-element list `[type, index, value]`.

- `type` can be 0 (row) or 1 (column)
- `index` is the row or column index to apply the query
- `value` is the value to add to each element of the specified row or column

Your task is to process all the queries and return the sum of the matrix after all the queries have been applied.

**Example:**
```
Input: m = 3, n = 4, queries = [[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2]]
Output: 15

Explanation:
Initially, the matrix is:
[[0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]

After applying query [0, 0, 1], the matrix becomes:
[[1, 1, 1, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0]]

Next, applying query [1, 1, 3], the matrix becomes:
[[1, 4, 1, 1],
 [0, 3, 0, 0],
 [0, 3, 0, 0]]

Finally, applying query [0, 1, 2], the matrix becomes:
[[1, 4, 1, 1],
 [2, 5, 2, 2],
 [0, 3, 0, 0]]

The sum of the matrix is 15.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the indices provided in the queries always be within the range of the matrix dimensions?**
   - Yes, the indices will always be valid.

2. **Do we need to handle multiple queries affecting the same row or column?**
   - Yes, each query will add to the current value of the row or column.

3. **What are the constraints on the size of the matrix and number of queries?**
   - The constraints will be such that an efficient solution is necessary.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize the matrix** with dimensions `m x n` filled with zeros.
2. **Process each query**:
   - For `type == 0`: Add `value` to all elements in `row = index`
   - For `type == 1`: Add `value` to all elements in `column = index`
3. **Sum all elements** of the matrix after processing all queries to obtain the final result.
4. Return the calculated sum.

## Code

Here is the C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long matrixSumQueries(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        // Initialize a m by n matrix filled with 0s
        vector<vector<int>> matrix(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Process each query
        for (const auto& query : queries) {
            int type = query[0];
            int index = query[1];
            int value = query[2];
            if (type == 0) {
                // Adding value to the entire row at `index`
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    matrix[index][j] += value;
                }
            } else if (type == 1) {
                // Adding value to the entire column at `index`
                for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                    matrix[i][index] += value;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate the sum of the matrix
        long long sum = 0;
        for (const auto& row : matrix) {
            for (int val : row) {
                sum += val;
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Initializing the `m x n` matrix takes `O(m * n)` time.
- **Processing Queries**: Each element can be updated `m` times for row queries and `n` times for column queries, resulting in `O(k * (m + n))` where `k` is the number of queries.
- **Summing the Matrix**: Summing up all elements of an `m x n` matrix takes `O(m * n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n + k * (m + n))`. Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough if `k` is kept reasonable relative to `m * n`.
