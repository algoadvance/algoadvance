[Leetcode 2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2463)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `robots` where `robots[i]` represents the position of the ith robot on an infinite number line. You are also given a 2D array `tasks` where `tasks[j][0]` is the position of the jth task and `tasks[j][1]` is the weight of the jth task.
Each robot can complete exactly one task. The cost of assigning the jth task to the ith robot is `|robots[i] - tasks[j][0]|`. 

Return the minimum total cost to complete all tasks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the number of robots always equal to the number of tasks?**
   - Yes, there is a one-to-one correspondence between robots and tasks.
   
2. **Are the weights of the tasks used in computing the cost?**
   - No, weights are not used in computing the cost, they might be for extra information.

3. **Can robots or tasks have negative positions?**
   - Yes, positions can be negative as the number line is infinite.

4. **Can tasks be assigned to multiple robots?**
   - No, each robot must be assigned exactly one task and each task must be completed by exactly one robot.

5. **Are the robots and tasks arrays always non-empty?**
   - Yes, given the problem context, they are always non-empty.

### Strategy

To solve this problem optimally:
1. **Sort** both the `robots` and `tasks` based on their positions.
2. **Use a greedy strategy** to match each robot to the nearest available task.
3. Compute the total cost by summing up the absolute differences for the optimal assignments.

### Steps:
1. Sort the `robots` array.
2. Extract and sort positions from the `tasks` array.
3. Pair each robot with the corresponding position in the sorted `tasks` array and compute the total minimum cost.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotalDistanceTraveled(vector<int>& robots, vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
        // Sort the robots positions
        sort(robots.begin(), robots.end());
        
        // Extract task positions and sort them
        vector<int> taskPositions;
        for (const auto& task : tasks) {
            taskPositions.push_back(task[0]);
        }
        sort(taskPositions.begin(), taskPositions.end());
        
        // Compute the minimum total cost
        int totalCost = 0;
        int n = robots.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            totalCost += abs(robots[i] - taskPositions[i]);
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
};

// You can test the implementation using the following sample inputs
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> robots = {1, 3, 5};
    vector<vector<int>> tasks = {{4, 1}, {2, 8}, {7, 10}};
    int result = solution.minimumTotalDistanceTraveled(robots, tasks);
    // Expected output: 3 (optimal assignment is: (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 7) 
    // resulting in costs 1 + 1 + 2)
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** both `robots` and `tasks` positions takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of robots/tasks.
- **Computing the total cost** takes `O(n)` time.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.

This approach ensures that each robot-task pairing minimizes the total travel distance, leveraging the properties of sorted arrays.
