[Leetcode 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l847)
### Problem Statement

The problem "Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes" (LeetCode 847) can be summarized as follows:

You have an undirected, connected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes `j` such that there is an edge between nodes `i` and `j`. Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should the function signature look like?**
   The function signature should be `int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph)`.

2. **Can the input graph contain loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   No, the graph is simple (undirected with no loops or multiple edges).

3. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   Yes, the graph is guaranteed to be connected.

4. **What is the range of `n` (number of nodes)?**
   Considering the graph is connected, typically, constraints are up to a few dozen nodes given the problem's nature.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) with State Compression**: 
   - Use a queue to perform BFS where each state is represented by a tuple `(node, visited)`:
     - `node` is the current node.
     - `visited` is a bitmask representing the set of visited nodes.
   - Start BFS from every node, as the start node can be any node.

2. **Visited State Management**:
   - Use a `set` or `map` to keep track of visited states `(node, visited)` to prevent re-processing.

3. **End Condition**:
   - The process is complete when `visited` bitmask has all bits set (i.e., `visited == (1 << n) - 1`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        if (n == 1) return 0;

        queue<tuple<int, int, int>> q;
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        int all_visited = (1 << n) - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            q.push({i, 1 << i, 0});
            visited.insert((i << 16) | (1 << i));
        }

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [node, mask, dist] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                int next_mask = mask | (1 << neighbor);
                if (next_mask == all_visited) {
                    return dist + 1;
                }
                int hash = (neighbor << 16) | next_mask;
                if (visited.find(hash) == visited.end()) {
                    q.push({neighbor, next_mask, dist + 1});
                    visited.insert(hash);
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // This line should never be reached
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n * 2^n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes. This is because there can be up to `2^n` different states for the bitmask and `n` possible current nodes, causing the combination of states to drive the complexity.

### Conclusion

This approach uses BFS with state compression to ensure that we efficiently find the shortest path that visits all nodes in the graph. The algorithm ensures that we minimize both the path length and the reprocessing of states to find the optimal solution for this problem.
