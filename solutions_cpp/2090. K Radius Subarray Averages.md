[Leetcode 2090. K Radius Subarray Averages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2090)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of `n` integers, and an integer `k`.

The *k-radius subarray average* for some index `i` with the radius `k` is the average of all elements in `nums` between the indices `i - k` and `i + k` (inclusive). If there are less than `k` elements before or after the index `i`, the *k-radius subarray average* is -1.

Build and return an array `avgs` of length `n` where `avgs[i]` is the *k-radius subarray average* for the index `i` or -1 if it does not exist.

The average of `x` elements is computed as the sum of the `x` elements divided by `x`, using integer division. The result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
Output: [-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in `nums`**: Do all elements of `nums` fall within a specific range?
   - **Response**: Usually, elements could be up to `10^5` in absolute value as typical constraint in such problems.
   
2. **Size of the array**: What is the maximum size of `n`?
   - **Response**: The length of `n` could be up to `10^5`.

3. **k constraint**: What is the range of `k`?
   - **Response**: `k` can be from `0` to `n // 2`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create the result array `avgs` initialized with `-1` of the same length as `nums`.
2. **Sliding Window Sum**: Maintain a sliding window sum of size `2k+1`.
3. **Calculate Averages**: For each valid index `i` from `k` to `n-k-1`, calculate the sum of the subarray `[i-k, i+k]` and compute the average as required.

Using a sliding window approach minimizes the number of operations by avoiding recalculating the entire sum at each step. Instead, we'll adjust the sum by adding the new element entering the window and subtracting the element exiting the window.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation for the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<int> getAverages(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> avgs(n, -1);
    if (n < 2 * k + 1) return avgs; 

    long long window_sum = 0;
    int window_size = 2 * k + 1;

    // Initial sum of the first window [0, 2k]
    for (int i = 0; i < window_size; ++i) {
        window_sum += nums[i];
    }

    // Compute averages
    for (int i = k; i < n - k; ++i) {
        if (i > k) {
            // Slide the window right
            window_sum = window_sum - nums[i - k - 1] + nums[i + k];
        }
        avgs[i] = window_sum / window_size;
    }

    return avgs;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the `avgs` array takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Sliding Window**:
  - The first window sum computation takes \(O(k)\).
  - Sliding the window across the array takes \(O(n)\) because each addition and subtraction operation takes constant time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), making this solution efficient even for larger input sizes.
