[Leetcode 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2257)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a grid with `m` rows and `n` columns. Additionally, you are given two 2D arrays `guards` and `walls` where:

- `guards[i] = [rowi, coli]` means there is a guard in the cell `(row[i], col[i])`.
- `walls[i] = [rowi, coli]` means there is a wall in the cell `(row[i], col[i])`.

A guard can observe all cells in the same row and column unless obstructed by a wall. Your task is to return the number of unguarded cells in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can multiple guards influence the same cell?
   - Yes, guards can influence the same cell, but it will be counted as guarded if at least one can see it.
   
2. Is it safe to assume that coordinates for guards and walls will be within the grid size limits `m` and `n`?
   - Yes, the input constraints ensure that.

3. What is the maximum size of the grid?
   - The constraints specify the sizes, but let's assume they fit within standard computational limits, typically `m, n <= 1000`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D grid to mark the status of cells: empty, wall, guard, and guarded.

2. **Place Guards and Walls:**
   - Mark the positions of guards and walls on the grid.

3. **Simulate Guard Vision:**
   - For each guard, mark all cells it can observe horizontally and vertically until a wall blocks the path.

4. **Count Unguarded Cells:**
   - Count cells that are neither guarded nor contain a guard or wall.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int countUnguardedCells(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& guards, vector<vector<int>>& walls) {
    vector<vector<char>> grid(m, vector<char>(n, 'E')); // 'E' for Empty
    
    // Place Guards
    for (auto& guard : guards) {
        grid[guard[0]][guard[1]] = 'G';
    }
    
    // Place Walls
    for (auto& wall : walls) {
        grid[wall[0]][wall[1]] = 'W';
    }

    // Directions: Right, Down, Left, Up
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};
    
    // Function to mark guard's vision
    auto markVision = [&](int row, int col, int dRow, int dCol) {
        int r = row + dRow;
        int c = col + dCol;
        while (r >= 0 && r < m && c >= 0 && c < n && grid[r][c] != 'W') {
            if (grid[r][c] == 'E') {
                grid[r][c] = 'V'; // 'V' for Vision (guarded but not a guard)
            }
            r += dRow;
            c += dCol;
        }
    };
    
    // Mark the vision of each guard
    for (auto& guard : guards) {
        int row = guard[0];
        int col = guard[1];
        for (auto& direction : directions) {
            markVision(row, col, direction[0], direction[1]);
        }
    }

    // Count unguarded cells
    int unguardedCells = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 'E') {
                ++unguardedCells;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return unguardedCells;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization and Placement of Guards/Walls:** O(G + W), where G and W are the number of guards and walls respectively.
- **Marking Guard Vision:** Each guard influences up to `O(m + n)` cells. Thus for all guards, it is `O(G * (m + n))`.
- **Counting Unguarded Cells:** O(m * n).

The overall time complexity is `O(G * (m + n) + m * n)`.

- G: Number of guards
- W: Number of walls
- m: Number of rows
- n: Number of columns

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient.
