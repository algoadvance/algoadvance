[Leetcode 1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1769)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` boxes. Each box is represented by a binary string `boxes`, where `boxes[i]` is `'0'` if the ith box is empty and `'1'` if it contains one ball.
In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the ith box.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the length of the string `boxes`?
2. Should the solution aim for optimal time complexity or is a simpler brute force solution acceptable?
3. Will `boxes` always contain at least one `'1'`?

Assuming the constraints are something like this:
- `1 <= boxes.length <= 2000`
- `boxes[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we should aim for a solution with a linear time complexity, `O(n)`, rather than a brute force `O(n^2)` solution. We can achieve this using a prefix sum approach.

1. **Prefix Calculation:**
   - Create two prefix arrays:
     - `prefix_sum` will keep track of the number of balls to the left and including the current position.
     - `prefix_ops` will keep track of the cumulative number of operations needed to bring balls to the current position.

2. **Forward Pass:**
   - Traverse the `boxes` string from left to right to fill the `prefix_sum` and `prefix_ops`.

3. **Suffix Calculation:**
   - Create two suffix arrays similar to the prefix arrays but from right to left.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - Use the prefix and suffix arrays to compute the minimum operations required for each position.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<int> minOperations(std::string boxes) {
    int n = boxes.size();
    std::vector<int> result(n, 0);
    
    // Vector to store the number of balls to the left of current index
    std::vector<int> prefix_sum(n, 0);
    // Vector to store the number of operations up to the current index
    std::vector<int> prefix_ops(n, 0);
    
    int balls_to_left = 0, ops_to_left = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i] = balls_to_left;
        prefix_ops[i] = ops_to_left;
        
        if (boxes[i] == '1') {
            balls_to_left += 1;
        }
        ops_to_left += balls_to_left;
    }
    
    // Vector to store the number of balls to the right of current index
    std::vector<int> suffix_sum(n, 0);
    // Vector to store the number of operations up to the current index
    std::vector<int> suffix_ops(n, 0);
    
    int balls_to_right = 0, ops_to_right = 0;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        suffix_sum[i] = balls_to_right;
        suffix_ops[i] = ops_to_right;
        
        if (boxes[i] == '1') {
            balls_to_right += 1;
        }
        ops_to_right += balls_to_right;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[i] = prefix_ops[i] + suffix_ops[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves two passes over the input string:
  - One forward pass (`O(n)`).
  - One backward pass (`O(n)`).
- So, the total time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Testing

Tests should be created to validate that the above function works correctly in various scenarios, including edge cases like a single box or all boxes being empty except one.

**Example Test Cases:**

1. `boxes = "110"` should return `[1, 1, 3]`.
2. `boxes = "001011"` should return `[11, 8, 5, 4, 3, 4]`.

With the above strategy and code implementation, we can efficiently determine the minimum number of operations needed to move all balls to each box in an optimal linear time complexity.
