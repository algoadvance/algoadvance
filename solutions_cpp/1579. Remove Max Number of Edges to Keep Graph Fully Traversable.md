[Leetcode 1579. Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1579)
## Problem Statement
Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of `n` nodes and three types of edges:

1. Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
2. Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
3. Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array `edges`, where `(type_i, u_i, v_i)` represents an edge of type `type_i` between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`, your task is to find the maximum number of edges you can remove from the graph such that the graph is still fully traversable by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversable if there is a path between any two nodes for Alice and any two nodes for Bob.

If it is impossible to make the graph fully traversable by both Alice and Bob, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:** 
    - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
    - `1 <= edges.length <= min(10^5, 3 * n * (n - 1) / 2)`
    - `edges[i].length == 3`
    - `1 <= type_i <= 3`
    - `1 <= u_i < v_i <= n`
    - All triples `(type_i, u_i, v_i)` are unique

2. **Output:** Return the maximum number of edges that can be removed while keeping the graph fully traversable by both Alice and Bob or `-1` if it's not possible.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU):

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** We'll create two instances of Union-Find, one for Alice and one for Bob.

2. **Process Type 3 edges (shared edges):** These edges are beneficial for both Alice and Bob, and should be processed first. They will help in reducing the number of required edges for connectivity.

3. **Process Type 1 and Type 2 edges independently:** These edges are specific to Alice or Bob and should be processed after type 3 edges.

4. **Check Connectivity:** After processing all edges, we need to ensure that both Alice and Bob can traverse the entire graph:
    - Alice's Union-Find instance should have all nodes connected.
    - Bob's Union-Find instance should have all nodes connected.

5. **Count removable edges:** The total number of edges minus the used edges gives the removable edges.

6. **Early Exit:** If at any point, it becomes impossible to keep the graph fully traversable for both Alice and Bob, return `-1`.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

class UnionFind {
public:
    std::vector<int> parent;
    std::vector<int> rank;
    int components;

    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 0), components(n) {
        std::iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
    }

    int find(int u) {
        if (parent[u] != u) {
            parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
        }
        return parent[u];
    }

    bool unite(int u, int v) {
        int root_u = find(u);
        int root_v = find(v);
        if (root_u != root_v) {
            if (rank[root_u] > rank[root_v]) {
                parent[root_v] = root_u;
            } else if (rank[root_u] < rank[root_v]) {
                parent[root_u] = root_v;
            } else {
                parent[root_v] = root_u;
                rank[root_u]++;
            }
            components--;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    bool isConnected() {
        return components == 1;
    }
};

int maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& edges) {
    UnionFind uf_alice(n), uf_bob(n);
    int used_edges = 0;

    for (const auto &edge : edges) {
        if (edge[0] == 3) {
            bool used_by_alice = uf_alice.unite(edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1);
            bool used_by_bob = uf_bob.unite(edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1);
            if (used_by_alice || used_by_bob) {
                used_edges++;
            }
        }
    }

    for (const auto &edge : edges) {
        if (edge[0] == 1) {
            if (uf_alice.unite(edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1)) {
                used_edges++;
            }
        } else if (edge[0] == 2) {
            if (uf_bob.unite(edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1)) {
                used_edges++;
            }
        }
    }

    if (uf_alice.isConnected() && uf_bob.isConnected()) {
        return edges.size() - used_edges;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** Each Union-Find operation (`find` and `unite`) is nearly constant time, O(α(n)), where α is the Inverse-Ackermann function. For practical purposes, it can be considered constant.
- **Edge Processing:** Processing each edge is O(1).

Thus, the total time complexity is O(E), where E is the number of edges.
