[Leetcode 3028. Ant on the Boundary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3028)
### Problem Statement

3028. **Ant on the Boundary-out**

You're given the width `width` and the height `height` of a rectangular grid where the cells are partitioned. An ant starts at the position `(x, y)` at time `t = 0` and moves in a straight path, bouncing off the boundaries of the grid. The ant moves at a speed of one cell per second.

Given the current position of the ant, determine the coordinates of the ant after `t` seconds.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - What happens when the ant hits a boundary? Does it reverse its direction?
   
   **Answer:** Yes, when the ant hits a boundary, it bounces back in the opposite direction.

2. **Initial Position:**
   - Can the initial position `(x, y)` be on the boundary?

   **Answer:** Yes, the initial position can be anywhere within the grid including on the boundaries.

3. **Time `t`:**
   - Is `t` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?
   
   **Answer:** Yes, `t` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the width or height is 1? How should movements be handled?
   
   **Answer:** The movements are within the single row or column, and the ant just bounces back and forth, behaving like a 1D motion.

### Strategy

To determine the position of the ant after `t` seconds:
1. Observe the periodic nature of the ant's motion:
   - In the x-direction, the ant moves from 0 to `width` and back, treating the motion as bouncing at the endpoints.
   - Similarly, in the y-direction, the ant moves from 0 to `height` and back.

2. **X-coordinate Calculation:**
   - The effective distance the ant moves horizontally is `(x + t) % (2 * width)`.
   - If this distance exceeds `width`, the ant is on the bounce-back path.

3. **Y-coordinate Calculation:**
   - The effective distance the ant moves vertically is `(y + t) % (2 * height)`.
   - If this distance exceeds `height`, the ant is on the bounce-back path.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> antPosition(int width, int height, int x, int y, int t) {
    // Calculate the new coordinates
    int x_distance = (x + t) % (2 * width);
    int y_distance = (y + t) % (2 * height);
    
    int new_x = (x_distance < width) ? x_distance : (2 * width - x_distance);
    int new_y = (y_distance < height) ? y_distance : (2 * height - y_distance);
    
    return {new_x, new_y};
}

int main() {
    int width = 5, height = 4;
    int x = 1, y = 0, t = 10;
    std::vector<int> position = antPosition(width, height, x, y, t);
    std::cout << "Position after " << t << " seconds: (" << position[0] << ", " << position[1] << ")" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - The calculations for the new coordinates after `t` seconds involve basic arithmetic and modulus operations, which are all constant time.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - Only a few integer variables are used to store intermediate values and the final result.

By following this strategy and implementation, the ant's new position can be efficiently calculated after any given `t` seconds.
