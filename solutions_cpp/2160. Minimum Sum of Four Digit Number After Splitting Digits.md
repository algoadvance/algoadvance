[Leetcode 2160. Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2160)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `num` consisting of exactly four digits. You need to split `num` into two new integers `new1` and `new2` by rearranging its digits. The task is to return the minimum possible sum of `new1` and `new2`.

Example:
- Input: `num = 2932`
- Output: `52`

The possible pairs of `new1` and `new2` after rearranging the digits can be (29, 23) leading to the minimum sum 52.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `num` have leading zeros?**
   - No, `num` is a positive integer with exactly four digits (1000 to 9999).

2. **Do `new1` and `new2` need to be non-zero integers?**
   - Yes, `new1` and `new2` should be non-zero integers formed by using exactly two of the digits from `num`.

3. **Is there any constraint on which digits should go into `new1` and `new2`?**
   - No, you can use any pair of digits to form the integers, but each digit from `num` must be used exactly once.

### Strategy

To achieve the minimum sum:
1. Extract and sort the digits of `num`.
2. Use the smallest two digits to form one number and the larger two digits to form another, ensuring they are combined in such a way that their sum is minimized.

Steps:
1. Extract digits from `num`.
2. Sort these digits.
3. Form the smallest possible integers using these digits as described.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the solution strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumSum(int num) {
    // Extract digits
    std::vector<int> digits;
    while (num > 0) {
        digits.push_back(num % 10);
        num /= 10;
    }
    
    // Sort the digits
    std::sort(digits.begin(), digits.end());
    
    // Form two numbers such that their sum is minimized
    int new1 = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2];
    int new2 = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3];
    
    return new1 + new2;
}

// Driver code to test the function
int main() {
    int num = 2932;
    std::cout << "Minimum sum: " << minimumSum(num) << std::endl; // Output should be 52
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Extracting digits**: `O(1)` since the number has a fixed number of digits (4).
- **Sorting digits**: `O(4 log 4)`, but as this is a constant size, it simplifies to `O(1)` in practical terms.
- **Forming the numbers and their sum**: `O(1)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(1)` considering the constraints.

This ensures that the solution is optimal and efficient for the given problem constraints.
