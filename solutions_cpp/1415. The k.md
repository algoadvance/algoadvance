[Leetcode 1415. The k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1415)
### Problem Statement
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k-th` lexicographical string of length `n` that can be composed using the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. A string is called happy if it does not have any consecutive characters that are the same.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Validity:** What are the constraints on the values of `n` and `k`? Are they guaranteed to be within certain bounds?
   - Typical constraints might be `1 <= n <= 10` and `1 <= k <= possible number of happy strings of length `n`.
   
2. **Output:** If `k` exceeds the number of happy strings of length `n`, should we return an empty string?
   - Yes, if `k` is larger than the total number of happy strings possible, return an empty string.

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Generation with Backtracking:**
   - Generate all happy strings of length `n` using a recursive approach with backtracking.
   - Maintain a count and stop the generation once the `k-th` happy string is found.
   
2. **While Backtracking:**
   - Ensure no two consecutive characters are the same.
   - Track a global counter to identify the `k-th` happy string.
   
3. **Lexicographical Order:**
   - Utilize the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a fixed lexicographical order to ensure the happy strings are generated in lexicographical order.

### Code
Here is the C++ code to solve the problem using a recursive backtracking approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    int count;
    string result;

    void generateHappy(string& str, int n, char lastChar) {
        if (str.length() == n) {
            count--;
            if (count == 0) {
                result = str;
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for (char c : {'a', 'b', 'c'}) {
            if (c != lastChar) {
                str.push_back(c);
                generateHappy(str, n, c);
                str.pop_back();
                
                if (count == 0) return; // Stop if the k-th string is found
            }
        }
    }

public:
    string getHappyString(int n, int k) {
        count = k;
        result = "";
        string current = "";
        
        generateHappy(current, n, '\0');
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Driver code (for testing purpose)
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 3, k = 9;
    string res = sol.getHappyString(n, k);
    cout << "The " << k << "-th happy string of length " << n << " is: " << res << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(3^n), as each position in the string has three potential choices, and we are generating all possible strings of length `n`.
- **Best-case Complexity:** The complexity may reduce if `k` is small because the function returns early without generating all possibilities.

### Notes
- This problem involves combinatorial string generation with specific constraints (no consecutive characters the same).
- Efficient backtracking with early stopping ensures we do not perform unnecessary computations once the k-th string is found.
