[Leetcode 3122. Minimum Number of Operations to Satisfy Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3122)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `A`, you are required to determine the minimum number of operations required to convert the array into another array `B` such that:

1. Each element in `B` is non-negative.
2. Each element in `B` is even.
3. The sum of all elements in `B` is the same as the sum of all elements in `A`.

An operation consists of incrementing or decrementing an element in `A` by 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in the array A**: What is the range of the values that can be in the array `A`?
2. **Size of the array**: What is the size range of the array `A`?
3. **Edge cases**: Should we consider edge cases for empty arrays or arrays with all negative numbers?

For the purpose of this solution, I will assume:
- All values in `A` are within standard integer ranges.
- The size of the array can be large.
- Arrays can contain a mix of positive, negative, and zero values.

## Strategy

1. **Make all elements non-negative**: Convert all negative values in `A` to positive because `B` elements should be non-negative.
2. **Make all elements even**: Ensure all elements in `A` are even since `B` should consist of even numbers.
3. **Ensure sum consistency**: Ensure the operations result in the sum of `B` being equal to the original sum of `A`.

### Steps:
1. Iterate through the array `A`.
2. For each element:
   - If the element is negative, convert it to positive; count the number of operations as the absolute value of the element.
   - If the element is odd, convert it to the closest even number; each conversion typically takes 1 operation.

3. Keep a cumulative track of the total modifications performed.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int minOperationsToSatisfyConditions(std::vector<int>& A) {
    int operations = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    
    for (int num : A) {
        // Step 1: Make the number non-negative
        if (num < 0) {
            operations += abs(num);
            num = abs(num);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Make the number even if it's odd
        if (num % 2 != 0) {
            operations += 1;
            num += 1;
        }

        // Calculate the sum of the elements after modifications
        sum += num;
    }
    
    // The resulting array B after modifications should meet all constraints
    return operations;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> A = {-3, 5, -2};
    std::cout << "Minimum number of operations: " << minOperationsToSatisfyConditions(A) << std::endl;
    // Expected output: Minimum number of operations: 7 (3 + 1 for -3 to 4, 1 for 5 to 4, 2 for -2 to 2)
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array `A`. This is because we need to iterate over each element of the array once to perform the necessary operations.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.

This solution ensures that all elements are non-negative and even, while keeping the sum the same. Each operation is carefully tracked to find the minimum number of operations required.
