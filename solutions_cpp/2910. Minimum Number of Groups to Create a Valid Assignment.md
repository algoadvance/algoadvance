[Leetcode 2910. Minimum Number of Groups to Create a Valid Assignment](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2910)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array nums containing `n` distinct integers. You need to divide the integers into the minimum number of groups where each group follows these rules:

- Each group can consist of one or more integers.
- The integers in each group must be consecutive integers from `nums`.

Return the minimum number of groups needed.

Example:

```cpp
Input: nums = [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The groups are [1, 2], [5, 6, 7], and [9].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in `nums` always distinct?**
   - Yes, the problem explicitly states that the integers are distinct.

2. **Can `nums` be an empty array?**
   - Given that `nums` can contain one or more integers, we should ensure our implementation handles the case when `nums` has only one element.

3. **Does the order of the integers in the output groups matter?**
   - No, the order does not matter as long as each group contains consecutive integers from `nums`.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** Begin by sorting the `nums` array to facilitate easy identification of consecutive groups.
2. **Iterate Through the Array:** Use a loop to identify and form groups of consecutive integers.
3. **Form Groups:** Track the last element of the current group. If the next integer is not consecutive, start a new group.
4. **Count Groups:** Maintain a count of the groups formed during the iteration.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minGroups(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array.
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    // Step 2: Initialize the group count.
    int groupCount = 0;

    // Step 3: Traverse the sorted array to form groups.
    for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        ++groupCount; // Start a new group
        
        // Continue to keep elements in the same group as long they are consecutive.
        while (i + 1 < nums.size() && nums[i + 1] == nums[i] + 1) {
            ++i;
        }
    }
    
    return groupCount; // Return the number of groups formed.
}

// Example usage.
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9};
    std::cout << "Minimum number of groups: " << minGroups(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array:** \( O(n \log n) \) where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Traversing the Array:** \( O(n) \) since we iterate through the array once to form groups.

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is \( O(n \log n) \).
