## Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1282: Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

There are `n` people, each person has a unique ID from `0` to `n - 1` and each person belongs to exactly one group. Given an array `groupSizes` of length `n` where `groupSizes[i]` is the group size for the `i`-th person.

Return a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`.

Each person must be in exactly one group, and each group (except possibly the last one) must have exactly the size specified in `groupSizes[i]`.

You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
**Input:** `groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]`  
**Output:** `[[5], [0,1,2], [3,4,6]]`

**Explanation:**  
- The first group is `[5]`. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
- The second group is `[0, 1, 2]`. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
- The third group is `[3, 4, 6]`. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can there be duplicate group sizes in the input array?
   - Yes, there can be duplicate group sizes.
2. Is the order of groups in the output important?
   - No, the order of groups in the output does not matter.

## Strategy
1. Use a hash table to accumulate people into their respective groups based on their group sizes.
2. Traverse the `groupSizes` array and append each personâ€™s ID to the list of people having the same group size.
3. When a list reaches the required group size, add it to the result and start a new list for that group size.
4. Continue this process until all people are grouped correctly.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) because we traverse the array once and perform constant time operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) to store the hash table and the result.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> groupThePeople(vector<int>& groupSizes) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> group_map;
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < groupSizes.size(); ++i) {
            int size = groupSizes[i];
            group_map[size].push_back(i);
            
            // When the current group reaches the required size, add it to the result.
            if (group_map[size].size() == size) {
                result.push_back(group_map[size]);
                group_map[size].clear();  // Clear the list for new group
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- We use an unordered map `group_map` where the key is the group size and the value is a list of person IDs.
- By iterating through `groupSizes`, we append the current index `i` to its respective group size list in `group_map`.
- When the size of the list `group_map[size]` reaches the desired group size `size`, we move that list to the result and clear the list in `group_map` to collect more people for the next group of the same size.
- Finally, `result` contains all the groups and we return it.
