[Leetcode 2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2136)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `plantTime` and `growTime`, each of length `n`. For each index `i`:
- `plantTime[i]` is the number of full days to plant the `i-th` seed.
- `growTime[i]` is the number of full days it takes for the `i-th` seed to grow after being completely planted.

You want to schedule the planting of the seeds in such a way that all seeds will be in full bloom as soon as possible. Full bloom means that the seed has been completely planted and its growth time has elapsed. Determine the earliest possible day where all the seeds are blooming.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is there a restriction on the order of planting the seeds?
   - No, you can plant the seeds in any order you wish.
   
2. Do all the seeds need to bloom simultaneously, or do we need the earliest possible day when the last seed blooms?
   - We need the earliest possible day when the last seed blooms.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: To minimize the time when all seeds are fully bloomed, a good strategy would be to plant seeds with a longer grow time first. This ensures that seeds with longer grow durations do not delay the overall blooming time unnecessarily.
2. **Simulating Planting and Growing**: Simulate the planting process by keeping track of the current day as you plant each seed and compute the day when the last seed will bloom.

### Code
Here's the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int earliestFullBloom(vector<int>& plantTime, vector<int>& growTime) {
    int n = plantTime.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> seeds(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        seeds[i] = {growTime[i], plantTime[i]};
    }
    
    // Sort by growTime in non-ascending order (longest growTime first)
    sort(seeds.begin(), seeds.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.first > b.first;
    });
    
    int currentDay = 0;
    int maxBloomDay = 0;
    
    for (const auto& seed : seeds) {
        int grow = seed.first;
        int plant = seed.second;
        
        currentDay += plant;  // Advance currentDay by plant time
        maxBloomDay = max(maxBloomDay, currentDay + grow);  // Calculate full bloom day
    }
    
    return maxBloomDay;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> plantTime = {1, 4, 3};
    vector<int> growTime = {2, 3, 1};
    cout << "Earliest possible day of full bloom: " << earliestFullBloom(plantTime, growTime) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Sorting the seeds list takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Simulation**: Iterating through the list once takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
