[Leetcode 2926. Maximum Balanced Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2926)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers `nums` containing both positive and negative elements. A subsequence of this array is called "balanced" if the sum of the absolute values of the elements is equal to the sum of the actual values of the elements.

Return the maximum sum of a balanced subsequence that can be achieved by removing some elements (possibly zero) from `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the array `nums`?
   - What is the value range of elements in `nums`?
   - Can the array be empty?

2. **Balanced Subsequence Definition:**
   - To clarify, a subsequence `sub` is balanced if `sum(abs(sub)) == sum(sub)`?

3. **Output:**
   - Should the function return an integer representing the maximum sum or the maximum balanced subsequence itself?

Let's make some reasonable assumptions for now:
- The length of `nums` will be between 1 and \(10^5\).
- Each element in `nums` is an integer between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

### Strategy:

1. **Identifying Balanced Condition:**
   - A subsequence where the sum of the absolute values of its elements is equal to the sum of the elements means that all elements in the subsequence must be non-negative. For a subsequence to be balanced, it should contain only non-negative numbers.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Iterate over the array and form a new array containing only non-negative numbers.
   - Calculate the sum of this new array.
   - The maximum balanced subsequence sum is simply the sum of all non-negative numbers in the array.

### Code:

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int maximumBalancedSubsequenceSum(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int maxSum = 0;
    
    for (const auto& num : nums) {
        if (num >= 0) {
            maxSum += num;
        }
    }
    
    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, -2, 3, 4, -5, 6};
    std::cout << "Maximum Balanced Subsequence Sum: " << maximumBalancedSubsequenceSum(nums) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the array `nums`, because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) additional space, since we are using a single integer to keep track of the maximum sum.

This solution is efficient and leverages the properties of the balanced subsequence condition to ensure optimal performance.
