[Leetcode 1187. Make Array Strictly Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1187)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing. In one operation, you can choose any element from `arr2` and replace any element in `arr1` with that element.

**Note:**
1. Arrays are 1-indexed for the description.
2. It is guaranteed that it is possible to make the final array strictly increasing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the arrays sorted?**
   - No specific information on whether they are sorted is provided.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the array sizes?**
   - Constraints are moderate, typically arrays could have a few hundred elements.

3. **Are there any constraints on the elements of the arrays?**
   - Elements are integers, but no specific bounds on the integer values are mentioned.

4. **Can elements in `arr2` be reused?**
   - Yes.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - We can use a DP-based strategy, where we maintain the minimum number of operations needed to make the array strictly increasing up to each element.
   - Use a DP table where `dp[i]` keeps track of the minimal steps to make the first `i` elements of `arr1` strictly increasing.

2. **Binary Search for Efficient Replacement:**
   - Sort `arr2` to leverage binary search to find the smallest possible replacement value that maintains the strictly increasing property.

3. **Transitions for the DP Table:**
   - For each index in `arr1`, we either:
     - Keep the current element if it's already maintaining the strictly increasing property.
     - Replace it with an element from `arr2` using binary search to ensure the property is maintained.
     
### Solution Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int makeArrayIncreasing(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
        sort(arr2.begin(), arr2.end());
        arr2.erase(unique(arr2.begin(), arr2.end()), arr2.end());
        
        unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        dp[-1] = 0; // -1 as a baseline
        
        for (int num : arr1) {
            unordered_map<int, int> new_dp;
            for (auto& [prev, steps] : dp) {
                
                // Case 1: Keep current number if it's greater than previous
                if (num > prev) {
                    if (new_dp.find(num) == new_dp.end())
                        new_dp[num] = steps;
                    else
                        new_dp[num] = min(new_dp[num], steps);
                }
                
                // Case 2: Replace current number with a number from arr2
                auto it = upper_bound(arr2.begin(), arr2.end(), prev);
                if (it != arr2.end()) {
                    if (new_dp.find(*it) == new_dp.end())
                        new_dp[*it] = steps + 1;
                    else
                        new_dp[*it] = min(new_dp[*it], steps + 1);
                }
            }
            dp = new_dp;
        }
        
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for (auto& [key, steps] : dp) {
            ans = min(ans, steps);
        }
        return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting `arr2`:** O(NlogN), where N is the size of `arr2`.
2. **DP Iteration:**
   - Given T be the number of unique states for DP and M is the length of `arr1`.
   - For each element in `arr1`, we iterate possibilities including binary searches: This is \(O(M \cdot T \cdot logN)\).

Combined, the overall time complexity tends to be O(NlogN + M \cdot T \cdot logN), making this approach feasible for moderate constraints.
