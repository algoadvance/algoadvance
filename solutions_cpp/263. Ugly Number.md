[Leetcode 263. Ugly Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l263)
## Problem Statement

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return `true` if `n` is a happy number, and `false` if not.

Example:
```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1² + 9² = 82
8² + 2² = 68
6² + 8² = 100
1² + 0² + 0² = 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does `n` have any specific constraints (e.g. maximum value)?
   - Assume `n` is a positive integer.
2. Can the input number be `1`?
   - Yes, and in this case, the output should be `true`.

## Strategy

To determine if a number is a happy number:

1. Start with the given number.
2. Replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
3. Use a set to track all previously seen sums to detect if there is a cycle.
4. If the number equals 1 at any point, return `true`.
5. If a previously seen sum appears again, return `false`.

This way, we can detect cycles which indicate that the number will not reach 1.

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        std::unordered_set<int> seen;
        
        while (n != 1 && seen.find(n) == seen.end()) {
            seen.insert(n);
            n = getNext(n);
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }

private:
    int getNext(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            n = n / 10;
            sum += digit * digit;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is difficult to define exactly due to the nature of the problem. However, it is generally efficient because we are using a set to detect cycles, and operations on the set are O(1) on average. In practice, the number of iterations is relatively small.
- The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of unique numbers we see before detecting a cycle or reaching 1. In the worst-case scenario, it can be logarithmic in the number of digits of `n`.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently detect happy numbers and avoid infinite loops caused by cycles.
