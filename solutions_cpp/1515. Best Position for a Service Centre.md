[Leetcode 1515. Best Position for a Service Centre](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1515)
### Problem Statement

The problem "1515. Best Position for a Service Centre" from LeetCode involves determining the optimal location for a service center given a set of customer positions. The goal is to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances from the service center to all customer points.

We are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the ith customer on a 2D plane. We need to find the coordinates `[x, y]` for the service center such that the total Euclidean distance from this point to all customer points is minimized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the number of customer positions or their coordinates?**
    - The number of customer positions will be within reasonable limits for computational feasibility, typically under 10,000.
2. **What is the precision required for the final output coordinates?**
    - Typically, a precision constraint might be given in the problem, such as up to 1e-6.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a geometric optimization algorithm called "Weiszfeld's algorithm," an iterative method used to find the geometric median.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for the service center position. A common initial guess is the centroid (arithmetic mean) of all the given customer positions.
2. **Iteration**: Iteratively adjust the position based on neighboring points using the weighted average approach until a satisfactory precision is achieved.
3. **Convergence**: Check if the changes in position are smaller than the given precision (this indicates convergence).

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing Weiszfeld's algorithm to find the optimal position for the service center:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<double> getMinDistSum(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& positions) {
        int n = positions.size();
        double x = 0, y = 0;

        // Initialize the position with the centroid of all points
        for (auto& p : positions) {
            x += p[0];
            y += p[1];
        }
        x /= n;
        y /= n;

        double eps = 1e-7; // Precision
        double change = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();

        while (change > eps) {
            double numX = 0, numY = 0, denom = 0;
            for (auto& p : positions) {
                double dx = x - p[0];
                double dy = y - p[1];
                double dist = std::sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy) + eps;
                numX += p[0] / dist;
                numY += p[1] / dist;
                denom += 1 / dist;
            }
            double newX = numX / denom;
            double newY = numY / denom;

            change = std::sqrt((newX - x) * (newX - x) + (newY - y) * (newY - y));
            x = newX;
            y = newY;
        }

        return {x, y};
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N * T)**, where:
- **N** is the number of customer positions.
- **T** is the number of iterations required for convergence. 

In practice, **T** is typically small and independent of **N**, making this approach quite efficient for reasonable input sizes.
