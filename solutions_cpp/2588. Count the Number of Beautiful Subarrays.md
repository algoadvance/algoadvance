[Leetcode 2588. Count the Number of Beautiful Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2588)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. A subarray of `nums` is called beautiful if the sum of the subarray is equal to a specified value `target`. Determine the number of beautiful subarrays in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Size of `nums`**: Is there any constraint on the size of the array?
2. **Range of Values**: What is the range of values in `nums` and `target`?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should we handle cases where the input array is empty or where `target` is zero or negative, considering the elements are positive integers?

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we can leverage the "sliding window" or "prefix sum + hash map" techniques, given that we are dealing with subarray sum problems. The latter technique often provides a more straightforward approach for counting subarrays with a specified sum in linear time.

**Steps**:
1. Use a hash map to store the cumulative sums of the elements in `nums`.
2. Iterate through the array, computing the cumulative sum.
3. For each cumulative sum, check if there is a previous cumulative sum that satisfies the condition:
   \[
   \text{current\_cumulative\_sum} - \text{target} = \text{previous\_cumulative\_sum}
   \]
4. If such a previous cumulative sum exists, it indicates that the subarray between these two sums adds up to the `target`.
5. Maintain a count of such valid subarrays.

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation based on the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countBeautifulSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> sumCount;  // To store frequency of cumulative sums.
        int cumulativeSum = 0;
        int beautifulSubarrayCount = 0;

        // Initialize the map with the base condition.
        sumCount[0] = 1;

        for (int num : nums) {
            cumulativeSum += num;

            // Check if there exists a subarray with the required sum.
            if (sumCount.find(cumulativeSum - target) != sumCount.end()) {
                beautifulSubarrayCount += sumCount[cumulativeSum - target];
            }

            // Update the cumulative sum frequency in the map.
            sumCount[cumulativeSum]++;
        }

        return beautifulSubarrayCount;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`, since we are iterating through the array once and performing O(1) operations for each element (lookup and insertions in the hash map).

- **Space Complexity**: This is also **O(n)** in the worst case because, in the worst scenario, all cumulative sums are different and need to be stored in the hash map.
