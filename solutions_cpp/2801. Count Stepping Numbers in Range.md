[Leetcode 2801. Count Stepping Numbers in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2801)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers `low` and `high`. A **stepping number** is an integer such that the absolute difference between any two consecutive digits is equal to 1. For example, 321 is a stepping number while 421 is not. 

Your task is to return the count of all the stepping numbers in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the ranges for `low` and `high`? 
   - Can `low` and `high` be very large which might cause performance issues with a naive approach?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should we consider the bounds inclusive?
   - What should be the return type of the function?

3. **Special Cases:**
   - Should we handle cases where `low > high`?
   - Are single-digit numbers considered stepping numbers?

### Code

Here is a C++ solution using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to generate stepping numbers in the given range:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

int countSteppingNumbers(int low, int high) {
    if (low > high) return 0;

    auto isStepping = [](int num) -> bool {
        std::string s = std::to_string(num);
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            if (std::abs(s[i] - s[i - 1]) != 1) return false;
        }
        return true;
    };
    
    std::queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) q.push(i);

    int count = 0;

    if (low == 0) ++count;  // 0 is a stepping number

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int num = q.front();
        q.pop();

        if (num > high) continue;
        if (num >= low && num <= high) ++count;

        int lastDigit = num % 10;
        if (lastDigit > 0) {
            int newNum = num * 10 + (lastDigit - 1);
            if (newNum <= high) q.push(newNum);
        }
        if (lastDigit < 9) {
            int newNum = num * 10 + (lastDigit + 1);
            if (newNum <= high) q.push(newNum);
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    int low = 0, high = 21;
    std::cout << "Count of stepping numbers in range [" << low << ", " << high << "]: " << countSteppingNumbers(low, high) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Start with single-digit numbers (1 to 9). The number 0 is considered separately if `low` is 0.
   - For each number, generate new numbers by appending digits such that the absolute difference between the last digit and the new digit is 1.
   - Use a queue to systematically explore these numbers in a breadth-first manner.
   - Count the numbers that fall within the range `[low, high]`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Check if `low == 0` to include 0 as a stepping number.
   - Skip numbers that are larger than `high` during the generation process.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The method leverages BFS to ensure each number is processed in sequence, avoiding redundant checks.
   - As numbers grow, they naturally stop being enqueued if they exceed `high`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the number of stepping numbers that can potentially be generated within the range. This is because each number is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the queue to store intermediate numbers.

This approach efficiently generates and counts stepping numbers without exhaustively checking each number in the given range.
