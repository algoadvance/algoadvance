[Leetcode 1080. Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1080)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree and an integer *limit*, delete all insufficient nodes in the tree. A node is considered insufficient if every root-to-leaf path intersecting this node has a sum strictly less than *limit*. You need to return the root of the pruned tree. The definition of a binary tree node is given below:

```cpp
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the tree contain only integers?**
   - Yes, node values are integers.
2. **Can the limit be negative?**
   - Yes, the limit can be any integer.
3. **What should we return if the entire tree is insufficient?**
   - In this case, return `nullptr`.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach**: We'll use a depth-first search approach, traversing each node and tracking the sum of the path from root to the current node.
2. **Backtracking**: As we traverse the tree, if both left and right subtrees of a node are pruned away (i.e., returned `nullptr`) and the path sum including this node is less than the limit, then this node should also be pruned.
3. **Base Case**: If a node is a leaf, return `nullptr` if the path sum (including this node) is less than the limit, otherwise return the node.

### Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sufficientSubset(TreeNode* root, int limit) {
        return dfs(root, 0, limit);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* dfs(TreeNode* node, int current_sum, int limit) {
        if (!node) return nullptr;
        
        current_sum += node->val;
        
        // If it is a leaf node
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            return current_sum < limit ? nullptr : node;
        }
        
        node->left = dfs(node->left, current_sum, limit);
        node->right = dfs(node->right, current_sum, limit);
        
        // If both left and right sub-trees are pruned, prune this node as well
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        return node;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H) where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the implicit call stack in the depth-first search recursion. In the worst case, this can be O(N) for a skewed tree.

This solution ensures that each node is evaluated based on the sums of all root-to-leaf paths passing through it, and only nodes that don't meet the condition are pruned.
