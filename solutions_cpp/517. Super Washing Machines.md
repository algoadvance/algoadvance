[Leetcode 517. Super Washing Machines](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l517)
### Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

You have n super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses or is empty. For each move, you can choose any `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ n) washing machines, and pass one dress of these `m` washing machines to one of the adjacent washing machines at the same time.

Given an array `machines` representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraint:** What is the maximum length of the array `machines`?
   - Usually, LeetCode problems handle arrays up to 10^4 to 10^5 elements, unless otherwise specified.
   
2. **Initial Values:** Can the initial values in `machines` contain negative counts?
   - No, washing machines count (dresses) should be non-negative.

3. **Output Specification:** Should the output be in integer format representing the minimum moves?
   - Yes, the output should be an integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to distribute the dresses as uniformly as possible. Here’s the strategy we can use:

1. **Total Dresses:** Compute the total number of dresses. If it cannot be evenly divided among the washing machines, return `-1`.

2. **Target Dresses:** Calculate the target number of dresses each machine should have.

3. **Simulation:** Use a simulation approach to keep track of the balance (difference with the target) and the moving dresses.
    - `balance`: This accumulates the current load imbalance encountered so far.
    - `moves`: Requires keeping track of the maximum balance encountered at any machine use the concept of prefix sums to manage distribution over the indices.

Here is the plan in code:

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int findMinMoves(vector<int>& machines) {
    int n = machines.size();
    int totalDresses = 0;
    for (int dresses : machines) {
        totalDresses += dresses;
    }
    
    // If totalDresses is not divisible by n, it's impossible to balance.
    if (totalDresses % n != 0) return -1;
    
    int target = totalDresses / n;
    int balance = 0, maxMoves = 0;
    for (int dresses : machines) {
        balance += dresses - target;
        maxMoves = max(maxMoves, max(abs(balance), dresses - target));
    }
    
    return maxMoves;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of washing machines. This is because:
- We iterate through the list of machines twice:
  1. Once to calculate `totalDresses`.
  2. Once to calculate `balance` and find `maxMoves`.

Thus, the approach is efficient for large inputs up to 10^5 elements.
