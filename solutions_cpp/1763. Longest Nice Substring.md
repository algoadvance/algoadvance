[Leetcode 1763. Longest Nice Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1763)
## Problem Statement:
A string `s` is considered **nice** if, for every character in `s`, the corresponding uppercase and lowercase characters both exist in `s`. 

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are no nice substrings, return an empty string.

### Example:
1. **Input:** s = "YazaAay"
   **Output:** "aAa"
2. **Input:** s = "Bb"
   **Output:** "Bb"
3. **Input:** s = "c"
   **Output:** ""

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, the input string `s` will always have at least one character.

2. Are we considering case sensitivity for characters?
   - Yes, the problem explicitly specifies lowercase and uppercase pairs.

3. Should the solution account for non-alphabet characters?
   - No, the problem is framed around alphabetic (A-Z, a-z) characters only.

## Strategy:
1. **Recursive Approach**: 
   - If the string `s` itself is nice, return it.
   - Otherwise, split the string at points where it fails the niceness condition and recurse on those substrings.
   - Keep track of the longest nice substring found during recursion.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - A function to check if a string is nice.
   - A function to find and return the longest nice substring using recursion.

## Time Complexity:
- Checking if a string is nice takes O(n) time.
- In the worst case, the recursive function may split the string into smaller substrings many times. This can be highly inefficient for very large strings.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to check if a string is nice
bool isNice(const string &s) {
    unordered_set<char> charset(s.begin(), s.end());
    for (char c : charset) {
        if ((isupper(c) && charset.count(tolower(c)) == 0) || 
            (islower(c) && charset.count(toupper(c)) == 0)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Recursive function to find the longest nice substring
string longestNiceSubstring(const string &s) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (n < 2) return "";

    // If the entire string is nice, return it
    if (isNice(s)) return s;

    // Try to find the longest nice substring by splitting
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        string left = s.substr(0, i);
        string right = s.substr(i + 1, n - i - 1);

        if (!isNice(s.substr(i, 1))) {
            string longestLeft = longestNiceSubstring(left);
            string longestRight = longestNiceSubstring(right);
            return longestLeft.length() >= longestRight.length() ? longestLeft : longestRight;
        }
    }
    
    return "";
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cout << "Enter the string: ";
    cin >> s;
    string result = longestNiceSubstring(s);
    cout << "Longest Nice Substring: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **isNice Function**: 
   - Check each character if its case counterpart exists in the string.
   
2. **longestNiceSubstring Function**:
   - Use recursion to split when a character violates niceness.
   - Compare between left and right substrings and return the longer one.

This ensures that the solution finds the longest nice substring by systematically breaking down the problem using a divide-and-conquer approach.
