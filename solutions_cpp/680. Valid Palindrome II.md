[Leetcode 680. Valid Palindrome II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l680)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return `true` if the `s` can be a palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a palindrome?**
   - A string that reads the same backward as forward.

2. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the input string `s` will have at least one character.

3. **What characters can `s` contain?**
   - The string `s` will consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

To determine if a string can be a palindrome after deleting at most one character, we can use a two-pointer approach:

1. Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the string.
2. Iterate through the string while comparing characters at `left` and `right` pointers.
    - If characters at both pointers are equal, move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left.
    - If characters are not equal, you can either remove the character at the `left` or `right` pointer and check if the remaining substring (excluding the character) is a palindrome.

To check if a substring is a palindrome, you can write a helper function that performs this check by using a similar two-pointer technique.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(const string& s, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    bool validPalindrome(string s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] == s[right]) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                // Try removing either the left or the right character
                return isPalindrome(s, left + 1, right) || isPalindrome(s, left, right - 1);
            }
        }
    
        return true;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "abca";
    
    if (solution.validPalindrome(s)) {
        cout << "The string can be a palindrome after deleting at most one character." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The string cannot be a palindrome after deleting at most one character." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - The main check loops through the string once (`O(n)`).
   - The helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome also takes linear time (`O(n)`).
   - In the worst-case scenario, we might call the helper function twice for each mismatch, resulting in `O(n)` + `O(n)`, which simplifies to `O(n)` overall.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The additional space used by the algorithm is `O(1)` since we only use a few extra variables for the pointers.

Thus, the final time complexity is `O(n)` and the space complexity is `O(1)`.
