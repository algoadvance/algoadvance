[Leetcode 2013. Detect Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2013)
### Problem Statement

You are given points in a 2D plane. Implement a data structure that can:

1. Add a new point to the plane.
2. Count the number of ways to form axis-aligned squares with the points.

Implement the `DetectSquares` class:

- `void add(vector<int> point)` Adds a new point with coordinates `point = [x, y]` to the data structure.
- `int count(vector<int> point)` Counts the number of ways to form an axis-aligned square with `point = [x, y]` as one of the four corners.

### Strategy

First, let's outline the necessary steps:

1. **Data Storage**: Use a map (dictionary) to store the frequency of points. Specifically, we can use a map of maps where `point_count[x][y]` represents the count of point `(x, y)`.
2. **Add Operation**: For adding a point, simply update the counts in our map.
3. **Count Operation**: To find the number of squares that have the given point `(x, y)` as one of the corners:
   - For each possible point `(other_x, y)` which is aligned horizontally with `(x, y)` (`other_x != x`):
     - Determine the side length from the x-axis difference (`side_length = abs(x - other_x)`).
     - Check two possible squares using the points `(other_x, y+side_length)` and `(other_x, y - side_length)`.
     - For each of these points, verify if the opposite corners `(x, y+side_length)` and `(x, y-side_length)` exist and calculate the number of such squares.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the coordinates of the points? (Typically, it's important to know the range to ensure that our data structure can handle all input sizes efficiently.)
2. **Multiple Calls**: Can the `add` and `count` methods be called multiple times, and do they need to handle overlapping squares or points?

### Code Implementation

Below is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class DetectSquares {
private:
    unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int, int>> point_count;

public:
    DetectSquares() {
        // Constructor
    }

    void add(vector<int> point) {
        int x = point[0];
        int y = point[1];
        point_count[x][y]++;
    }

    int count(vector<int> point) {
        int x = point[0];
        int y = point[1];
        int total_squares = 0;

        if (point_count.find(x) == point_count.end()) return 0;  // No points with this x-coordinate
        
        auto& y_map = point_count[x];
        for (auto& [other_x, row_y_map] : point_count) {
            if (other_x == x) continue;  // Skip the current x-point
            
            int side_length = abs(x - other_x);

            // Check if potential square corners exist
            if (point_count[other_x].find(y) != point_count[other_x].end()) {
                total_squares += row_y_map[y] * point_count[other_x][y + side_length] * y_map[y + side_length];
                total_squares += row_y_map[y] * point_count[other_x][y - side_length] * y_map[y - side_length];
            }
        }

        return total_squares;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity

1. **Add Operation**:
   - Time Complexity: `O(1)` — Inserting a point into the map is a constant-time operation.
   
2. **Count Operation**:
   - Time Complexity: `O(n)` — In the worst case, for each counting operation, we need to inspect all possible x-coordinates, hence resulting in linear complexity relative to the number of distinct x-coordinates.

### Key Assumptions

1. We assume that the coordinates of the points are within a bounded range, allowing efficient storage and lookup in the map.
2. Multiple points at the same coordinates are properly handled by maintaining counts.

This solution should be efficient for the constraints typically presented in competitive programming and technical interviews.
