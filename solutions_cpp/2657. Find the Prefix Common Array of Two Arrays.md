[Leetcode 2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2657)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the number of indices `j` (0 <= j <= i) for which `A[j]` is equal to `B[j]`.

Return the prefix common array `C` of `A` and `B`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the arrays `A` and `B` guaranteed to be of the same length?
   - Yes, both arrays have length `n`.
 
2. Can the elements in the arrays have negative values or are they strictly non-negative?
   - Since they are permutations, they contain all integers from 0 to n-1 or 1 to n.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list `C` of the same length `n` to store the result.
2. Use two sets to keep track of the elements seen so far in `A` and `B`.
3. Iterate through both arrays simultaneously.
   - Add the current elements from both arrays `A` and `B` to their respective sets.
   - Compute the intersection of both sets to get the count of common elements up to index `i`.
   - Store this count in the corresponding position in `C`.
4. Return the list `C` after processing all elements.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of arrays `A` and `B`. This is because iterating through both arrays and updating the sets and intersection operation takes linear time.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

std::vector<int> findThePrefixCommonArray(std::vector<int>& A, std::vector<int>& B) {
    int n = A.size();
    std::vector<int> C(n, 0);
    std::unordered_set<int> setA, setB;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        setA.insert(A[i]);
        setB.insert(B[i]);

        // Count the common elements in setA and setB
        int commonCount = 0;
        for (int num : setA) {
            if (setB.find(num) != setB.end()) {
                commonCount++;
            }
        }
        C[i] = commonCount;
    }

    return C;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> A = {1, 3, 2, 4};
    std::vector<int> B = {3, 1, 2, 4};

    std::vector<int> result = findThePrefixCommonArray(A, B);

    for (int val : result) {
        std::cout << val << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. We initialize the `C` array with size `n` and filled with 0s.
2. We create two unordered sets `setA` and `setB` to store the elements seen so far in `A` and `B`.
3. We then iterate over the elements of `A` and `B`:
   - Add the current element of `A` to `setA` and the current element of `B` to `setB`.
   - Compute the number of common elements between `setA` and `setB`.
   - Store this count in `C` at index `i`.
4. Finally, we return the result array `C`.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle arrays of significant length due to its linear time complexity.
