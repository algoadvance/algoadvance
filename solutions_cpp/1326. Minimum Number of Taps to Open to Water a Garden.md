[Leetcode 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1326)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. There are `n + 1` taps located at positions `0` to `n` in a one-dimensional garden. Each tap `i` can water a range of the garden from `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it is open. 

Return the minimum number of taps that must be open to water the whole garden, or return `-1` if the entire garden cannot be watered.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at position 0 can cover the whole garden [0,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 7, ranges = [1,2,1,0,2,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The tap at position 1 can cover [0,3], position 4 can cover [2,6], and position 7 can cover [6,7].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the taps always installed at integer positions from `0` to `n`?
2. Can the values in `ranges` be negative or zero?
3. Is it guaranteed that `ranges` will always have exactly `n + 1` elements?

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& ranges) {
        vector<int> maxReach(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Gather the maximum reach for each position
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            int left = max(0, i - ranges[i]);
            int right = min(n, i + ranges[i]);
            maxReach[left] = max(maxReach[left], right);
        }
        
        int taps = 0, currEnd = 0, nextEnd = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (i > nextEnd) return -1;  // We can't reach this point
            if (i > currEnd) {
                taps++;
                currEnd = nextEnd;
            }
            nextEnd = max(nextEnd, maxReach[i]);
        }
        
        return taps;
    }
};
```

## Strategy
1. **Preprocess the Ranges:**
   - For each position `i`, calculate the effective range `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]`.
   - Modify this range to fit within `[0, n]` if it goes out of bounds.
   - Create an array `maxReach` where `maxReach[i]` stores the farthest right position that can be reached starting from or before position `i`.

2. **Greedy Approach to Cover the Garden:**
   - Initialize a count for the number of taps needed.
   - Use two pointers: `currEnd` to keep track of the end of the current tap's reach, and `nextEnd` to keep track of the farthest reach available while traversing.
   - Traverse from the start to the end of the garden. If you encounter a position that can extend the reach farther than the current tap, update `nextEnd`.
   - When you move past `currEnd`, increment the tap count and update `currEnd` to `nextEnd`.
   - If at any point, the current position exceeds `nextEnd`, return `-1` because the position is unreachable.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `ranges` contain zero ranges repeatedly and do not cover parts of the garden.
   - Single tap with coverage over entire garden.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`, because:
- We preprocess the ranges in `O(n)`.
- We then perform a single pass over the array to determine the minimum number of taps in `O(n)`.
