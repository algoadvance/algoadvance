[Leetcode 2278. Percentage of Letter in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2278)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a character `letter`, return the percentage of characters in the string `s` that equal `letter` rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length of the string `s`? (Typically, for LeetCode problems, inputs can vary, but a common constraint could be \( 1 \leq |s| \leq 1000 \)).
   - Is the string `s` guaranteed to contain only lowercase/uppercase alphabetic characters, or can there be other characters?

   - **Character Case Sensitivity**:
   - Should the comparison between characters be case-sensitive or case-insensitive?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - How should we handle an empty string or letter not present in the string? (Considering the given problem structure, we can assume the string will not be empty.)
   - Rounding down the percentage should be done using integer division, correct?

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

int percentageLetter(std::string s, char letter) {
    int count = 0;
    int length = s.length();
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == letter) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the percentage and round down
    int percentage = (count * 100) / length;
    
    return percentage;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters**:
   - We need a counter `count` to keep track of how many times `letter` appears in the string `s`.
   - Also, keep track of the length of the string using `length = s.length()`.

2. **Count Occurrences**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string:
     - If the character matches `letter`, increment the count.

3. **Calculate Percentage**:
   - Calculate the percentage of occurrences by `(count * 100) / length`.
   - Since integer division in C++ automatically floors the result towards zero, this will yield the rounded-down integer percentage directly.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the calculated percentage.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We iterate through the string once to count the occurrences, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant, as we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently even for the upper limits of string length.
