[Leetcode 1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1248)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is called nice if there are exactly `k` odd numbers on it. Return the number of nice subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a subarray?**
   - A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **What are the constraints on the array length and values?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 50000`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= k <= nums.length`

3. **Do we need to handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative k, non-array inputs)?**
   - No, the constraints guarantee valid inputs as per the problem statement.

4. **Can the array contain non-integer values or negative values?**
   - No, the constraints guarantee that all elements are positive integers.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we can use a hash map and the prefix sum method:

1. **Prefix Sum and Hash Map Approach:**
   - Maintain a running count of the number of odd numbers encountered so far as we iterate through the array.
   - Use a hash map to record the frequency of occurrences of each count.
   - For each element in the array, if the count of odd numbers so far is `current_count`, we check if there exists a prefix with a count of `current_count - k` in the hash map. If it exists, it means that there are that many subarrays ending at the current position which have exactly `k` odd numbers.
   - Increment the hash map with the current count of odd numbers encountered so far as you progress through the array.

This approach avoids the need for nested loops and ensures efficient computation.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the array because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case due to the storage required for the hash map.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // This hash map will store the count of odd numbers seen so far.
        std::unordered_map<int, int> oddCountMap;
        oddCountMap[0] = 1;  // Base case: to handle the initial subarray with exactly k odd numbers.

        int currentOddCount = 0;
        int niceSubarrays = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 != 0) {  // Odd number
                currentOddCount++;
            }
            
            // Check if there is a prefix whose sum of odds is currentOddCount - k
            if (oddCountMap.find(currentOddCount - k) != oddCountMap.end()) {
                niceSubarrays += oddCountMap[currentOddCount - k];
            }

            // Update the count of currentOddCount in the map
            oddCountMap[currentOddCount]++;
        }

        return niceSubarrays;
    }
};
```

This code maintains linear complexity while accurately counting the number of subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers, leveraging a hash map to keep track of the frequency of odd counts encountered as we iterate through the array. This ensures that we efficiently find the number of nice subarrays.
