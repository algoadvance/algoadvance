[Leetcode 2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2101)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb means that if it explodes, all other bombs within that range will also explode.

Bombs are represented by a 2D integer array `bombs` where `bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]`. It denotes a bomb with a position `(xi, yi)` and a range `ri`.

Return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one initially.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q**: What should be returned if no bombs can be detonated (i.e., each bomb is out of range of any others)?
  - **A**: It should return `1` since the single bomb detonated would be the maximum count in that case.
  
- **Q**: Are the coordinates and range values within a specific range?
  - **A**: The problem doesn't specify, but let's assume they are within the range of standard integer values.

- **Q**: Can bombs' positions overlap?
  - **A**: Yes, bombs' positions can overlap because they are defined by coordinates.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the bombs and their detonation reach using an adjacency list.
    - Each bomb will be a node.
    - There will be a directed edge from bomb `i` to bomb `j` if bomb `j` is within the range of bomb `i`.

2. **Breadth-first Search (BFS) or Depth-first Search (DFS)**: For each bomb treated as the initial bomb, perform BFS/DFS to find the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated starting from that bomb.

3. **Calculate Distances**: To determine if one bomb can trigger another, use the Euclidean distance formula. Specifically, check if the square of the distance between two bombs is less than or equal to the square of the range to avoid floating-point precision issues.

4. **Maximum Detonations**: Track the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated by iterating over each bomb and using BFS/DFS from that bomb.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumDetonation(vector<vector<int>>& bombs) {
        int n = bombs.size();
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);

        // Build the graph
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i != j) {
                    long long dx = bombs[i][0] - bombs[j][0];
                    long long dy = bombs[i][1] - bombs[j][1];
                    long long distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
                    long long rangeSquared = (long long)bombs[i][2] * bombs[i][2];
                    if (distanceSquared <= rangeSquared) {
                        graph[i].push_back(j);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Function to perform BFS starting from a bomb
        auto bfs = [&](int start) -> int {
            vector<bool> visited(n, false);
            queue<int> q;
            q.push(start);
            visited[start] = true;
            int count = 1;
            while(!q.empty()) {
                int current = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for(int neighbor : graph[current]) {
                    if(!visited[neighbor]) {
                        visited[neighbor] = true;
                        q.push(neighbor);
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
            return count;
        };

        // Compute the maximum number of detonations
        int maxDetonations = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            maxDetonations = max(maxDetonations, bfs(i));
        }

        return maxDetonations;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**: \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of bombs.
- **BFS/DFS Traversal**: Each traversal is \(O(V + E)\), which in the worst case is \(O(n + n-1) = O(n)\).
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity is \(O(n^2) + O(n^2) = O(n^2)\) since we potentially perform BFS/DFS \(n\) times for each bomb.

This solution should handle the problem efficiently given the constraints.
