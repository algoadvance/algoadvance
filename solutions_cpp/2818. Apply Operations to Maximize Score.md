[Leetcode 2818. Apply Operations to Maximize Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2818)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You have a circular array derived from `nums` where the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. You can perform the following operation on this circular array:

- Pick any `x` in the array and remove it to increase your score by `x`.

You need to maximize your score by applying the operation exactly `k` times. The score is the sum of the `k` numbers you picked. Return the maximum score possible.

### Example

``` cpp
Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 2, 6], k = 4
Output: 16
Explanation: 
The optimal choice is to pick numbers 3, 4, 6, and 2. 
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements be chosen multiple times?**
   - No, each element can only be chosen once.

2. **Is the given array `nums` always non-empty?**
   - Yes, assume the array will always have at least one element.

3. **What is the constraint on the value of `k` in relation to the length of the array?**
   - `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`

## Strategy

Given the circular nature of the array, this problem can be approached using a sliding window technique, where we attempt to find the maximum sum of any `k` consecutive elements in the array by considering the circular nature.

The total number of elements we need to consider is `k`, which means we could end up needing elements from the end and the front of the array together. Hence, we can extend the array by concatenating itself to make it easier to handle the circularity.

### Steps:
1. Create a new array `extended_nums` by concatenating `nums` with itself.
2. Use a sliding window of size `k` on `extended_nums` to find the maximum sum of `k` consecutive elements.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the original array. This is because the creation of the extended array and the sliding window both operate linearly with respect to the input size.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxScore(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> extended_nums(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    extended_nums.insert(extended_nums.end(), nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Initialize sum for the first window of size k
    int current_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        current_sum += extended_nums[i];
    }
    
    int max_sum = current_sum;
    
    // Slide the window across the extended array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        current_sum = current_sum - extended_nums[i - 1] + extended_nums[i + k - 1];
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum);
    }
    
    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 1, 4, 2, 6};
    int k = 4;
    cout << "Max Score: " << maxScore(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We form the `extended_nums` by concatenating the array with itself.
- We calculate the sum of an initial window of size `k`.
- We then slide this window across `extended_nums`, updating the sum and tracking the maximum sum encountered.

This approach ensures we handle the circular nature efficiently while keeping a linear time complexity.
