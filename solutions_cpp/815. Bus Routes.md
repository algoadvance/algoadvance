[Leetcode 815. Bus Routes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l815)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `i-th` bus repeats forever.

- For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 2, 7]`, this means that the `0-th` bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> ... forever`.

You will also be given two integers `source` and `target`. 

Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from `source` to `target`. Return `-1` if it is not possible.

### Example:
```
Input: routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: The best strategy is take the first bus to the station 7, then take the second bus to the station 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can we assume the routes are valid and each bus repeats its route forever?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of `routes` and the range for `source` and `target`?
3. Should we consider the shortest path in terms of distance or number of bus changes?

Assuming the problem is clear and proceeding to the coding part.

### Strategy:
1. **Graph Modeling:** Use BFS (Breadth-First-Search) since it is optimal for shortest path problems.
2. **Graph Nodes:** Treat each bus stop as a node.
3. **Edges:** Connect nodes (bus stops) if they are on the same bus route. Also, connect bus stops across routes if a bus can be switched.
4. **BFS:** Start from the `source` stop and traverse using BFS. Maintain a record of visited buses to avoid cycles. 
5. **Tracking:** Use a queue to store the current bus stop and the number of buses taken to reach there.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int numBusesToDestination(vector<vector<int>>& routes, int source, int target) {
    if (source == target) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Build the graph
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> stopToBuses;
    for (int bus = 0; bus < routes.size(); ++bus) {
        for (int stop : routes[bus]) {
            stopToBuses[stop].push_back(bus);
        }
    }
    
    // BFS setup
    queue<pair<int, int>> q; // {current stop, buses taken}
    unordered_set<int> visitedStops;
    unordered_set<int> visitedBuses;
    q.push({source, 0});
    visitedStops.insert(source);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int curStop = q.front().first;
        int busesTaken = q.front().second;
        q.pop();
        
        // Explore all buses that can be taken from current stop
        for (int bus : stopToBuses[curStop]) {
            if (visitedBuses.count(bus) == 0) {
                visitedBuses.insert(bus);
                
                // Explore all stops on this bus route
                for (int stop : routes[bus]) {
                    if (stop == target) {
                        return busesTaken + 1;
                    }
                    if (visitedStops.count(stop) == 0) {
                        visitedStops.insert(stop);
                        q.push({stop, busesTaken + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> routes = {{1, 2, 7}, {3, 6, 7}};
    int source = 1;
    int target = 6;
    
    int result = numBusesToDestination(routes, source, target);
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl; // Output should be 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- Constructing the mapping `stopToBuses` takes O(N*M) where N is the number of routes and M is the average number of stops per route.
- BFS traversal in the worst case visits all stops and buses, hence O(N*M) in complexity.
- Overall, the solution is efficient for moderate sizes of N and M due to BFS operations per level.

This strategy ensures the use of optimal pathfinding techniques to solve the problem of finding the least number of bus routes needed.
