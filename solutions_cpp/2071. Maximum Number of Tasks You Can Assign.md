[Leetcode 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2071)
Sure! Let’s break this problem down step-by-step in a detailed manner:

### Problem Statement
You are given two arrays, `tasks` and `workers`, and an integer `pills` which represents the number of pills you have. The effect of each pill is to increase any worker's strength by the `strength` parameter. 

Your goal is to determine the maximum number of tasks you can assign to the workers such that:
1. Each task can only be assigned to one worker.
2. Each worker can only be assigned to one task.
3. A worker can perform a task if their strength is greater than or equal to the task's difficulty. A worker can choose to take a pill, which increases their strength by `strength`.

### Example
If `tasks = [3, 2, 1]`, `workers = [3, 4, 2]`, `pills = 1`, and `strength = 2`, you need to determine the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned given the conditions.

### Strategy
1. **Sort both arrays**: Start by sorting the `tasks` in increasing order and the `workers` in decreasing order to maximize the number of assigned tasks.
   
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned based on the constraints. For each number of tasks we check if we can assign that many tasks using two pointers method.

3. **Two Pointers Method**: For each `mid` value (from binary search), try to check if it is possible to assign `mid` number of tasks using a two pointers technique:
   - Assign tasks to workers without pills as far as possible.
   - If more tasks remain, use the pills to increase the worker’s strength.

### Clarifying Questions
Before proceeding, let's ensure understanding with a few questions:
1. Are workers and task strengths always positive integers?
2. Are there any constraints on the lengths of `tasks` and `workers` arrays?
3. Should we consider corner cases where tasks or workers array might be empty?

### Code Implementation

Here is the C++ solution implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

bool canAssignTasks(vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength, int mid) {
    multiset<int> availableWorkers(workers.end()-mid, workers.end());
    int i = mid - 1;
    
    for (int task : tasks) {
        auto it = availableWorkers.end();
        
        if (strength < task) {
            it = availableWorkers.lower_bound(task - strength);
        }
        
        if (it == availableWorkers.end() || *it < task) {
            it = availableWorkers.lower_bound(task);
        }
        
        if (it == availableWorkers.end()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        availableWorkers.erase(it);
    }
    
    return true;
}

int maxNumberOfTasks(vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength) {
    sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), greater<int>());
    sort(workers.begin(), workers.end(), greater<int>());
    
    int left = 0, right = min(tasks.size(), workers.size());
    
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left + 1) / 2;
        
        if (canAssignTasks(tasks, workers, pills, strength, mid)) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> tasks = {3, 2, 1};
    vector<int> workers = {3, 4, 2};
    int pills = 1;
    int strength = 2;
    
    int result = maxNumberOfTasks(tasks, workers, pills, strength);
    cout << "Maximum number of tasks: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting both arrays takes \(O(T \log T + W \log W)\) where \(T\) is the length of `tasks` and \(W\) is the length of `workers`.
- Binary search runs in \(O(\log N)\) where \(N\) is the minimum of \(T\) and \(W\).
- Each check within the binary search involves verifying if `mid` number of tasks can be assigned, which takes \(O(mid \log W)\) at most due to the multiset operations.

Combining, the overall complexity is approximately \(O((T + W) \log \min(T, W) \log W)\).

This solution balances the constraints effectively, ensuring that we maximize the tasks assigned in an optimal manner.
