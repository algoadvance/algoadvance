[Leetcode 3117. Minimum Sum of Values by Dividing Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3117)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Divide the array into `k` subarrays such that the sum of values in the subarrays is minimized. Return the minimized sum of the values in the subarrays.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: One possible way to divide the array is to have subarrays: [3, 1, 4, 1], [5, 9], and [2, 6]. The sum of their values are 9, 14, 8. The minimum sum is 8 (of [2, 6]), so the minimized sum is 10.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if `k` is greater than the length of `nums`?**
   - The number of subarrays `k` should not be greater than the length of `nums` as it doesnâ€™t make logical sense. If it does happen, we should return a sum of the elements themselves split into individual subarrays.

2. **Can `k` be equal to the length of `nums`?**
   - Yes, and in this case, each element will be its own subarray, and the minimized sum will simply be the maximum element in `nums`.

3. **What constraints are given?**
   - Will there be a guaranteed solution?
   - Are there any bounds on the size of the input array?

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search on the Answer**:
   - We will take advantage of binary search on the value range from the maximum single element (which represents the smallest possible sum) to the sum of the entire array (which represents the largest possible sum).
   - For each mid-value in this range, check if it's possible to partition the array into `k` or fewer subarrays such that no subarray sum exceeds this mid-value.
   - If it's possible, we search for a smaller maximum sum, otherwise, search for a larger maximum sum.

2. **Helper Function**:
   - Define a helper function to check the feasibility of dividing the array into `k` subarrays based on the current maximum sum value.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

bool isFeasible(const std::vector<int>& nums, int k, int maxSum) {
    int currentSum = 0;
    int requiredSubarrays = 1;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        if (currentSum + num > maxSum) {
            ++requiredSubarrays;
            currentSum = num;
            
            if (requiredSubarrays > k) return false;
        } else {
            currentSum += num;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}

int minimizedSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int left = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int right = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    int result = right;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (left - right) / 2;
        
        if (isFeasible(nums, k, mid)) {
            result = mid;
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the binary search part is `O(log(sum(nums)))`.
- The time complexity to check feasibility `isFeasible` is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- So the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(sum(nums)))`, which is efficient for a number of elements `n` up to about \(10^5\) and sum up to \(10^9\).
