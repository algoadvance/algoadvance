[Leetcode 2085. Count Common Words With One Occurrence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2085)
### Problem Statement

Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `words1` and `words2`?
   - Are the strings within the arrays guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - What should be returned if no word fits the criteria? (Assumption: return `0`)

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int countWords(vector<string>& words1, vector<string>& words2) {
    unordered_map<string, int> count1, count2;
    
    // Count occurrences in words1
    for (const auto& word : words1) {
        count1[word]++;
    }
    
    // Count occurrences in words2
    for (const auto& word : words2) {
        count2[word]++;
    }
    
    int result = 0;
    // Iterate over the first map and check the conditions in the second map
    for (const auto& entry : count1) {
        if (entry.second == 1 && count2[entry.first] == 1) {
            result++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words1 = {"leetcode", "is", "amazing", "as", "is"};
    vector<string> words2 = {"amazing", "leetcode", "is"};
    
    cout << "Number of common words with one occurrence: " << countWords(words1, words2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy
1. Use two hash maps to store the counts of each word in `words1` and `words2`.
2. Traverse through the first map to check if each word has exactly one occurrence in both arrays.
3. Count the words that meet the criteria and return this count.

### Time Complexity
- **O(N + M)**: 
  - N is the length of `words1`.
  - M is the length of `words2`.
  - Constructing the hash maps takes linear time relative to the lengths of the arrays.
  - Iterating through the hash maps to count common words also takes linear time.
