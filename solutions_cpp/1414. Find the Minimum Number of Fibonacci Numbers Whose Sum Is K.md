[Leetcode 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1414)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `k`, you need to find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to `k`. Each Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

**Example:**
```
Input: k = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum of the two Fibonacci numbers 2 and 5 is equal to 7.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `k` be 0?
   **A:** No, `k` will be at least 1.
2. **Q:** What is the maximum value of `k`?
   **A:** The maximum value of `k` is not explicitly stated, but you should assume it fits within a 32-bit signed integer, so `k` <= 2^31 - 1.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm.

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers:** First, generate all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Greedy Selection:** Start with the largest Fibonacci number and subtract it from `k`. Continue this process until `k` becomes zero.
3. **Count the Numbers:** Count the number of Fibonacci numbers used in the subtraction process.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize an empty list to store Fibonacci numbers.
2. Generate Fibonacci numbers until the largest number is less than or equal to `k`.
3. Start with the largest Fibonacci number, subtract it from `k`, and increment the count.
4. Continue the process until `k` becomes zero.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinFibonacciNumbers(int k) {
        // Generate all Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to k
        vector<int> fibonacci = {1, 1};
        int nextFib = 2;
        
        while (nextFib <= k) {
            fibonacci.push_back(nextFib);
            int size = fibonacci.size();
            nextFib = fibonacci[size - 1] + fibonacci[size - 2];
        }
        
        // Find minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is k
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = fibonacci.size() - 1; i >= 0 && k > 0; --i) {
            if (fibonacci[i] <= k) {
                k -= fibonacci[i];
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int k = 7;
    cout << "Minimum number of Fibonacci numbers for k = " << k << " is " << solution.findMinFibonacciNumbers(k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
## Time Complexity
- **Generating Fibonacci Numbers:** This will run in O(log(k)) since each number in the Fibonacci sequence after the first few is roughly 1.618 times the previous one.
- **Greedy Selection Process:** This will essentially decompose `k` by subtracting decreasing Fibonacci numbers, which will run in O(log(k)) as well because the number of Fibonacci numbers less than `k` is logarithmic with respect to `k`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(log(k))**. The space complexity is **O(log(k))** as well due to the storage of Fibonacci numbers up to `k`.
