[Leetcode 896. Monotonic Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l896)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `A` of integers, return `true` if and only if the array is monotonic.

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

- An array `A` is monotone increasing if for all `i <= j`, `A[i] <= A[j]`.
- An array `A` is monotone decreasing if for all `i <= j`, `A[i] >= A[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output when the array is empty?**
   - Since an empty array can be considered trivially monotonic, the output should be `true`.
   
2. **Can the array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

3. **What is the range of the array length and the element values?**
   - The array length can range from 0 to \(10^5\).
   - The element values are integers within the standard integer range.

### Strategy
We need to check if the given array is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. We can do this in one pass by maintaining two flags `increasing` and `decreasing`. We will iterate through the array:

1. Initialize `increasing` and `decreasing` to `true`.
2. Iterate through the array from the second element:
   - If we find an element where `A[i] < A[i-1]`, set `increasing` to `false`.
   - If we find an element where `A[i] > A[i-1]`, set `decreasing` to `false`.
3. If at the end, either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `true`, then the array is monotonic.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isMonotonic(vector<int>& A) {
        if (A.empty()) return true;

        bool increasing = true;
        bool decreasing = true;

        for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            if (A[i] > A[i - 1])
                decreasing = false;
            if (A[i] < A[i - 1])
                increasing = false;
        }

        return increasing || decreasing;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we only need to make a single pass through the array to determine if it is monotonic.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
