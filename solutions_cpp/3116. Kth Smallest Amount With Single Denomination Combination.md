[Leetcode 3116. Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3116)
### Problem Statement
You are given a single coin of denomination `k` (k > 1) and an integer `n`. You need to find the n-th smallest positive integer that cannot be obtained by any non-negative integer combination of this coin. More formally, find the n-th positive integer that is not in the set {k * x | x â‰¥ 0}.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the upper and lower limits for `k` and `n`?
   - Ensure both `k` and `n` are positive integers (`k > 1`).

2. **Output**:
   - Should return a single integer representing the n-th smallest positive integer that cannot be formed using the denomination `k`.

### Strategy
Given that every number that can be represented as `k * x` (where `x` is a non-negative integer) is essentially a multiple of `k`, we need to find the numbers that are not multiples of `k`.

Here is the step-by-step strategy:
1. Generate a sequence of all positive integers.
2. Traverse through these integers, skipping the multiples of `k`.
3. Track the count of these non-k-multiples.
4. When we reach the `n-th` such number, return it.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int findNthNonMultiple(int k, int n) {
    int count = 0;
    int num = 0;

    while (count < n) {
        num++;
        if (num % k != 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return num;
}

int main() {
    int k = 3; // Example input
    int n = 5; // Example input
    std::cout << "The " << n << "-th smallest positive integer that cannot be formed with denomination " << k << " is: " << findNthNonMultiple(k, n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times k)\), which is mainly due to the fact that for each number, we check if it is a multiple of `k`. In the worst-case scenario, we need to skip `k` multiples for each count increment, resulting in `n*k` operations.

### Explanation
The solution involves simple arithmetic and iteration:
1. Start with `num = 0` and increment it until `count` reaches `n`.
2. For each value of `num`, check if it is a multiple of `k` using the modulus operator (`%`). If it is not a multiple, increment the count.
3. Return the value of `num` when the `count` matches `n`.

This ensures that we correctly find the `n-th` number that is not a multiple of the given `k`.
