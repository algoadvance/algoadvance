[Leetcode 377. Combination Sum IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l377)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to `target`.

The problem differs from the combination sum problem because the order of the integers in the combination matters. 

### Example 1:
- **Input**: `nums = [1,2,3], target = 4`
- **Output**: `7`
- **Explanation**:
  - The possible combinations are:
    - (1, 1, 1, 1)
    - (1, 1, 2)
    - (1, 2, 1)
    - (1, 3)
    - (2, 1, 1)
    - (2, 2)
    - (3, 1)

### Example 2:
- **Input**: `nums = [9], target = 3`
- **Output**: `0`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can we use negative numbers in the `nums` array?
   - **A**: No, all the numbers in `nums` are positive and distinct.
2. **Q**: Can `nums` be empty or `target` be zero?
   - **A**: No, the problem guarantees there will always be at least one number in `nums` and `target` will be a positive integer.

## Strategy

We will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. The idea is to build an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations that add up to the target `i`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Initialize the DP array of size `target + 1` with zeros: `std::vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0)`.
   - Set `dp[0] = 1` because there's one way to reach the target 0, which is by using no elements.

2. **DP Update**:
   - Iterate through each target value from 1 to `target`.
   - For each target value, iterate through each number in `nums`.
   - If the number is less than or equal to the current target, update the DP array by adding the value of `dp[current target - num]`.

3. **Result**:
   - The final result will be `dp[target]` which will give us the number of combinations to form the target.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * target)
  - `n` is the length of `nums`, and we iterate through the `target` for each number in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(target)
  - We are using a DP array of size `target + 1`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int combinationSum4(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    std::vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1; // There is one way to reach target 0, by using no elements.

    for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
        for (const int& num : nums) {
            if (i - num >= 0) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - num];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[target];
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 3};
    int target1 = 4;
    std::cout << "Number of combinations for target " << target1 << " is: " << combinationSum4(nums1, target1) << std::endl; // Output: 7

    std::vector<int> nums2 = {9};
    int target2 = 3;
    std::cout << "Number of combinations for target " << target2 << " is: " << combinationSum4(nums2, target2) << std::endl; // Output: 0

    return 0;
}
```

The provided code snippet initializes the DP array, updates it based on possible sums for each target value, and finally prints the result for provided cases.
