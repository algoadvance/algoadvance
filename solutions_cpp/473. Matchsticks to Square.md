[Leetcode 473. Matchsticks to Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l473)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `matchsticks` where `matchsticks[i]` is the length of the `i-th` matchstick. You want to use all the matchsticks to form a square. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

Return `true` if you can make this square and `false` otherwise.

### Examples

1. Example 1:
    - Input: `matchsticks = [1,1,2,2,2]`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: You can form a square with sides of length 2: [1,1],[1,1],[2],[2],[2].

2. Example 2:
    - Input: `matchsticks = [3,3,3,3,4]`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: You cannot make a square with these matchsticks.

### Constraints

- `1 <= matchsticks.length <= 15`
- `1 <= matchsticks[i] <= 10^8`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of the matchsticks guaranteed to be positive integers?**
    - Yes, as indicated by the constraints (`1 <= matchsticks[i]`).

2. **Can we assume that the total length of all matchsticks can sum to a number that can divide by 4 evenly in some cases?**
    - Yes, that's one of the checks we must perform. If the total length of all matchsticks is not divisible by 4, we can immediately return `false`.

3. **What should we return if the number of matchsticks is less than 4?**
    - If the input length is less than 4, we can directly return `false`, since a square requires 4 sides.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check**:
    - Calculate the sum of all matchsticks. If it is not divisible by 4, return `false`.

2. **Target Side Length**:
    - The side length of the square must be `sum / 4`.

3. **Backtracking**:
    - Sort the matchsticks in descending order (to optimize the backtracking process).
    - Use a recursive backtracking method to try to form the 4 sides with length `sum / 4`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    bool makesquare(std::vector<int>& matchsticks) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int stick : matchsticks) {
            sum += stick;
        }

        if (sum % 4 != 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int sideLength = sum / 4;
        std::sort(matchsticks.begin(), matchsticks.end(), std::greater<int>());
        std::vector<int> sides(4, 0); // Initialize 4 sides

        return dfs(matchsticks, sides, sideLength, 0);
    }

private:
    bool dfs(std::vector<int>& matchsticks, std::vector<int>& sides, int sideLength, int index) {
        if (index == matchsticks.size()) {
            return sides[0] == sideLength && sides[1] == sideLength 
                && sides[2] == sideLength && sides[3] == sideLength;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            if (sides[i] + matchsticks[index] <= sideLength) {
                sides[i] += matchsticks[index];
                if (dfs(matchsticks, sides, sideLength, index + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }
                sides[i] -= matchsticks[index];
            }

            // If this side already has no matchsticks, break to avoid redundancy
            if (sides[i] == 0) break;
        }

        return false;
    }
};

```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of matchsticks.
- **Backtracking DFS**: Since we potentially try each matchstick in all 4 sides, the worst-case time complexity is `O(4^n)`, where `n` is the number of matchsticks. But the actual performance can be significantly better with pruning.

This solution combines initial checks with efficient backtracking to determine if the matchsticks can form a square.
