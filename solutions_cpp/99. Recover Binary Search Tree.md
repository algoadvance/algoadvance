[Leetcode 99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l99)
Sure, let's tackle the problem "99. Recover Binary Search Tree."

### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) where exactly two nodes' values have been swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?
   - No specific constraints besides typical memory and performance considerations.
2. Can we assume that there will always be exactly two nodes swapped?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that exactly two nodes have been swapped.
3. What should we return from our function?
   - We need to modify the tree in place, so no return is necessary.

### Strategy
The main idea is to use the in-order traversal of the BST, which should yield a sorted list of values. When two nodes are swapped, the in-order traversal will not be sorted correctly. By identifying the points where the order is violated, we can pinpoint the two nodes that have been swapped.

1. Perform an in-order traversal to find the two nodes. During traversal:
   - First node (`first`) is identified when we find the first pair where a previous node has a larger value than the current node.
   - Second node (`second`) is identified when we find the second pair where a previous node has a larger value than the current node (or if we only find one pair, then it must involve `first` and `second` directly).

2. Swap the values of the two nodes identified.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    void recoverTree(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode *first = nullptr, *second = nullptr, *prev = nullptr;

        // Helper function for the modified in-order traversal
        std::function<void(TreeNode*)> inorder = [&](TreeNode* node) {
            if (!node) return;

            inorder(node->left); // Traverse the left subtree

            // Check for swapped nodes
            if (prev && prev->val > node->val) {
                if (!first) first = prev;
                second = node;
            }
            prev = node;

            inorder(node->right); // Traverse the right subtree
        };

        inorder(root);

        // Swap values of the two identified nodes
        if (first && second) {
            std::swap(first->val, second->val);
        }
    }
};

// Function for testing the code 
void inorderPrint(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    inorderPrint(root->left);
    std::cout << root->val << " ";
    inorderPrint(root->right);
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);

    std::cout << "Before recover: ";
    inorderPrint(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    Solution().recoverTree(root);

    std::cout << "After recover: ";
    inorderPrint(root);
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Clean up the tree (not strictly necessary in a problem setting)
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we traverse each node once during the in-order traversal.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. In the case of a balanced tree, this is `O(log N)`, but in the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), it is `O(N)`. This space is used for the recursion stack during the in-order traversal.

This solution effectively solves the problem by making use of the properties of in-order traversal and BST. The identified swapped nodes are corrected by simply swapping their values.
