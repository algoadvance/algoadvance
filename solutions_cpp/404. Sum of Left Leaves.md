[Leetcode 404. Sum of Left Leaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l404)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of its parent.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the tree node?**
   - The tree node is typically represented by a structure like the following:
     ```cpp
     struct TreeNode {
         int val;
         TreeNode *left;
         TreeNode *right;
         TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
         TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
         TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
     };
     ```

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - Yes, the tree can be empty. In such a case, the sum should be 0.

3. **Is it important to consider both left and right subtrees?**
   - Yes, we need to traverse the entire tree to check for left leaves.

## Strategy

We'll use a recursive depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree. At each node, we'll check if the left child is a leaf. If it is, we'll add its value to our sum. We also need to continue traversing both left and right subtrees to ensure we capture all left leaves in the tree.

### Steps:

1. Create a helper function that takes a node and a boolean to indicate if the node is a left child.
2. In the helper function:
   - If the node is `nullptr`, return 0.
   - If the node is a leaf (both children are `nullptr`) and the boolean indicates it is a left child, return the node value.
   - Recursively call the helper function for both left and right children.
3. The main function will call this helper function with the root node and an initial boolean value of `false` (since the root is not a left child).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr, right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfLeftLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, false);
    }

private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, bool isLeft) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            if (isLeft) return node->val;  // only include left leaves
            return 0;
        }
        return dfs(node->left, true) + dfs(node->right, false);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because in the worst case, we have to visit every node once.

- The space complexity is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack for a DFS, which can vary from \(O(\log n)\) in a balanced tree to \(O(n)\) in the worst case (skewed tree).
