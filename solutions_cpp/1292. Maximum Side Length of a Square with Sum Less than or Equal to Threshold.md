[Leetcode 1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1292)
### Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return the maximum side length of a square with a sum less than or equal to `threshold` or return 0 if there is no such square.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**:
   - What are the possible values for `m` and `n` (matrix dimensions)?
   - What are the possible values for the elements within the matrix and `threshold`?
   
2. **Square Properties**:
   - Are the square submatrices required to be aligned with the matrix cells (i.e., no rotation)?
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should we return if the maximum side length is not found (i.e., no such square exists)?
   - Can the matrix contain negative numbers?

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we will use a technique involving **prefix sums** to quickly compute the sum of any submatrix:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Construct a prefix sum matrix where `prefix[i][j]` represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from `(0,0)` to `(i-1,j-1)` in the original matrix.
   
2. **Checking Square Sums**:
   - Use the prefix sum matrix to determine the sum of every possible square submatrix of varying sizes and record the largest size that has a sum less than or equal to the `threshold`.

3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**:
   - Use binary search to find the maximum possible side length, checking for each length if a valid square submatrix exists using the prefix sum matrix.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSideLength(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int threshold) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        
        // Create a prefix sum matrix
        vector<vector<int>> prefix(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                prefix[i][j] = mat[i - 1][j - 1] + prefix[i - 1][j] + prefix[i][j - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j - 1];
            }
        }

        // Helper function to check if there exists a square of size k with sum <= threshold
        auto valid = [&](int k) {
            for (int i = k; i <= m; ++i) {
                for (int j = k; j <= n; ++j) {
                    int sum = prefix[i][j] - prefix[i - k][j] - prefix[i][j - k] + prefix[i - k][j - k];
                    if (sum <= threshold) return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        };

        int left = 0, right = min(m, n), res = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (valid(mid)) {
                res = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Prefix Sum Matrix Construction**: `O(m * n)`
2. **Binary Search**: Logarithmic in dimension of the matrix side.
3. **Checking Square Sums**:
   - For each potential side length `k`, verifying all possible squares involves `O((m - k + 1) * (n - k + 1))` checks.
   - In the worst-case scenario (max length `k` check), this results in `O(m * n)` for each binary search step.

**Total Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * log(min(m, n)))`

This ensures that the solution is both optimal and efficient for large dimensions of matrices.
