[Leetcode 383. Ransom Note](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l383)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
- **Output:** false

### Example 2:
- **Input:** ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
- **Output:** false

### Example 3:
- **Input:** ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
- **Output:** true

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the ransom note and magazine contain characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - According to the problem, both `ransomNote` and `magazine` consist of lowercase English letters only.
   
2. **What should be returned if either `ransomNote` or `magazine` is empty?**
   - If `ransomNote` is empty, the return value should be `true` because an empty note can always be constructed.
   - If `magazine` is empty and `ransomNote` is not, the return value should be `false`.

## Strategy
1. Create a frequency count for each letter in `magazine` using an array or a hash map.
2. Iterate over each character in `ransomNote` and decrease the frequency count from the magazine's frequency map.
3. If at any point the frequency of any letter in `magazine` goes below zero, return `false`.
4. If all characters in `ransomNote` can be matched with characters in `magazine`, return `true`.

## Time Complexity
- Constructing the frequency map for `magazine` will take `O(m)` time where `m` is the length of `magazine`.
- Checking each character in `ransomNote` against the frequency map will take `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of `ransomNote`.
- Overall time complexity is `O(m + n)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

bool canConstruct(std::string ransomNote, std::string magazine) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> letterCount;
    
    // Build the letter frequency map from the magazine
    for (char c : magazine) {
        letterCount[c]++;
    }
    
    // Check if ransom note can be constructed
    for (char c : ransomNote) {
        if (letterCount[c] == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        letterCount[c]--;
    }
    
    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string ransomNote = "a";
    std::string magazine = "b";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine) << std::endl; // Output: false
    
    ransomNote = "aa";
    magazine = "ab";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine) << std::endl; // Output: false
    
    ransomNote = "aa";
    magazine = "aab";
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine) << std::endl; // Output: true

    return 0;
}
```

This code implements the described strategy to determine if the `ransomNote` can be constructed from the `magazine`. It uses an unordered map to keep track of the character count in the magazine and then checks if those counts suffice to form the ransom note.
