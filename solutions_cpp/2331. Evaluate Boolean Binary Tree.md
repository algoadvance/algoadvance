[Leetcode 2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2331)
## Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a **full binary tree** with the following properties:
- Leaf nodes have either the value `0` or `1`, representing `False` and `True` respectively.
- Non-leaf nodes have either the value `2` or `3`:
  - Node with value `2` represents the boolean **OR** operation.
  - Node with value `3` represents the boolean **AND** operation.

Return the boolean result of the evaluation of the binary tree.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram represents the binary tree:
        2
       / \
      1   3
         / \
        0   1
 The evaluation of this tree would be True OR (False AND True), which is True.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the tree have only one node? 
   - Yes, it can be a single leaf node, which can either be `0` or `1`.
2. Are all trees guaranteed to be valid full binary trees?
   - Yes, the tree is guaranteed to be a full binary tree.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will perform a post-order traversal of the tree. Post-order traversal is suitable because we need to evaluate the children before we can evaluate the parent. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. Define a helper function to evaluate the tree recursively.
2. For a leaf node, simply return its boolean value.
3. For non-leaf nodes, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees.
4. Depending on the value of the non-leaf node (`2` for OR and `3` for AND), combine the results of the left and right subtrees using the corresponding boolean operation.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool evaluateTree(TreeNode* root) {
        // Base case for leaf node
        if (root->left == nullptr && root->right == nullptr) {
            return root->val == 1;
        }
        
        // Recursively evaluate left and right subtrees
        bool leftVal = evaluateTree(root->left);
        bool rightVal = evaluateTree(root->right);
        
        // Perform the operation based on the value of the node
        if (root->val == 2) {
            return leftVal || rightVal;
        } else { // root->val must be 3
            return leftVal && rightVal;
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used for the tree traversal. In the worst case, for a tree that is a chain, \(H = N\). For a balanced tree, \(H = \log(N)\).
