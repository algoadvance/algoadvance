[Leetcode 1739. Building Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1739)
### Problem Statement:

You have a number of boxes `n` and you need to build a solid staircase shaped structure consisting of `n` boxes. The staircase should be built in such a way that the `i-th` level (from the bottom) contains exactly `i` boxes. If you cannot build the entire staircase with the given `n` boxes, then you should figure out the minimum number of extra boxes needed to complete the staircase up to the highest possible level you can reach.

**Example:**
1. Input: `n = 3`
   Output: `0`
   Explanation:  You can use all the 3 boxes to build the structure shown below:
    ```
    []
    [][]
    ```

2. Input: `n = 10`
   Output: `1`
   Explanation: You can build a structure like this:
    ```
    []
    [][]
    [][][]
    [][][]
    ```
   And you will need 1 more box to complete the 4th level.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Can `n` be zero?
   **A:** Yes, `n` can be zero.
   
2. **Q:** What is the maximum value of `n`?
   **A:** According to the problem constraints, `n` can be up to \(10^9\).

### Strategy:

1. **Identify the pattern**: Calculate the cumulative number of boxes needed for each level.
   - For level 1: 1 box.
   - For level 1 and 2 combined: 3 boxes.
   - For levels 1, 2, and 3 combined: 6 boxes, and so forth.
   
2. **Sum formula**: Use the sum of first k natural numbers:
   - \(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\)
   
3. **Determine the maximum levels**: 
   - Find the largest `k` such that \(\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \leq n\).

4. **Check remaining boxes**: After determining the possible maximum levels, check if there are any remaining boxes and calculate how many more are required to form the next level.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        // Find the maximum k such that k(k+1)/2 <= n
        long long k = std::floor((-1 + std::sqrt(1 + 8.0 * n)) / 2);
        
        // Total number of boxes needed for the first k levels
        long long total = k * (k + 1) / 2;
        
        // If total is exactly n, no extra boxes are needed
        if (total == n) return 0;
        
        // Remaining boxes to be placed on k+1 level
        long long remaining = n - total;
        
        // On level k+1, boxes needed are from 1 to k
        // So we need to check how many boxes are required to reach remaining boxes
        int extra = 0;
        while (remaining > 0) {
            extra++;
            remaining -= extra;
        }
        
        // Return the number of extra boxes needed
        return extra;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n;
    std::cin >> n; // Read the input
    std::cout << solution.minimumBoxes(n) << std::endl; // Output the result
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** due to the mathematical calculations involved. The square root calculation is constant time and so are the remaining arithmetic operations.
