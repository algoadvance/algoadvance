[Leetcode 1980. Find Unique Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1980)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` unique binary strings each of length `n`. Return a binary string of length `n` that does not appear in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What can be the maximum value of `n`?
   - Let's consider typical constraints; `n` could be reasonably up to 16-20 for practical purposes in a typical interview.

2. **Output Requirements**: Does the output need to be the lexicographically smallest missing binary string?
   - The problem allows us to return any such binary string that is not in the list.

3. **Edge Cases**: Are there cases where `num` is empty or any other edge cases?
   - Given the constraints, it should not be empty, and `nums` would not contain duplicate strings as clarified in the problem.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Diagonal Approach**: We can take advantage of the properties of unique binary strings. Specifically, we can utilize the diagonal elements to guarantee a unique binary string that isn't present in the list. The approach involves constructing a binary string where the i-th character is different from the i-th character of the i-th string in `nums`. This guarantees that the constructed string will differ from each of the given strings.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty string of length `n`.
   - For each string in the array, flip the character at index `i` (from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0').
   - This guarantees that our constructed string will not match the i-th string at the i-th position.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string findDifferentBinaryString(std::vector<std::string>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::string result = "";
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i][i] == '0') {
            result += '1';
        } else {
            result += '0';
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the strings in the array `nums` because:
- We iterate through each string once.
- We construct the result string of length `n`.

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We start with an empty result string.
- **Loop Through Diagonal**: For each string, at position `i`, we append the flipped character of the i-th string at position `i`. This guarantees the generated string will be different from every given string at least at one character position.

This method is efficient and ensures we meet the constraints and requirements of the problem.
