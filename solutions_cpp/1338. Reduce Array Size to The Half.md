[Leetcode 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1338)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr`, you can choose a set of integers and remove all occurrences of these integers in the array. Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the array are removed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the array elements? Can they be negative?
   - What is the size range of the array?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - What should be the output if the array already has a size less than or equal to 1?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if the array is empty?

### Given Constraints:
- The size of the array `arr` will be in the range [1, 10^5].
- The values in `arr` will be in the range [1, 10^5].

For this problem, we can start with the assumption that:
- The values are positive integers.
- The array is non-empty.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - First, we need to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.

2. **Sorting by Frequency:**
   - We can then sort these frequencies in descending order. The most frequent elements should be considered first since removing them will reduce the array size more quickly.

3. **Greedy Approach:**
   - We accumulate the counts of the most frequent elements until the sum is at least half of the original array's length.

4. **Return the Set Size:**
   - The number of unique elements we've considered during this accumulation process is our result.

### Code Implementation

Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int minSetSize(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Step 1: Count frequencies
    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequency;
    for (int num : arr) {
        frequency[num]++;
    }

    // Step 2: Collect the frequencies and sort them in descending order
    std::vector<int> frequencies;
    for (auto& entry : frequency) {
        frequencies.push_back(entry.second);
    }
    
    std::sort(frequencies.rbegin(), frequencies.rend()); // Sort in descending order

    // Step 3: Greedily pick the most frequent elements until we remove at least half of the array
    int removed = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int freq : frequencies) {
        removed += freq;
        count++;
        if (removed >= arr.size() / 2) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7};
    std::cout << "Minimum size of set: " << minSetSize(arr) << std::endl; // Output should be 2

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. Counting the frequencies involves iterating through the array once: **O(n)**.
2. Collecting and sorting the frequencies, the sorting step dominates: **O(m log m)**, where `m` is the number of unique elements. In the worst case, `m` could be up to `n`.
3. The greedy selection involves iterating through the sorted list of frequencies which is **O(m)**.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m log m)**, which is efficient for the given constraints. In the worst case, it simplifies to **O(n log n)**.
