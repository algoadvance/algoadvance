[Leetcode 1255. Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1255)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `letters` containing letters and an array `score` of size 26. You have to find the maximum score you can obtain by forming any subset of the given words using the letters.

The score of each letter is given in the `score` array, where `score[i]` is the score of the ith lowercase letter (i.e., 'a' + i).

You must use at most the given letters (letters can only be used as many times as they appear in the string `letters`).

## Example:

**Input:**
```
words = ["dog","cat","dad","good"]
letters = "aabbccdddgooo"
score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,0,3,2,1,0,2,4,2,0,1,10,6,7,8,0,0,4,0,0,10]
```
**Output:** `50`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the characters in the `letters` string always lowercase?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can the `words` array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, but it would still be treated as different words.

3. **What is the length range for `words`, `letters`, and `score`?**
   - The words array can have up to 20 words each with a maximum length of 7.
   - The letters string can have a maximum length of 100.
   - The score array is always fixed at size 26.

4. **How is the input supplied and the output expected?**
   - The input is given as arrays and a string, and the output is an integer.

## Strategy

We aim to use a backtracking approach to generate subsets of the `words` array and, for each subset, verify if it can be formed using the given `letters`. If it can, compute its score and track the maximum score obtained.

Steps:
1. Count the frequency of each letter in `letters`.
2. Create a recursive backtracking function that builds subsets of `words`.
3. For each subset:
    - Check if it can be formed with the available letters.
    - Calculate its score using the `score` array.
4. Return the highest score found.

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach will be `O(2^n * k)`, where `n` is the length of `words` and `k` is the average length of the words. This is due to generating all possible subsets of `words`.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxScoreWords(vector<string>& words, vector<char>& letters, vector<int>& score) {
        // Step 1: Count frequency of each letter in `letters`
        vector<int> letterCount(26, 0);
        for (char letter : letters) {
            letterCount[letter - 'a']++;
        }

        return backtrack(words, letterCount, score, 0);
    }
    
private:
    int backtrack(vector<string>& words, vector<int>& letterCount, vector<int>& score, int index) {
        if (index == words.size()) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Move to the next word without including the current word
        int maxScore = backtrack(words, letterCount, score, index + 1);
        
        // Try to include the current word
        string word = words[index];
        vector<int> wordCount(26, 0);
        for (char letter : word) {
            wordCount[letter - 'a']++;
        }

        // Check if the current word can be formed with the available letters
        bool canForm = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (wordCount[i] > letterCount[i]) {
                canForm = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (canForm) {
            // Deduct the letters used
            for (char letter : word) {
                letterCount[letter - 'a']--;
            }

            // Calculate the score for the word and add to the result
            int currentWordScore = 0;
            for (char letter : word) {
                currentWordScore += score[letter - 'a'];
            }

            maxScore = max(maxScore, currentWordScore + backtrack(words, letterCount, score, index + 1));

            // Backtrack, add the letters back
            for (char letter : word) {
                letterCount[letter - 'a']++;
            }
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
};
```

This `Solution` class can be used to instantiate and call the `maxScoreWords` function, providing the required parameters (`words`, `letters`, `score`) and yielding the maximum possible score as an integer.
