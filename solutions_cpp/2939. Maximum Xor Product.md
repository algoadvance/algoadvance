[Leetcode 2939. Maximum Xor Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2939)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums`. Your task is to calculate the maximum XOR product of two distinct elements in the array. The XOR product of two elements \( a \) and \( b \) is defined as \( a \oplus b \) where \( \oplus \) denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Return the maximum XOR product of any two distinct elements in the `nums` array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements in the array non-negative or can they be negative?**
   - Let's assume the elements are non-negative for simplicity, as XOR operation with negative numbers can be more complex.
   
2. **What is the range of values that can be in the `nums` array?**
   - Let's assume typical constraints such as \( 1 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^9 \).

3. **What is the potential size of the `nums` array?**
   - Let's assume that the array can have up to \( 10^5 \) elements.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to find the maximum XOR of any two elements in the array. Bruteforce approach would take \( O(n^2) \) time, which is not feasible for large arrays. Instead, we can use a Trie-based approach to leverage the properties of the XOR operation.

1. **Trie Building**: 
   - Each number is represented in binary form and inserted into a Trie.

2. **Maximizing XOR**:
   - For each number in the array, we will traverse through the Trie to find the number that results in the highest XOR when XORed with the current number.

### Code
Below is the C++ code to solve this problem using the Trie-based approach.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[2];
    
    TrieNode() {
        children[0] = nullptr;
        children[1] = nullptr;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    TrieNode* root;
    
    Solution() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (!node->children[bit]) {
                node->children[bit] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[bit];
        }
    }
    
    int findMaximumXOR(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        int maxXOR = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (node->children[!bit]) {
                maxXOR = (maxXOR << 1) | 1;
                node = node->children[!bit];
            } else {
                maxXOR = (maxXOR << 1);
                node = node->children[bit];
            }
        }
        return maxXOR;
    }

    int findMaximumXOR(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Insert all numbers in Trie
        for (int num : nums) {
            insert(num);
        }
        
        int maxResult = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxResult = max(maxResult, findMaximumXOR(num));
        }
 
        return maxResult;
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8};
    Solution solution;
    cout << "Maximum XOR is: " << solution.findMaximumXOR(nums) << endl;  // Output: 28
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Trie Insertion**: Each insertion takes \( O(32) \) time since we consider up to 32-bit integers.
- **Finding Maximum XOR**: Traversing the Trie for each number also takes \( O(32) \) time.
- **Overall Complexity**: Inserting all numbers and finding the maximum XOR for \( n \) numbers results in \( O(n \cdot 32) = O(n) \) time complexity.

This approach is efficient and ensures that we can handle the problem within reasonable time limits for large arrays.
