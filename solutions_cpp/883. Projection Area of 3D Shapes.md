[Leetcode 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l883)
## Problem Statement

In a 2D grid of size `n x n`, there are `n x n` 3D shapes. Each shape is represented by an integer value `grid[i][j]` where `grid[i][j]` indicates the height of the 3D shape at position `(i, j)`.

The projection of these shapes onto the xy-plane, yz-plane, and zx-plane are outlines that form shadows. We need to calculate the total area of these projections. 

- The projection on the xy-plane results in a grid where we count each occupied cell (i.e., each cell where the height is greater than 0).
- The projection on the yz-plane involves taking the maximum height in each column.
- The projection on the zx-plane involves taking the maximum height in each row.

Your task is to write a function that calculates the total area of these projections.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values in `grid[i][j]`?
2. Is it guaranteed that the grid is always `n x n`?
3. Can the height of the 3D shapes (`grid[i][j]`) be zero?

## Code

Here is a function to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int projectionArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int n = grid.size();
    int xyArea = 0, yzArea = 0, zxArea = 0;

    // Iterate through each row and column
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int maxRow = 0;
        int maxCol = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            // For xy projection, count all non-zero heights
            if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                xyArea++;
            }
            // For zx projection, find the maximum height in the row
            maxRow = max(maxRow, grid[i][j]);
            // For yz projection, find the maximum height in the column
            maxCol = max(maxCol, grid[j][i]);
        }
        zxArea += maxRow;
        yzArea += maxCol;
    }

    return xyArea + yzArea + zxArea;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **XY Plane:**
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.
   - Count cells where the height is greater than 0 (each such cell contributes to the xy projection).

2. **YZ Plane:**
   - For each column, find the maximum height in that column.
   - Sum these maximum heights to get the yz projection area.

3. **ZX Plane:**
   - For each row, find the maximum height in that row.
   - Sum these maximum heights to get the zx projection area.

Finally, sum all three areas to get the total projection area.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) since we need to iterate through an `n x n` grid to compute the areas of all three projections.
- This is efficient given the constraints and ensures that we capture all the necessary details from the 3D shapes on the grid.
