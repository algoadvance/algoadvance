[Leetcode 1206. Design Skiplist](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1206)
## Problem Statement

Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

A Skiplist is a data structure that extends a linked list with multiple layers for fast search, insertion, and deletion. It allows for efficient search and operations similar to a balanced tree structure like an AVL or Red-Black Tree, but simpler and easier to implement.

Implement the `Skiplist` class:

- `Skiplist()`: Initializes the Skiplist object.
- `bool search(int target)`: Returns true if the `target` exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
- `void add(int num)`: Inserts the `num` into the Skiplist.
- `bool erase(int num)`: Removes the `num` from the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. Return true if the `num` was successfully removed.
  
## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range and type of input numbers**: What is the range and type of numbers that will be stored in the Skiplist? Are we dealing with integers only?
   - *Assumption*: The input numbers are integer values.
   
2. **Concurrency**: Do we need to handle concurrent modifications to the Skiplist?
   - *Assumption*: No, we do not need to handle concurrency in this problem.

3. **Performance expectations**: Are there specific performance expectations, or should we assume that we need to implement it following the average characteristics of Skiplists (logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion)?
   - *Assumption*: We need to implement it with average logarithmic time complexity for fundamental operations.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of a Skiplist:

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <vector>

class Skiplist {
private:
    struct Node {
        int val;
        std::vector<Node*> forward;
        Node(int val, int level) : val(val), forward(level, nullptr) {}
    };

    int maxLevel;
    float probability;
    Node* head;
    
    int randomLevel() {
        int level = 1;
        while (((double) std::rand() / RAND_MAX) < probability && level < maxLevel ) {
            level++;
        }
        return level;
    }

public:
    Skiplist(int maxLevel = 16, float probability = 0.5) 
        : maxLevel(maxLevel), probability(probability), head(new Node(-1, maxLevel)) {}
    
    bool search(int target) {
        Node* curr = head;
        for (int i = maxLevel - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (curr->forward[i] != nullptr && curr->forward[i]->val < target) {
                curr = curr->forward[i];
            }
        }
        curr = curr->forward[0];
        return curr != nullptr && curr->val == target;
    }

    void add(int num) {
        std::vector<Node*> update(maxLevel, head);
        Node* curr = head;

        for (int i = maxLevel - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (curr->forward[i] != nullptr && curr->forward[i]->val < num) {
                curr = curr->forward[i];
            }
            update[i] = curr;
        }

        int level = randomLevel();
        Node* newNode = new Node(num, level);
        for (int i = 0; i < level; ++i) {
            newNode->forward[i] = update[i]->forward[i];
            update[i]->forward[i] = newNode;
        }
    }

    bool erase(int num) {
        std::vector<Node*> update(maxLevel, head);
        Node* curr = head;

        for (int i = maxLevel - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (curr->forward[i] != nullptr && curr->forward[i]->val < num) {
                curr = curr->forward[i];
            }
            update[i] = curr;
        }

        curr = curr->forward[0];
        if (curr == nullptr || curr->val != num) {
            return false;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < maxLevel; ++i) {
            if (update[i]->forward[i] != curr) {
                break;
            }
            update[i]->forward[i] = curr->forward[i];
        }

        delete curr;
        return true;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a head node with the highest level that the Skiplist can support.
   - Use a probabilistic method to balance the levels of the nodes.
   
2. **randomLevel Function**:
   - Randomly determine the level of a new node using a geometric distribution.

3. **Search**:
   - Start from the highest level and traverse downwards to find the target.

4. **Add**:
   - Find update points for each level where the new node will be inserted.
   - Insert the new node and update the forward pointers accordingly.
   
5. **Erase**:
   - Similar to add, find the update points.
   - Remove the node and update the forward pointers.

## Time Complexity

- **Search**: O(log n) on average.
- **Insert**: O(log n) on average.
- **Erase**: O(log n) on average.

In practice, the time complexity can vary slightly based on the probabilistic nature of the Skiplist.
