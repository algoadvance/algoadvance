[Leetcode 127. Word Ladder](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l127)
## Problem Statement:

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> endWord` such that:
- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
- Every `s1`, `s2`, ..., `sn` must be in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
- `endWord` is the last word of the sequence.

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the **length** of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists.

### Example 1:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which is 5 words long.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, so no possible transformation.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `beginWord != endWord`
- All words in `wordList` are unique.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Are all words in the `wordList` guaranteed to be the same length as `beginWord` and `endWord`?
   - Yes.
   
2. Are there any uppercase letters we need to handle, or is it completely lowercase?
   - It's completely lowercase as specified.

3. Do we need to return the transformation sequence itself, or just the length of the sequence?
   - Just the length of the sequence.

## Strategy:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This problem can be seen as finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph where each word is a node and there is an edge between two nodes if they differ by exactly one character.
2. **Queue**: Use a queue to perform the BFS. The queue will store pairs of the current word and the current depth of the transformation.
3. **Set**: Use a set to keep track of words that have already been visited to avoid loops and redundant work.
4. **Early Exit**: Once the `endWord` is reached, return the current depth.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
    unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
    if (wordSet.find(endWord) == wordSet.end()) {
        return 0;
    }

    queue<pair<string, int>> toVisit;
    toVisit.push({beginWord, 1});

    while (!toVisit.empty()) {
        auto [currentWord, currentLength] = toVisit.front();
        toVisit.pop();

        for (int i = 0; i < currentWord.size(); ++i) {
            string originalWord = currentWord;
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                currentWord[i] = c;
                if (currentWord == endWord) {
                    return currentLength + 1;
                }
                if (wordSet.find(currentWord) != wordSet.end()) {
                    toVisit.push({currentWord, currentLength + 1});
                    wordSet.erase(currentWord);
                }
            }
            currentWord = originalWord;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    string beginWord = "hit";
    string endWord = "cog";
    vector<string> wordList = {"hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"};
    cout << ladderLength(beginWord, endWord, wordList) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Construction of wordSet**: $O(N)$ where $N$ is the size of `wordList`.
- **BFS Traversal**:
  - Each word has `L` possible intermediate transformations where `L` is the length of the word.
  - Each transformation can be checked in $O(L)$ time.
  - Total complexity is $O(L^2 \cdot N)$ in the worst case, where we might visit each word and check all possible transformations.
