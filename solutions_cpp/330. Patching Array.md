[Leetcode 330. Patching Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l330)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add the fewest number of patches (numbers) to the array such that any number in the range `[1, n]` can be formed by the sum of some elements of the array.

Return the minimum number of patches required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the ranges for the sizes of `nums` and the value of `n`?
   - Are all elements in `nums` positive or can they be zero or negative?
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the function return just the count of patches or also the patched array?
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `nums` is empty?
   - What if `n` is zero or one (i.e., very small `n`)?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a variable `miss` initialized to 1; this represents the smallest number that we cannot yet form.
   - Use an index `i` to iterate over the array `nums`.
   - Use a counter `patches` to count the number of patches we've added.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate through the `nums` array. For each number in `nums`, if it is less than or equal to `miss`, it means we can extend our range of formable numbers up to `miss + nums[i] - 1`. So, we update `miss` to `miss + nums[i]`.
   - If the current number `nums[i]` is larger than `miss`, it means we need to patch the array by adding `miss`. Each patch will double the range of the numbers we can form, i.e., we update `miss` to `miss * 2`.

3. **Continue Until**:
   - Continue the above steps until `miss` exceeds `n`, indicating that all numbers up to `n` can be formed.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int minPatches(std::vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        long long miss = 1;
        int patches = 0, i = 0;
        
        while (miss <= n) {
            if (i < nums.size() && nums[i] <= miss) {
                miss += nums[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                miss += miss;
                patches++;
            }
        }
        
        return patches;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(m + log n)**: Where `m` is the size of the input array `nums` and `log n` is the complexity due to potentially doubling `miss`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables.

This solution efficiently patches the array by ensuring it can generate all required sums up to `n` with minimal additions.
