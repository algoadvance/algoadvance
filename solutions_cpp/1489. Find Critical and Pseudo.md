[Leetcode 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1489)
## Problem Statement

You are given a weighted, undirected graph consisting of `n` nodes, and this graph can be represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `from_i` and `to_i`.

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph is a subset of the edges that connects all the vertices without any cycles and with the minimum total edge weight.

There are two types of edges we are interested in:

1. **Critical Edge**: An edge that, if removed, would cause the MST weight to increase.
2. **Pseudo-Critical Edge**: An edge that is in some valid MST of the graph but not necessarily in all MSTs.

You need to return a list of two lists, `result` where:
- `result[0]` contains all critical edges.
- `result[1]` contains all pseudo-critical edges.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the nodes in the graph be 0-indexed?
2. Can there be multiple edges with the same weight between the same nodes?
3. Should the solution handle graphs with disconnected components?

Assumptions based on standard interpretation:
1. Yes, the nodes are 0-indexed.
2. No, there are no multiple edges with the same weight between the same nodes.
3. No, the graph is always connected which ensures MST is always possible.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST. We will identify the critical and pseudo-critical edges by altering the graph and checking the impact on the MST.

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: For managing the connected components.
2. **Sort Edges by Weight**: For applying Kruskal's algorithm.
3. **MST Calculation**:
    - Standard MST calculation.
    - Check each edge if it is a critical or pseudo-critical edge:
        - **Critical Edge**:
          - Exclude the edge and calculate MST. If MST weight increases, it is critical.
        - **Pseudo-Critical Edge**:
          - Include the edge forcibly and calculate MST. If MST weight is the same, it is pseudo-critical.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) : parent(n), rank(n, 0) {
        iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
    }
    
    int find(int u) {
        if (u != parent[u])
            parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
        return parent[u];
    }
    
    bool unite(int u, int v) {
        int rootU = find(u);
        int rootV = find(v);
        if (rootU == rootV)
            return false;
        if (rank[rootU] < rank[rootV])
            parent[rootU] = rootV;
        else if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV])
            parent[rootV] = rootU;
        else {
            parent[rootV] = rootU;
            rank[rootU]++;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i)
            edges[i].push_back(i);
        
        sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            return a[2] < b[2];
        });

        int mst_weight = getMSTWeight(n, edges, -1, -1);
        
        vector<int> critical;
        vector<int> pseudoCritical;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
            if (getMSTWeight(n, edges, i, -1) > mst_weight)
                critical.push_back(edges[i][3]);
            else if (getMSTWeight(n, edges, -1, i) == mst_weight)
                pseudoCritical.push_back(edges[i][3]);
        }
        
        return {critical, pseudoCritical};
    }
    
private:
    int getMSTWeight(int n, const vector<vector<int>>& edges, int bannedEdge, int preIncludeEdge) {
        UnionFind uf(n);
        int weight = 0;
        
        if (preIncludeEdge != -1) {
            uf.unite(edges[preIncludeEdge][0], edges[preIncludeEdge][1]);
            weight += edges[preIncludeEdge][2];
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
            if (i != bannedEdge && uf.unite(edges[i][0], edges[i][1]))
                weight += edges[i][2];
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (uf.find(i) != uf.find(0))
                return INT_MAX;
        }
        
        return weight;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting edges: \(O(E \log E)\)
- MST weight calculation:
  - For each edge, we calculate MST by excluding or including it, which involves a traversal and union-find operations.
  - So, MST calculation for each edge: \(O(E \log V)\)
  - This is done for all edges: \(O(E^2 \log V)\)

Overall time complexity: \(O(E^2 \log V)\).
Let's verify this logic and see if optimization is possible based on real-world scenarios.
