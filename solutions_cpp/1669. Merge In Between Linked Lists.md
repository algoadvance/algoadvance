[Leetcode 1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1669)
### Problem Statement

You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.

* Merge the elements of `list2` starting from `a` to `b` of `list1`. Specifically, you should do the following operations:
  1. Remove the nodes `list1[a]` to `list1[b]` from list1 (inclusive).
  2. Add `list2` to `list1` in place of the removed sub-list.

The function needs to return the head of the modified `list1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the values of `a` and `b`?
   - Constraints ensure `0 <= a <= b < n`.
   
2. Is it guaranteed that the list indices `a` to `b` and `list2` will always be valid?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees valid inputs.

3. Are the values inside the nodes important, or only the structure?
   - Only the structure is relevant for merging.

### Strategy

The main idea is to splice `list2` into `list1` by removing the section from `a` to `b` in `list1` and inserting `list2` in its place.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Traverse `list1` to find the node just before `a`, i.e., `pre_a`.
2. Traverse `list1` to find the node just after `b`, i.e., `after_b`.
3. Connect `pre_a`'s next to the head of `list2`.
4. Traverse to the end of `list2` and connect its tail to `after_b`.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeInBetween(ListNode* list1, int a, int b, ListNode* list2) {
        // Initialize dummy nodes
        ListNode* dummy1 = new ListNode(0, list1);
        ListNode* pre_a = dummy1;
        for (int i = 0; i < a; ++i) {
            pre_a = pre_a->next;
        }
        
        // Traverse to the end of the segment that will be removed
        ListNode* after_b = pre_a;
        for (int i = 0; i <= b - a + 1; ++i) {
            after_b = after_b->next;
        }

        // Reference the head of list2 (start merging)
        pre_a->next = list2;

        // Traverse list2 to the end
        ListNode* end_of_list2 = list2;
        while (end_of_list2->next) {
            end_of_list2 = end_of_list2->next;
        }

        // Connect the end of list2 to the designated point in list1
        end_of_list2->next = after_b;
        
        // Return the modified list1
        ListNode* result = dummy1->next;
        delete dummy1; // Cleanup dummy node
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the length of `list1` up to index `b` and `m` is the length of `list2`. This ensures that our solution will traverse both lists efficiently and ensures optimal execution:

- `O(n)` for traversing from the head of `list1` to `pre_a` and `after_b`
- `O(m)` for traversing through `list2` to its end.
