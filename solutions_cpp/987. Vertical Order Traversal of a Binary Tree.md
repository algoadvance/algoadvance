[Leetcode 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l987)
### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree. A vertical traversal considers all nodes that share the same horizontal distance (column) from the root. Nodes that share the same horizontal distance and are on the same level are ordered by their row number. If multiple nodes have the same coordinates `(row, col)`, they should be sorted by their values. Return the list of vertical order traversal groupings.

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any edge cases we should be aware of?**
   - A: An edge case would be having a fully left-leaning or right-leaning tree, or all values being the same.

2. **How should we handle equal node values at the same `(row, col)` coordinates?**
   - A: When coordinates are the same, they should be sorted by node value.

3. **Is there any restriction on the structure of the input binary tree?**
   - A: No, the tree can be of any structure given the constraints.

Let's proceed with the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Coordinate Mapping**: We need to map each node to its `(col, row, value)`.
2. **Traversal**: We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree and record these coordinates.
3. **Sorting**: After collecting the nodes with their coordinates, we need to sort them.
4. **Grouping**: Finally, we will group the nodes based on their `col` values to get the required vertical order.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <set>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        // Map to store nodes sorted by column, then row, then value
        map<int, map<int, multiset<int>>> nodes;
        
        // Queue to perform BFS
        queue<pair<TreeNode*, pair<int, int>>> q;
        q.push({root, {0, 0}});  // {node, {col, row}}

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto p = q.front(); q.pop();
            TreeNode* node = p.first;
            int col = p.second.first;
            int row = p.second.second;
            nodes[col][row].insert(node->val);

            if (node->left) q.push({node->left, {col - 1, row + 1}});
            if (node->right) q.push({node->right, {col + 1, row + 1}});
        }

        // Collect the results into the final answer
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        for (auto& p : nodes) {
            vector<int> colVals;
            for (auto& q : p.second) {
                colVals.insert(colVals.end(), q.second.begin(), q.second.end());
            }
            result.push_back(colVals);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal**: The BFS traversal of the binary tree takes `O(N)` time, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- **Insertion in Map**: For each node, we are inserting it into the map structures. The map operations (insertions into the nested maps and multisets) are `O(log N)`.
- **Grouping and Sorting**: The subsequent collection and sorting steps are also bounded by tree size and logarithmic factors due to map operations. 

Overall, the complexity is `O(N log N)` due to the use of sorted data structures like `map` and `multiset`.

### Space Complexity

- Additional space required to store the map and queue structures is `O(N)`.

This completes the solution for the vertical order traversal of a binary tree.
