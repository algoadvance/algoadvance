[Leetcode 957. Prison Cells After N Days](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l957)
### Problem Statement
There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant. Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:
- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We are given the initial state of the prison in the form of an array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `i`-th cell is occupied, and `cells[i] == 0` if the `i`-th cell is vacant. We are also given an integer `N`.

Return the state of the prison after `N` days (and `N` such changes).

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can you explain the purpose of `N` in the problem statement? 
   - **N** represents the number of days the prison cell changes should be simulated.

2. Are the initial and final states of the cells input and output respectively? 
    - Yes, you will input the initial state and output the final state after N days.

### Strategy
1. Notice that the size of the problem (8 cells) is small enough, which makes finding cycles in the state change beneficial. 
2. Calculate the next state of the cells by checking the neighboring cells.
3. Use a hash map (or a dictionary) to store seen states and the day they were seen to detect cycles.
4. If a cycle is detected, use modulo operation to reduce the number of simulation steps needed.
5. Return the final state after N days.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<int> nextDayState(const vector<int>& cells) {
    vector<int> new_state(8, 0);
    for (int i = 1; i < 7; ++i) {
        new_state[i] = cells[i-1] == cells[i+1] ? 1 : 0;
    }
    return new_state;
}

vector<int> prisonAfterNDays(vector<int>& cells, int N) {
    unordered_map<string, int> seen;
    bool hasCycle = false;
    int cycleLength = 0;
    
    for (int day = 0; day < N; ++day) {
        vector<int> new_state = nextDayState(cells);
        string stateString = to_string(new_state[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < 8; ++i) {
            stateString += to_string(new_state[i]);
        }
        
        if (seen.find(stateString) != seen.end()) {
            hasCycle = true;
            cycleLength = day - seen[stateString];
            break;
        } else {
            seen[stateString] = day;
        }
        cells = new_state;
    }
    
    if (hasCycle) {
        N %= cycleLength;
        for (int day = 0; day < N; ++day) {
            cells = nextDayState(cells);
        }
    }
    
    return cells;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> cells = {0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1};
    int N = 7;
    vector<int> result = prisonAfterNDays(cells, N);
    for (int cell : result) {
        cout << cell << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Computing the next state takes `O(1)` as it involves a fixed amount of work (8 cells).
- Simulating the states for `N` days would be `O(N)`.
- Finding a cycle and then reducing the number of days with modulo operation could further reduce computation in practical scenarios.

In summary, the time complexity is `O(N)` in the worst case, but in practice, it can be reduced significantly if cycles are detected early.
