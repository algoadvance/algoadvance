[Leetcode 1886. Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1886)
## Problem Statement

You are given two `n x n` binary matrices `mat` and `target`. You can rotate `mat` by 90 degrees (clockwise) any number of times. Return `true` if it is possible to make `mat` equal to `target` by rotating `mat` in 90-degree increments; otherwise, return `false`.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]], target = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can rotate mat 90 degrees to get target.
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == mat.length == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `mat[i][j]` and `target[i][j]` are either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions
To fully understand the problem, we may want to ask:
- Are there any restrictions on the number of rotations (e.g., count should be minimized)?
- Are both matrices guaranteed to have the same dimensions and contain only binary values (0 and 1)?

## Strategy

1. **Define Rotation Operation**: Create a function to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Check All Possible Rotations**: Rotate the input matrix `mat` up to three times and check after each rotation whether it matches the `target` matrix.
3. **Return Result**: If any rotation results in `mat` being equal to `target`, return `true`. If none do, return `false`.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to rotate the given matrix 90 degrees clockwise
vector<vector<int>> rotate90Clockwise(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
    int n = mat.size();
    vector<vector<int>> rotatedMat(n, vector<int>(n));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            rotatedMat[j][n - 1 - i] = mat[i][j];
        }
    }
    return rotatedMat;
}

// Function to check if mat can be rotated to match target
bool findRotation(vector<vector<int>>& mat, vector<vector<int>>& target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        if (mat == target) {
            return true;
        }
        mat = rotate90Clockwise(mat);
    }
    return false;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Rotation Complexity**: Each 90-degree rotation operation has a time complexity of O(n^2), where `n` is the dimension of the matrix.
- **Comparison Complexity**: Each comparison of the `mat` with `target` is also O(n^2).
- **Total Complexity**: We perform up to four rotations and at most four comparisons. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(4 * n^2) which simplifies to O(n^2).

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints and ensures that we check all possible rotations in a systematic way.
