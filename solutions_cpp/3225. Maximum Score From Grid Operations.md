[Leetcode 3225. Maximum Score From Grid Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3225)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n`, which initially contains only 0s and 1s. You can perform the following operation on the grid any number of times:

1. **Choose any cell (i, j) which contains a 1 and mark it with a 2.**
2. **For each of its 4 adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), add 1 to them (this increase can exceed 1). If any of these cells contain 1, replace them with 2 and recursively continue for their adjacent 1s. This step stops when no more 1s are encountered in the adjacent cells.**

Your goal is to maximize the score of the grid, which is defined as the sum of all values in the grid.

Return the maximum score possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can values in the grid exceed 1?**
    - Yes, during the process values can exceed 1.
1. **Is it possible to handle up to the largest possible constraints within the function?**
    - Yes, the solution should work efficiently even for reasonably large grids.
1. **Should the function handle edge cases, such as grids with no 1s or grids that are already maximized?**
    - Yes, account for such edge cases.

## Strategy

1. **DFS Approach**: When you mark a `1` as `2`, use Depth First Search (DFS) to propagate this marking and addition to all connected `1`s.
2. **Grid Traversal**: Traverse the grid and for each cell containing `1`, start the DFS marking and addition.
3. **Edge Handling**: Carefully handle the grid boundaries to avoid out-of-bounds errors during the adjacent cells update.

## Code

Here's how we can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int m, n;
    vector<vector<int>> directions = \{\{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};
    
    int maxScoreFromGrid(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        m = grid.size();
        n = grid[0].size();
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if(grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxScore = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                maxScore += grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }

private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y) {
        if(grid[x][y] != 1) return;
        
        grid[x][y] = 2;
        
        for(auto& dir : directions) {
            int newX = x + dir[0];
            int newY = y + dir[1];
            
            if(isValid(newX, newY)) {
                grid[newX][newY]++;
                if(grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                    dfs(grid, newX, newY);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    bool isValid(int x, int y) {
        return x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {
        {1, 1, 0},
        {0, 1, 1},
        {1, 0, 0}
    };
    cout << "Maximum Score: " << sol.maxScoreFromGrid(grid) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **DFS Cost**:
    - Each DFS operation (initiated at each 1) visits the grid cells involved in the propagated cluster once.
    - Total DFS cost in worst-case (all 1s connected) is O(m * n).
2. **Grid Traversal**:
    - The double for-loop to traverse the grid in the `maxScoreFromGrid` function is O(m * n).
3. **Overall Complexity**:
    - O(m * n) because we perform DFS visits corresponding to each cell at most once due to marking.

This solution ensures that each cell is processed effectively, and the final grid state is evaluated correctly.
