[Leetcode 54. Spiral Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l54)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the matrix be empty? 
   - Yes, handle the case of an empty matrix by returning an empty list.
2. Does the matrix always have integers as elements?
   - Yes, the matrix will contain integer elements only.
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix?
   - No explicit constraints, but your solution should handle typical input sizes efficiently.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a simulation approach, where we simulate the process of traversing the matrix in spiral order. The matrix can be traversed layer by layer, and in each layer we can follow a specific direction order: right, down, left, and up. We keep track of our boundaries to know when to change direction. Hereâ€™s the detailed strategy:

1. **Initialize Boundaries**: Set the initial boundaries for rows and columns.
2. **Direction Vectors**: Use direction vectors to simplify the movement in the matrix.
3. **Traversal**:
   - Move to the right until the right boundary is reached.
   - Move down until the bottom boundary is reached.
   - Move left until the left boundary is reached.
   - Move up until the top boundary is reached.
   - After completing every cycle (right, down, left, up), adjust the boundaries accordingly.
4. **Completion**: Repeat the above steps until all elements have been traversed.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> spiralOrder(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
    if(matrix.empty()) return {};

    int m = matrix.size();
    int n = matrix[0].size();
    std::vector<int> result;
    
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;
    int top = 0;
    int bottom = m - 1;

    while (left <= right && top <= bottom) {
        // Traverse from left to right along the top row
        for (int col = left; col <= right; ++col) {
            result.push_back(matrix[top][col]);
        }
        ++top; // Move the top boundary down

        // Traverse from top to bottom along the right column
        for (int row = top; row <= bottom; ++row) {
            result.push_back(matrix[row][right]);
        }
        --right; // Move the right boundary to the left

        if (top <= bottom) { // Check if we still have rows to process
            // Traverse from right to left along the bottom row
            for (int col = right; col >= left; --col) {
                result.push_back(matrix[bottom][col]);
            }
            --bottom; // Move the bottom boundary up
        }

        if (left <= right) { // Check if we still have columns to process
            // Traverse from bottom to top along the left column
            for (int row = bottom; row >= top; --row) {
                result.push_back(matrix[row][left]);
            }
            ++left; // Move the left boundary to the right
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because every element in the matrix is visited exactly once. The space complexity is **O(1)** (excluding the space required for the output list), as we only use a few additional variables to manage the boundaries and directions.
