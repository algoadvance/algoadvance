[Leetcode 2124. Check if All A's Appears Before All B's](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2124)
### Problem Statement

- Title: **Check if All A's Appears Before All B's**
- Description: Given a string `s` consisting only of the characters 'a' and 'b', check if all the 'a' characters appear before all the 'b' characters in the string.

Example:
```
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: true

Input: "abab"
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Are there any invalid characters in the string or is it guaranteed to only contain 'a' and 'b'?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the function return a boolean value or a specific format of `true` and `false`?

Assuming:
- The input string `s` will only contain 'a' and 'b'.
- The maximum length of the string would be within typical input size constraints for LeetCode problems (e.g., up to \(10^5\) characters).
- The function should simply return a boolean value.

### Strategy

We need to iterate through the string and check if at any position a character 'b' is followed by a character 'a'. This would mean that 'a' does not appear before all 'b's, and we should return `false` in that case.

### Pseudocode

1. Iterate through the string character by character.
2. Initialize a flag `seenB` to `false`.
3. For each character:
   - If the character is 'b', set `seenB` to `true`.
   - If the character is 'a' and `seenB` is `true`, return `false` immediately.
4. If the loop completes without finding such a condition, return `true`.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkString(string s) {
        bool seenB = false;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == 'b') {
                seenB = true;
            } else if (c == 'a') {
                if (seenB) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate through the string exactly once, where \(n\) is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We use a constant amount of space irrespective of the input size. 

This solution is efficient since it only requires a single pass through the input string, ensuring optimal performance.
