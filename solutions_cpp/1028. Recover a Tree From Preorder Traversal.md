[Leetcode 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1028)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to recover a binary tree from its preorder traversal.

The preorder traversal is a string `S` of integers with a single space between adjacent nodes and formatted in such a way that nodes are represented with the number of dashes (-) preceding them, indicating their depth in the binary tree. 

For example, the preorder traversal string "1-2--3--4-5--6--7" represents the binary tree:

```
     1
   /   \
  2     5
 / \   / \
3   4 6   7
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** A string `S` representing the preorder traversal of a binary tree.
   - **Output:** The root of the binary tree.

2. **Tree Properties:**
   - The tree is a binary tree.
   - Each node's value is a positive integer.
   - The depth of each node is indicated by the number of dashes preceding it.

## Strategy

1. **Parse the String:**
   - Traverse through the string to identify the depth and value of each node.
   - Use a stack to keep track of nodes as we rebuild the tree. Nodes at each level are attached to the last node at the previous level.
 
2. **Build the Tree:**
   - For each node's value encountered, determine its depth.
   - If the depth of the current node is greater than the depth of the node on the top of the stack, it means this node is a left child. Attach it to the left of the last node.
   - If the depth is less than or equal to, pop nodes from the stack until the top of the stack reflects the parent node for this depth.
   - Attach appropriately to either the left or right based on the last depth-comparison.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* recoverFromPreorder(string S) {
        stack<TreeNode*> stk;
        int i = 0;

        while (i < S.size()) {
            int level = 0;

            // Count dashes to determine the depth of the current node
            while (i < S.size() && S[i] == '-') {
                level++;
                i++;
            }

            // Extract the value of the node
            int val = 0;
            while (i < S.size() && isdigit(S[i])) {
                val = val * 10 + (S[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }

            TreeNode *node = new TreeNode(val);

            // Adjust the stack according to the level
            while (stk.size() > level) {
                stk.pop();
            }

            if (!stk.empty()) {
                if (stk.top()->left == nullptr) {
                    stk.top()->left = node;
                } else {
                    stk.top()->right = node;
                }
            }

            stk.push(node);
        }

        // Root of the tree is at the bottom of the stack
        while (stk.size() > 1) {
            stk.pop();
        }
        
        return stk.top();
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Parsing the string and constructing the tree both take O(N), where N is the length of the string.
- Each node manipulation (push/pop in stack operations) happens in constant time relative to the node.

**Overall Time Complexity: O(N)**
