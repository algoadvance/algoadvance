[Leetcode 2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2841)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `m`, find the maximum sum of a subarray of length `m` in which there are at most `k` different numbers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in the array be negative?
   - Yes, subarrays can contain negative numbers.
2. Is it guaranteed that a subarray of length `m` exists?
   - Yes, the constraint will ensure `nums` has at least `m` elements.
3. Can `k` be greater than the actual number of unique elements in the given array `nums`?
   - Yes, in that case, we consider all unique elements present in the subarray.

### Strategy

To solve the problem effectively, we can use a sliding window approach combined with a hashmap to track the frequency of each element in the current window. The steps are as follows:

1. Use a sliding window of size `m`.
2. Maintain a hashmap to count the occurrences of each number in the current window.
3. Check the number of unique elements in the current window using the hashmap.
4. If the count of unique elements in the window is greater than `k`, slide the window to the right.
5. Keep track of the maximum sum of all valid windows (with at most `k` unique elements).

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<int>& nums, int m, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int maxSum = 0, currentSum = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            freqMap[nums[i]]++;
            currentSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        if (freqMap.size() <= k) {
            maxSum = currentSum;
        }
        
        for (int i = m; i < n; i++) {
            int outElem = nums[i - m];
            if (--freqMap[outElem] == 0) {
                freqMap.erase(outElem);
            }
            currentSum -= outElem;
            
            int inElem = nums[i];
            freqMap[inElem]++;
            currentSum += inElem;
            
            if (freqMap.size() <= k) {
                maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 2, 2};
    int m = 3, k = 2;
    cout << sol.maxSum(nums, m, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once when it enters the window and once when it exits the window).

- Sliding window iteration over `nums` is O(n).
- Hashmap operations (insertion, deletion) are O(1) on average.

Overall, this solution efficiently solves the problem with linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes.
