[Leetcode 921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l921)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` of '(', ')' and lowercase English characters, return the minimum number of parentheses `(` or `)` that you need to add to make the parentheses in the string valid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the lowercase English characters significant in determining the validity of the parentheses?
   - No, the lowercase English characters do not affect the validity of the parentheses. They can be ignored for the purpose of this problem.
2. Can the string be empty?
   - Yes, it's possible for the string to be empty. An empty string is already valid, so the result for an empty string should be `0`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and keep track of unbalanced parentheses. We can use a counter to track open and close parentheses as we iterate through the string:
1. Initialize two counters: `open_needed` and `close_needed`. These counters will represent the number of parentheses needed to balance the string.
2. Traverse through the string character by character:
   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', increment the `open_needed` counter.
   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', check if `open_needed` is greater than 0 (which means there is an unmatched '(' available to be matched):
     - If `open_needed` is greater than 0, decrement `open_needed` because this closing parenthesis can balance with a previous '('.
     - Otherwise, increment `close_needed` because this closing parenthesis does not have a matching opening parenthesis.

3. At the end of the traversal, the sum of `open_needed` and `close_needed` will be the minimum number of parentheses needed to make the string valid.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are traversing the string only once.

### Code

Here's the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minAddToMakeValid(string s) {
        int open_needed = 0;
        int close_needed = 0;
        
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                open_needed++;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                if (open_needed > 0) {
                    open_needed--;
                } else {
                    close_needed++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return open_needed + close_needed;
    }
};
```

To summarize:
- `open_needed` tracks the number of unmatched '(' parentheses.
- `close_needed` tracks the number of unmatched ')' parentheses.
- The total number of parentheses to add is the sum of `open_needed` and `close_needed`.
