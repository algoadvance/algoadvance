[Leetcode 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l668)
### Problem Statement

Given the integers `m` and `n`, return the `k`-th smallest number in the `m x n` multiplication table. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `m`, `n`, and `k`:**
   - How large can `m`, `n`, and `k` be?
   - Typically for Leetcode problems, constraints are provided in the problem description:
     - `1 <= m, n <= 300`
     - `1 <= k <= m * n`

2. **Unique Values:** 
   - Do the elements in the multiplication table have to be unique?
     - No, elements value can repeat. For example, in a 3x3 table both (2,3) and (3,2) can have the value 6.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Use binary search on the value of elements in the table.
   - The multiplication table has values ranging from `1` to `m * n`.
   
2. **Count of Values Less Than or Equal to `x`:**
   - For a given `x`, count how many values in the table are less than or equal to `x`.
   - For each row `i`, the number of values less than or equal to `x` is `min(x / i, n)` because the elements in row `i` are `i, 2*i, ..., i*n`.
   
3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - Set the start of the binary search to 1 and the end to `m * n`.
   - Calculate the middle value and count how many elements are less than or equal to the middle.
   - If the count is less than `k`, move the start to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, move the end to `mid`.
   - The condition will converge on the k-th smallest element.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int findKthNumber(int m, int n, int k) {
        int low = 1, high = m * n;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (countLessEqual(mid, m, n) < k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
    
private:
    int countLessEqual(int x, int m, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            count += std::min(x / i, n);
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int m = 3, n = 3, k = 5;
    std::cout << "The " << k << "th smallest number in the " << m << "x" << n << " multiplication table is " << sol.findKthNumber(m, n, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * log(m * n) + min(m, n) * log(m * n))`
  - The dominating factor is binary search, which contributes `O(log(m * n))`.
  - Inside the binary search, we count elements which takes `O(m)` or `O(n)` depending on the values.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we only use a constant amount of extra space.
