[Leetcode 3165. Maximum Sum of Subsequence With Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3165)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. Your task is to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no two elements are adjacent in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the elements of the array be negative?
   - **A:** Yes, the elements can be negative.

2. **Q:** What is the length range of the array `nums`?
   - **A:** The length of the array can range from 0 to 10^4.

3. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, the input array can be empty. If it is, the maximum sum is 0.

4. **Q:** Do we need to account for cases with only one element?
   - **A:** Yes, if the array has only one element, the maximum sum is the value of that element itself.

### Strategy

This problem is an example of a dynamic programming problem. The main idea is to use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum that can be obtained using elements from the subarray `nums[0]` to `nums[i]` with the constraint that no two elements are adjacent.

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If the array is empty, return 0.
   - If the array contains only one element, return that element.
   - If the array contains two elements, return the maximum of the two.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each element `i`, we have two choices:
     - Include the current element `i`: In this case, we add `nums[i]` to the maximum sum we can obtain up to `i-2` (i.e., `dp[i-2] + nums[i]`).
     - Exclude the current element `i`: In this case, the maximum sum we can obtain is up to `i-1` (i.e., `dp[i-1]`).
   - Therefore, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxSumNonAdjacent(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];
    
    // Initialize the dp array
    std::vector<int> dp(n);
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = std::max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    
    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = std::max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i]);
    }
    
    // The answer will be in dp[n-1]
    return dp[n-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the `dp` array. However, this can be optimized to `O(1)` by using two variables instead of an array, since we only need the last two computed values at each step.

### Optimized Solution

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxSumNonAdjacent(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];
    
    int prev2 = nums[0];
    int prev1 = std::max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    
    for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
        int current = std::max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i]);
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = current;
    }
    
    return prev1;
}
```

### Explanation of Optimized Solution

Instead of maintaining a full `dp` array, the optimized version keeps track of just the two most recent values (`prev1` and `prev2`). This reduces the space complexity to `O(1)` while maintaining the same time complexity of `O(n)`.
