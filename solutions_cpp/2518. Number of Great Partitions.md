[Leetcode 2518. Number of Great Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2518)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers and an integer `k`.

A partition of the array is called **"great"** if both of the following conditions are true:

1. The sum of the elements in the first part is greater than or equal to `k`.
2. The sum of the elements in the second part is greater than or equal to `k`.

Return the number of different "great" partitions. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `n` and `k`:** What are the constraints on the size of the input array (`n`) and the value of `k`?
   - This can help determine the feasibility of different algorithm approaches.

2. **Partition Details:** Are we allowed to partition the array into exactly two non-empty contiguous subarrays, or are non-contiguous subarrays allowed?

3. **Element Range:** What is the range of the values in the array `nums`?

These questions are essential to understand the problem fully and tailor our approach accordingly.

## Strategy

Given the constraints and problem requirements, dynamic programming or a variation might be useful here. Here's a high-level strategy:

1. **Initialize Dynamic Programming Arrays:** Use dynamic programming arrays to count the number of subsets with a specific sum.
   
2. **Subset Sum Calculation:** Calculate the number of subsets that have a sum less than `k`.

3. **Total Subsets:** Calculate the total number of subsets (`2^n`).

4. **Great Partitions Calculation:** Subtract the invalid partitions (those that don't meet the criteria for being "great") from the total number.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = nums.size();
        long total_sum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of elements in nums
        for (int num : nums) {
            total_sum += num;
        }

        // If total_sum < 2 * k, it's not possible to have a great partition
        if (total_sum < 2 * k) {
            return 0;
        }

        // DP array to store the number of ways to form specific sums
        vector<int> dp(k, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // There is one way to form the sum 0 (by taking no elements)

        // Fill the dp array
        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int j = k - 1; j >= num; --j) {
                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - num]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Calculate the number of invalid partitions
        long invalid_partitions = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            invalid_partitions = (invalid_partitions + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }

        // Total number of partitions (2^n)
        long total_partitions = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            total_partitions = (total_partitions * 2) % MOD;
        }

        // The result is total_partitions - 2 * invalid_partitions
        long result = (total_partitions - 2 * invalid_partitions + MOD) % MOD;
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Subset Sum Calculation (DP):** `O(n * k)`
  - We iterate through each element in `nums` and update the DP array for sums up to `k`.
  
- **Total Partitions Calculation:** `O(n)`
  - This involves calculating `2^n`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n * k)**, which should be efficient given typical constraints.
