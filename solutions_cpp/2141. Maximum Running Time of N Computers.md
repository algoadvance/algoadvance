[Leetcode 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2141)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` computers and `b` batteries. The power consumption of all computers is the same, and each battery can power any computer. You need to maximize the time `t` (in hours) for which all `n` computers can be running simultaneously. You can swap batteries between any two computers, but each battery can only power one computer at a time.

**Input:**
- `n`: An integer representing the number of computers.
- `b`: A list of integers where each integer represents the power available in each battery.

**Output:**
- Return an integer representing the maximum number of hours `t` that all `n` computers can run simultaneously.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can a battery be split into smaller batteries? 
   - No, a battery cannot be split.
2. Should each computer have exactly one battery at all times?
   - No, a battery can be swapped out for another as needed.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxRunTime(int n, vector<int>& batteries) {
        long long left = 0, right = accumulate(batteries.begin(), batteries.end(), 0LL) / n;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (canRunAllComputers(n, batteries, mid)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }

private:
    bool canRunAllComputers(int n, vector<int>& batteries, long long time) {
        long long totalPower = 0;
        for (auto& battery : batteries) {
            totalPower += min((long long)battery, time);
        }
        return totalPower >= time * n;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Requirements**: We need to find the maximum time `t` for which all `n` computers can simultaneously use the available `b` batteries.

2. **Binary Search**: Employ binary search on the possible running times `t`, because the problem exhibits monotonicity:
    - If it's possible to run all computers for `t` hours, it should also be possible for `t-1` hours.
    - Conversely, if it's not possible for `t` hours, it won't be possible for `t+1` hours.

3. **Feasibility Check (`canRunAllComputers`)**: Check if it is possible to run all `n` computers for `t` hours using the given batteries:
    - Calculate the total possible power `totalPower` from all batteries but cap each battery's contribution at `t` hours (since beyond `t` hours for each battery is unnecessary).
    - Confirm that the sum of these capped contributions is at least `t * n`.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The runtime of the binary search is `O(log(max_time))`, where `max_time` is the total power of all batteries divided by `n`.
- **Feasibility Check**:
    - Each check iterates through the list of batteries, making it `O(m)` where `m` is the number of batteries.
    - This results in an overall time complexity of `O(m * log(max_time))`.

Therefore, the algorithm is efficient and should handle reasonably large inputs well.
