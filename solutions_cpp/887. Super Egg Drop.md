[Leetcode 887. Super Egg Drop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l887)
### Problem Statement

You are given `K` eggs and you have access to a building with `N` floors from 1 to N.

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot use it again. You want to know the minimum number of attempts you need to find out the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking.

You need to determine the minimum number of attempts you need in the worst case to find the critical floor.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the object to minimize the number of attempts in the worst case scenario?**
   - Yes, we need to find the minimum number of drops required in the worst case.

2. **Can we assume the input values for K (number of eggs) and N (number of floors) are within a reasonable range, or do we need to consider very high values?**
   - Yes, you should consider that K and N can be relatively large.

3. **When an egg is dropped from a floor and it doesn't break, can we reuse the egg?**
   - Yes, if the egg does not break, it can be reused.

### Strategy

The problem of finding the critical floor with the minimum number of attempts in the worst case can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the number of eggs and `j` is the number of floors:

- Base case: If we have 1 egg, then in the worst case, we need to perform `j` drops (one for each floor).
- Base case: If we have `j` floors and 1 egg, the answer is `j` because we have to try each floor.
  
The recursive relation is:
- If we drop an egg from the `x`th floor:
  - If the egg breaks, we need to check the floors below (`x-1`) with `i-1` eggs.
  - If the egg does not break, we need to check the floors above (`N-x`) with the same number of eggs (`i`).

Thus, our formula will be:
\[ \text{dp}[i][j] = 1 + \min_{1 \leq x \leq j} (\max(\text{dp}[i-1][x-1], \text{dp}[i][j-x])) \]

Where `1 + ...` indicates the drop from the `x`th floor and we take the minimum of the worst-case scenarios among all choices of `x`.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int superEggDrop(int K, int N) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(K+1, vector<int>(N+1, 0));

    // Fill the table for cases with 1 egg and various floors
    for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        dp[1][j] = j; // If we have one egg, we need j drops for j floors.
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= K; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
            for (int x = 1; x <= j; ++x) {
                // Taking maximum of the two scenarios (egg breaks or egg does not break)
                int attempts = 1 + max(dp[i-1][x-1], dp[i][j-x]);
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], attempts);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[K][N];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution can be broken down as follows:
- We are filling a table of size `K x N`.
- Each cell computation involves a loop that can go up to `j`.

Thus, the time complexity is \(O(K \times N^2)\). This can be optimized using binary search in the inner loop to bring it to \(O(K \times N \log N)\).

### Optimized Code (Using Binary Search)

To optimize the inner loop using binary search:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int superEggDrop(int K, int N) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(K+1, vector<int>(N+1, 0));

    for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        dp[1][j] = j;
    }

    for (int i = 2; i <= K; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
            int low = 1, high = j;
            while (low <= high) {
                int mid = (low + high) / 2;
                int breaks = dp[i-1][mid-1];  // Egg breaks
                int not_breaks = dp[i][j-mid];  // Egg does not break
                int worst = 1 + max(breaks, not_breaks);
                if (breaks > not_breaks) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], worst);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[K][N];
}
```

This optimized version reduces the time complexity to \(O(K \times N \log N)\).
