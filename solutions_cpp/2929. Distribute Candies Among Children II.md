[Leetcode 2929. Distribute Candies Among Children II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2929)
### Problem Statement:

We need to distribute `n` candies among `k` children in such a way that the `i-th` child gets at least `i` candies. If it is not possible to distribute the candies this way, return an empty array. Otherwise, return an array `ans` of length `k`, where `ans[i]` is the number of candies that the `i-th` child receives.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value for `n` (number of candies) and `k` (number of children)?
   - Are `n` and `k` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?

2. **Output format:**
   - Should the array `ans` list candy distributions starting from the first child to the `k`-th child (0-indexed or 1-indexed)?

3. **Edge cases:**
   - What should be returned if `k` is 0?
   - What if there are more candies than needed, should the excess candies be distributed equally or arbitrarily?

### Strategy:

1. **Minimum Candy Requirement Calculation:**
   - Compute the minimum number of candies required to satisfy the distribution rule: Every child `i` (1-indexed) should get at least `i` candies. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers: `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

2. **Feasibility Check:**
   - If `n` is less than the minimum required number of candies, return an empty array.

3. **Initial Distribution:**
   - Distribute the minimum required candies first as `i` candies to the `i-th` child.

4. **Distribute Remaining Candies:**
   - Distribute any remaining candies starting from the first child until all candies are distributed.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

std::vector<int> distributeCandies(int n, int k) {
    // Calculate the minimum number of candies required
    int min_required = k * (k + 1) / 2;
    
    // If not enough candies, return an empty vector
    if (n < min_required) {
        return {};
    }
    
    // Initialize distribution with the minimum requirement
    std::vector<int> distribution(k);
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        distribution[i] = i + 1;
    }
    
    // Distribute the remaining candies
    int remaining = n - min_required;
    int index = 0;
    while (remaining > 0) {
        distribution[index % k] += 1;
        remaining -= 1;
        index += 1;
    }
    
    return distribution;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initial distribution of `k` candies:** O(k)
- **Distributing the remaining candies:** O(n - k * (k + 1) / 2), which in the worst case is O(n) when every remaining candy needs to be individually placed.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(k + n), which should be efficient for typical input limits.

If you have any further clarifications or need additional details, feel free to ask!
