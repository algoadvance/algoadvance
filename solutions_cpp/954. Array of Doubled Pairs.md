[Leetcode 954. Array of Doubled Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l954)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` of even length, and you need to check if it is possible to reorder the array such that `arr[2*i + 1] = 2 * arr[2*i]` for every `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < `len(arr) / 2`).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [3,1,3,6]
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [2,1,2,6]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [4,-2,2,-4]
Output: true
Explanation: We can take two pairs: (4, 2) and (-2, -4) to yield the reordering [4, -2, 2, -4]
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= arr.length <= 3 * 10^4
- arr.length is even
- -10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain duplicate values?
2. Should I account for both positive and negative numbers?
3. What edge cases should I consider (e.g., all zeros)?
4. Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?

### Strategy

1. **Handle Special Cases**:
   - If the array is empty, return true as it's trivially valid.
   - Any zero in the array should be handled carefully since `0 * 2 = 0`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sort the array by absolute values. Sorting by absolute values helps in pairing positive and negative numbers properly.

3. **Counter to Track Frequencies**:
   - Use a frequency counter to keep track of the occurrences of each number.

4. **Validation**:
   - Iterate over the sorted array and use the frequency counter to ensure pairing each number with its double (or half).
   - Decrease the count from the frequency counter as pairs are formed.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Checking Pairs**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- Overall: O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

bool canReorderDoubled(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Frequency count of elements
    std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
    for (const int& num : arr) {
        freq[num]++;
    }

    // Sort the array by absolute value
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end(), [](int a, int b) { return std::abs(a) < std::abs(b); });

    // Check each element to form the valid pairs
    for (const int& num : arr) {
        if (freq[num] == 0) continue; // Skip if already used in a pair
        if (freq[2 * num] == 0) return false; // If no pair exists, return false
        
        // Decrease the frequency for the current number and its pair
        freq[num]--;
        freq[2 * num]--;
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Map**: First, create a frequency map to track how many times each element appears.
2. **Sorting by Absolute Values**: Sorting by the absolute values allows us to manage negative numbers and positive numbers uniformly.
3. **Pair Formation**: Traverse through the sorted array, and try to form pairs using the frequency map. If at any point a necessary pair can't be formed, return `false`.
4. **Return True**: If we can successfully form all pairs as required, return `true`.

This approach ensures that we handle potential edge cases, including negative values and zeros, effectively.
