[Leetcode 1872. Stone Game VIII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1872)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

**Initially, there are `n` stones arranged in a row.**

**On each player's turn, the player does the following:**
  - Choose a number, `k` (1 <= k <= m), such that the player can remove exactly `k` stones from the row. The chosen number `k` must always be from a fixed list of numbers given as `arr[i]`. The player can choose any number from the list `arr[i]`.
  - If a player cannot make a move, that player loses the game.

**Given the initial number of stones `n`, the list `arr` of possible counts of stones that a player can remove on each turn, determine the winner if both players play optimally.**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= n`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any restrictions on the numbers in the list `arr`?**
   - Each element of `arr` represents a valid number of stones that can be removed in a turn.
   
2. **Should we assume that `m` is included as part of the input in some form?**
   - Yes, the size of the list `arr` effectively serves this role.

3. **Is optimal play always guaranteed from both players?**
   - Yes, both Alice and Bob play optimally.

4. **Are the numbers in `arr` distinct?**
   - Yes, the entries in `arr` are distinct.

## Strategy

The goal of the problem is to determine if Alice (the starting player) can guarantee a win given `n` stones and the list `arr` of allowed moves. Both players will play optimally.

We can use dynamic programming to keep track of winning and losing positions. The essence is:
- Create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i]` is `true` if the current player can guarantee a win with `i` stones left.
- Initialize `dp[0]` as `false` since the player to move with 0 stones already on the board loses.
- For each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, determine if there is a valid move `k` in `arr` such that `dp[i-k]` is `false`. If so, set `dp[i]` to `true`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

bool stoneGameVIII(int n, std::vector<int>& arr) {
    std::vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);  // dp[i] is true if the player to move can force a win with i stones.
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (const int &k : arr) {
            if (i >= k && !dp[i - k]) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    int n = 10;  // Number of stones
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 4}; // Possible moves

    bool result = stoneGameVIII(n, arr);
    if(result) std::cout << "Alice wins." << std::endl;
    else std::cout << "Bob wins." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** `O(n)` to initialize the `dp` vector.
- **Calculation:** For each `i` from `1` to `n`, we check all `k` in `arr` which takes `O(n * len(arr))`.

So, the overall time complexity is **O(n * len(arr))**, where `len(arr)` is the length of the array `arr`. Given the constraints, this is efficient and feasible.
