[Leetcode 2234. Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2234)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `flowers` where `flowers[i]` represents the beauty of the i-th flower in your garden. You want to select some subset of the flowers and remove them from the garden entirely so that the total beauty of the remaining flowers in the garden is maximized. You are allowed to remove any number of flowers (possibly zero).

Return the maximum total beauty of the garden after removing some (possibly zero) flowers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The length of the array `flowers` could be up to \(10^5\).

2. **What values can be present in the array?**
   - Beauty values in the array `flowers` can be positive or negative.

3. **What should be the return value if all flower beauty values are negative?**
   - In such a case, we should consider removing all flowers to maximize the beauty (which would be 0).

### Strategy

1. **Identify Positive Contributions:**
   - Any flower with positive beauty will contribute positively to the total beauty if included.
   
2. **Ignore Negative Contributions:**
   - Any flower with negative beauty will reduce the total beauty if included. Hence, we would exclude all such flowers.
   
3. **Combine Positive Beauties:**
   - Sum up all positive beauties to get the maximum total beauty.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBeauty(std::vector<int>& flowers) {
        int maxBeauty = 0;

        for (int beauty : flowers) {
            if (beauty > 0) {
                maxBeauty += beauty;
            }
        }
        
        return maxBeauty;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We only iterate through the array once, making the solution linear in terms of the size of the array.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Explanation

- Traverse the `flowers` array.
- For each element in the array:
  - If the element is positive, add it to the `maxBeauty`.
  - Ignore any negative elements.
- Return the sum of the positive elements as this value represents the maximum total beauty after potentially removing negative beauty flowers.

The simplicity of this approach ensures it handles large input sizes efficiently, adhering to typical constraints encountered in competitive programming and coding interviews.
