[Leetcode 1505. Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1505)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer and an integer `k`. You are allowed to swap any two adjacent digits of the number at most `k` times.

Return the minimum possible integer you can obtain by applying at most `k` adjacent swaps on the digits.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `num`?
   - Is there any constraint on the values of the digits in `num` beyond it being a numeric string?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if `k` is 0?
   - How do we handle cases where the string consists of all identical digits?

3. **Performance:**
   - Is there any upper limit on the computational complexity we should aim to achieve for this solution?

Since the problem typically involves string manipulation and combinatorial operations, understanding these constraints will help craft an efficient solution.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to rearrange the digits of the string `num` to get the smallest possible integer by performing at most `k` adjacent swaps.

2. **Optimal Substructure:**
   - The problem could be tackled by dynamically finding the smallest lexicographical order by comparing and swapping the adjacent digits carefully.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a greedy approach to place the smallest possible digits at the front within the allowed number of swaps.
   - Utilize a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently track and fetch the smallest digit within a limited range.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Traverse the string and at each digit, check all possible positions up to `k` steps ahead and find the smallest digit.
   - Calculate the number of swaps needed to bring this smallest digit to the current position.
   - Perform the swap operations and reduce the remaining `k` accordingly.
   - Continue the process until you've minimized the entire string or `k` is exhausted.

### Code Implementation

Here is a C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string minInteger(std::string num, int k) {
    int n = num.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n && k > 0; ++i) {
        // Find the smallest digit in the range num[i] to num[i + k]
        // So we need a min element from subarray [i, min(i + k, n - 1)]
        int pos = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n && j - i <= k; ++j) {
            if (num[j] < num[pos]) {
                pos = j;
            }
        }

        // Number of swaps required to bring pos to i
        int swaps = pos - i;

        // If we can swap within k
        if (swaps <= k) {
            // Bring num[pos] to the i-th position by swapping one by one
            char selected = num[pos];
            for (int j = pos; j > i; --j) {
                num[j] = num[j - 1];
            }
            num[i] = selected;
            k -= swaps;
        }
    }
    return num;
}

int main() {
    std::string num = "4321";
    int k = 4;
    std::cout << "Minimum possible integer: " << minInteger(num, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the length of the string `num`. For each digit, we potentially scan up to `k` digits ahead to find the smallest digit. This should be efficient enough for reasonably sized inputs within typical constraints seen in competitive programming.

*Note: The exact constraints were not specified in the initial problem statement provided, so performance considerations are made for typical input sizes. For very large inputs, more advanced data structures (like segment trees) might be required to optimize the solution further.*
