[Leetcode 2288. Apply Discount to Prices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2288)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `sentence` representing a sentence that has some prices enclosed within dollar signs. The prices are formatted as integers and should be formatted to at most two decimal places. You need to apply a discount of `discount` percentage to those prices and return the new sentence, where all the prices are adjusted according to the given discount.

### Example:

**Input:** 
- `sentence = "there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop"`
- `discount = 50`

**Output:** 
- `"there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop"`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= sentence.length <= 1000`
- The value of prices will not exceed 10^7.
- The discount percentage will be an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are prices always valid positive integers?
   **A:** Yes, according to the problem constraints, prices are valid positive integers not exceeding 10^7.
   
2. **Q:** Can the prices be at the beginning or end of the sentence?
   **A:** Yes, prices can appear anywhere in the sentence.

3. **Q:** Will there be spaces or special characters between different price values?
   **A:** Yes, prices will be part of the sentence which can include spaces and other characters.

4. **Q:** Should non-price substrings be left unchanged in the final output?
   **A:** Yes, only the prices should be modified, all other parts of the sentence remain unchanged.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through the sentence** while parsing for prices denoted by a leading `$`.
2. **Extract the price** and apply the given discount.
3. **Format the new price** ensuring it retains up to two decimal places.
4. **Reconstruct the sentence** with the adjusted prices.

## Code

Here's the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

string applyDiscount(string sentence, int discount) {
    stringstream ss(sentence);
    string word;
    string result;
    double discountFactor = (100 - discount) / 100.0;
    
    while (ss >> word) {
        if (word[0] == '$' && word.size() > 1 && isdigit(word[1])) {
            bool validPrice = true;
            for (int i = 1; i < word.size(); ++i) {
                if (!isdigit(word[i])) {
                    validPrice = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (validPrice) {
                double price = stod(word.substr(1));
                double discountedPrice = price * discountFactor;
                stringstream updatedPriceStream;
                updatedPriceStream << fixed << setprecision(2) << "$" << discountedPrice;
                word = updatedPriceStream.str();
            }
        }
        if (!result.empty()) {
            result += " ";
        }
        result += word;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string sentence = "there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop";
    int discount = 50;
    
    string updatedSentence = applyDiscount(sentence, discount);
    cout << updatedSentence << endl; // Output: "there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop"
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Iterating through the sentence**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the sentence.
- **Price extraction and replacement**: O(k) for each price substring, where `k` is the length of the price string.
- The overall complexity will be linear in terms of the number of characters in the sentence.

Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input sentence.
