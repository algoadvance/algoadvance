[Leetcode 2970. Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2970)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. A subarray `[nums[i], nums[i + 1], ..., nums[j]]` is considered as incremovable if the following two conditions are met:
- The sum of the subarray is even.
- If you remove the entire subarray, the sum of the elements in the remaining part of the array cannot be greater than or equal to the original sum of the array.

Your task is to return the number of different incremovable subarrays.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 incremovable subarrays:
- [1, 2, 3, 4] -> Sum = 10 (even) and sum of remaining array (after removing this subarray) can never be >= 10
- [2, 3, 4] -> Sum = 9 (odd)
- [1, 2, 3] -> Sum = 6 (even) and sum of remaining array (after removing this subarray) cannot be >= 10
- [3, 4] -> Sum = 7 (odd)
Two more subarrays can also be counted: [2], [4].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input array length (`n`) and the values inside the array?**
   - Typical constraints include `1 <= n <= 10^4` and `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.

2. **Does the array contain only integers?**
   - Yes, the array contains only integer values.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum of the Array**:
   - First, we calculate the total sum `S` of the array.

2. **Iterate Over All Possible Subarrays**:
   - We iterate over all possible subarrays `[nums[i], nums[i + 1], ..., nums[j]]` and their sums.
   - For each subarray, we check if the sum of the subarray is even.
   - We also check if the remaining part of the array's sum is less than the original sum `S`.

3. **Count the Incremovable Subarrays**:
   - Count the number of subarrays that satisfy both conditions and return the count.

## Code Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // For std::accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    int countIncremovableSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Calculate the total sum of the array
        int total_sum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);

        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        // Iterate over all possible subarrays
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int current_sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                current_sum += nums[j];
                // Check if the sum of the subarray is even
                if (current_sum % 2 == 0) {
                    // Calculate the remaining sum of the array if this subarray is removed
                    int remaining_sum = total_sum - current_sum;
                    // Check if the remaining sum is less than the original total sum
                    if (remaining_sum < total_sum) {
                        ++count;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating over all possible subarrays, leading to a nested loop.

- Outer loop runs \(n\) times.
- Inner loop runs up to \(n\) times for each iteration of the outer loop.

In total, the nested loops will run \(n \times n = n^2\) times in the worst case, making the overall time complexity \(O(n^2)\).
