[Leetcode 232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l232)
### Problem Statement

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `peek`, `pop`, and `empty`).

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Implement the `MyQueue` class:
  - `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
  - `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
  - `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
  - `boolean empty()` Returns whether the queue is empty.

**Constraints:**
- You must use only standard stack operations â€” which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a deque or list if needed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Should I assume the elements are non-negative integers, or can they also be negative?**
   - Elements can be any integer.

2. **Is there a maximum number of elements that the queue should support?**
   - No specific limit, handle as many elements as possible within the constraints of typical memory limits.

3. **Can we assume that `pop` and `peek` will not be called on an empty queue?**
   - No, handle such cases gracefully, either by throwing an error or returning a specific value.

### Strategy

To implement this queue using two stacks, we can use the following strategy:

- Use two stacks, `input` and `output`.
- For the `push` operation, simply push the element onto the `input` stack.
- For the `pop` operation, if the `output` stack is empty, pour all the elements from the `input` stack into the `output` stack, then pop the top of the `output` stack.
- For the `peek` operation, if the `output` stack is empty, pour all the elements from the `input` stack into the `output` stack, then peek the top element of the `output` stack.
- The `empty` operation should check if both stacks are empty.

This way, we ensure that the oldest elements are popped and peeked first, maintaining the queue order.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the `MyQueue` class:
```cpp
#include <stack>

class MyQueue {
private:
    std::stack<int> input;
    std::stack<int> output;

public:
    MyQueue() {
    }
    
    void push(int x) {
        input.push(x);
    }
    
    int pop() {
        if (output.empty()) {
            while (!input.empty()) {
                output.push(input.top());
                input.pop();
            }
        }
        int val = output.top();
        output.pop();
        return val;
    }
    
    int peek() {
        if (output.empty()) {
            while (!input.empty()) {
                output.push(input.top());
                input.pop();
            }
        }
        return output.top();
    }
    
    bool empty() {
        return input.empty() && output.empty();
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Push Operation (`push`)**: O(1) - Pushing onto a stack is an O(1) operation.
- **Pop Operation (`pop`)**: Amortized O(1) - Each element is moved from `input` to `output` at most once.
- **Peek Operation (`peek`)**: Amortized O(1) - Each element is moved from `input` to `output` at most once.
- **Check Empty Operation (`empty`)**: O(1) - Simply checking if both stacks are empty.

Therefore, while individual `pop` and `peek` operations may sometimes take linear time in the worst case when elements are moved between the stacks, on average, each operation runs in constant time.
