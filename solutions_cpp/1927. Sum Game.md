[Leetcode 1927. Sum Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1927)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` consisting of digits and the characters '?'. Each `?` can be replaced with any digit from `0` to `9`, you need to determine whether Alice can guarantee to win the game if she plays optimally.

The rules of the game are as follows:
- Alice and Bob take turns, starting with Alice, replacing one `?` with any digit from `0` to `9`.
- The goal for Alice is to force the sum of the first half of the digits to not be equal to the sum of the second half.

Return **true** if Alice can guarantee to win, otherwise return **false**.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the requirements, consider the following clarifications:
- How long can the string `num` be?
- Are there guaranteed to be an equal number of '?' in the first and the second halves?
- Can `num` be an odd length, or is it guaranteed to be even?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Analysis**: Compare the number of '?' in both halves and the sum of known digits.
2. **Calculate Contributions**:
   - Compute the difference in the sum of known digits between the two halves.
   - Compute the difference in the number of '?' between the two halves.
3. **Winning Conditions**: Derive the conditions under which Alice can guarantee the win.
   - Alice should ensure that the number of '?' and digit difference leads to an imbalance that cannot be corrected by Bob.

### Code

Below is the C++ solution for this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool sumGame(string num) {
    int n = num.size();
    int half = n / 2;
    int sumA = 0, sumB = 0, countQuesA = 0, countQuesB = 0;

    // Calculate the sum and count '?' for both halves
    for (int i = 0; i < half; ++i) {
        if (num[i] == '?') {
            countQuesA++;
        } else {
            sumA += num[i] - '0';
        }
    }
    for (int i = half; i < n; ++i) {
        if (num[i] == '?') {
            countQuesB++;
        } else {
            sumB += num[i] - '0';
        }
    }

    int deltaSum = sumA - sumB;
    int deltaQues = countQuesA - countQuesB;

    if ((deltaQues % 2) != 0) {
        // If the total number of '?'s (after Alice and Bob have equal plays) is odd, Alice wins
        return true;
    } else {
        // If the number of '?'s are even, check the sum difference
        if (deltaSum * 2 == (-deltaQues / 2) * 9) {
            return false; // The differences can balance each other out, Bob wins
        } else {
            return true; // Alice can always force a situation where sums are different
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    cout << sumGame("5023") << endl;       // Output: false
    cout << sumGame("25??") << endl;       // Output: true
    cout << sumGame("?3295???") << endl;   // Output: false
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `num`. This is because we need to iterate over the entire string once to calculate the sum and number of '?'.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach is efficient given the constraints typically found in competitive programming and coding interviews.
