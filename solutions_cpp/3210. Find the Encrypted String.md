[Leetcode 3210. Find the Encrypted String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3210)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, perform the following operation until the string becomes empty: remove the character at the position with the highest alphabetical value. If there are multiple such characters, remove the leftmost one. After each removal, append the removed character to a result string. The task is to return the resulting string after applying the above operations.

### Example
- **Input**: `s = "abacad"`
- **Output**: `"dbcaab"`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string contain non-alphabetical characters?
   - No, it will only contain lowercase alphabetical characters.
2. Is the string guaranteed to have at least one character?
   - Yes, it will always be a non-empty string.
3. Can there be any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - Assume the length of the string is within reasonable limits for typical interview problems (e.g., 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000).

## Strategy

1. Initialize an empty result string.
2. While the original string `s` is not empty:
   - Find the character with the highest alphabetical value.
   - If multiple characters have the highest value, select the leftmost one.
   - Remove this character from `s`.
   - Append this character to the result string.
3. Return the result string.

### Steps in Detail:
- Iterate through the string to find the character with the highest alphabetical value.
- Maintain the position of this character.
- Use `erase` to remove the character from the string.
- Append the character to the result.

## Time Complexity

- Finding the maximum character in each iteration takes `O(n)`.
- Removing a character from a string takes `O(n)` in the worst case since string elements need to be shifted.
- Since we repeat this process `n` times (where `n` is the length of the string), the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string findEncryptedString(const std::string &input) {
    std::string s = input;  // making a copy of input as we will modify it
    std::string result;

    while (!s.empty()) {
        int maxPos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (s[i] > s[maxPos]) {
                maxPos = i;
            }
        }
        result.push_back(s[maxPos]);
        s.erase(s.begin() + maxPos);
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "abacad";
    std::string output = findEncryptedString(input);
    std::cout << "Encrypted String: " << output << std::endl;  // Output should be "dbcaab"
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - Copy the input string `s` to a mutable string.
   - Initialize an empty result string `result`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate while `s` is not empty.
   - Inside the loop, find the maximum character in the string `s` by comparing each character (tracked using `maxPos`).
   - Append the maximum character to `result`.
   - Remove the character from the original string `s` using `erase`.

3. **Output**:
   - Return the result string.

This solution respects the requirements and ensures each character is processed according to the given rules. The provided example demonstrates the expected output correctly.
