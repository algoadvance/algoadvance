[Leetcode 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1423)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `cardPoints` where `cardPoints[i]` is the number of points you get from the `i`-th card. Our goal is to pick exactly `k` cards from either the start or the end of the array to maximize the total points obtained.

Return the maximum score you can achieve by picking exactly `k` cards.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Bounds**: What are the constraints on the size of the array and the values it contains?
   - **Constraints**: 
     - `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`
     - `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`
     - `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `k` equals the length of the array, the result should be the sum of all the elements in the array.
   - If `k` is 1, the result should be the maximum of the first or last element of the array.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach to calculate the minimum subarray sum for the subarray of length `n-k` and then subtract it from the total sum of the array:

1. **Initial Sum**: Calculate the total sum of all elements in the `cardPoints` array.
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Compute the sum of the first `n-k` elements.
   - Slide the window by one element to the right each time and update the minimum sum of the subarray.
3. **Result Calculation**: 
   - Subtract the minimum sum of the `n-k` length subarray from the total sum to get the maximum score by picking `k` cards.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.size();
        int totalSum = accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.end(), 0);

        // If we need to pick all cards
        if (k == n) return totalSum;

        // Finding the sum of the subarray of length n-k
        int subarrayLength = n - k;
        int subarraySum = accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.begin() + subarrayLength, 0);
        int minSubarraySum = subarraySum;

        // Sliding window to find the minimum subarray sum of length n-k
        for (int i = subarrayLength; i < n; ++i) {
            subarraySum += cardPoints[i] - cardPoints[i - subarrayLength];
            minSubarraySum = min(minSubarraySum, subarraySum);
        }

        // The maximum score is totalSums - minSubarraySum
        return totalSum - minSubarraySum;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Sum Calculation**: `O(n)`
- **Sliding Window**: Calculating sum for subarrays, which is `O(n - k + 1)` operations, effectively `O(n)` in the worst case.
- **Total Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, since all operations are linear with respect to the size of the array.

This approach ensures we keep our solution efficient even for the upper limits of the constraints.
