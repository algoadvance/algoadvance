[Leetcode 2016. Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2016)
## Problem Statement:
Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n`, you need to find the **maximum difference** between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (i.e., `nums[j] - nums[i]`), such that `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] < nums[j]`. Return the **maximum difference**. If no such i and j exists, return -1.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [7,1,5,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The maximum difference occurs with i = 1 and j = 2 (nums[2] - nums[1] = 5 - 1 = 4).
```
## Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of the size of the array `nums`?
   - The size `n` will be within the range from 1 to 10^3.
2. What is the range of the elements in the array `nums`?
   - The elements in the array will be within the range from 1 to 10^9.
3. Are there any constraints regarding possible duplicates in the array?
   - No, there are no special constraints mentioned, duplicates are allowed but may affect the difference.

## Strategy:
A straightforward approach to solve this problem is to use a single pass scan while keeping track of the minimum element seen so far. At every position `j`, the difference `nums[j] - min_value` is computed, and the maximum difference is kept track of. Here is a more detailed algorithm:
1. Initialize `min_value` with the first element of the array.
2. Initialize `max_diff` as -1 (since we need to return -1 if no such `i` and `j` exists).
3. Iterate through each element of the array starting from the second element.
   - For each element, calculate the difference with `min_value`.
   - Update `max_diff` if the difference is larger than the current `max_diff`.
   - Update `min_value` if the current element is smaller than `min_value`.
4. Return `max_diff`.

## Code in C++:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumDifference(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int min_value = nums[0];
        int max_diff = -1;

        for (int j = 1; j < nums.size(); ++j) {
            if (nums[j] > min_value) {
                max_diff = std::max(max_diff, nums[j] - min_value);
            } else {
                min_value = std::min(min_value, nums[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return max_diff;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {7, 1, 5, 4};
    std::cout << "Maximum Difference: " << sol.maximumDifference(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because we traverse the array only once. 

The space complexity is O(1) since we use a fixed amount of extra space to store `min_value` and `max_diff`.

By maintaining these values during a single pass over the array, we ensure a performant solution that meets the problem constraints efficiently.
