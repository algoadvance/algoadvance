[Leetcode 2869. Minimum Operations to Collect Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2869)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, `nums`, and another array, `elements`. We would like to remove the minimum number of elements from `nums` such that all of the elements in `elements` are no longer in `nums`. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

In other words, you want to find the smallest subset of `nums` such that removing it will exclude all the integers in `elements` from `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of `elements` guaranteed to be present in `nums`?**
   - If not, handling cases where an element of `elements` is not in `nums` would be necessary.

2. **Are the arrays sorted or unsorted?**
   - Both arrays can be considered unsorted.

3. **Can the arrays contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate elements, and we have to consider them accordingly.

4. **What are the sizes of the arrays?**
   - Let `n` be the length of `nums`, and `m` be the length of `elements`. We'll assume minimal constraints where arrays can be reasonably large given typical problem constraints (e.g., 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000).

## Strategy

The strategy can be broken down into the following steps:
1. **Frequency Counting**: Create a frequency count of `elements` to know how many times each element needs to be removed from `nums`.
2. **Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers or window sliding techniques to find the smallest subarray in `nums` that contains all elements from `elements` with at least their required frequencies.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation following the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>

int minOperationsToCollectElementsOut(std::vector<int>& nums, std::vector<int>& elements) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> elementCount, windowCount;
    
    // Count the frequency of elements in the `elements` array
    for (const auto& ele : elements) {
        elementCount[ele]++;
    }
    
    int required = elementCount.size(); // Number of unique elements we need to match
    int formed = 0; // Number of unique elements we have successfully matched
    
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    int minLen = nums.size() + 1;
    
    while (right < nums.size()) {
        int rtEle = nums[right];
        windowCount[rtEle]++;
        
        if (elementCount.count(rtEle) && windowCount[rtEle] == elementCount[rtEle]) {
            formed++;
        }
        
        while (left <= right && formed == required) {
            int ltEle = nums[left];
            
            if (right - left + 1 < minLen) {
                minLen = right - left + 1;
            }
            
            windowCount[ltEle]--;
            if (elementCount.count(ltEle) && windowCount[ltEle] < elementCount[ltEle]) {
                formed--;
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        right++;
    }
    
    return minLen == nums.size() + 1 ? -1 : minLen;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3, 7, 3};
    std::vector<int> elements = {1, 3};
    std::cout << "Minimum operations: " << minOperationsToCollectElementsOut(nums, elements) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Generating the frequency map**: O(m) where m is the length of `elements`.
- **Sliding window traversal**: O(n) where n is the length of `nums`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

This approach ensures that we are efficiently finding the smallest subarray in `nums` that contains all elements with the required frequency from `elements`.
