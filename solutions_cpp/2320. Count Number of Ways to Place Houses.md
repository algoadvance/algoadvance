[Leetcode 2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2320)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. You have a street with `2 * n` plots, where there are `n` plots on each side of the street (i.e., 2 sides of `n` plots each). You want to place houses on some of these plots, but you must follow these rules:
1. No two houses on the same side of the street can be adjacent.
2. A house can be placed on any one of the plots.

Determine the number of ways we can place houses on these plots.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any restrictions on how far houses on opposite sides of the street should be from each other?**
   - No, there's no restriction on placing houses on opposite sides of the street.

2. **Can a plot have multiple houses?**
   - No, each plot can have at most one house.

3. **Is it possible to have zero houses on the streets?**
   - Yes, having zero houses is a valid configuration.

### Strategy

We will solve this problem using dynamic programming. Letâ€™s break down the approach:

1. **Single Side Computation**: First, we need to determine the number of ways to place houses on one side of the street while ensuring no two houses are adjacent.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to place houses on the first `i` plots.
   - The base cases would be:
     - `dp[0] = 1`: There's one way to place houses on zero plots, which is placing no houses.
     - `dp[1] = 2`: There are two ways on one plot: place a house or not place a house.
   - For `dp[i]`, two cases arise:
     1. **Do not place a house on plot `i`**: This is equivalent to `dp[i-1]`.
     2. **Place a house on plot `i`**: The plot `i-1` must be empty. Thus, it is equivalent to `dp[i-2]`.
   - So, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

3. **Combining Both Sides**: Since each side of the street operates independently, the total number of valid configurations for both sides is the square of the number of configurations for one side.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int countWays(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;  // Base case: no plots
    
    // dp[i] will hold the number of ways to place houses on i plots with no adjacent houses
    std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
    dp[0] = 1;  // One way to place houses on zero plots
    dp[1] = 2;  // Two ways to place houses on one plot (house or no house)
    
    // Fill dp array for plots from 2 to n
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }

    // The total number of ways to place houses on both sides independently
    int totalWays = dp[n];
    return totalWays * totalWays;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3; // Example input
    std::cout << "Number of ways to place houses: " << countWays(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n)` due to the single pass required to fill the `dp` array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the `dp` array.
