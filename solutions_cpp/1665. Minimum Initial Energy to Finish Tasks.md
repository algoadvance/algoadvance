[Leetcode 1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1665)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actual_i, minimum_i]`:

- `actual_i` is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the `i-th` task.
- `minimum_i` is the minimum amount of energy you need to start the `i-th` task.

For example, if the task is `[3, 5]`, you need at least `5` units of energy to start it, and it will cost `3` units of energy to complete it.

You want to finish all the given tasks. You can complete tasks in any order. Return *the minimum initial amount of energy* you need to be able to complete all tasks.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:**
   - What is the maximum number of tasks? 
   - What are the possible values for `actual_i` and `minimum_i`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if there are no tasks?
   - Can `actual_i` be greater than `minimum_i`? (It is assumed `actual_i <= minimum_i`)

## Strategy

To minimize the initial energy required, we need to find an optimal order to complete the tasks, which considers both the `actual_i` and `minimum_i` values. An appropriate strategy might involve sorting and prioritizing tasks with a higher difference between `minimum_i` and `actual_i`.

### Steps:

1. **Sort the Tasks:** Sort the tasks based on the difference between `minimum_i` and `actual_i` in descending order. This helps ensure that tasks that require a larger initial buffer are considered first.

2. **Iterate and Calculate Initial Energy:**
   - Initialize `current_energy` to 0.
   - Traverse through the sorted tasks.
   - Track the maximum value of `minimum_i` required so far and ensure that `current_energy` satisfies this requirement before starting each task.

3. **Track Minimum Initial Energy:**
   - Accumulate the actual energy consumption.
   - Ensure `initial_energy` is always sufficient to meet the maximum `minimum_i` before any task starts.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the C++ code to implement this approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumEffort(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& tasks) {
        // Sorting tasks based on (minimum - actual) in descending order
        std::sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end(), [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
            return (b[1] - b[0]) < (a[1] - a[0]);
        });

        int initial_energy = 0, current_energy = 0;
        
        // Traverse the sorted tasks
        for (const auto& task : tasks) {
            int actual = task[0];
            int minimum = task[1];
            
            // We need at least 'minimum' energy to start this task
            if (current_energy < minimum) {
                // Increase the initial energy to reach the required minimum
                initial_energy += (minimum - current_energy);
                current_energy = minimum;
            }
            
            // Deduct the actual energy spent to complete the task
            current_energy -= actual;
        }
        
        return initial_energy;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Tasks:** Sorting the tasks array takes `O(n log n)` time, where `n` is the number of tasks.
2. **Iterating through Tasks:** Single pass through the list of tasks takes `O(n)` time.

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures efficiency while effectively handling the task constraints and dependencies, minimizing the initial energy required to complete all tasks.
