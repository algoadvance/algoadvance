[Leetcode 566. Reshape the Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l566)
### Problem Statement

You are given a matrix represented by a 2D array, and you need to reshape the matrix into a different size, specified by the number of rows `r` and columns `c`. The reshaping should maintain the original order of elements. If it's not possible to reshape the matrix to the given dimensions, return the original matrix.

*Example:*
```
Input: 
nums = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

However, if the reshape operation is not possible:
```
Input: 
nums = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will the matrix contain only integers?
2. Can we assume the input dimensions `r` and `c` will always be non-negative?

### Strategy

1. **Check Total Elements**: First, compute the total number of elements in the original matrix. This is necessary to determine whether reshaping is feasible.
2. **Reshape Feasibility**: Check if the total number of elements in the original matrix equals `r * c`. If not, return the original matrix.
3. **Transform Elements**: If reshaping is possible, flatten the original matrix into a single list of elements.
4. **Populate New Matrix**: Populate the new matrix of shape `r` by `c` using the flattened list of elements, maintaining the original element order.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the original matrix. This is because we are essentially iterating through all elements once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the reshaped matrix, although this is typically space used to store the result.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> matrixReshape(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& nums, int r, int c) {
    int m = nums.size();
    int n = nums[0].size();
    int total_elements = m * n;
    
    // Check if reshape is possible
    if (total_elements != r * c) {
        return nums; // Reshape not possible, return original matrix
    }
    
    // Initialize the new reshaped matrix
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> reshaped(r, std::vector<int>(c));
    
    // Flatten matrix and reshape
    for (int i = 0; i < total_elements; ++i) {
        reshaped[i / c][i % c] = nums[i / n][i % n];
    }
    
    return reshaped;
}
```

This code will reshape the matrix `nums` into the dimensions specified by `r` and `c`, if possible, preserving the order of elements, or return the original matrix if reshaping is not feasible.
