[Leetcode 1420. Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K Comparisons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1420)
### Problem Statement
Given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, you need to build an array `arr` of size `n` such that:

1. Each element of `arr` is an integer between `1` and `m` (inclusive).
2. There are exactly `k` distinct integers in `arr` that are greater than all previous elements (in other words, the first `k` numbers are each greater than all previous numbers).
3. Return the number of such arrays. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`?**
   - Typical constraints for `n`, `m`, and `k` should be provided. Usually `1 <= k <= n` and elements in the array should be from `1` to `m`.

2. **What should be the value of output if no valid array exists?**
   - If no valid array exists, the result should be `0`.

3. **Do we need to optimize for large values of `n`, `m`, and `k`?**
   - Yes, considering the constraints, an efficient solution is preferred.

### Strategy
- This is a dynamic programming problem where we use a 3D DP table to store intermediate results:
  - Let `dp[i][j][l]` be the number of ways to build an array of size `i` using numbers from `1` to `j` with exactly `l` greater elements than all previous elements.
- Base Case: `dp[0][0][0] = 1` because there's one way to build an empty array with zero elements.
- Recurrence relation should consider inserting a new maximum or not:
  - If the new element is the maximum so far, it contributes to the count of such elements.
  - If not, it does not change the count of such elements but must be placed in valid positions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfArrays(int n, int m, int k) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n + 1, vector<vector<int>>(m + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0)));

        for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
            dp[1][j][1] = 1; // Base case: Providing only one possible way with one element
        }

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
                for (int l = 1; l <= k; ++l) {
                    // Fill the dp[i][j][l] based on previous results and choices.
                    dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i][j][l] + j * dp[i - 1][j][l]) % MOD;
                    for (int x = 1; x < j; ++x) {
                        dp[i][j][l] = (dp[i][j][l] + dp[i - 1][x][l - 1]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
            result = (result + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \( O(n \times m \times k \times m) \), which simplifies to \( O(n \times m^2 \times k) \). This considers iterating through all possible states and all potential contributions to each state, leading to a potentially large but manageable computation given the constraints.
