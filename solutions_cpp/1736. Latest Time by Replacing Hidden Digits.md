[Leetcode 1736. Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1736)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `time` in the form of "HH:MM", where some of the digits in the string are represented by '?'. The question marks represent digits that need to be replaced to convert `time` into the latest possible valid 24-hour time. Return the latest valid time in the "HH:MM" format.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Time:**
   - The time is in a 24-hour format, so hours can range from `00` to `23` and minutes from `00` to `59`.

2. **Input Format:**
   - The input will always be exactly 5 characters long, in the format "HH:MM", where each 'H' or 'M' can be a digit `[0-9]` or '?'.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output should be a string in the same format "HH:MM".

### Strategy

To find the latest valid time by replacing '?', we need to consider the following:

1. **Hour Formatting:**
   - For the first digit of hours (`time[0]`):
     - If the second digit (`time[1]`) is between `'0'` and `'3'` (inclusive), the first digit can be `2` to maximize.
     - Otherwise, to avoid invalid hours, the first digit should be `1`.
   - For the second digit of hours (`time[1]`):
     - If the first digit is `2`, the second digit can be between `0` and `3`.
     - Otherwise, the second digit should be `9`.

2. **Minute Formatting:**
   - For the first digit of minutes (`time[3]`), the maximum possible value is `5`.
   - For the second digit of minutes (`time[4]`), the maximum value is `9`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string maximumTime(std::string time) {
    // Process hours
    if (time[0] == '?') {
        if (time[1] != '?' && time[1] > '3') {
            time[0] = '1';
        } else {
            time[0] = '2';
        }
    }
    if (time[1] == '?') {
        if (time[0] == '2') {
            time[1] = '3';
        } else {
            time[1] = '9';
        }
    }

    // Process minutes
    if (time[3] == '?') {
        time[3] = '5';
    }
    if (time[4] == '?') {
        time[4] = '9';
    }

    return time;
}

int main() {
    std::string time;
    std::cin >> time;
    std::cout << maximumTime(time) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**, as the operations to replace the '?' characters involve a constant amount of work regardless of the input size.

- We check and potentially replace up to 5 characters in the string, each operation being a constant-time action.

This solution maximizes the given time string to the latest possible valid time while ensuring all replacements lead to a valid 24-hour time format.
