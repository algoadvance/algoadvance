[Leetcode 2999. Count the Number of Powerful Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2999)
### Problem Statement

You are given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`. An integer is considered powerful if it can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` where `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`. Return a list of all powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

You can return the answer in any order. The result should not contain duplicates.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input**:
   - What are the possible ranges for `x`, `y`, and `bound`?
     - Typical constraints might be `1 <= x, y <= 100` and `1 <= bound <= 10^6`.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be the return value if `bound` is very low (e.g., `x = 1, y = 1, bound = 1`)?
     - In this case, return the unique set of values generated which are <= bound.
   
3. **Duplicates**:
   - Should the returned list avoid duplications?
     - Yes, the result should not contain any duplicate values.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate for Possible Values of i and j**:
   - Given `x^i` and `y^j`, iterate over possible values, keeping them less than or equal to `bound`.
   - Use two nested loops for `i` and `j` starting from 0 and increment as long as `x^i` and `y^j` respectively are <= `bound`.
   
2. **Check Validity and Add to Set**:
   - For each combination of `i` and `j`, compute `x^i + y^j`, and if this sum is less than or equal to `bound`, add it to a set (to avoid duplicates).

3. **Edge Handling**:
   - If `x == 1`, then `x^i` will always be 1 for any `i`.
   - Similarly, if `y == 1`, then `y^j` will always be 1 for any `j`.

### Code

Below is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
        set<int> resultSet;
        
        // Iterate over powers of x
        for (int i = 0; pow(x, i) <= bound && i < 20; ++i) {
            int currentXPower = pow(x, i);
            
            // Iterate over powers of y
            for (int j = 0; pow(y, j) <= bound && j < 20; ++j) {
                int currentYPower = pow(y, j);
                
                int sum = currentXPower + currentYPower;
                if (sum <= bound) {
                    resultSet.insert(sum);
                }
                
                // If y is 1, we do not need to continue this loop as `y^j` will always be 1
                if (y == 1) break;
            }
            
            // If x is 1, we do not need to continue this loop as `x^i` will always be 1
            if (x == 1) break;
        }
        
        // Convert set to vector
        vector<int> result(resultSet.begin(), resultSet.end());
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst-case Scenario**:
  - We stop the loop at `i < 20` because `x` and `y` are up to 100, and raising any of these integers to powers higher than 20 will result in numbers beyond typical bounds (10^6).
  - Time complexity: \( O(M * N) \) where \( M \) and \( N \) are the effective ranges to keep `x^i` and `y^j` within bound. Given typical constraints, it can roughly be considered \( O(20 * 20) = O(400) \), which is efficiently manageable.

This solution effectively captures the required logic and constraints while maintaining performance standards expected in competitive programming.
