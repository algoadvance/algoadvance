[Leetcode 991. Broken Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l991)
## Problem Statement
Given two integers `startValue` and `target`, you have a broken calculator that can only perform two operations:

1. Multiply the number on the display by 2.
2. Subtract 1 from the number on the display.

Initially, the calculator is displaying the number `startValue`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to display the number `target`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `startValue` and `target` be negative?**
   - No, according to the problem constraints, `startValue` and `target` are positive integers.
   
2. **Is there an upper limit to the values that `startValue` and `target` can take?**
   - Yes, both `startValue` and `target` are in the range [1, 10^9].

3. **Should the program handle cases where `startValue` is greater than `target`?**
   - Yes, you need to handle cases where `startValue` is greater than `target`.

## Strategy
To achieve the minimum number of operations, we need to work backwards from `target` to `startValue`. This approach is beneficial because:
- Instead of doubling, you can divide by 2 when `target` is even, which is the inverse of the multiplication operation.
- Instead of decrementing `target` by 1, you can increment it when you are moving backward.

The algorithm can be summarized as:
1. If `target` is less than or equal to `startValue`, we only need to decrement to match `target` from `startValue`.
2. While `target` is greater than `startValue`:
   - If `target` is even, divide `target` by 2.
   - If `target` is odd, increment it by 1.
3. The total operations are the decrements needed after `target` becomes less than or equal to `startValue`.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        while (target > startValue) {
            if (target % 2 == 0) {
                target /= 2;
            } else {
                target += 1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations + (startValue - target);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(target))
  - Each operation reduces the `target` significantly (either by half if even or by one if odd), resulting in logarithmic time complexity with respect to `target`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space for operations and to store the variables.
