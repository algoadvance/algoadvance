[Leetcode 238. Product of Array Except Self](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l238)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `n > 1`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

You should solve it without using division and in O(n).

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What should be the behavior if the array contains zeros?** 
   - The problem can handle zeros, as the product except self for positions where zeros are present will be carefully computed without causing division by zero errors.
   
2. **Can the input contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the input can contain negative numbers as per the problem's constraints.

3. **What is the size constraint of the array?**
   - The array will have at least two elements.

### Strategy:

To achieve the desired output without using division and ensuring that the time complexity remains O(n), we can follow these steps:

1. **Create two arrays, `left` and `right`, of length `n`.**
   - `left[i]` will contain the product of all elements to the left of index `i`.
   - `right[i]` will contain the product of all elements to the right of index `i`.

2. **Initialize the `left` array:**
   - Set `left[0]` to 1 because there are no elements to the left of the first element.
   - Iterate through the array from left to right to fill the `left` array.

3. **Initialize the `right` array:**
   - Set `right[n-1]` to 1 because there are no elements to the right of the last element.
   - Iterate through the array from right to left to fill the `right` array.

4. **Compute the result:**
   - For each `i`, the result at `i` will be `left[i] * right[i]`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> left(n, 1);
    vector<int> right(n, 1);
    vector<int> result(n);

    // Fill in the left array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        left[i] = left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }

    // Fill in the right array
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        right[i] = right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
    }

    // Fill in the result array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[i] = left[i] * right[i];
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the array twice to fill the `left` and `right` arrays, and once more to fill the `result` array.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We use two additional arrays of size `n`, `left` and `right`, making the space complexity linear.
