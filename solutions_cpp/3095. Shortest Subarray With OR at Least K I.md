[Leetcode 3095. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3095)
### Problem Statement

On Interviewbit, you have been given a problem where you need to find the shortest subarray from a given array such that the bitwise OR of the elements of this subarray is at least a given integer `K`. 

Formally, given an array `A` of `N` non-negative integers and an integer `K`, you need to find the length of the shortest subarray such that the bitwise OR of all elements in that subarray is greater than or equal to `K`. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: What are the constraints on the values of `N`, elements of `A`, and `K`?
2. **Edge cases**: Should we consider the possibility of having all elements of the array being zero or smaller than `K`?
3. **Output clarity**: Should the function return the length (`integer` type) of the shortest subarray, or some additional information?

### Assumptions and Constraints

1. `1 <= N <= 10^5`
2. `0 <= A[i], K <= 10^9`

### Strategy

1. **Two Pointers Technique**: We will iterate over the array with two pointers to maintain a sliding window of elements.
2. **Bitwise OR Calculation**: As we slide the window, we will calculate the bitwise OR of the current subarray.
3. **Shortest Length**: Track the minimum length of the subarrays whose OR value is at least `K`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(const vector<int>& A, int K) {
    int n = A.size();
    int left = 0, right = 0;
    int current_or = 0;
    int min_length = INT_MAX;

    while (right < n) {
        // Extend the slide window to the right
        current_or |= A[right];

        // While current_or is at least K, try to shrink the window from the left
        while (left <= right && current_or >= K) {
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1);
            current_or &= ~A[left];  // Remove the effect of A[left] from current_or
            left++;
        }

        // Increment right pointer to extend the window
        right++;
    }

    return (min_length == INT_MAX) ? -1 : min_length;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> A = {1, 2, 4, 8};
    int K = 7;

    int result = shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(A, K);
    cout << "The length of the shortest subarray: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, both set to the beginning of the array.
   - Use `current_or` to store the OR value of the current subarray.
   - Use `min_length` to keep track of the smallest window length found.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Iterate with `right` to extend the window, updating the OR value by including `A[right]`.
   - Once `current_or` reaches or exceeds `K`, determine if the current window is the smallest by comparing its length with `min_length`.
   - Increment `left` to shrink the window from the left. While doing this, exclude `A[left]` from the OR calculation by using bitwise operations.

3. **Result Check**:
   - If no valid subarray was found, `min_length` remains unchanged and we return `-1`, otherwise return the smallest length found.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution operates in O(N) time, where N is the number of elements in the array, as each element is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1), apart from the input list, since we only use a few extra variables for computation.

This should provide an efficient solution to the problem statement.
