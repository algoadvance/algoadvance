[Leetcode 1524. Number of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1524)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, return the number of subarrays with an odd sum. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example:

**Input:** arr = [1,3,5]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** All subarrays are [[1], [1,3], [1,3,5], [3], [3,5], [5]]
 - [[1], [1,3,5], [3,5], [5]] all have odd sums.

**Input:** arr = [2,4,6]  
**Output:** 0  
**Explanation:** All subarrays are [[2], [2,4], [2,4,6], [4], [4,6], [6]]
 - All subarrays have even sums.

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
**Output:** 16

The constraints are:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any negative numbers in the array?
   - **A:** No, all elements are positive integers.

2. **Q:** Is there a constraint on the size of individual array elements?
   - **A:** Yes, elements are between 1 and 100.

3. **Q:** Do we need to consider subarrays of any specific length?
   - **A:** No, all subarrays regardless of their length should be considered.

## Strategy
1. Traverse through the array to maintain a prefix sum and count the number of subarrays ending at each position that have an odd sum.
2. We'll use two counters to keep track of the number of even and odd prefix sums encountered so far.
   - If the current prefix sum is even, all subarrays ending at the current position with an odd prefix sum will have an odd overall sum.
   - Conversely, if the current prefix sum is odd, all subarrays ending at the current position with an even prefix sum will result in an odd overall sum.
3. Maintain a running total of the counts of these subarrays, and apply the modulo operation as required by the problem.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = arr.size();
        int result = 0;
        
        int odd = 0, even = 1;  // initialize even as 1 to assume empty prefix sum as even
        int prefixSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            prefixSum += num;
            if (prefixSum % 2 == 0) {
                result = (result + odd) % MOD;
                even++;
            } else {
                result = (result + even) % MOD;
                odd++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The solution involves a single pass through the array of size `n`, hence the time complexity is O(n).
- The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of additional space for counters and the prefix sum. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of subarrays with an odd sum while maintaining the constraints for large inputs.
