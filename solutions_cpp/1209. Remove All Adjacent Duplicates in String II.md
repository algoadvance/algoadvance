[Leetcode 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1209)
## Problem Statement
The problem "Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II" is described as follows:

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to remove all adjacent duplicates from the string where the count of adjacent duplicates is equal to `k`.

The input string will only contain lowercase English letters and the length of `s` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`. The integer `k` is in the range `[2, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the same character appear in different places and still count as adjacent duplicates if they are separated by other characters?
   **A**: No, adjacent means the characters must be contiguous in the string.

2. **Q**: What should be returned if no adjacent duplicates exist in the string?
   **A**: Return the string as is.

3. **Q**: Should we consider only lowercase English letters as valid input characters?
   **A**: Yes, the problem guarantees only lowercase English letters in the input string.

## Strategy
1. **Use a stack to keep track of characters:** 
   - The stack will store pairs of (`character`, `count`), where `count` indicates how many times `character` has consecutively appeared.
   
2. **Iterate through the string:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has the same character, increment the count.
     - If the count reaches `k`, pop the element from the stack.
     - Otherwise, push a new pair onto the stack.

3. **Reconstruct the string:**
   - After processing all characters, reconstruct the string from the stack.

## Code
Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>

std::string removeDuplicates(std::string s, int k) {
    std::stack<std::pair<char, int>> stack;

    for (char ch : s) {
        if (!stack.empty() && stack.top().first == ch) {
            stack.top().second += 1;
            if (stack.top().second == k) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stack.push({ch, 1});
        }
    }

    std::string result;
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        auto [ch, count] = stack.top();
        stack.pop();
        result.append(count, ch);
    }
    
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "deeedbbcccbdaa";
    int k1 = 3;
    std::cout << removeDuplicates(s1, k1) << std::endl; // Output: "aa"

    std::string s2 = "pbbcggttciiippooaais";
    int k2 = 2;
    std::cout << removeDuplicates(s2, k2) << std::endl; // Output: "ps"
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case, all characters are distinct and stored in the stack.

This is an efficient solution given the input constraints, ensuring that the algorithm performs well even for large inputs.
