[Leetcode 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2870)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. Return the minimum number of operations to make the array empty if you can remove **three** elements in the following ways:
1. Three equal elements.
2. Three elements of consecutive values (note that these values need to be consecutive in value and should follow the exact sequence).

If it's not possible to remove the elements under these rules, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements of the array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.
  
2. **If we cannot remove all elements under the given rules, should we return -1?**
   - Yes, exactly.

3. **Can you provide an example?**
   - Sure, for `nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 2, 5, 9, 3]`, one possible removal sequence is
     1. Remove three `2`s.
     2. Remove three `4`s.
     3. Remove three `6`s.
     4. Remove `[3, 5, 9]` - this is not a valid sequence but ignoring it for this example, if there was another valid one, we would remove them.
   - In this case, we couldn't remove `[3, 5, 9]` as they need to be consecutive values which they are not.

## Strategy
1. **Frequency Map:** Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each number.
2. **Three Consecutive Elements:** Check if there exist sequences where three consecutive numbers can be formed.
3. **Three Equal Elements:** Check how many groups of three equal elements can be made from the frequency map.
4. Keep reducing the array and if at any point neither condition can be met to remove elements, it's impossible.

The problem sounds similar in spirit to other "make operations to perform" puzzles. A greedy approach often works well:
- Sort the unique element keys first.
- Attempt to remove groups until no more groups can be formed.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Frequency map
        map<int, int> freq;
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }
        
        int operations = 0;

        // While there are still elements in the map
        while (!freq.empty()) {
            // Check for three equal elements
            bool foundTriple = false;
            for (auto it = freq.begin(); it != freq.end();) {
                if (it->second >= 3) {
                    it->second -= 3;
                    operations++;
                    foundTriple = true;
                    if (it->second == 0) {
                        it = freq.erase(it);
                    } else {
                        ++it;
                    }
                } else {
                    ++it;
                }
            }
            
            // Check for three consecutive elements
            if (!foundTriple) {
                auto it = freq.begin();
                if (next(it, 2) != freq.end()) {
                    int a = it->first;
                    int b = next(it)->first;
                    int c = next(it, 2)->first;
                    if (b == a + 1 && c == b + 1) {
                        freq[a]--;
                        freq[b]--;
                        freq[c]--;
                        operations++;
                        if (freq[a] == 0) freq.erase(a);
                        if (freq[b] == 0) freq.erase(b);
                        if (freq[c] == 0) freq.erase(c);
                        
                        foundTriple = true;
                    }
                }
            }

            // If no triples were found in this iteration, it's impossible
            if (!foundTriple) {
                return -1;
            }
        }

        return operations;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {2, 4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 2, 5, 9, 3};
    cout << sol.minOperations(nums) << endl;  // should output the number of operations needed
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Building the frequency map:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array.
- **Processing the frequency map:** Each element is processed potentially several times but overall dominated by sorting and traversal which together would be O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for traversal. Therefore, the overall time complexity would be O(n log n).

This approach attempts to greedily reduce the array by removing permissible groups until no more groups can be formed.
