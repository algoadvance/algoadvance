[Leetcode 2197. Replace Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2197)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, replace every pair of adjacent integers in the array that are not coprime (where the greatest common divisor, GCD, of the pair is greater than 1) with their least common multiple (LCM). Repeat this process until all adjacent pairs in the array are coprime. Return the resulting array.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [6,4,3,2,7,6,2]
Output: [12,7,6,2]
Explanation:
- (6,4) are not coprime -> replace them with LCM(6,4) = 12
- (12,3),(12,2) are not coprime -> continue with (3,2) as coprime
- (3,2),(7,6) are coprime -> continue
- (7,6) are not coprime -> replace them with LCM(7,6) = 42
- Finally return[12,7,6,2] as there are no adjacent pairs not coprime
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the input range?**
   - You can assume that the number of elements in `nums` is at least 1 and can be reasonably large (up to \(10^6\)).
2. **What is the range of the values in the array?**
   - The elements of `nums` are positive integers, where each value can be as large as \(10^5\).
3. **Do elements of `nums` contain only positive integers?**
   - Yes, elements are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Implementation of helper functions:**
   - **GCD Function**: Use the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **LCM Function**: Utilize the relationship between LCM and GCD: 
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]

2. **Main Routine:**
   - Use a stack to manage the replacement of non-coprime pairs.
   - Iterate over the input array and repeatedly check the top of the stack with the current element from the array to see if they are coprime.
   - If they are not coprime, replace them with their LCM and push the result back onto the stack.
   - Continue until the entire array has been processed.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <numeric> // for std::gcd

// Utility function to compute Least Common Multiple
uint64_t lcm(uint64_t a, uint64_t b) {
    return (a / std::gcd(a, b)) * b;
}

std::vector<int> replaceNonCoprimes(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::stack<int> stack;

    for (const int& num : nums) {
        stack.push(num);

        // Process stack to maintain coprime pairs
        while (stack.size() > 1) {
            int top1 = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            int top2 = stack.top();

            if (std::gcd(top1, top2) > 1) {
                // Replace with their LCM
                int new_top = lcm(top1, top2);
                stack.pop();
                stack.push(new_top);
            } else {
                // If they are coprime, put them back
                stack.push(top1);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Extract elements from stack into array in correct order
    std::vector<int> result(stack.size());
    for (int i = stack.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        result[i] = stack.top();
        stack.pop();
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **GCD Computation**: Each GCD computation takes \(\mathcal{O}(\log(\min(a, b)))\).
- **LCM Calculation**: Each LCM computation takes \(\mathcal{O}(\log(\min(a, b)))\) due to the GCD step.

The overall time complexity is influenced by both the number of stack operations and the combined complexity of LCM/GCD calculations. Given `n` elements in the array:

- **Worst-Case Complexity**: \(\mathcal{O}(n \log(\max(elements)))\) due to potentially repeated LCM/GCD calculations. However, since each merge reduces the number of elements to process, real-world scenarios often involve fewer operations.

### Conclusion

The proposed solution uses a stack to dynamically manage elements and ensure pair-wise coprimality through iterative merging of non-coprime pairs using their LCM. This approach efficiently reduces the problem's complexity while maintaining correctness and feasibility for large input sizes.
