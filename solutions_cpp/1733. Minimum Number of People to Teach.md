[Leetcode 1733. Minimum Number of People to Teach](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1733)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `languages` where `languages[i]` is a list of languages the i-th user knows, and two integers `n` and `k`. There is an array `friendships` where `friendships[i] = [u, v]` denotes that the u-th user and the v-th user are friends. The users can only communicate with each other if they know at least one common language.

You need to find the minimum number of people that need to learn at least one additional language so that all friends can communicate with each other.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can a user learn more than one new language, or should we only consider introducing a single new language per person?
2. Can we assume that the array indices for languages and friendships are 1-based or 0-based?

We assume here that:
- Each person can be taught just one additional language.
- Array indices are 1-based.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Analysis**:
   - Determine the pairs of friends who cannot communicate (i.e., they do not share any common languages).
   
2. **Calculate Impact**:
   - For each language, calculate the minimum number of people who need to learn this language to enable all friends to communicate.
   
3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Consider teaching a new language `L` to the minimum number of users who are in non-communicable friend pairs such that the number of people who need to learn `L` is minimized.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTeachings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& languages, vector<vector<int>>& friendships) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> langMap;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < languages.size(); ++i) {
            for (int lang : languages[i]) {
                langMap[lang].insert(i);
            }
        }
        
        vector<pair<int, int>> cannotCommunicatePairs;
        for (const auto& friendship : friendships) {
            int u = friendship[0] - 1;
            int v = friendship[1] - 1;
            unordered_set<int> setU(languages[u].begin(), languages[u].end());
            unordered_set<int> setV(languages[v].begin(), languages[v].end());
            bool canCommunicate = false;
            for (int lang : setU) {
                if (setV.count(lang)) {
                    canCommunicate = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!canCommunicate) {
                cannotCommunicatePairs.push_back({u, v});
            }
        }
        
        int minTeachings = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int lang = 1; lang <= n; ++lang) {
            unordered_set<int> toTeach;
            for (const auto& pair : cannotCommunicatePairs) {
                int u = pair.first;
                int v = pair.second;
                if (!langMap[lang].count(u)) toTeach.insert(u);
                if (!langMap[lang].count(v)) toTeach.insert(v);
            }
            minTeachings = min(minTeachings, static_cast<int>(toTeach.size()));
        }
        
        return minTeachings;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution can be broken down as follows:
1. **Initialization and set construction** (O(∑l)), where *l* is the number of languages in each user's list.
2. **Constructing non-communicable friend pairs** (O(F × L)), where *F* is the number of friendships and *L* is the average number of languages a user knows.
3. **Calculating the teaching requirement for each language** (O(F × n)), where *n* is the total number of languages.

Overall, the complexity is O(∑l + F × L + n × F), which generally simplifies to O(F × max(L, n)). This should be efficient enough for reasonable input sizes commonly tested in interviews.
