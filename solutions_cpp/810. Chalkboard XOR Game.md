[Leetcode 810. Chalkboard XOR Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l810)
## Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers `nums`. Two players take turns drawing an integer from `nums` and removing it. The game ends when there are no integers left to draw. The winner is determined based on whether the XOR of all the integers removed is 0. Player 1 starts the game.

Both players play optimally. Determine if Player 1 can guarantee a win.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if XOR remains 0 for both players after every round?**
    - The game always starts with Player 1, and the condition only checks if the XOR of all elements becomes 0 by the end of the game to determine the winner.

2. **Is there a limit on the size of the array?**
    - No specific constraints mentioned, but it is safe to assume typical constraints where the size of array and elements are reasonable for computation.

3. **Are the elements only integers?**
    - Yes, all elements in the array are integers.

## Strategy

To decide if Player 1 wins, the following observations are useful:
1. **XOR Property**: XOR of a number with itself is 0 and XOR is commutative and associative.
2. **Cases Based on Sum (XOR)**:
    - If XOR of the entire array is 0, Player 1 can force a win since they can keep the XOR 0 at each step.
    - If the XOR is not 0:
        - If the number of elements is even, Player 1 can always leave an even number of elements to Player 2, forcing Player 2 to always face the situation where all elements XOR is 0.
        - If the number of elements is odd, Player 1 might lose because Player 2 will always leave an even number of elements for Player 1.

Using these observations, the decision point is whether XOR of the array is 0 or the number of elements in the array is even.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    bool xorGame(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int xor_sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            xor_sum ^= num;
        }
        
        // Player 1 wins if initial xor is 0 or number of elements is even
        return xor_sum == 0 || nums.size() % 2 == 0;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The solution has a time complexity of \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. 
- Space complexity is \( O(1) \) as we only use a constant amount of additional space.

This solution efficiently checks the conditions for Player 1 to guarantee a win in the XOR game.
