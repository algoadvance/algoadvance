[Leetcode 1528. Shuffle String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1528)
Sure, let's break down the problem:

### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` will be rearranged such that the character at the `i`th position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.

#### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "code", indices = [3, 1, 2, 0]
Output: "edoc"
Explanation: As the indices are [3, 1, 2, 0], the characters of s will be moved to the respective positions: "c" -> 3, "o" -> 1, "d" -> 2, "e" -> 0. Thus, the output is "edoc".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the characters in the string `s` unique?
   - No, the characters may not be unique.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - The length of the string can be up to `100`.

Let's proceed to the strategy and code.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a Result String**: Create a result string `result` of the same length as `s` and initialize it with empty spaces or any placeholder character.
2. **Rearrange Characters**: Iterate through the input string and place each character at the target index specified in the `indices` array.
3. **Build the Output**: Join the characters to form the final shuffled string.

### Code
Here's the C++ code implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string restoreString(const std::string& s, const std::vector<int>& indices) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::string result(n, ' '); // Initialize a result string with spaces of the same length as s

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[indices[i]] = s[i]; // Place each character at the correct position
    }

    return result; // Return the rearranged result
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "code";
    std::vector<int> indices = {3, 1, 2, 0};

    std::string shuffled = restoreString(s, indices);
    std::cout << "Shuffled string: " << shuffled << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the string once and placing each character in its appropriate position. 

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also:
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is due to the creation of the result string which requires additional space equal to the input string.

Feel free to ask any further clarifying questions or for additional help!
