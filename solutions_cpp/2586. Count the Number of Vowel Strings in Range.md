[Leetcode 2586. Count the Number of Vowel Strings in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2586)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a 0-indexed array of string `words` and two integers `left` and `right`.

A string is called a vowel string if it starts with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and ends with a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

Return the number of vowel strings `words[i]` where `left <= i <= right`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are both `left` and `right` inclusive?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies that we need to count the vowel strings in the range `[left, right]` inclusive.

2. **What is the maximum length of the `words` array?**
   - This information is not provided in the problem statement, but typical constraints would have us assume that the array could be as large as 10^5 elements.

3. **What should be returned if there are no vowel strings in the given range?**
   - The function should return `0` in that case.

4. **Are `left` and `right` guaranteed to be within the bounds of the array?**
   - It is implied that `left` and `right` will be valid indices within the bounds of the array.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of vowel strings.

2. **Vowel Set:**
   - Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.

3. **Iterate Through the Range:**
   - Loop through the indices from `left` to `right` (inclusive).
   - For each word, check if it starts and ends with a vowel.
   - Increment the counter for each vowel string found.

4. **Return the Count:**
   - Return the counter after the loop.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of elements in the range `[left, right]`. Each check (whether the first and last characters of a string are vowels) is an O(1) operation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we're using a constant amount of extra space for the set of vowels and the counter.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int countVowelStringsInRange(std::vector<std::string>& words, int left, int right) {
        std::unordered_set<char> vowels {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            const std::string& word = words[i];
            if (!word.empty() && vowels.count(word.front()) && vowels.count(word.back())) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

In this implementation:

- We use a set of vowels to quickly check if a character is a vowel.
- We loop through the given range `[left, right]` and check if the first and last characters of each word are in the vowel set.
- We maintain a counter to keep track of the valid vowel strings and return this count at the end.
