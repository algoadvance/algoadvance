[Leetcode 140. Word Break II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l140)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`. Add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

### Example
**Input:** 
- `s = "catsanddog"`
- `wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]`

**Output:** 
- `["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]`

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10`
- `s` and `wordDict[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters
- All the strings of `wordDict` are unique

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume the dictionary contains no duplicate words?
   - Yes, the problem states that all strings in `wordDict` are unique.
2. Is the output order important?
   - No, the order of the output sentences does not matter.
3. Will there always be at least one solution?
   - No, if no valid sentence can be formed, the results should be an empty list.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - We'll use a backtracking approach to generate all possible sentences.
   - For each function call, we take a substring of `s` and check if it's in `wordDict`.
   - If it's a valid word, we recursively call the function with the remaining substring.
   - Use memoization to store results of substrings already computed to avoid repeat calculations for overlapping subproblems and improve efficiency.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the entire string `s` is exhausted, return a list with an empty string representing a completed sentence.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> memo;
    
    vector<string> wordBreak(string s, unordered_set<string> &wordDict) {
        if (s.empty()) return {""};
        
        if (memo.find(s) != memo.end()) {
            return memo[s];
        }
        
        vector<string> res;
        
        for (int len = 1; len <= s.length(); ++len) {
            string word = s.substr(0, len);
            if (wordDict.find(word) != wordDict.end()) {
                vector<string> remainder = wordBreak(s.substr(len), wordDict);
                for (string sentence : remainder) {
                    res.push_back(word + (sentence.empty() ? "" : " ") + sentence);
                }
            }
        }
        
        memo[s] = res;
        return res;
    }
    
    vector<string> wordBreak(string s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordDict.begin(), wordDict.end());
        return wordBreak(s, wordSet);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Worst case: O(n^2 + 2^n). Each substring might have recursive calls exponentially increasing with the combinations of new words formed.
  - Optimized with memoization to store overlapped subproblems.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - O(n^2). Due to the space used by the recursion stack and memoization map storing solution of substrings.

Using these strategies, the implementation ensures that we efficiently determine all possible word break scenarios, pruning the problem space through memoization.
