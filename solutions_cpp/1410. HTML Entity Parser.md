[Leetcode 1410. HTML Entity Parser](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1410)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `text` that includes substrings representing HTML entities. Your task is to replace these HTML entities with their corresponding special characters. The commonly used HTML entities and their mappings are:

- `&quot;` -> `"`
- `&apos;` -> `'`
- `&amp;` -> `&`
- `&gt;` -> `>`
- `&lt;` -> `<`
- `&frasl;` -> `/`

Write a function `string entityParser(string text)` that will replace these entities in the given string `text` and return the parsed string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Are there any other HTML entities in the string, apart from those listed?**
   - A: No, only the listed entities need to be handled.

2. **Q: Can we assume that the input string is well-formed and there are no invalid HTML entities?**
   - A: Yes, you can assume the input string is well-formed.

3. **Q: What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - A: The length of the string can be up to 10^4.

### Strategy
1. **Using String Replacement**: We'll iterate through the string, and whenever we encounter an HTML entity, we'll replace it with the corresponding special character.
2. **Map Usage**: Create a mapping of the HTML entities to their corresponding characters.
3. **Efficient Search**: Use the `find` function to locate the next occurrence of `&` and replace the HTML entity appropriately.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the entities are at the beginning or end of the string.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Each replacement operation will consume linear time concerning the length of the substring being replaced and the overall traversal will be linear.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

unordered_map<string, string> entityMap = {
    {"&quot;", "\""},
    {"&apos;", "'"},
    {"&amp;", "&"},
    {"&gt;", ">"},
    {"&lt;", "<"},
    {"&frasl;", "/"}
};

string entityParser(string text) {
    string result;
    int i = 0, n = text.size();
  
    while(i < n) {
        if (text[i] == '&') {
            bool replaced = false;
            for (const auto& entity : entityMap) {
                string e = entity.first;
                if (i + e.size() <= n && text.substr(i, e.size()) == e) {
                    result += entity.second;
                    i += e.size();
                    replaced = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!replaced) {
                result += text[i];
                ++i;
            }
        } else {
            result += text[i];
            ++i;
        }
    }
  
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string text = "&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not.";
    cout << entityParser(text) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Test Cases
1. `"&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."` -> `"& is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."`
2. `"Stay &quot;hungry&quot;, stay &quot;foolish&quot;."` -> `"Stay "hungry", stay "foolish"."`
3. `"&lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;"` -> `"<div>Hello</div>"`

This code replaces only the specified HTML entities with their respective characters while handling the entire string efficiently.
