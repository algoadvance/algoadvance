[Leetcode 906. Super Palindromes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l906)
### Problem Statement

906. Super Palindromes - [LeetCode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/super-palindromes/)

Let's say a positive integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome and it is also the square of a palindrome.

Given two positive integers `left` and `right` represented as strings, return the number of super-palindromes integers in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - `left` and `right` will be strings representing integers. This allows for very large input sizes.
   - Both inputs are positive integers with `1 <= left <= right <= 10^18`.

2. **Palindrome Definition**:
   - An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

3. **Super-Palindrome Definition**:
   - An integer is a super-palindrome if it is a palindrome and the square root of this integer is also a palindrome.

With this understanding, letâ€™s move on to the strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Range**:
   - Because \( right \leq 10^{18} \), the square roots we need to consider are at most \( 10^9 \). We need to generate palindromes up to \( 10^9 \).

2. **Generate Palindromes**:
   - Generate palindromes up to \( 10^5 \) to ensure their squares cover the needed range.
   - Consider both odd and even length palindromes.

3. **Check Conditions**:
   - For each generated palindrome, compute its square.
   - Check if the square falls within the range `[left, right]`.
   - Check if the square itself is a palindrome.

4. **Count Valid Super-Palindromes**:
   - Keep a count of such valid palindromes.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

bool isPalindrome(long long x) {
    std::string s = std::to_string(x);
    int l = 0, r = s.size() - 1;
    while (l < r) {
        if (s[l++] != s[r--]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

std::vector<long long> generatePalindromesUpTo(int maxNumber) {
    std::vector<long long> palindromes;
    // Odd length palindromes.
    for (int i = 1; i < maxNumber; ++i) {
        std::string left = std::to_string(i);
        std::string right = std::string(left.rbegin(), left.rend());
        palindromes.push_back(std::stoll(left + right.substr(1)));  // 121, 12321, etc.
        palindromes.push_back(std::stoll(left + right));             // 22, 1221, etc.
    }
    return palindromes;
}

int superpalindromesInRange(std::string left, std::string right) {
    long long l = std::stoll(left);
    long long r = std::stoll(right);
        
    int maxLen = 100000;
    std::vector<long long> palindromes = generatePalindromesUpTo(maxLen);
    int count = 0;

    for (long long num : palindromes) {
        long long square = num * num;
        if (square > r) break;
        if (square >= l && isPalindrome(square)) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string left = "4";
    std::string right = "1000";
    std::cout << superpalindromesInRange(left, right) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Generation of Palindromes**:
   - Generating palindromes up to \( 10^5 \) is \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the number of such palindromes we generate.

2. **Checking Palindromes and Squaring**:
   - For each palindrome, the squaring and palindrome check are \( O(\log N) \) operations where \( N \) is the number.

Overall, this solution should work efficiently for the input constraints provided.
