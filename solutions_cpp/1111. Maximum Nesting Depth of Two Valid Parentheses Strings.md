[Leetcode 1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1111)
### Problem Statement:

Given a valid parentheses string `seq`, split it into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B` such that the **maximum** nesting depth of either subsequence is **minimized**.

- A valid parentheses string is either an empty string, `"(" + A + ")"`, or `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are valid parentheses strings.
- A nesting depth of a valid parentheses string is the maximum number of open parentheses that occur to the left of a position in the string, including the parenthesis at that position.

Return two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B` such that the maximum nesting depth of either subsequence is minimized. If there are multiple solutions, return any.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Length of `seq` will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
   - `seq` will only contain the characters `'('` and `')'`.

2. **Output:**
   - Two strings representing the subsequences `A` and `B`.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can follow a simple approach to distribute the parentheses between subsequences `A` and `B`. The goal is to balance the parentheses as much as possible to minimize the maximum nesting depth:

1. **Iterate through the sequence `seq`.**
2. **Distribute the parentheses between `A` and `B` alternatively wherever a new open parenthesis `(` is encountered.**
3. **Do the same for the closing parenthesis `)` to ensure that they match their respective open parentheses distribution.**

This approach ensures that the nesting depth is balanced between `A` and `B`.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - where `n` is the length of the sequence. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - for storing the subsequences `A` and `B`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<std::string> maxDepthAfterSplit(std::string seq) {
    int n = seq.size();
    std::vector<int> A(n, 0);
    std::vector<int> B(n, 0);
    
    // Result subsequences as required
    std::string a = "";
    std::string b = "";
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (seq[i] == '(') {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                A[i] = 1;
                a += '(';
            } else {
                B[i] = 1;
                b += '(';
            }
        } else {  // seq[i] == ')'
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                A[i] = 1;
                a += ')';
            } else {
                B[i] = 1;
                b += ')';
            }
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<std::string> res;
    res.push_back(a);
    res.push_back(b);
    return res;
}
```

The above function `maxDepthAfterSplit` will produce two balanced subsequences `A` and `B` with minimized maximum nesting depth.

This approach makes sure that wherever possible, parentheses are alternatively placed between `A` and `B`, ensuring balanced depths in both sequences.
