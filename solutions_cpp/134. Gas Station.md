[Leetcode 134. Gas Station](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l134)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to determine if there is a starting gas station around a circular route where a car can travel, starting with an empty tank. The car can travel from the index `i` to the next index `i+1`, and the car's tank can be refueled at each gas station. You are given two integer arrays: `gas` where `gas[i]` is the amount of gas at the `i-th` station, and `cost` where `cost[i]` is the amount of gas needed to travel from the `i-th` station to the `(i+1)-th` station.

Your goal is to return the starting gas station index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise, return -1.

```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the arrays `gas` and `cost` have different lengths?
   **A**: No, both arrays will always have the same length.

2. **Q**: What are the constraints on the values of `gas[i]` and `cost[i]`?
   **A**: We assume that `0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4` and the lengths of the arrays are `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

3. **Q**: If there are multiple valid starting stations, can I return any of them?
   **A**: Yes, you can return any valid starting station index.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Pass**: Compute the total surplus or deficit of gas.
   - If total gas available is less than total cost, return -1 because it's impossible to complete the circuit.

2. **Finding the Start Station**: Traverse the arrays to find the start index.
   - Initialize the total deficit and current surplus.
   - Iterate over the stations:
     - Update current surplus as the difference between gas at current station and cost to next station.
     - If current surplus drops below zero, it means the portion up to this station is unsustainable as a starting point; hence, reset the start position to the next station and update the total deficit.

3. **Return the Start Index**: If the total deficit is within the total surplus (considering both start and remaining journey), we have the valid start station, otherwise return -1.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size();
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, start = 0, tank = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (tank < 0) {
                start = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }

        return totalGas >= totalCost ? start : -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) because we are iterating through the arrays once in a single pass.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space for the variables.

This approach ensures an efficient solution through optimized traversal and logical condition checks, adhering to a linear time complexity.
