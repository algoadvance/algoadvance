[Leetcode 2528. Maximize the Minimum Powered City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2528)
### Problem Statement

You are given the task of distributing power to different cities. Each city consumes a certain amount of power, represented by the array `power`. You have `k` power plants that can be placed in any city. Each power plant can fully power one city. Your goal is to maximize the minimum power of any city after distributing the power plants optimally.

**Input:**
- An integer `n` representing the number of cities.
- An array `power` of length `n` where `power[i]` is the power consumption of city `i`.
- An integer `k` representing the number of power plants.

**Output:**
- The maximum possible minimum power of any city after optimally placing the `k` power plants.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the values of `n`, power consumption, and `k`?
2. **Power Plant Placement:** Can multiple power plants be placed in the same city?
3. **Distribution Details:** Does placing a power plant in a city completely satisfy its power consumption, regardless of its value?

Assuming typical constraints for a coding problem:
- The number of cities `n` is from 1 to 10^5.
- Power consumption values are positive integers.
- `k` is an integer ranging from 0 to `n`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search combined with a greedy approach or a sliding window maximum/minimum depending on the interpretation of the constraints.

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Use binary search to determine the maximum possible minimum power among the cities.
   - For each mid value in the binary search, check if it's possible to distribute the `k` power plants in such a way that every city's power is at least `mid`.

2. **Greedy Algorithm:**
   - During each step of binary search, use a sliding window or dynamic approach to determine if it's possible to achieve the mid value.

### Code

Let's start with a potential implementation in C++.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

bool canAchieveMinPower(const std::vector<int>& power, int k, int minPower) {
    int n = power.size();
    std::vector<int> neededPlants(n, 0);
    int totalPlants = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (power[i] < minPower) {
            int needed = minPower - power[i];
            if (totalPlants + needed > k) {
                return false;
            }
            totalPlants += needed;
            for (int j = i; j < std::min(i + needed, n); ++j) {
                neededPlants[j] += needed;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int maximizeMinPower(std::vector<int>& power, int k) {
    int left = 0, right = *std::max_element(power.begin(), power.end()) + k;
    int result = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (canAchieveMinPower(power, k, mid)) {
            result = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> power = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << "Maximum possible minimum power: " << maximizeMinPower(power, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Binary Search Bounds:**
   - The minimum power a city can have is `0`.
   - The upper bound is the maximum power in the array plus `k` (if all power plants were placed in cities with 0 initial power).

2. **Check Feasibility (`canAchieveMinPower` Function):**
   - For each city, if its power is less than `minPower`, calculate the needed power plants to make it reach `minPower`.
   - Track the total number of power plants used and ensure it does not exceed `k`.

3. **Adjusting Search Range:**
   - If the current `mid` value is feasible, adjust the lower bound of the search range to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, adjust the upper bound to `mid - 1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** `O(log(max_power + k))`
- **Feasibility Check:** `O(n)`

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log(max_power + k))`.

This ensures an efficient solution that scales well with large input sizes.
