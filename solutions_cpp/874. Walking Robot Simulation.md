[Leetcode 874. Walking Robot Simulation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l874)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `commands` representing the commands to control a robot. The robot starts at the origin (0, 0) and faces the positive Y-axis. Each integer in the `commands` array has the following meanings:

- `-2`: turn left 90 degrees
- `-1`: turn right 90 degrees
- `1 <= x <= 9`: move forward `x` units

Additionally, you are given an array `obstacles` where `obstacles[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents a barrier at coordinates `(x_i, y_i)`.

The robot should simulate the movement given the commands while avoiding obstacles. The goal is to determine the maximum Euclidean distance from the origin `(0, 0)` to any point the robot reaches.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the obstacles always within the range of possible movements given in the commands?**
   - Obstacles may be anywhere within the potential range of movement. A proper check needs to be in place to avoid collisions.
   
2. **Is there a guaranteed maximum size for the `commands` and `obstacles`?**
   - For this problem, we will assume practical limits within reasonable bounds as defined in typical competitive programming constraints.

3. **Should diagonal movements be considered?**
   - No, only horizontal and vertical movements based on the current facing direction will be considered.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Start Point and Directions:**
   - Start at the origin `(0, 0)`.
   - Use directional vectors to handle movement:
     - North: `(0, 1)`
     - East: `(1, 0)`
     - South: `(0, -1)`
     - West: `(-1, 0)`

2. **Process Commands:**
   - Use a variable to keep track of the current direction index.
   - For each command:
     - Update the direction index when turning (`-2` and `-1`).
     - Move forward according to the current direction for movement commands (`1` to `9`).

3. **Handle Obstacle Checking:**
   - Use a set to store obstacle positions for quick lookup.
   - During movement, check for each step if there is an obstacle ahead and stop if there is.

4. **Calculate Maximum Distance:**
   - Track the maximum Euclidean distance squared from the origin throughout the movement.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int robotSim(vector<int>& commands, vector<vector<int>>& obstacles) {
        // Direction vectors for north, east, south, west
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        
        // Use a set to store the obstacle positions
        unordered_set<string> obstacleSet;
        for (auto& obs : obstacles) {
            obstacleSet.insert(to_string(obs[0]) + "," + to_string(obs[1]));
        }
        
        // Start at origin, facing north
        int x = 0, y = 0, d = 0; // direction index (north)
        int maxDist = 0;
        
        for (int command : commands) {
            if (command == -2) {
                // Turn left
                d = (d + 3) % 4;
            } else if (command == -1) {
                // Turn right
                d = (d + 1) % 4;
            } else {
                // Move forward
                for (int i = 0; i < command; ++i) {
                    int nx = x + directions[d].first;
                    int ny = y + directions[d].second;
                    if (obstacleSet.find(to_string(nx) + "," + to_string(ny)) == obstacleSet.end()) {
                        x = nx;
                        y = ny;
                        maxDist = max(maxDist, x * x + y * y);
                    } else {
                        break; // obstacle found, stop moving in this direction
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return maxDist;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** Placing obstacles into the set takes O(k) time where `k` is the number of obstacles.
- **Processing Commands:** Each command takes constant time except for movement commands, which can take up to the distance moved.
- **Overall:** The main loop runs O(n) times for commands, and movement checks are effectively constant time, making the total complexity O(n + k).

This ensures that even for larger inputs, the solution remains efficient.
