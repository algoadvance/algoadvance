[Leetcode 148. Sort List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l148)
## Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

### Example:

- Input: head = [4, 2, 1, 3]
- Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the structure of the linked list?**
   - The linked list is a singly linked list where each node has an integer value and a pointer to the next node.

2. **Can the linked list be empty?**
   - Yes, the linked list can be empty.

3. **Is there a constraint on the additional space we can use?**
   - The problem does not explicitly mention space complexity constraints, but sorting in O(1) auxiliary space is preferred.

## Strategy:
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a sorting algorithm suitable for linked lists, such as Merge Sort, which has O(n log n) time complexity.

### Steps:
1. **Find the Middle:** Use the slow and fast pointer strategy to find the middle of the linked list.
2. **Divide:** Split the linked list into two halves.
3. **Sort Each Half:** Recursively sort each half.
4. **Merge:** Merge the two sorted halves.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode* next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* sortList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) {
            return head;
        }

        // Step 1: Find the middle point of the list
        ListNode* mid = findMiddle(head);

        // Step 2: Split the list into two halves
        ListNode* right = mid->next;
        mid->next = NULL;  // Split the list into two halves

        // Step 3: Sort each half
        ListNode* left = sortList(head);
        right = sortList(right);

        // Step 4: Merge the sorted halves
        return mergeTwoLists(left, right);
    }

private:
    ListNode* findMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;

        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        return slow;
    }

    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode dummy(0);
        ListNode* tail = &dummy;

        while (l1 && l2) {
            if (l1->val < l2->val) {
                tail->next = l1;
                l1 = l1->next;
            } else {
                tail->next = l2;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }
            tail = tail->next;
        }

        if (l1) {
            tail->next = l1;
        } else {
            tail->next = l2;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is due to the merge sort algorithm which performs log n splits and each merge operation takes linear time in the size of the list.
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) due to the recursion stack.
