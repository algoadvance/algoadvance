[Leetcode 2337. Move Pieces to Obtain a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2337)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `start` and `target`, both of the same length, containing the characters 'L', 'R', and ' '. The task is to determine if you can transform the string `start` into the string `target` using any number of the following moves:

1. Any 'L' can move to the left if there is a ' ' (empty space) to its immediate left.
2. Any 'R' can move to the right if there is a ' ' (empty space) to its immediate right.

Return true if you can transform `start` into `target`, otherwise return false.

## Clarifying Questions

To ensure full understanding of the problem, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. Can 'L' and 'R' cross each other?
2. Can consecutive 'L' or 'R' characters move at the same time?
3. Is there any limitation on the number of moves?
4. Can the characters move over multiple empty spaces in one move, or do they have to move one position at a time?

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

bool canTransform(std::string start, std::string target) {
    int n = start.length();
    int i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < n && j < n) {
        while (i < n && start[i] == ' ') ++i;
        while (j < n && target[j] == ' ') ++j;

        if (i == n || j == n) break;

        if (start[i] != target[j]) return false;

        if (start[i] == 'L' && i < j) return false;
        if (start[i] == 'R' && i > j) return false;

        ++i;
        ++j;
    }

    while (i < n) {
        if (start[i] != ' ') return false;
        ++i;
    }
    while (j < n) {
        if (target[j] != ' ') return false;
        ++j;
    }

    return true;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    std::string start = "R_L_";
    std::string target = "__RL";
    std::cout << (canTransform(start, target) ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Pointer Initialization**: Start with two pointers `i` and `j` at the beginning of `start` and `target` strings.
2. **Skipping Spaces**: Move the pointers to skip spaces in both strings.
3. **Character Comparison**: Compare the characters at the pointers:
   - If they are different, return false.
   - If they are the same, ensure 'L' does not move right and 'R' does not move left. 
   - Move the pointers forward.
4. **Final Check**: Ensure there are no remaining 'L' or 'R' characters left in either string.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the strings. We iterate through each character of the strings once, hence the linear time complexity. The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are only using a constant number of extra variables.
