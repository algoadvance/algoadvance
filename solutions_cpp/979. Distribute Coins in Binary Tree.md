[Leetcode 979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l979)
### Problem Statement:
You are given the root of a binary tree with `N` nodes. Each node in the tree has `node.val` coins, and there are `N` coins in total. In one move, you can choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to the other. Your task is to return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What values can `node.val` take?**
   - `node.val` can be any non-negative integer. Since the problem states that there are `N` coins in total, some nodes might initially have more than one coin and others might have none.

2. **What constitutes an adjacent node?**
   - In the context of a binary tree, an adjacent node is either the parent, left child, or right child of a given node.

### Strategy:
1. We will use a post-order traversal of the binary tree (left, right, root) to calculate the number of moves needed to balance the tree.
2. The idea is to calculate the balance (excess or deficit) of coins at each node and propagate this balance to its parent.
3. During the traversal:
   - Calculate the total number of coins needed by current subtree.
   - Calculate how many coins this subtree has.
   - Determine the number of moves required to balance this subtree.
4. The balance at any node can be calculated by:
   - `balance = node.val - 1 + left_balance + right_balance`
   Here, `node.val - 1` represents the excess or deficit of the current node after deducting one coin for itself. `left_balance` and `right_balance` are the balances from the left and right subtrees.
5. Sum the absolute values of balances from left and right subtrees at each node and propagate this balance up the tree to accumulate the total number of moves.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCoins(TreeNode* root) {
        int moves = 0;
        postOrderTraversal(root, moves);
        return moves;
    }

private:
    int postOrderTraversal(TreeNode* node, int &moves) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        int left_balance = postOrderTraversal(node->left, moves);
        int right_balance = postOrderTraversal(node->right, moves);

        int balance = node->val - 1 + left_balance + right_balance;
        moves += abs(left_balance) + abs(right_balance);

        return balance;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(0), new TreeNode(0));
// Solution sol;
// cout << sol.distributeCoins(root) << endl; // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the post-order traversal to calculate the balances and moves.
