[Leetcode 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2014)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the longest subsequence repeated `k` times in `s`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some (or none) of the characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the length of the string `s`? (Generally, we assume it can be large, example up to \(10^5\)).
   - What is the range of `k`? (Typically `k` is a small integer, could be between 1 and length of string).
2. **Output Requirements**: If there are multiple solutions, should we return any one of them or is there a specific order to follow (lexicographically smallest)?
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - What should be returned if no such subsequence exists?
   - Should we consider case sensitivity? (Typically strings are case-sensitive unless otherwise mentioned)

### Strategy
1. **Generate Potential Candidates**: The subsequence we are searching for needs to be repeated `k` times. Thus, we need to search for all possible subsequences in `s` and check if they can be formed `k` times.
2. **Maximizing Length**: To maximize the length of the subsequence, we will start by trying the longest possible candidate subsequences.
3. **Binary Search over Length**: Since we want the longest subsequence, we can employ binary search over the length of subsequences. This helps in narrowing down the search space effectively.
4. **Verification**: For each candidate subsequence, check if it can be found `k` times in `s`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

bool canBeSubsequenceKTimes(const string &s, const string &sub, int k) {
    int n = s.size(), m = sub.size(), i = 0, j = 0, count = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        if (s[i] == sub[j]) {
            j++;
            if (j == m) {
                count++;
                j = 0;
                if (count == k)
                    return true;
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    return false;
}

string longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(const string &s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    unordered_map<char, int> freq;
    for (char c : s) freq[c]++;
    
    string result = "";
    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
        if (freq[c] >= k)
            result.push_back(c);
    }
    
    string longestSubsequence = "";
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    function<void(string, int)> dfs = [&](string current, int start) {
        if (current.size() > maxLength) {
            if (canBeSubsequenceKTimes(s, current, k)) {
                maxLength = current.size();
                longestSubsequence = current;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i < result.size(); ++i) {
            dfs(current + result[i], i);
        }
    };
    
    dfs("", 0);
    
    return longestSubsequence;
}

int main() {
    string s = "letsleetcode";
    int k = 2;
    
    cout << "Longest subsequence repeated " << k << " times: " 
         << longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(s, k) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
**Time Complexity Analysis**:
- **Generate Potential Candidates**: Generating all possible subsequences and repeating the process can be exponential in worst case.
- **Verification**: Each check for a candidate subsequence's validity can be done in O(n) time.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity can be high due to the combinatorial explosion of possible subsequences, making it effectively exponential in the worst case. This is why efficiency can be gained by pruning and possibly binary searching over lengths as noted in the strategy.
