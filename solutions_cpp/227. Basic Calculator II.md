[Leetcode 227. Basic Calculator II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l227)
### Problem Statement

The problem is "227. Basic Calculator II" from LeetCode. The task is to implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains the following non-negative integers and operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. The expression string is guaranteed to be valid and does not contain any leading or trailing spaces. Each integer in the string is non-negative and always less than `2^31`. The return value should be an integer.

### Additional Rules:
1. You should not use the eval function in Python.
2. You must handle multiple digit numbers and follow the standard order of operations (i.e., `*` and `/` before `+` and `-`).
3. You must handle spaces between characters and numbers.

Here's an example:
- Input: `"3+2*2"`
- Output: `7`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Should we handle negative numbers in the input?
   - **Clarification:** No, all numbers are non-negative.

2. **Question:** Should we consider floating-point division or integer division?
   - **Clarification:** Integer division, as it involves only non-negative integers.

3. **Question:** Can we assume that the input string is always valid as per the problem statement?
   - **Clarification:** Yes, the input string is always valid.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Use a stack to handle the intermediate results.
   - Use a `currentNumber` to keep track of multi-digit numbers.

2. **Scan the String:**
   - Traverse the string character by character.
   - If the character is a digit, update `currentNumber`.
   - If the character is an operator, push the previous `currentNumber` based on the last operator to the stack, then update the operator.
   - If it's the end of the string, do the same as above.

3. **Maintain the Order of Operations:**
   - For `+` and `-`: Push the number directly to the stack.
   - For `*` and `/`: Perform immediate operations with the top of the stack.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Sum up all the numbers left in the stack to get the result.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>

class Solution {
public:
    int calculate(std::string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        std::stack<int> stk;
        char lastOperator = '+';
        int currentNumber = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            char ch = s[i];
            if (isdigit(ch)) {
                currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + (ch - '0');
            }
            if ((!isdigit(ch) && !isspace(ch)) || i == n - 1) {
                if (lastOperator == '+') {
                    stk.push(currentNumber);
                } else if (lastOperator == '-') {
                    stk.push(-currentNumber);
                } else if (lastOperator == '*') {
                    int top = stk.top();
                    stk.pop();
                    stk.push(top * currentNumber);
                } else if (lastOperator == '/') {
                    int top = stk.top();
                    stk.pop();
                    stk.push(top / currentNumber);
                }
                lastOperator = ch;
                currentNumber = 0;
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            result += stk.top();
            stk.pop();
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string input = "3+2*2";
    int result = sol.calculate(input);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl; // Output: 7

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We traverse the string once to process each character.
  - Stack operations (push, pop) are O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - In the worst case, we might store all numbers in the stack which takes linear space proportional to the length of the string `n`.
