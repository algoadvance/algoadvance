[Leetcode 3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3085)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. A string is called K-special if it contains k distinct characters. You are tasked with finding the minimum number of deletions required to make the string K-special. If it's not possible to make the string K-special, return -1.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "abcabbaca", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: We can delete 3 characters to get "aabb" which has exactly 2 distinct characters.
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the range of input sizes (length of `s` and value of `k`)?**
   - Typically, constraints would be given on a problem but let's assume reasonable sizes (e.g., length of `s` can be up to around 10^5, and `k` can be up to 26 given it's the alphabet size limit).

2. **Can `s` include characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - We will assume `s` contains only lowercase English letters unless otherwise specified.

3. **What if `k` is greater than the number of distinct characters in `s`?**
   - Return -1 because it's impossible to form a string with more distinct characters than are present.

## Strategy:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - **If `k` is greater than the number of distinct characters in `s`:** Return -1.
   - **If the length of `s` is smaller than `k`:** Return -1 because we need at least `k` characters to make a K-special string.
   - **If `k` is zero:** Return 0 because we do not need any characters if zero distinct characters are required.

2. **Character Frequency Count**:
   - Count the frequency of each character in `s` using an unordered_map or a vector of size 26.

3. **Sort Characters by Frequency**:
   - Sort the characters by their frequency in decreasing order.

4. **Calculate Deletions**:
   - Determine the minimum deletions required to retain exactly `k` distinct characters by converting excess characters to match the exact count needed.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial(string s, int k) {
    if (k == 0) return 0;
    
    // Count frequency of each character in the string
    unordered_map<char, int> freqMap;
    for (char ch : s) {
        freqMap[ch]++;
    }
    
    // If there are not enough distinct characters to meet the requirement
    if (freqMap.size() < k) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Create a vector of frequencies
    vector<int> frequencies;
    for (auto& entry : freqMap) {
        frequencies.push_back(entry.second);
    }
    
    // Sort frequencies in descending order
    sort(frequencies.rbegin(), frequencies.rend());
    
    // Calculate the minimum deletions
    int deletions = 0;
    for (int i = k; i < frequencies.size(); ++i) {
        deletions += frequencies[i];
    }
    
    return deletions;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcabbaca";
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Minimum deletions to make the string K-special: " << minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial(s, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- Counting the frequency of each character in `s` takes `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- Sorting the frequency array takes `O(26 log 26)` since there are at most 26 characters.
- Summing up the deletions involves iterating over the frequency array which is `O(26)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`. 

This should be efficient given the typical constraints on string length and character set size.
