[Leetcode 476. Number Complement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l476)
### Problem Statement

The problem statement for Leetcode 476 - "Number Complement" is as follows:

Given a positive integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

For example:
- Input: `num = 5`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `5` is `101`, and its complement is `010`, which is the binary representation of `2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of the input number `num`?
   **A:** The input number `num` is guaranteed to be a positive integer. We will assume it's within the range typically constrained by a 32-bit signed integer, i.e., `1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`.

2. **Q:** Should the solution handle edge cases such as the smallest and largest numbers within the range?
   **A:** Yes, the solution should handle all positive integers within the range, including boundary values.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the execution time or space complexity?
   **A:** Standard Leetcode constraints apply. We should aim for an efficient solution in terms of both time and space complexity.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Convert the given number to its binary representation.
2. Create a mask which has the same number of bits as the binary representation of `num` but all bits set to 1. This can be achieved by shifting left and subtracting one.
3. XOR the original number with the mask to flip all bits.

Detailed steps:
1. Calculate the number of bits in `num`.
2. Generate a mask that has all these bits set to 1.
3. XOR `num` with this mask to get the complement.

### Code

Here is the C++ code that efficiently computes the complement of a given number:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return 1;  // Special case for num = 0, though it's not a positive integer
        
        // Calculate the bit length of num
        int bitLength = log2(num) + 1;
        
        // Create a mask that has the same number of bits all set to 1
        int mask = (1 << bitLength) - 1;
        
        // XOR num with the mask to get the complement
        return num ^ mask;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int num = 5;  // Example number
    cout << "The complement of " << num << " is: " << solution.findComplement(num) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)`. This is because the number of operations performed (logarithm calculation for bit length and basic bit manipulations) are constant time relative to the size of an integer.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also `O(1)`, as we are using a fixed number of additional variables.

This approach ensures that we have a minimal and efficient solution for finding the complement of a given positive integer.
