[Leetcode 1818. Minimum Absolute Sum Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1818)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n`, the *absolute sum difference* of these two arrays is defined as the sum of `|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|` for each `0 <= i < n`.

You can replace exactly one element of `nums1` with any other element in `nums1` to minimize this absolute sum difference.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing one element in the array `nums1`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of array lengths (n)?**
   - The length `n` is between 1 and 10^5.
   
2. **What is the range of array elements?**
   - Each element in `nums1` and `nums2` is between 1 and 10^5.

3. **Is there any constraint on the number of times we can replace elements in `nums1`?**
   - Yes, you can replace exactly one element in `nums1` only with another element from `nums1`.

4. **What should the function signature look like?**
   - `int minAbsoluteSumDiff(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2);`

### Strategy

1. **Initial Calculation:** Calculate the initial absolute sum difference without any replacement.
2. **Binary Search for Optimization:**
   - Sort a copy of `nums1` to facilitate binary search.
   - For each element in `nums2`, find the closest element in the sorted `nums1` using binary search to minimize the absolute difference.
   - Calculate the potential new absolute sum difference if the replacement is performed.
3. **Replacement Effect:** Track the maximum reduction in the absolute sum difference achieved by any single replacement.
4. **Final Calculation:** Subtract the maximum reduction from the initial absolute sum difference to get the final result.
5. **Modulus Operation:** Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int minAbsoluteSumDiff(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = nums1.size();
        std::vector<int> sorted_nums1(nums1);
        std::sort(sorted_nums1.begin(), sorted_nums1.end());
        
        // Calculate the initial absolute sum difference
        long long initial_diff_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            initial_diff_sum += std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
        }
        
        // Tracking the maximum reduction in absolute sum difference
        long long max_reduction = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int original_diff = std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            
            // Use binary search to find the closest element in sorted_nums1 to nums2[i]
            auto it = std::lower_bound(sorted_nums1.begin(), sorted_nums1.end(), nums2[i]);
            
            if (it != sorted_nums1.end()) {
                int new_diff = std::abs(*it - nums2[i]);
                max_reduction = std::max(max_reduction, static_cast<long long>(original_diff) - new_diff);
            }
            
            if (it != sorted_nums1.begin()) {
                --it;
                int new_diff = std::abs(*it - nums2[i]);
                max_reduction = std::max(max_reduction, static_cast<long long>(original_diff) - new_diff);
            }
        }
        
        long long result = (initial_diff_sum - max_reduction) % MOD;
        return result < 0 ? result + MOD : result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting `nums1`.
- **Binary Search:** For each element in `nums2`, binary search operations are \(O(\log n)\), and since this is done for all n elements, the overall time complexity for this part is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting and multiple binary searches.

The solution is efficient and scalable for the input size constraints.
