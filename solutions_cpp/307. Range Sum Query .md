[Leetcode 307. Range Sum Query ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l307)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`, and you are tasked with performing the following operations:

1. **Update**: Update a specific element of the array at a given index.
2. **Sum Range**: Return the sum of elements between indices `left` and `right` inclusive, where `left` and `right` are given.

Design an efficient data structure to implement the given operations.

Implement the `NumArray` class:

- `NumArray(vector<int>& nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
- `void update(int index, int val)` Updates the value of `nums[index]` to `val`.
- `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the sum of elements between indices left and right inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative values.
2. What are the constraints on the size of the array and the number of operations?
   - The length of `nums` will be in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.
   - The number of operations will be in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.

### Strategy

To efficiently handle range sum and update queries, we can use a data structure known as **Segment Tree**. This structure allows us to perform both update and sum range queries in O(log n) time.

Hereâ€™s a high-level strategy using a Segment Tree:
1. **Building the Tree**: Construct a segment tree from the given array. Each leaf node will represent an element of the array, and each internal node will represent the sum of its children.
2. **Updating the Tree**: When updating an element, update the corresponding leaf node and propagate the change upwards to maintain the correct sum in each internal node.
3. **Querying the Tree**: To get the sum of a range, combine the sums of segments that completely or partially overlap with the query range.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>

class NumArray {
public:
    NumArray(std::vector<int>& nums) : n(nums.size()), tree(2 * nums.size()) {
        // Build the tree
        buildTree(nums);
    }

    void update(int index, int val) {
        index += n; // Convert to leaf index
        tree[index] = val;

        // Update the parents
        while (index > 0) {
            int left = index;
            int right = index;
            if (index % 2 == 0) {
                right = index + 1;
            } else {
                left = index - 1;
            }
            // Parent updated to the sum of its children
            tree[index / 2] = tree[left] + tree[right];
            index /= 2;
        }
    }

    int sumRange(int left, int right) {
        left += n;
        right += n;
        int sum = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            // If left is a right node, bring its value and move to parent's right node
            if (left % 2 == 1) {
                sum += tree[left];
                left++;
            }
            // If right is a left node, bring its value and move to parent's left node
            if (right % 2 == 0) {
                sum += tree[right];
                right--;
            }
            left /= 2;
            right /= 2;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
private:
    std::vector<int> tree;
    int n;

    void buildTree(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Initialize leaves
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            tree[n + i] = nums[i];
        }
        // Build the tree by summing children
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            tree[i] = tree[i * 2] + tree[i * 2 + 1];
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: Building the segment tree takes O(n) time.
2. **Update Operation**: Each update operation takes O(log n) time.
3. **Sum Range Query**: Each sum range query takes O(log n) time.

By using a Segment Tree, we achieve efficient update and query times, making it suitable for handling large arrays and a high frequency of operations.
