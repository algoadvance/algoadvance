[Leetcode 1139. Largest 1](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1139)
Sure, let's work through the problem "Largest 1-Bordered Square" from LeetCode.

### Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of `0`s and `1`s, the task is to find the largest square that has all `1`s on its border. The square should be as large as possible. Your function should return the area of the largest such square.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Does the grid only contain `0`s and `1`s?
   - Yes.
2. What should be returned if there's no such square?
   - Return 0 if there's no 1-bordered square.

### Example

For example:
```plaintext
Input: grid = 
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
Output: 9
```

For this grid, the entire grid is a 3x3 square which all borders are `1`, so the area of the largest 1-bordered square is `9` (3*3).

### Strategy

1. **Pre-computation**
   - Calculate the number of consecutive `1`s to the right (`right[i][j]`) and down (`down[i][j]`) for each cell `(i, j)` in the grid.

2. **Find the Largest Square**
   - Iterate over possible side lengths from the largest possible down to 1.
   - For each possible top-left corner `(i, j)` of a square with side length `k`:
     - Check if there are at least `k` consecutive `1`s in the right direction on both the top and bottom edges.
     - Check if there are at least `k` consecutive `1`s in the down direction on both the left and right edges.
   - If all the conditions are met, then `k*k` is a candidate for the largest area.

3. **Return the Area**
   - The maximum area found is the result.

### Code

Here's the C++ code that implements this solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int largest1BorderedSquare(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        
        // Create two helper tables
        vector<vector<int>> right(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> down(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
        
        // Fill the helper tables
        for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = cols - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (j < cols - 1)
                        right[i][j] = right[i][j + 1] + 1;
                    else
                        right[i][j] = 1;

                    if (i < rows - 1)
                        down[i][j] = down[i + 1][j] + 1;
                    else
                        down[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find the largest 1-bordered square
        for (int size = min(rows, cols); size > 0; size--) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= rows - size; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= cols - size; j++) {
                    if (right[i][j] >= size && right[i + size - 1][j] >= size &&
                        down[i][j] >= size && down[i][j + size - 1] >= size) {
                        return size * size;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return 0; // No 1-bordered square found
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Pre-computation Step**:
   - Calculating the `right` and `down` arrays requires iterating over each cell once, so this is `O(rows * cols)`.

2. **Checking Possible Squares**:
   - Checking all possible top-left corners and side lengths also results in a complexity of `O(rows * cols * min(rows, cols))` in the worst case where every position can be a potential square's top-left corner and we check for all possible sizes.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(rows * cols * min(rows, cols))`.

This should be efficient enough for most practical grid sizes encountered in interview problems.
