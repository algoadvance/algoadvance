[Leetcode 1884. Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1884)
### Problem Statement

You are provided with two eggs and you need to determine the highest floor (in a building with `N` floors) from which you can drop an egg without breaking it. You want to minimize the number of drops in the worst case scenario.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any specific input size or constraints we should be aware of?**
   - The building has `N` floors where `1 <= N <= 1000`.

2. **Are there any assumptions about the eggs' behavior when dropped?**
   - Yes, if an egg breaks when dropped from a floor `k`, then it will also break from any floor higher than `k`.
   - If an egg does not break when dropped from a floor `k`, then it will not break from any floor lower than `k`.
   
3. **Is the result required to be the minimum number of drops in the worst case scenario?**
   - Yes, the goal is to minimize the number of drops in the worst case scenario.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of drops required with `i` eggs and `j` floors.
    - Initialize `dp` array such that `dp[0][j]` = 0 (0 eggs, 0 drops) and `dp[1][j]` = j (1 egg, worst case you have to do a linear search).
    - Calculate the values for `2` eggs and from `1` to `N` floors.
    - Use a nested loop where the outer loop is for the number of floors, and the inner loop finds the minimum number of attempts.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int eggDrop(int N) {
    // Initialize the dp array
    vector<vector<int>> dp(3, vector<int>(N + 1, 0));

    // Base cases
    for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        dp[1][j] = j;  // With 1 egg and j floors, we do a linear search
    }
    
    // Fill dp array for the case of 2 eggs
    for (int j = 1; j <= N; ++j) {
        dp[2][j] = j;  // Start by assuming the worst case is linear
        for (int k = 1; k <= j; ++k) {
            // Calculate the minimum of the worst case attempts
            dp[2][j] = min(dp[2][j], 1 + max(dp[1][k-1], dp[2][j-k]));
        }
    }

    return dp[2][N];
}

int main() {
    int N;
    cout << "Enter the number of floors: ";
    cin >> N;

    cout << "Minimum number of drops required in worst case with 2 eggs and " << N << " floors is: " << eggDrop(N) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Setting up the base cases for `dp` takes linear time, `O(N)`.
- **Filling the DP Table**: The nested loops over floors result in a worst case time complexity of `O(N^2)`:
  - Outer loop runs `N` times.
  - The inner loop (for finding the minimum of the worst case attempts) runs `N` times leading to an `O(N^2)` complexity for filling the `dp` table.

Thus, the overall time complexity for this approach is `O(N^2)`.
