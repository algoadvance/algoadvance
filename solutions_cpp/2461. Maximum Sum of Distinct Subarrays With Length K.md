[Leetcode 2461. Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2461)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum sum of any subarray of `nums` of length `k` that has all distinct elements.

Return the maximum sum of the subarray, or 0 if no such subarray exists.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range for the `nums` array? (e.g., 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5)
   - What are the possible values for the elements in the `nums` array? (e.g., -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4)
   - Is `k` always guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of `nums`?

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - If no such subarray of length `k` exists with distinct elements, should the function simply return 0?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with a hash set to ensure all elements within the current window are distinct. The steps include:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Use a hash set to keep track of unique elements in the current window.
   - Use a variable to keep track of the current sum of the window.

2. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Iterate through the `nums` array while maintaining a window of size `k`.
   - If the size of the window exceeds `k`, remove the leftmost element.
   - If the current number already exists in the set, adjust the window by removing elements from the left until it becomes distinct.
   - Calculate and update the maximum sum whenever a window of size `k` with distinct elements is formed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle scenarios where `k` is greater than the length of `nums`.
   - Handle cases where it's impossible to have a subarray of length `k` with distinct elements (return 0).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm> // for max

int maximumSubarraySum(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (k > n) return 0;  // This condition is logically ensuring k is valid.

    std::unordered_set<int> unique_elements;
    int max_sum = 0;
    int current_sum = 0;
    int left = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        while (unique_elements.count(nums[right])) {
            unique_elements.erase(nums[left]);
            current_sum -= nums[left];
            ++left;
        }

        unique_elements.insert(nums[right]);
        current_sum += nums[right];

        if (right - left + 1 == k) {
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_sum);

            // Remove the left element to slide the window
            unique_elements.erase(nums[left]);
            current_sum -= nums[left];
            ++left;
        }
    }

    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << "Maximum sum of distinct subarrays of length " << k << " is: " << maximumSubarraySum(nums, k) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because each element is processed at most twice â€“ once when it is added to the window and once when it is removed from the window.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(k)** due to the extra space used by the hash set to store the elements of the current window of size `k`.
