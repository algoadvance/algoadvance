[Leetcode 497. Random Point in Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l497)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles `rects` where `rects[i] = [ai, bi, xi, yi]` represents the rectangle with lower left corner `(ai, bi)` and upper right corner `(xi, yi)`. Implement the function `pick()` to randomly select a point within one of these rectangles with a uniform probability. The rectangles are non-overlapping, so any given point in the space falls into at most one rectangle.

Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(vector<vector<int>>& rects)` Initializes the object with the given rectangles `rects`.
- `vector<int> pick()` Returns a random point `[x, y]` within one of the given rectangles with a uniform probability.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the coordinates of the rectangles integers?**
   - Yes, the coordinates of the rectangles are given as integers.

2. **What is the range of coordinates and the number of rectangles?**
   - The coordinates and the number of rectangles are within reasonable bounds as per typical coding challenges, but specifics can be found in the problem if additional constraints are noted.

3. **Is the distribution strictly uniform over the area covered by all rectangles?**
   - Yes, each point in the area covered by the rectangles should have an equal probability of being picked.

### Strategy

1. **Compute the Total Number of Points:**
   - For each rectangle, calculate the number of points it contains.
   - Maintain a cumulative count of points.

2. **Random Point Selection:**
   - Generate a random number within the total number of points.
   - Determine which rectangle this point falls into based on cumulative sums.

3. **Point Generation within Rectangle:**
   - For the selected rectangle, compute the exact coordinates for the point.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
    vector<vector<int>> rects;
    vector<int> prefixSums;
    int totalPoints;

public:
    Solution(vector<vector<int>>& rects) : rects(rects), totalPoints(0) {
        srand(time(0));  // Seed for random number generation
        
        for (auto& rect : rects) {
            // Calculate the number of points in the current rectangle
            int numPoints = (rect[2] - rect[0] + 1) * (rect[3] - rect[1] + 1);
            totalPoints += numPoints;
            prefixSums.push_back(totalPoints);
        }
    }

    vector<int> pick() {
        // Generate a random number in range [1, totalPoints]
        int randPoint = rand() % totalPoints + 1;
        
        // Binary search to find the rectangle containing the randPoint
        int lo = 0, hi = rects.size() - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (prefixSums[mid] < randPoint) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        
        // lo now is the index of the target rectangle
        vector<int>& selectedRect = rects[lo];
        
        // Calculate the offset within the selected rectangle
        int pointsInPreviousRects = (lo == 0) ? 0 : prefixSums[lo - 1];
        int offset = randPoint - pointsInPreviousRects - 1;

        int width = selectedRect[2] - selectedRect[0] + 1;
        int x = selectedRect[0] + (offset % width);
        int y = selectedRect[1] + (offset / width);
        
        return {x, y};
    }
};

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> rects = {{1, 1, 5, 5}, {10, 10, 13, 13}, {20, 20, 25, 25}};
    Solution solution(rects);
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        vector<int> point = solution.pick();
        cout << "Random Point: (" << point[0] << ", " << point[1] << ")\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`Solution` constructor):** O(n), where `n` is the number of rectangles. This is because we compute the area of each rectangle once.
- **Pick Function (`pick` method):** O(log n) for the binary search to determine the target rectangle plus O(1) to compute the exact coordinates within the rectangle.

This approach ensures efficient point selection with uniform distribution.
