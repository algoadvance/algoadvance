[Leetcode 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1971)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and an array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`. Given two integer nodes `start` and `end`, return `true` if there is a path between `start` and `end` otherwise return `false`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], start = 0, end = 5
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the `edges` array be empty?**
   - Yes, in which case there are no edges in the graph.
   
2. **Can there be self-loops in the graph?**
   - The problem does not specify, so we will assume there can be.

3. **Can there be multiple edges between two nodes?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically such problems assume simple graphs unless specified.

4. **What should we return if `start` is the same as `end`?**
   - We should return `true` since the node is trivially reachable from itself.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **Graph Traversal:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine if there is a path from `start` to `end`.

3. **Visited Nodes:**
   - Keep track of visited nodes to prevent infinite loops.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <stack>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

bool dfs(int start, int end, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& graph, unordered_set<int>& visited) {
    if (start == end) return true;
    
    visited.insert(start);
    
    for (int neighbor : graph[start]) {
        if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
            if (dfs(neighbor, end, graph, visited)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

bool validPath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int start, int end) {
    if (start == end) return true;
    
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
    
    // Construct the graph
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }
    
    unordered_set<int> visited;
    return dfs(start, end, graph, visited);
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0,1},{0,2},{3,5},{5,4},{4,3}};
    int start = 0, end = 5;

    bool result = validPath(n, edges, start, end);
    cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the graph:** O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **DFS/BFS traversal:** O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(V + E)**. This is efficient for typical constraints in graph problems where `V` and `E` are large.

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - We build an adjacency list from the given edge list.
  
2. **DFS to Find Path:**
   - We perform a DFS starting from the `start` node. If we reach the `end` node, we return `true`.
   - If all reachable nodes are visited without finding `end`, we return `false`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `start` is equal to `end`, we immediately return `true`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if a path exists between two nodes in an undirected graph.
