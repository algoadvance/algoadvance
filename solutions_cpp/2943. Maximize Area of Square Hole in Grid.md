[Leetcode 2943. Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2943)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D `m x n` grid of integers. You have to find the largest square hole that can be created by removing integers from the grid such that the square hole's area is maximized. The removed integers will form a perfect square (a square with all four sides having equal length). 

Write a function `int maximizeAreaOfSquareHole(vector<vector<int>>& grid)` which returns the area of the largest possible square hole.

Note:
- The integers in the grid might be repeated.
- The square hole does not need to have consecutive numbers removed (i.e., there can be non-removed integers inside the hole).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What does it mean to form a square hole?**
   - It means removing cells from the grid such that the removed cells form a square.

2. **Can we assume grid always has at least one integer?**
   - Yes, the problem ensures that the grid is non-empty.

3. **Does the square hole need to be completely aligned with the grid boundaries or can it be rotated?**
   - The square hole can be aligned with the grid boundaries, not rotated.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the size of the largest square ending at cell `(i, j)`.
   - If `grid[i][j]` is part of the removed square, then it should form a square with the upper, left, and upper-left diagonal cells.
   - The transition would be: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1` if `grid[i][j]` can be part of the hole.
   
2. **Result Calculation:**
   - Iterate through the entire grid to compute `dp` array.
   - Keep track of the maximum value in the `dp` array which will be the side length of the largest square hole.
   - Calculate the area of the square as side length squared.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeAreaOfSquareHole(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        int max_side_length = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    // On the border, the largest square would be the cell itself if removed.
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                        dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]}) + 1;
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
                max_side_length = max(max_side_length, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return max_side_length * max_side_length;  // Return the area of the largest square hole.
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(m*n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
  - Each cell is visited once and the `min` operation over 3 elements is a constant time operation.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - **O(m*n)** due to the `dp` array. This could be optimized to O(n) using a rolling array, but for simplicity, we use a 2D array here.

This solution efficiently computes the largest square hole's area in a given grid by leveraging dynamic programming.
