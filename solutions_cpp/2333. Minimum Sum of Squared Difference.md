[Leetcode 2333. Minimum Sum of Squared Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2333)
## Problem Statement
You are given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, and an integer `k`. The arrays are of the same length, `n`. You are allowed to perform the following operation at most `k` times:

1. Choose an index `i` from `nums1` and an index `j` from `nums2`.
2. Increase or decrease `nums1[i]` or `nums2[j]` by `1`.

Your goal is to minimize the sum of squared differences between `nums1` and `nums2` after performing the allowed operations. The sum of squared differences is defined as:

\[ \text{Sum of squared differences} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (nums1[i] - nums2[i])^2 \]

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are `nums1` and `nums2` guaranteed to be of the same length? 
   - Yes.
2. Are the elements in `nums1` and `nums2` within a certain range?
   - Typically they would be within a reasonable integer range.
3. Can `k` be zero, and should we account for it?
   - Yes, `k` can be zero. The code must handle this case properly.
4. Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?
   - Yes, typically the constraints are such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^9\).

## Strategy
1. **Calculate Initial Differences**: Compute the absolute differences of paired elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. **Prioritize Large Differences**: To minimize the sum of squared differences, we should target large differences first to maximize the impact of reducing them.
3. **Reduce Differences Using `k`**: Use a max heap (priority queue) to keep track of differences and reduce them using the allowed operations (`k`).
4. **Update Sum of Squared Differences**: After reducing differences using `k`, recalculate the sum of squared differences.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

long long minSumSquaredDifference(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, int k) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    
    // Calculate initial differences
    vector<int> diff(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        diff[i] = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
    }
    
    // Use a max heap to always reduce the largest difference first
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap(diff.begin(), diff.end());
    
    // Use k operations to reduce the differences
    while (k > 0 && !maxHeap.empty()) {
        int top = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();
        if (top == 0) break;
        
        int decreaseAmt = min(top, k);
        k -= decreaseAmt;
        
        maxHeap.push(top - decreaseAmt);
    }
    
    // Calculate the final sum of squared differences
    long long result = 0;
    while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
        long long num = maxHeap.top(); maxHeap.pop();
        result += num * num;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> nums2 = {2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 5;
    
    cout << "Minimum Sum of Squared Difference: " << minSumSquaredDifference(nums1, nums2, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Heap Initialization**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Heap Operations**: Each operation (pop and push) takes \(O(\log n)\). In the worst case, we perform `k` operations, thus \(O(k \log n)\).
- **Summation Calculation**: \(O(n \log n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by \(O((k + 2n) \log n)\). Given typical constraints, this should be efficient enough.
