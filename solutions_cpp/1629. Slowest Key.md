[Leetcode 1629. Slowest Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1629)
## Problem Statement
A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of n keys, one at a time.

You are given a string keysPressed of length n, where keysPressed[i] was the i-th key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list `releaseTimes`, where `releaseTimes[i]` was the time the i-th key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed, and they are of the same length.

The *duration* of a key press is the time between the key's press and release. The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. If there is a tie, the key with the lexicographically largest key should be returned.

**Example:**
```
Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The keypress durations are as follows:
    - Key "c" has duration 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
    - Key "b" has duration 20 (pressed at time 9 and released at time 29).
    - Key "c" has duration 20 (pressed at time 29 and released at time 49).
    - Key "d" has duration 1 (pressed at time 49 and released at time 50).
    Therefore, the key pressed with the longest duration is "b", but "c" (another key with the same duration) lexicographically comes last.
```

**Constraints:**
- `releaseTimes.length == n`
- `keysPressed.length == n`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= releaseTimes[i] <= 10^9`
- `releaseTimes[i] < releaseTimes[i+1]`
- `keysPressed contains only lowercase English letters.`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the `releaseTimes` guaranteed to be sorted and strictly increasing?
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that `releaseTimes[i] < releaseTimes[i+1]`.
2. Can the input strings and arrays be empty?
   - No, according to the constraints, `n` is at least 2.
3. Should we handle inputs outside the constraints (e.g., non-lowercase letters in `keysPressed`)?
   - No, we can assume the input will always meet the given constraints.

## Strategy
1. Initialize variables to track the longest duration and the corresponding key.
2. The duration of the first key is simply `releaseTimes[0]`.
3. Iterate through the list from the second element, computing the duration of each key press as `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]`.
4. Compare each duration with the longest duration found so far:
   - If the current duration is longer, update the longest duration and corresponding key.
   - If the current duration is equal to the longest duration, update the key if it is lexicographically larger.
5. Return the key with the longest duration.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `releaseTimes` and `keysPressed`. This is because we iterate through the input arrays only once.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    char slowestKey(vector<int>& releaseTimes, string keysPressed) {
        char slowestKey = keysPressed[0];
        int maxDuration = releaseTimes[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < releaseTimes.size(); ++i) {
            int duration = releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1];
            if (duration > maxDuration || (duration == maxDuration && keysPressed[i] > slowestKey)) {
                maxDuration = duration;
                slowestKey = keysPressed[i];
            }
        }
        
        return slowestKey;
    }
};
```

This code implements the strategy outlined above by:
1. Initializing the first key and its duration as benchmarks.
2. Iterating through subsequent keys to compare and update the longest duration and the lexicographically largest key when durations tie.
