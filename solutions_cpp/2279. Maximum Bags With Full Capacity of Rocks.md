[Leetcode 2279. Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2279)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` bags numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given two 0-indexed integer arrays `capacity` and `rocks`. The `i-th` bag can hold a maximum of `capacity[i]` rocks and currently contains `rocks[i]` rocks. You are also given an integer `additionalRocks`, the number of additional rocks you can place in any of the bags.

Return the maximum number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some of the bags.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `rocks[i]` ever exceed `capacity[i]`?
   - No, `rocks[i]` will always be less than or equal to `capacity[i]`.
   
2. Should we consider partial fillings of bags for the final count?
   - No, only fully filled bags count towards the final answer.
   
3. Is modifying the input arrays allowed?
   - For simplicity in code explanation, modifying `capacity` and `rocks` will not be an issue, but this shouldn't be assumed in a real interview. Thus, we'll use fresh variables where necessary.

### Strategy

1. Calculate the difference between `capacity[i]` and `rocks[i]` to determine how many additional rocks are needed to fill each bag completely.
2. Sort these differences in ascending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted list of differences and keep adding rocks from `additionalRocks` until either you run out of `additionalRocks` or you fill the maximum number of bags.
4. Count how many bags have been filled and return this count.

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the differences takes O(n).
- Sorting the differences takes O(n log n).
- Iterating through the sorted differences to fill bags takes O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumBags(vector<int>& capacity, vector<int>& rocks, int additionalRocks) {
        int n = capacity.size();
        
        // Calculate the differences
        vector<int> differences(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            differences[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i];
        }
        
        // Sort the differences
        sort(differences.begin(), differences.end());
        
        // Start filling the bags
        int maxBags = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if(differences[i] <= additionalRocks) {
                additionalRocks -= differences[i];
                maxBags++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return maxBags;
    }
};
```

Ensure to test edge cases such as empty arrays, all bags already full, and varying amounts of `additionalRocks`.
