[Leetcode 2871. Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2871)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to split `nums` into the maximum number of subarrays such that:

1. Each subarray is non-empty.
2. The sum of elements of each subarray is strictly greater than or equal to `1`.

Return the maximum number of subarrays you can achieve.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, -1, 2, 3, -2, -2, 2, 1]
Output: 6

Explanation: We can split the array into the following subarrays: [1], [-1, 2], [3], [-2, -2, 2], [1]. Each subarray has a sum greater than or equal to `1`.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the inputs be empty? (No, in such a case, no subarray can be formed).
2. Are there negative numbers in the array? (Yes, there might be both positive and negative numbers).
3. Is there any upper limit on the size of the array? (This is typically constrained by the system memory).

## Strategy

The primary strategy is to iterate over the array, maintaining a running sum of elements. Whenever the running sum reaches 1 or more, we can consider the subarray before this point (inclusive) as one subarray, and then reset the running sum to zero to start forming a new subarray starting from the next element.

Steps:
1. Initialize a running sum to zero.
2. Traverse through the array and add each element to the running sum.
3. Whenever the running sum becomes 1 or higher, increment the subarray count, and reset the running sum to zero to begin a new subarray.
4. Return the count of subarrays generated.

By following this strategy, we aim to maximize the number of subarrays where each subarray has a sum of at least 1.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int subarrayCount = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        
        for(int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum >= 1) {
                subarrayCount++;
                currentSum = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return subarrayCount;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once and performing constant-time operations (addition, comparison, and reset) for each element.

## Edge Cases

1. All elements are positive: The subarray count will be the number of elements.
2. All elements are negative: No valid subarray can form.
3. Mixed positive and negative elements: The algorithm handles these by adjusting the subarray boundaries based on sum conditions.
