[Leetcode 1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1376)
### Problem Statement

A company has `n` employees with a unique ID from `0` to `n-1`. The head of the company has an ID `headID`. Every employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where `manager[i]` is the ID of the manager for employee `i`. A manager of `-1` indicates the head of the company.

Each employee `i` needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all their direct subordinates. The company wants to inform all employees of some urgent news. Return the number of minutes needed to inform all employees.

```
Example 1:
Input: n = 1, headID = 0, manager = [-1], informTime = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation: The head of the company is the only employee, so the total time needed is 0.

Example 2:
Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id 2 will inform all employees.

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= headID < n
- manager.length == n
- 0 <= manager[i] < n
- informTime.length == n
- 0 <= informTime[i] <= 1000
- manager[i] == -1 means employee i is the head of the company.
- It's guaranteed that all the employees can be informed.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Do all employees need to be informed eventually, regardless of the amount of time it takes?
2. Can the inform time for an employee be 0, indicating that they can immediately inform their subordinates without any delay?
3. Is the input guaranteed to form a tree structure (each employee has exactly one direct manager except the head)?

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**: Each employee and their subordinates can be represented as a tree where the root is the `headID`.
2. **DFS or BFS**: We will use DFS (Depth First Search) to traverse the tree since we are interested in the maximum time required to inform all employees.
3. **Recursive DFS**:
    - Start from the head.
    - For each subordinate, recursively calculate the time needed to inform all employees under the subordinate.
    - Sum the inform time of the manager and the maximum time required by their subordinates.
4. **Base Case**: If an employee has no subordinates, the time is simply 0 since they have no one to inform.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int timeNeededToInformAllEmployees(int n, int headID, vector<int>& manager, vector<int>& informTime) {
        vector<vector<int>> subordinates(n);

        // Build the tree.
        for (int employee = 0; employee < n; ++employee) {
            if (manager[employee] != -1) {
                subordinates[manager[employee]].push_back(employee);
            }
        }

        // Function to perform DFS.
        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int employee) {
            int maxTime = 0;
            for (int subordinate : subordinates[employee]) {
                maxTime = max(maxTime, dfs(subordinate));
            }
            return maxTime + informTime[employee];
        };

        return dfs(headID);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    // Example: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2], informTime = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
    vector<int> manager = {2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2};
    vector<int> informTime = {0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0};
    int n = 6;
    int headID = 2;

    cout << "Time needed to inform all employees: " 
         << solution.timeNeededToInformAllEmployees(n, headID, manager, informTime) 
         << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of employees. Each employee is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the subordinates list and function call stack during the recursion.

This solution ensures that all employees are informed as efficiently as possible and respects the hierarchical structure provided by the manager array.
