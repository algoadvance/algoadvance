[Leetcode 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1044)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. Consider all non-empty substrings of `s` that occur at least twice. Return any such substring that has the longest possible length. If `s` does not have any such substring, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Length**: What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
    - **Answer**: The length can be up to `10^5`.

2. **Character Set**: What characters does the string `s` contain?
    - **Answer**: The string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Output**: What should be returned if there is no duplicate substring?
    - **Answer**: Return an empty string `""`.

4. **Substring Definition**: Are overlapping substrings considered?
    - **Answer**: Yes, overlapping substrings are considered.

## Strategy

The problem can be solved using a combination of Binary Search and Rabin-Karp Algorithm for efficient substring comparison.

1. **Binary Search**: 
    - The length of the longest duplicate substring lies between 0 and the length of the string. Use binary search to determine the longest possible length of the duplicate substring.

2. **Rabin-Karp with Sliding Window**:
    - Use a rolling hash to efficiently check for duplicate substrings of a given length within the string.
    - For each mid in binary search, generate hashes for all substrings of length mid and use a set to check for duplicates.

## Code

Here is an implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string longestDupSubstring(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int left = 1, right = n;
        string result = "";

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            string dup = getDuplicateSubstring(s, mid);
            if (!dup.empty()) {
                result = dup;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

private:
    string getDuplicateSubstring(const string& s, int length) {
        if (length == 0) return "";
        
        unordered_set<long long> seen;
        long long base = 31;
        long long mod = 1e9 + 7;
        long long hash = 0, power = 1;
        
        // Calculate the hash for the first 'length' characters
        for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            hash = (hash * base + s[i] - 'a' + 1) % mod;
            power = (power * base) % mod;
        }
        seen.insert(hash);
        
        for (int i = length; i < s.length(); ++i) {
            hash = (hash * base + s[i] - 'a' + 1 - ((s[i - length] - 'a' + 1) * power % mod) + mod) % mod;
            if (seen.count(hash)) {
                return s.substr(i - length + 1, length);
            }
            seen.insert(hash);
        }
        
        return "";
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "banana";
    cout << "Longest duplicate substring: " << solution.longestDupSubstring(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log n)
- **Rabin-Karp Algorithm for substring checking**: O(n)

Overall time complexity: O(n log n)
- The binary search runs in O(log n) iterations.
- The Rabin-Karp substring checking runs in O(n) for each iteration.

Hence, the combined complexity is O(n log n).
