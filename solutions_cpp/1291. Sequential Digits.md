[Leetcode 1291. Sequential Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1291)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers low and high, return a sorted list of all the integers in the range `[low, high]` inclusive that have sequential digits.

Sequential digits are digits in an integer that follow an increasing sequential order. For example, `123` and `2345`.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: low = 100, high = 300
Output: [123, 234]

Input: low = 1000, high = 13000
Output: [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678, 6789, 12345]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Constraints**: What are the constraints of the low and high values?
   - Generally, they are within the range of 1 to 10^9.

2. **Output Order**: Should the output list be sorted?
   - Yes, the output list must be sorted in ascending order.

### Strategy

1. **Generate Sequential Digit Numbers**:
   - To tackle this problem, we can generate all possible sequential digit numbers from the smallest number to the largest number in our range. 
   - We do this by iterating over possible starting digits (1 through 9) and generating numbers by appending the next sequential digit until our number exceeds the high value.

2. **Filtering**:
   - As we generate each number, we check if it falls within the `[low, high]` range and store it in our list if it does.

3. **Sorting**:
   - By the nature of our generation strategy, the numbers should already be in ascending order, so an additional sort is not necessary.

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> sequentialDigits(int low, int high) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    
    for (int start = 1; start <= 9; ++start) {
        int num = start;
        for (int nextDigit = start + 1; nextDigit <= 9; ++nextDigit) {
            num = num * 10 + nextDigit;
            if (num > high) break;
            if (num >= low) result.push_back(num);
        }
    }
    
    return result; // Results should be naturally in ascending order
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    int low = 100, high = 300;
    std::vector<int> results = sequentialDigits(low, high);
    for (int num : results) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generation**: We are generating all possible sequential digits starting from each digit 1 through 9. The inner loop runs a constant number of times (at most 8 times for the longest sequence).
- **Filtering**: Each generated number that is within the range `[low, high]` is added to the result vector.
- **Overall Complexity**: Considering that each number of a given length is generated once, the approach runs in approximately constant time relative to the length of numbers involved, making it efficient and feasible within typical problem constraints.

Time Complexity: **O(1)** (effectively constant due to the small range of numbers generated)
Space Complexity: **O(1)** (for the result list, ignoring the input size constants)
