[Leetcode 2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2196)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `descriptions` where `descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti]` indicates that `parenti` is the parent of `childi` in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore:

- If `isLefti == 1`, then `childi` is the left child of `parenti`.
- If `isLefti == 0`, then `childi` is the right child of `parenti`.

Construct the binary tree, and return *the root* of the tree.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[1,3,0],[2,4,1]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: The binary tree that is created is:
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /
4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - Can we assume that there will be exactly one valid binary tree that can be made from the given descriptions?
   - Yes, you can assume that there's exactly one valid binary tree that can be made from the given descriptions.

2. **Unique Values**:
   - Are the values in `descriptions` guaranteed to be unique and positive?
   - Yes, the values are unique and positive.

3. **Output Format**:
   - Should the output be the root node of the constructed binary tree?
   - Yes, the output should be the root node of the constructed binary tree.

### Strategy

1. **Building the Tree**:
   - Use a map to keep track of each node and its children.
   - Use a set to keep track of all child nodes which will help in identifying the root (the root is not in the set of children).

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a map to hold `TreeNode` for every node value.
   - Create a set to keep track of child nodes.
   - Iterate through `descriptions` to populate the map and children set.
   - Iterate through the map to set the left and right children accordingly.
   - Determine the root by finding the element in the map that is not in the children set.
   - Return the root node.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

TreeNode* createBinaryTree(vector<vector<int>>& descriptions) {
    unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> nodes;
    unordered_set<int> children;

    // Step 1: Create all nodes and keep track of children
    for (const auto& desc : descriptions) {
        int parent = desc[0];
        int child = desc[1];
        int isLeft = desc[2];

        if (nodes.find(parent) == nodes.end()) {
            nodes[parent] = new TreeNode(parent);
        }
        if (nodes.find(child) == nodes.end()) {
            nodes[child] = new TreeNode(child);
        }

        children.insert(child);

        if (isLeft == 1) {
            nodes[parent]->left = nodes[child];
        } else {
            nodes[parent]->right = nodes[child];
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Find the root (it won't be in the children set)
    TreeNode* root = nullptr;
    for (const auto& node : nodes) {
        if (children.find(node.first) == children.end()) {
            root = node.second;
            break;
        }
    }

    return root;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Data Structures**:
  - `unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> nodes`: Maps each value to its corresponding TreeNode.
  - `unordered_set<int> children`: Keeps track of all nodes that are children.

- **Steps**:
  - Populate the `nodes` map and `children` set during the first loop through `descriptions`.
  - Set the left and right children appropriately in the nodes during the same loop.
  - Determine the root by identifying the node that does not appear in the `children` set.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the number of descriptions. Each description is processed in constant time, and finding the root node will also take linear time in the worst case.
