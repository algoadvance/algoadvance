[Leetcode 57. Insert Interval](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l57)
## Problem Statement

Given a set of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, insert a new interval `newInterval = [start, end]` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by start and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return the intervals after the insertion.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the intervals in `intervals` guaranteed to be sorted by their start values initially?
   - Yes, the intervals are initially sorted.

2. Can the `newInterval` overlap with multiple intervals in `intervals`?
   - Yes, it can overlap with multiple intervals.

3. What should be done if `newInterval` does not overlap with any of the intervals?
   - The `newInterval` should simply be inserted in its correct position to maintain the sorted order.

## Strategy

### Approach:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a result vector to store the final merged intervals.
   - Use two pointers to handle the intervals before and after the merge.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate through the given `intervals` and:
     - Add all intervals that end before the `newInterval` starts directly to the result.
     - Merge all intervals that overlap with `newInterval`, updating the `newInterval` to the merged interval's boundaries.
     - Add the rest of the intervals after the `newInterval` ends to the result.

3. **Insertion**:
   - If `newInterval` has not been added yet, add it to the result.

4. **Return the result**:
   - Return the updated list of intervals.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals in the `intervals` list. This is because each interval is processed exactly once.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int i = 0;
    int n = intervals.size();

    // Add all intervals that end before newInterval starts
    while (i < n && intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]) {
        result.push_back(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }

    // Merge all overlapping intervals with newInterval
    while (i < n && intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]) {
        newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0]);
        newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1]);
        i++;
    }
    result.push_back(newInterval);

    // Add all remaining intervals after newInterval
    while (i < n) {
        result.push_back(intervals[i]);
        i++;
    }

    return result;
}
```

This solution handles the insertion of the new interval by maintaining the sorted order and merging overlapping intervals into a single, unified interval. The result is a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start times.
