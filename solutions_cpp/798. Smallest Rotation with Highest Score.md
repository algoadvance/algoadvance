[Leetcode 798. Smallest Rotation with Highest Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l798)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 798: **Smallest Rotation with Highest Score**

Given an array `A`, we are allowed to perform a "rotation" action: choose an index `k` and shift the elements of the array starting from that index to the beginning while maintaining the order of remaining elements. Formally, rotation of elements around index `k` results in the array `A[k], A[k+1], ..., A[n-1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[k-1]`.

The "score" of an array is defined as the number of elements such that `A[i] <= i` where `i` is the index of the element in the rotated array. Your task is to determine the smallest index `k` that maximizes this score after rotation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, it can contain any integers.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the array size?**
   - It's guaranteed that `1 <= A.length <= 20000` and `0 <= A[i] < 20000`.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - Return the smallest index `k` that gives the highest score.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - If `A[i] <= i` in the original array, then after rotation, an element `A[j]` should have been `A[i]` in the original array such that `A[j] <= j`.
   - Managing scores directly could involve large computation time if done naively for all positions. We have to find a more efficient approach.

2. **Difference Array Approach**:
   - We'll use a difference array to calculate the effect of rotating at each position.
   - By precomputing the difference of the distances, we can determine the optimal rotation quickly.
     
3. **Steps**:
   - Create a `change` array which will store the difference in scores starting from no rotation.
   - Iterate through the given array and update the `change` array based on the position's effect.
   - Calculate the maximum score and determine the corresponding index.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int bestRotation(std::vector<int>& A) {
        int N = A.size();
        std::vector<int> change(N + 1, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            int low = (i - A[i] + 1 + N) % N;
            int high = (i + 1) % N;
            change[low]++;
            change[high]--;
            if (low > high) {
                change[0]++;
            }
        }
        
        int best_position = 0;
        int max_score = 0;
        int current_score = 0;

        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {
            current_score += change[k];
            if (current_score > max_score) {
                max_score = current_score;
                best_position = k;
            }
        }

        return best_position;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
  - We iterate through the array a constant number of times; thus, the solution is linear in relation to the size of the input array `N`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
  - We use an additional array `change` of size `N+1`, so the space complexity is linear.

This method efficiently computes the smallest rotation that maximizes the score using a combination of array traversal and auxiliary space for difference management.
