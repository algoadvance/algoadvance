[Leetcode 1696. Jump Game VI](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1696)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You are initially standing at index `0` and you want to reach the last index of the array. You can jump at most `k` steps forward at a time. The goal is to maximize your score, which is the sum of the values of the indices you visit.

Your score at index `i` is `nums[i]`. Return the maximum score you can achieve when you reach the last index of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` will contain at least one element.
   
2. **Can `k` be larger than the size of the array?**
   - No, `k` will be a valid positive integer such that `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values within the `nums` array?**
   - The values in `nums` are given by `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.

4. **Is there a guarantee that a valid path exists from the first index to the last index?**
   - Yes, as long as we can jump within the bounds specified by `k`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxResult(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        // dp[i] will store the maximum score to reach index i
        vector<int> dp(n);
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        
        // Deque to store indices of the useful elements
        deque<int> dq;
        dq.push_back(0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            // Remove elements out of the current window of size k
            if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() < i - k) {
                dq.pop_front();
            }
            
            // Calculate dp[i] using the maximum value in the deque
            dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[dq.front()];
            
            // Maintain the deque to store useful elements in decreasing order
            while (!dq.empty() && dp[i] >= dp[dq.back()]) {
                dq.pop_back();
            }
            
            dq.push_back(i);
        }
        
        return dp.back();
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Deque**:
   - Utilize a `deque` to keep track of the indices of the elements in the window of the last `k` elements that will give the maximum result.
   - Maintain the `dp` array where `dp[i]` denotes the maximum score to reach index `i`.
   - Start by initializing `dp[0]` to `nums[0]` because we start at index `0`.
   - Traverse the array, for each index `i`, use the maximum score from the last `k` steps to calculate the `dp[i]`.
   - Maintain the deque such that it always contains indices in non-increasing order of their corresponding `dp` values. This allows quick access to the maximum value within the sliding window.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.
  - Each index is pushed and popped from the deque at most once, making the operations linear in terms of the array size.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` to store the `dp` array and the deque.

This solution is efficient for the given constraints and guarantees optimal performance in terms of both time and space complexities.
