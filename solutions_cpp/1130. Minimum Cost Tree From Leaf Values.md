[Leetcode 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1130)
Sure, I'll guide you through solving the LeetCode problem "1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values" in C++. Let's start with the details.

### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:
1. Each node has either 0 or 2 children.
2. The values of `arr` are stored in the leaf nodes.
3. The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree.

Among all possible binary trees considered, find the smallest possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.

You are guaranteed that there will always be at least one tree that satisfies the conditions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the values in the array distinctly unique?
   - No, the values are not necessarily unique.
2. What is the maximum size of the array?
   - The length of the array can go up to 40.

### Strategy
To minimize the sum of the values of the non-leaf nodes, we can use a greedy approach because choosing the two smallest values to combine in each step will lead to the smallest overall product sum.

The approach can be implemented using a stack to maintain the minimum cost effectively. The steps would be:
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each number in the array.
   - While the stack has more than one element and the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current number, pop from the stack. Calculate the cost using the popped value and the minimum of the current number or the next top of the stack, and add it to the result.
   - Push the current number onto the stack.
3. Finally, reduce the stack to combine all remaining elements.

### Code
Here is the C++ code that implements the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int mctFromLeafValues(vector<int>& arr) {
        stack<int> st;
        int result = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            while (!st.empty() && st.top() <= num) {
                int mid = st.top();
                st.pop();
                if (st.empty()) {
                    result += mid * num;
                } else {
                    result += mid * min(st.top(), num);
                }
            }
            st.push(num);
        }

        while (st.size() > 1) {
            int top = st.top();
            st.pop();
            result += top * st.top();
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\) because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. Here, \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.

### Explanation
- We use a stack to maintain the sequence of leaves.
- For each element, we maintain elements in descending order in the stack.
- When we encounter a number greater than or equal to the stack's top, we compute the cost using the popped number and the minimum of the adjacent numbers (either the current number or the next top in the stack).
- After processing all elements in the array, we process any remaining elements in the stack to compute the final cost.

This approach ensures that we are always combining the smallest products first, leading to the minimum possible sum of non-leaf node values.
