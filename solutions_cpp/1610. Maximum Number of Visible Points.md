[Leetcode 1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1610)
Sure, let's walk through the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` refers to a point at coordinates (xi, yi) on a 2D plane. You also have another array `location` representing your location on the same 2D plane, and an integer `angle`. Your task is to determine the maximum number of points that are visible from your location, given that you have a viewing angle of `angle` degrees.

A point is considered visible if the angle from your viewing direction to the point is less than or equal to `angle`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do all points and the location have integer coordinates?**
   - Yes, both the points and location coordinates are integers.
2. **What's the range of the angle?**
   - The angle is between 0 and 360 degrees.
3. **Can there be points at the same location as the starting location?**
   - Yes, and these should automatically be considered as visible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can transform the visibility problem into an angular problem:

1. **Convert coordinates to angles**: Convert the (x, y) coordinates of each point relative to the location into an angle.
2. **Handle direct overlaps**: Directly count any points that coincide with the location (`location`).
3. **Sort and sweep**: Sort the angles and use a sliding window technique to find the maximum number of points that fit within the viewing angle.

### Code

Here is the code to achieve this:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int visiblePoints(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& points, int angle, std::vector<int>& location) {
        std::vector<double> angles;
        int same_location_count = 0;

        for (auto &point : points) {
            if (point[0] == location[0] && point[1] == location[1]) {
                same_location_count++;
                continue;
            }
            double deltaX = point[0] - location[0];
            double deltaY = point[1] - location[1];
            double angle = atan2(deltaY, deltaX) * 180 / M_PI;
            angles.push_back(angle);
        }

        std::sort(angles.begin(), angles.end());
        int n = angles.size();
        
        // Duplicate first angles to handle circular range
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            angles.push_back(angles[i] + 360);
        }

        int max_visible = 0;
        int j = 0;

        // Sliding window approach
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (j < angles.size() && angles[j] <= angles[i] + angle) {
                j++;
            }
            max_visible = std::max(max_visible, j - i);
        }

        return max_visible + same_location_count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading points**: We iterate over the list of points to convert each point to its angle relative to the `location`. Points that overlap with `location` are counted separately.
2. **Converting to angles**: Using the `atan2` function, we convert each point's coordinates to an angle in degrees.
3. **Sorting**: We sort the angles, and then we handle the circular nature of angles by duplicating the list with +360 degrees.
4. **Sliding window**: Using a sliding window, we count how many points fit within the visible angle `angle`.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the angles**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of points.
- **Sliding window sweep**: \(O(N)\), as each point is processed at most twice.

The overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\), which is efficient and expected given the need to sort the angles.
