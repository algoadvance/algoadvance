[Leetcode 2861. Maximum Number of Alloys](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2861)
## Problem Statement

You are given two matrices `composition` and `stock`, and a list `cost`.

The `composition[i][j]` indicates the amount of stock j needed to manufacture alloy i.

The `stock[j]` is the amount of stock j you currently have.

The `cost[j]` is the cost to acquire 1 unit of stock j.

Your goal is to manufacture the maximum number of alloys such that the sum of the costs does not exceed `budget`.

Write a function:
```cpp
int maxNumberOfAlloys(vector<vector<int>>& composition, vector<int>& stock, vector<int>& cost, int budget);
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume that the composition, stock, and cost vectors are non-negative integers?
2. Is `budget` an integer?
3. Will there always be a feasible solution?

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Inputs and Outputs**:
    - `composition`: Matrix of size `m x n` where `m` is the number of types of alloys and `n` is the number of types of stocks.
    - `stock`: Vector of size `n`, representing the current amount of each type of stock.
    - `cost`: Vector of size `n`, showing the cost of each unit of stock.
    - `budget`: The maximum cost we can afford to spend to obtain the required stocks.

2. **Approach**:
    - The goal is to compute how many of each type of alloy we can manufacture given the constraints.
    - For each type of alloy, calculate if we can manufacture one unit within the given budget by checking the composition against the stock.
    - When the stock is insufficient, calculate how much more is required and if it fits within the remaining budget.
    - Sum up the cost in real-time and check if the budget is exceeded or not.

3. **Steps**:
    - For each type of alloy, calculate the number of alloys that can be manufactured.
    - If additional stock is needed, calculate the cost and update the budget.
    - Track the maximum number of alloys that can be manufactured without exceeding the budget for each type and return the maximum number possible.

4. **Time Complexity**:
    - We need to iterate through each alloy type and for each type, iterate through each stock type once, making it O(m * n).

## Code

Here is the implementation of the described approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxNumberOfAlloys(vector<vector<int>>& composition, vector<int>& stock, vector<int>& cost, int budget) {
    int m = composition.size();
    int n = stock.size();
    int max_alloys = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { // for each type of alloy
        int low = 0, high = INT_MAX;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            int needed_stock = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                long long total_needed = (long long)composition[i][j] * mid;
                if (stock[j] < total_needed) {
                    needed_stock += (total_needed - stock[j]) * cost[j];
                }
                if (needed_stock > budget) {
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (needed_stock <= budget) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        max_alloys = max(max_alloys, low - 1);
    }

    return max_alloys;
}
```

- **Explanation**: For each type of alloy, we perform a binary search to determine the maximum number of units we can manufacture within the budget constraints. In each iteration of the binary search, the total required amount of each stock is calculated to determine if it's affordable based on the budget.

- **Time Complexity**: The binary search runs in \(O(\log k)\), where \(k\) is a large number (usually a practical limit based on constraints). Since it does this for each of the \(m\) alloys and checks all \(n\) resource types per iteration, the overall complexity becomes \(O(m \cdot n \cdot \log k)\).
