[Leetcode 2068. Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2068)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, a string `word1` is almost equivalent to `word2` if the differences between the frequencies of each character from `a` to `z` between `word1` and `word2` is at most 3. Formally, for all characters `c`, `|frequency(c, word1) - frequency(c, word2)| <= 3`.

Return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are almost equivalent, otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the lengths of the strings? (Both word lengths are between 1 and 100, inclusive.)
2. Are the strings composed only of lowercase English letters? (Yes)

## Strategy
1. **Character Frequency Count**: We'll count the frequency of each character in both `word1` and `word2`.
2. **Comparison**: We'll then compare the frequency of each character. If the absolute difference at any point exceeds 3, we'll return `false`.
3. **Initialization**: Use two arrays of size 26 (for each letter of the alphabet) to store the character frequencies of `word1` and `word2`.
4. **Efficiency**: This approach ensures linear time complexity, `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the longest string since the counting is done in a single pass through each string.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath> // for abs

bool checkAlmostEquivalent(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
    std::vector<int> freq1(26, 0); // Frequency array for word1
    std::vector<int> freq2(26, 0); // Frequency array for word2

    // Count character frequencies for word1
    for(char c : word1) {
        freq1[c - 'a']++;
    }

    // Count character frequencies for word2
    for(char c : word2) {
        freq2[c - 'a']++;
    }

    // Check the absolute difference in frequencies
    for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if(std::abs(freq1[i] - freq2[i]) > 3) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    std::string word1 = "aabbcc";
    std::string word2 = "abbbccc";
    bool result = checkAlmostEquivalent(word1, word2);
    std::cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Frequency Arrays**: We use `freq1` and `freq2` to keep track of the frequencies of characters in `word1` and `word2`.
- **Counting Frequencies**: Iterate through each character in `word1` and `word2`, updating the respective frequency array.
- **Checking Differences**: Loop through the frequency arrays, comparing the frequencies of corresponding characters. If any character's frequency difference exceeds 3, return `false`.
- **Final Check**: If no differences exceed 3, return `true`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`. This is because:
- We traverse each string once to count character frequencies (`O(n)` for `word1` and `O(m)` for `word2`).
- We then perform a constant-time check over the fixed-size frequency arrays (26 elements), which is `O(26)` or simply `O(1)`.

In conclusion, the overall complexity is linear with respect to the input size.
