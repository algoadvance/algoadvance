[Leetcode 1147. Longest Chunked Palindrome Decomposition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1147)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `text`, you should partition it into several parts such that each part is a chunk and forms a palindrome by concatenating two of them. The goal is to minimize the number of chunks:

A chunk is defined as a substring that appears the same when read forward or backward.

Return the largest possible number of chunks such that each chunk is a palindrome.

### Example
- Example 1:
  ```text
  Input: "ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi"
  Output: 7
  Explanation: We can split the string into 7 chunks as follows: "ghi", "abcdef", "hello", "adam", "hello", "abcdef", "ghi".
  ```
- Example 2:
  ```text
  Input: "merchant"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The whole string itself is the longest chunk.
  ```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string be empty? 
2. What is the expected output if the string is already a palindrome?
3. Are there any restrictions on the character set of the input string?
4. What is the length range of the input string?

### Strategy

The problem essentially asks for finding the largest number of palindrome partitions possible for the given string. Here is a strategy we can follow to solve it with a greedy approach:

1. Use two pointers, one starting from the left (`left`) and one from the right (`right`).
2. Start comparing substrings from the left and right:
   - Start by considering equal lengths from both ends and compare them.
   - If they match, increment the counter for chunks and move the pointers inward accordingly.
3. Continue this process until the pointers cross each other.
4. There might be some middle parts left, which could also be a single chunk.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int longestDecomposition(std::string text) {
    int n = text.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    int chunks = 0;

    std::string leftSubstr = "", rightSubstr = "";

    while (left <= right) {
        leftSubstr += text[left];
        rightSubstr = text[right] + rightSubstr;

        if (leftSubstr == rightSubstr) {
            chunks++;
            leftSubstr = "";
            rightSubstr = "";
        }

        left++;
        right--;
    }

    // If some part in the middle is remaining
    if (!leftSubstr.empty()) {
        return chunks + 1;
    }

    return chunks;
}

int main() {
    std::string text1 = "ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi";
    std::string text2 = "merchant";
    
    std::cout << "Result for '" << text1 << "': " << longestDecomposition(text1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Result for '" << text2 << "': " << longestDecomposition(text2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this algorithm is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input string. Each character in the string is checked at most once due to the two-pointer approach.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the additional space used for `leftSubstr` and `rightSubstr`.

This strategy ensures that we maximize the number of palindrome chunks by comparing the substrings from the ends towards the center, which is optimal for this problem setup.
