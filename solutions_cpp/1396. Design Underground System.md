[Leetcode 1396. Design Underground System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1396)
## Problem Statement

Design a system to manage customer check-ins and check-outs on an underground subway system. You need to implement the `UndergroundSystem` class:

- `void checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)`:
   - A customer with ID `id`, checks in at the station `stationName` at time `t`.
   - A customer can only be checked into one place at a time.

- `void checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)`:
   - A customer with ID `id`, checks out from the station `stationName` at time `t`.

- `double getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)`:
   - Returns the average time it takes to travel between the `startStation` and the `endStation`.
   - The average time is computed based on all the previous check-ins and check-outs that happened between the two stations.

You may assume that all queries are consistent and they come in chronological order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Unique IDs**: Can we assume that each customer's ID is unique at any given time and does not interfere with others?
   - Yes, each customer has a unique ID during their trip.

2. **Inputs Range**: What are the ranges of IDs and time values?
   - IDs and time values are reasonably large within typical constraints of such problems (e.g., IDs ranging from 1 to \(10^6\), and times being within a typical day's operations).

3. **Concurrency**: Do we need to worry about handling concurrent check-ins/check-outs?
   - No, there is no mention of concurrency concerns; you can assume all operations are sequential.

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

class UndergroundSystem {
private:
    // Maps to keep track of check-ins
    std::unordered_map<int, std::pair<std::string, int>> checkInMap;
    // Maps to keep the total time and the number of trips between each station pair
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unordered_map<std::string, std::pair<long long, int>>> journeyMap;

public:
    UndergroundSystem() {}

    void checkIn(int id, std::string stationName, int t) {
        checkInMap[id] = {stationName, t};
    }

    void checkOut(int id, std::string stationName, int t) {
        auto checkInData = checkInMap[id];
        std::string startStation = checkInData.first;
        int startTime = checkInData.second;
        int travelTime = t - startTime;

        // Remove the check-in entry once checked out
        checkInMap.erase(id);

        // Update the journey map with the new travel time
        journeyMap[startStation][stationName].first += travelTime;
        journeyMap[startStation][stationName].second += 1;
    }

    double getAverageTime(std::string startStation, std::string endStation) {
        auto journeyData = journeyMap[startStation][endStation];
        long long totalTime = journeyData.first;
        int totalTrips = journeyData.second;
        return static_cast<double>(totalTime) / totalTrips;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use an unordered_map (`checkInMap`) to track users' check-in information. This will allow constant time complexity for insertion and retrieval.
   - Use a nested unordered_map (`journeyMap`) to store the cumulative travel times and trip counts for each station pair.

2. **Operations**:
   - **checkIn**: Store the user ID along with their check-in station and time.
   - **checkOut**: Retrieve and remove the user's check-in details, calculate the travel time, and update the journey statistics for the corresponding station pair.
   - **getAverageTime**: Compute the average travel time by dividing the total accumulated time by the number of trips stored in `journeyMap`.

## Time Complexity

- **checkIn**: \(O(1)\)
- **checkOut**: \(O(1)\)
- **getAverageTime**: \(O(1)\)

Each operation only requires accessing and updating hash tables which operate in constant time on average.
