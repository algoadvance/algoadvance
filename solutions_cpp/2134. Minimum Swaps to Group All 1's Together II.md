## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2134: Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

Given a binary circular array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together in any place in the circular array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array's length?**
   - The array length can be from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **Should the solution consider edge cases such as arrays that are already grouped by 1's, or arrays full of 0's or 1's?**
   - Yes, the solution should handle these edge cases.

3. **How do we define a swap in this context?**
   - A swap is switching two elements' positions within the array.

## Strategy

1. **Count the total number of 1's in the array.**
   - This helps determine the size of the window we need to slide.
   
2. **Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of 1's in any window of that size.**
   - By determining how many 1's can be maximized within any window of length equal to the count of total 1's, we can determine the number of 0's present in that window, which gives us the minimum swaps needed.
   
3. **Handle the circular nature of the array using extended array indexing.**
   - By "extending" the array to `nums.length * 2 - 1`, we can simulate the circular array behavior in a straightforward manner without actual circular indexing.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int total_ones = std::count(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 1);
        
        // If there are no 1's, no swaps are needed
        if (total_ones == 0) return 0;
        
        // Find the maximum number of 1's in any window of length total_ones
        int max_ones_in_window = 0, current_ones = 0;
        
        // Sum 1's in the first window
        for (int i = 0; i < total_ones; ++i) {
            current_ones += nums[i];
        }
        
        max_ones_in_window = current_ones;
        
        // Sliding the window
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            // Slide the window: remove the effect of the element that's sliding out and add the element that's sliding in
            current_ones = current_ones - nums[i - 1] + nums[(i + total_ones - 1) % n];
            max_ones_in_window = std::max(max_ones_in_window, current_ones);
        }
        
        // Minimum swaps will be the number of 0's in the largest 1's window
        return total_ones - max_ones_in_window;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
   - Counting total 1's takes \(O(n)\).
   - Sliding the window once over the array takes \(O(n)\).
   
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - The space used does not depend on the input size significantly, only a few extra variables are used.
