[Leetcode 89. Gray Code](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l89)
## Problem Statement
The problem is to generate a sequence of Gray codes for a given number `n`.

Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

For a given integer `n`, generate the sequence of `2^n` Gray codes. A Gray code sequence must begin with 0.

### Example:
For `n = 2`, the Gray code sequence is `[0, 1, 3, 2]`. Note that:
- `0` in binary is `00`
- `1` in binary is `01`
- `3` in binary is `11`
- `2` in binary is `10`
where consecutive numbers differ by only one bit.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the output Gray codes be in binary format or in decimal format?
   - The output should be in decimal format as shown in the example.
2. Is there any specific order in which the Gray code sequence should be returned?
   - Yes, the sequence should start with 0 and any two successive values in the sequence should differ by exactly one bit.

## Strategy
To generate Gray codes for a given integer `n`, we can use the following approach:
1. Use the bit manipulation method to convert binary numbers to Gray code numbers.
2. For an integer `i` (where `0 <= i < 2^n`), the i-th Gray code can be obtained by using the formula:
   ```
   gray(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)
   ```
   Here, `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operator, and `>>` denotes right shift.

## Code
Let's implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        std::vector<int> result;
        int totalNumbers = 1 << n; // 2^n
        for (int i = 0; i < totalNumbers; ++i) {
            result.push_back(i ^ (i >> 1));
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Explanation of Code
1. **Initialization**: We declare a vector `result` to store the Gray codes.
2. **Total Numbers**: The total number of Gray codes for `n` bits is `2^n`, which is computed using `1 << n`.
3. **Generating Gray Codes**:
   - For each integer `i` from `0` to `2^n - 1`, compute the Gray code using the formula `i ^ (i >> 1)`.
   - Append the resulting Gray code to the `result` vector.
4. **Return Result**: Finally, return the `result` vector containing the Gray codes.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(2^n). This is because we generate `2^n` Gray codes, and each operation inside the loop (bitwise XOR and right shift) takes constant time, O(1). Hence, the overall time complexity is O(2^n).
