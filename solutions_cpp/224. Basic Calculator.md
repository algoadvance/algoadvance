[Leetcode 224. Basic Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l224)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string that contains:
- Non-negative integers
- The operators `+`, `-`
- Parentheses `(` and `)`
- The expression string contains only non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `(`, `)`, and empty spaces.

You need to return the integer result of the expression.

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "1 + 1"`
   Output: `2`
2. Input: `s = " 2-1 + 2 "`
   Output: `3`
3. Input: `s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"`
   Output: `23`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. How should we handle invalid input strings?
   - Assume the input is always a valid expression.
2. Can the expression string contain multiple digit numbers?
   - Yes.
3. Are there other operators like `*`, `/`, or power involved?
   - No, the problem only involves `+` and `-`.

## Strategy:
We'll use a stack-based approach to handle the parentheses and maintain the computation of `+` and `-` operations. The main steps are:
1. Initialize a stack to keep track of the results and the signs.
2. Iterate over the string `s` and for each character:
   - If it's a digit, construct the whole number.
   - If it's a `+` or `-`, update the result with the last sign and reset the sign to the current one.
   - If it’s an opening parenthesis `(`, push the result and the sign onto the stack and reset them.
   - If it’s a closing parenthesis `)`, pop from the stack and update the result.
3. Do the final addition/subtraction to get the result after the loop ends.

## Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int calculate(string s) {
    stack<int> stk;
    int result = 0;
    int sign = 1;
    int n = s.length();
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        char ch = s[i];
        
        if(isdigit(ch)) {
            int num = 0;
            while(i < n && isdigit(s[i])) {
                num = num * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
                i++;
            }
            i--;
            result += sign * num;
        } else if(ch == '+') {
            sign = 1;
        } else if(ch == '-') {
            sign = -1;
        } else if(ch == '(') {
            stk.push(result);
            stk.push(sign);
            result = 0;
            sign = 1;
        } else if(ch == ')') {
            result = stk.top() * result; // Pop the sign
            stk.pop();
            result += stk.top(); // Pop the result
            stk.pop();
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string expression = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)";
    cout << calculate(expression) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is **O(N)**, where `N` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(N)** as well, in the worst case using the stack to store intermediate results and signs for each nested parenthesis level.
