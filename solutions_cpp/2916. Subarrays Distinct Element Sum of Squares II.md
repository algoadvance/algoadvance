[Leetcode 2916. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2916)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of length `n`. Find the sum of squares of the number of distinct elements in every subarray of `nums`. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Let's assume that `n` can be up to \(10^5\).

2. **What are the possible values of elements in `nums`?**
   - Assume they can be any integer within the range of standard C++ integers.

3. **Are there any specific constraints we should be aware of?**
   - Efficient computation is necessary given the possible size of `n`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<int> distinct_elements_length_squares(const vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> distinctSumSquares(n + 1, 0);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        int distinctCount = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            if (freqMap[nums[j]] == 0) {
                distinctCount++;
            }
            freqMap[nums[j]]++;
            distinctSumSquares[j - i + 1] += distinctCount * distinctCount;
        }
    }
    
    return distinctSumSquares;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 4, 3, 2};
    vector<int> result = distinct_elements_length_squares(nums);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < result.size(); ++i) {
        cout << "Length " << i << ": " << result[i] << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Task**: We need to compute the sum of squares of the number of distinct elements for every possible subarray in `nums`.

2. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Iterate over each starting point of the subarray.
   - For each starting point, iterate over each possible endpoint.
   - Keep track of the distinct elements in a hash map and compute the square of the count of distinct elements for each subarray, accumulating these values.

3. **Optimizations**:
   - This brute-force approach checks every subarray explicitly, which yields a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\) â€” that's not feasible for large values of `n`.
   - Consider optimizing using two-pointer technique or a sliding window approach to reduce redundant calculations.

## Time Complexity

- **Current Solution**:
  - The nested loops (i, j) result in \(O(n^2)\) iterations.
  - Within each pair of i, j, updating the frequency map takes up to \(O(n)\).
  - This gives a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\), which is not efficient.

## Possible Optimizations

- Using a sliding window approach could reduce the interaction count within the inner loop, potentially reducing overall complexity.
- Using data structures like `unordered_set` and `sliding window` can help achieve better time complexities.

For actual interview scenarios, this solution provides a starting point but asks for further optimization for larger inputs.
