[Leetcode 2570. Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2570)
### Problem Statement

Given two 2D integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each array contains elements in the form `[id, val]` where:
- `id` is a unique identifier,
- `val` is the value associated with the identifier.

Merge these two arrays such that the resulting array contains unique `id`s and sums the `val` for any `id` that appears in both arrays. The resulting array should be sorted by `id`.

**Example:**

```cpp
Input: nums1 = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5]], nums2 = [[1, 3], [2, 1], [3, 2]]
Output: [[1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 2], [4, 5]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Validation:** Can we assume that inputs are always well-formed (i.e., no negative `id`s, no missing `id` or `val`, etc.)?
2. **Ordering of `id`s:** Should the input lists be considered pre-sorted, or can they be unordered? (Clarification: In the resulting array, `id`s must be sorted.)

### Strategy
1. **Use a Map:** Utilize an unordered map (or map) to store the `id` as key and the `val` as the cumulative value.
2. **Iterate and Aggregate:** Iterate over both arrays, updating the map's values by summing up for the same `id`s.
3. **Convert to Vector:** Convert the map back to a vector of pairs.
4. **Sort the Result:** Sort the resulting vector by `id`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> mergeArrays(vector<vector<int>>& nums1, vector<vector<int>>& nums2) {
    unordered_map<int, int> idMap;

    // Aggregate values from nums1
    for (const auto& pair : nums1) {
        idMap[pair[0]] += pair[1];
    }

    // Aggregate values from nums2
    for (const auto& pair : nums2) {
        idMap[pair[0]] += pair[1];
    }

    vector<vector<int>> result;
    for (const auto& entry : idMap) {
        result.push_back({entry.first, entry.second});
    }

    // Sort by id
    sort(result.begin(), result.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[0] < b[0];
    });

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Insertion into Map:** O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`.
- **Conversion to Vector:** O(k) where `k` is the number of unique ids.
- **Sorting:** O(k log k), where `k` is the number of unique ids (because it is sorted by `id`).
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n + m + k log k)

This solution efficiently aggregates and sorts the values, making it suitable for this kind of merging task. By using an unordered map, we ensure an average case constant time complexity for insertions and lookups.
