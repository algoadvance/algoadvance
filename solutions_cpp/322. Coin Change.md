[Leetcode 322. Coin Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l322)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Negative Amount:** Can `amount` be negative? 
   - No, the amount is always non-negative.
2. **Empty Coins Array:** Could the `coins` array be empty?
   - Yes, the array could be empty. In such cases, if the amount is greater than 0, the output should be `-1`.

## Strategy
We'll use dynamic programming to solve the problem. We'll initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to get the amount `i`. The size of the `dp` array will be `amount + 1` (to include `0`).

1. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` because 0 coins are needed to make the amount of 0.
2. For all other amounts, initialize `dp[i] = amount + 1` which signifies that initially, we assume it's impossible to make that amount.
3. Traverse from `1` to `amount`:
   - For each coin in the list, if the amount is greater than or equal to the coin value, update the minimum coins needed. This can be done using the formula:
     ```cpp
     dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
     ```
4. Finally, check the `dp[amount]`. If it's still `amount + 1`, return `-1` (impossible to form the amount), otherwise, return `dp[amount]`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(n * amount)`, where `n` is the number of different coins.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(std::vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        if (coins.empty()) {
            return amount == 0 ? 0 : -1;
        }

        std::vector<int> dp(amount + 1, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0; // Base case: It takes 0 coins to make amount 0

        for (int i = 1; i <= amount; ++i) {
            for (const int &coin : coins) {
                if (i - coin >= 0) {
                    dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};
```

This code first checks if the coins array is empty and handles that case accordingly. Then it initializes the `dp` array and fills it using a nested loop. Finally, it checks if it's possible to form the required amount and returns the result.
