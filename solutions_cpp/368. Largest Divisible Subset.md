[Leetcode 368. Largest Divisible Subset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l368)
## Problem Statement

Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

``` 
Si % Sj == 0 or Sj % Si == 0
```

If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all elements in the input array distinct?
   - Yes, confirmed by the problem statement.
2. Can the input array be empty? What should be the output in that case?
   - Yes, if the input array is empty, the output should be an empty subset.
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   - No specific constraints are given, but typical constraints for LeetCode problems usually apply.

## Strategy

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. **Sort the array**: Begin by sorting the array. This allows us to more easily check the divisibility conditions progressively.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array Setup**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset ending with `nums[i]`.
3. **Previous Index Tracker**: Use an array to track the previous index in the largest subset for reconstruction purposes.
4. **DP array Update**: Update the DP array by iterating over each element and checking all previous elements for divisibility.
5. **Reconstruct the Largest Subset**: Use the DP values and previous index tracker to reconstruct the largest subset from the DP table.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> largestDivisibleSubset(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return {};
    
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    std::vector<int> dp(n, 1);
    std::vector<int> prev(n, -1);

    int maxSubsetSize = 1;
    int maxSubsetIndex = 0;

    // Fill dp and prev arrays
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (nums[i] % nums[j] == 0 && dp[i] < dp[j] + 1) {
                dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
                prev[i] = j;
            }
        }
        if (dp[i] > maxSubsetSize) {
            maxSubsetSize = dp[i];
            maxSubsetIndex = i;
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct the largest subset
    std::vector<int> largestSubset;
    for (int i = maxSubsetIndex; i >= 0; i = prev[i]) {
        largestSubset.push_back(nums[i]);
        if (prev[i] == i) break;
    }

    std::reverse(largestSubset.begin(), largestSubset.end());
    return largestSubset;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **DP Updates**: \(O(n^2)\) due to nested loop over the elements.
- **Reconstructing Subset**: \(O(n)\)

### Overall Time Complexity
The combined time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which is dominated by the dynamic programming update steps.
