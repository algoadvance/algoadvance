[Leetcode 1591. Strange Printer II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1591)
Sure, let's go through this problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

The problem "Strange Printer II" involves a 2D grid of integers (representing colors) and a strange printer that is capable of printing one color at a time but can only print connected blocks of the same color.

Given such a grid, the task is to determine if it's possible to print the grid using the strange printer, obeying these rules:
1. Each color must be printed as a single contiguous block of the same color.
2. The printer can print colors in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, let's clarify a few points:

1. Can the input grid contain negative numbers or zeros? (Assume it contains only positive integers representing different colors)
2. Do we have constraints about the grid dimensions? (Assume the grid can be of any reasonable size)
3. Do we care about the order in which the colors are printed? (No, any order that builds the grid correctly is acceptable)
4. Are all the "colors" continuous blocks in the grid or not necessarily so? (Not necessarily so; we need to check them)
5. Should we consider any specific edge cases like an empty grid or all cells having the same color? (Yes, handle edge cases as usual)

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to check if it's possible to overlay the colors in such a way that each color forms a contiguous block. Here's a strategy for achieving this:

1. Identify all the distinct colors in the grid.
2. For each color, determine the bounding rectangle that encloses all occurrences of that color.
3. Ensure that for these bounding rectangles, no other color intersects within the bounding rectangle of any color. This can be simplified to checking that each color is printed such that it forms a contiguous block and no other color is printed before finishing areas that belong to the current color.

### Approach

- Extract all distinct colors from the grid.
- For each color, find the minimum and maximum rows and columns it occupies to form its bounding rectangle.
- Check if for each color, this bounding rectangle is isolated (does not include any other color).

### Code

Below is the C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPrintable(vector<vector<int>>& targetGrid) {
        int m = targetGrid.size();
        int n = targetGrid[0].size();
        
        // Step 1: Identify all distinct colors and their bounding rectangles
        vector<int> minRow(61, m), maxRow(61, -1), minCol(61, n), maxCol(61, -1);
        unordered_set<int> colors;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int color = targetGrid[i][j];
                colors.insert(color);
                minRow[color] = min(minRow[color], i);
                maxRow[color] = max(maxRow[color], i);
                minCol[color] = min(minCol[color], j);
                maxCol[color] = max(maxCol[color], j);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Check if each color can form a contiguous block
        // Set to perform topological sorting
        unordered_set<int> printed;
        while (!colors.empty()) {
            bool flag = false;
            for (auto it = colors.begin(); it != colors.end();) {
                int color = *it;
                bool canPrint = true;
                // Check if color can be printed in complete
                for (int i = minRow[color]; i <= maxRow[color]; ++i) {
                    for (int j = minCol[color]; j <= maxCol[color]; ++j) {
                        if (targetGrid[i][j] != color && printed.find(targetGrid[i][j]) == printed.end()) {
                            canPrint = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (!canPrint) break;
                }
                if (canPrint) {
                    for (int i = minRow[color]; i <= maxRow[color]; ++i) {
                        for (int j = minCol[color]; j <= maxCol[color]; ++j) {
                            if (targetGrid[i][j] == color) {
                                targetGrid[i][j] = 0; // Marking printed area
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    printed.insert(color);
                    it = colors.erase(it);
                    flag = true;
                } else {
                    ++it;
                }
            }
            if (!flag) return false; // If no color can be printed in whole in any iteration
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(K \times m \times n) \), where \( K \) is the number of distinct colors, and \( m \times n \) is the size of the grid. This complexity arises because we might need to check the entire grid for each color in the worst case.

Overall, the outlined strategy and code should handle various edge cases efficiently.
