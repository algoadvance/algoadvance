[Leetcode 732. My Calendar III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l732)
## Problem Statement
You are asked to implement a class `MyCalendarThree` to keep track of your calendar events. The class should have two methods:
1. `void book(int start, int end)`: Books an event from `start` to `end`.
2. `int getMaxBooking()`: Returns the maximum number of overlapping events at any given time.

*Example:*
```cpp
MyCalendarThree myCalendar;
myCalendar.book(10, 20);  // returns 1
myCalendar.book(50, 60);  // returns 1
myCalendar.book(10, 40);  // returns 2
myCalendar.book(5, 15);   // returns 3
myCalendar.book(5, 10);   // returns 3
myCalendar.book(25, 55);  // returns 3
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the events share the same start and end time?
2. Is the `getMaxBooking` method supposed to return the highest number of overlapping events after each new event has been booked?
3. What is the parameter range for the start and end times?

Assuming:
1. Events can have the same start and end time, implying an inclusive-exclusive interval.
2. Yes, the `getMaxBooking` method should provide overlap info after each booking.
3. Time values (`start`, `end`) are within integers.

## Strategy
To solve the problem of finding the maximum number of overlapping events, we can use a **sweep line algorithm** with an `ordered map` to keep track of changes at each time point:

1. Use an ordered map (`std::map<int, int>`) to record the changes in event times:
   - Increment the counter at the start time of an event.
   - Decrement the counter at the end time of an event.
2. Iterate through the map to calculate the maximum number of overlaps (ongoing events).

## Code
Here is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

class MyCalendarThree {
private:
    map<int, int> events;
    
public:
    MyCalendarThree() {}
    
    void book(int start, int end) {
        events[start]++;
        events[end]--;
    }
    
    int getMaxBooking() {
        int maxBooking = 0;
        int currentBooking = 0;
        
        for (const auto &event : events) {
            currentBooking += event.second;
            if (currentBooking > maxBooking) {
                maxBooking = currentBooking;
            }
        }
        
        return maxBooking;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyCalendarThree myCalendar;
    cout << myCalendar.book(10, 20) << endl; // 1
    cout << myCalendar.book(50, 60) << endl; // 1
    cout << myCalendar.book(10, 40) << endl; // 2
    cout << myCalendar.book(5, 15) << endl;  // 3
    cout << myCalendar.book(5, 10) << endl;  // 3
    cout << myCalendar.book(25, 55) << endl; // 3
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. Booking an event (`book` method) involves inserting two entries into the `map`, each operation is O(log N) where N is the number of unique times in the calendar.
2. To get the maximum number of overlapping events (`getMaxBooking` method), we traverse through all unique times, which is O(N) in the worst case, where N is the number of unique times.

Thus, each call to `book` is O(log N) and each call to `getMaxBooking` after booking is O(N).
