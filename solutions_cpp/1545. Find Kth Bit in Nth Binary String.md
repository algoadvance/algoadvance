[Leetcode 1545. Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1545)
### Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, the objective is to find the `k`th bit in the `n`th binary string. The binary string is constructed as follows:
* `S1 = "0"`
* `Si = Si-1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Si-1))` for `i > 1`

where the `+` operator denotes string concatenation, `reverse(x)` means reversing the string `x`, and `invert(x)` means inverting each bit in the string `x` (changing '0' to '1' and '1' to '0').

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on `n` and `k`?
   - `n` is between `1` and `20`.
   - `1 <= k <= 2^n - 1`.
2. **Output**: Should the output be the integer value of the bit (0 or 1)?
   - Yes, the output should be 0 or 1.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Construction**: Understand how the binary string for a given `n` is constructed step by step using the given formula.
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Instead of constructing the entire string (which can be very large for `n` around 20), use the properties of inversion and reversal to determine the bit at position `k` directly.
3. **Recursive Bit Finding**:
    - If `k` is in the first half, it's the same as the `k`th bit in `n-1`.
    - If `k` is exactly in the middle, it's always `1`.
    - If `k` is in the second half, it relates to `n-1` but needs both inversion and reversing.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findKthBit(int n, int k) {
        return findKthBitHelper(n, k);
    }

private:
    char findKthBitHelper(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return '0';
        }

        int length = (1 << n) - 1; // Length of Sn: 2^n - 1
        int mid = (length >> 1) + 1; // Midpoint of Sn: 2^(n-1)

        if (k == mid) {
            return '1'; // The middle bit is always '1'
        } else if (k < mid) {
            return findKthBitHelper(n - 1, k);
        } else {
            int mirrored_k = mid - (k - mid);
            char bit = findKthBitHelper(n - 1, mirrored_k);
            return (bit == '0') ? '1' : '0'; // Invert the bit
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Recursive Approach**: Each recursive step reduces `n` by 1, leading to a maximum of `n` levels of recursion.
    - The recursive calls' time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the given integer representing the level of binary string construction.
    - Space complexity for the recursion stack is also O(n).

This solution efficiently finds the `k`th bit without needing to construct the entire binary string for large `n`.
