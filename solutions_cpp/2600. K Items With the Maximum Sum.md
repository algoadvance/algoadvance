[Leetcode 2600. K Items With the Maximum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2600)
### Problem Statement

You are given three integers `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes`. You are tasked with constructing an array that consists of exactly:
- `numOnes` instances of `1`
- `numZeros` instances of `0`
- `numNegOnes` instances of `-1`

You also have an integer `k`. The array constructed should be of length `numOnes + numZeros + numNegOnes`.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of any subarray of length `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `k` be larger than the total length of the array?
    - No, the problem guarantees that `k` will be less than or equal to the sum of `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes`.
2. Can `k` be zero?
    - No, `k` will be at least 1 according to the problem constraints.
3. Are the values of `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes` guaranteed to be non-negative?
    - Yes, these values are non-negative integers.

### Strategy
To maximize the sum of a subarray of length `k`, we need to include as many `1`s as possible since `1` is the highest value in the given elements. Our strategy would be:
1. Use as many `1`s as possible up to `k`.
2. If `k` is larger than `numOnes`, then use zero `0`s until enough if there are remaining positions.
3. If there are still positions left after considering `1`s and `0`s, use `-1`s to fill the rest.

This strategy ensures that the maximum sum is achieved.

### Time Complexity
The solution involves simple arithmetic operations based on the values of `k`, `numOnes`, `numZeros`, and `numNegOnes`, making the time complexity O(1).

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kItemsWithMaximumSum(int numOnes, int numZeros, int numNegOnes, int k) {
        // Use as many 1's as possible
        if (k <= numOnes) {
            return k; // since all k elements will be 1's
        }
        
        // Use all 1's and then check next
        k -= numOnes;
        int sum = numOnes; // all used 1's contribute to the sum
        
        // Use 0's, they do not affect the sum
        if (k <= numZeros) {
            return sum; // remaining elements are 0's
        }
        
        // Use all 0's and then check next
        k -= numZeros;
        
        // Use -1's, each -1 decreases the sum
        sum -= k; // remaining elements are all -1's
        
        return sum;
    }
};
```

This code will correctly produce the maximum sum of a subarray of length `k` by following the steps outlined in the strategy above.
