[Leetcode 2211. Count Collisions on a Road](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2211)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `directions` representing the directions of n cars traveling on a one-lane road. The `i`-th character in `directions` can be one of three values:

- 'L' : A car moving to the left.
- 'R' : A car moving to the right.
- 'S' : A car standing still.

A collision occurs when a moving car collides with a standing car or another moving car coming from the opposite direction. When two cars collide, they become stationary.

Return the number of collisions that will happen on the road.

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: directions = "RLRSLL"
Output: 5
Explanation:
- The first car collides with the second car (R<->L), and both become stationary.
- The fourth and fifth cars collide (R<->S), and the fourth car becomes stationary.
- The fifth and sixth cars collide (S<->L), and the sixth car becomes stationary.
- A total of 5 collisions occur (1 for the first pair and 4 for the last pair).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: directions = "LLRR"
Output: 0
Explanation:
No collisions occur because cars moving to the left and right never meet.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string be empty?
    - No, `directions` is guaranteed to have at least one character.
2. Are the cars always moving in one initial direction or can they start stationary?
    - They can be moving in any of the three directions including stationary ('S').

## Strategy

1. Traverse the string `directions` to count the collisions.
   - If we encounter a 'L' after 'R', it's an immediate collision, and both become stationary.
   - If we encounter 'R' followed by 'S', the 'R' car becomes stationary.
   - If we encounter 'S' followed by 'L', the 'L' car becomes stationary.
   - If 'R' clusters collide with 'L', count the collisions accordingly.

2. Start with a collision counter set to zero.

3. Use a two-pointer approach or a single loop to detect these conditions and update the counter accordingly.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int countCollisions(string directions) {
    int collisions = 0;
    int n = directions.size();
    bool movingRight = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (directions[i] == 'R') {
            movingRight = true;
        } else if (directions[i] == 'L') {
            if (movingRight) {
                collisions += 2;
                movingRight = false;
            }
        } else if (directions[i] == 'S') {
            if (movingRight) {
                collisions++;
                movingRight = false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    movingRight = false;

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (directions[i] == 'L') {
            movingRight = false;
        } else if (directions[i] == 'R') {
            if (!movingRight) {
                collisions++;
                movingRight = true;
            }
        } else if (directions[i] == 'S') {
            movingRight = false;
        }
    }

    return collisions;
}

int main() {
    string directions;
    cin >> directions;
    cout << countCollisions(directions) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string `directions`.
- We perform a single pass through the string to check for collisions.

This approach should handle the collisions in an efficient manner while keeping the logic straightforward and clear.
