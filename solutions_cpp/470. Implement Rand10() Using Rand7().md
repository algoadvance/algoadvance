[Leetcode 470. Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l470)
## Problem Statement

The task is to implement a function `int rand10()` that utilizes a given API function `int rand7()`, which generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 7]`, to generate a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 10]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does `rand7()` generate truly random integers uniformly?**
   - Yes, each integer from 1 to 7 is equally likely to be generated.
   
2. **Are there any constraints in terms of performance or the number of calls to `rand7()`?**
   - It is generally desirable to minimize the number of calls to `rand7()` to improve performance. The solution should balance simplicity and efficiency.

3. **Is there a limit on how many times `rand7()` can be called?**
   - Typically, no hard limit is given, but making fewer calls is usually better in terms of performance.

## Strategy

To use `rand7()` to generate a uniform distribution from 1 to 10, one straightforward way is to consider generating numbers in the range `[1, 49]` using two calls of `rand7()`, as `7 * (rand7() - 1) + rand7()` covers ranges from 1 to 49 uniformly:

1. Utilize two calls to `rand7()` to create a range from 1 to 49:
   - Let `a = rand7() - 1` be an integer in `[0, 6]`.
   - Let `b = rand7()` be an integer in `[1, 7]`.
   - Then, calculate `val = a * 7 + b`, which produces an integer in `[1, 49]`.

2. If the generated integer `val` is in the range `[1, 40]`, use `val % 10 + 1` to get a number in the range `[1, 10]`.

3. If `val` is outside the range `[1, 40]`, reject it and repeat the process (rejection sampling).

This method ensures that each number between 1 and 10 has an equal probability of being selected.

## Code

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>

// Given API
int rand7();

int rand10() {
    int val;
    do {
        // Generate a uniform number in the range [1, 49]
        int a = rand7() - 1;
        int b = rand7();
        val = a * 7 + b; // (a * 7) gives values in multiples of 7, then add b.
    } while (val > 40); // Since we only need numbers in the range [1, 40]

    return (val - 1) % 10 + 1; // Normalize [1, 40] to [1, 10]
}
```

## Time Complexity

The expected time complexity for this solution is O(1), although the actual number of iterations in the loop depends on the probability of generating values in the range `[1, 40]` from `[1, 49]`. Specifically, the loop runs an average of 1.225 times per call to `rand10()`, since the probability of acceptance is 40/49.

Therefore, this solution is efficient both in terms of implementation complexity and performance.
