[Leetcode 2258. Escape the Spreading Fire](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2258)
### Problem Statement

Here is the problem statement for Leetcode problem 2258, "Escape the Spreading Fire":

You are given a grid `grid` of size `m x n` which represents a field of grass and fire. The value `grid[i][j]` can be `0`, `1`, or `2` where:
- `grid[i][j] = 0` represents grass,
- `grid[i][j] = 1` represents fire, and
- `grid[i][j] = 2` represents a house.

The fire spreads to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) each minute, and it also can move through houses. You can only move through the grass cells (`0`) and houses (`2`), but not through fire cells (`1`). You start from the top-left corner of the grid and you must reach the bottom-right corner before the fire reaches there. Return `true` if it is possible to reach the bottom-right corner before the fire does; otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume that the input grid will always have `m >= 1` and `n >= 1`?**
   - Yes, you can assume that constraint.

2. **How does the fire spread preference workâ€”does it spread in all directions simultaneously or sequentially?**
   - The fire spreads to all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) simultaneously each minute.

3. **Are there obstacles other than fire cells and the constraints with moving only through grass and houses?**
   - No, the only constraints are that you cannot move through fire cells, and must navigate only through grass (`0`) and houses (`2`).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The main steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Multiple Source BFS for Spread of Fire**:
   - Use BFS to precompute the time when the fire reaches each cell in the grid.
 
2. **Single Source BFS for Escape Path**:
   - Use BFS again to find the earliest time you can reach each cell by comparing it with the precomputed fire timings. If at any point you reach the bottom-right corner before or at the same time as the fire, return `true`. If after visiting all possible cells, you don't reach the bottom-right corner safely, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

bool escapeTheFire(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> fireTime(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    queue<pair<int, int>> fireQueue;
    
    // Initialize fire's multiple source BFS
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                fireQueue.push({i, j});
                fireTime[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> dir = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1}; // Up, Down, Left, Right directions
    
    // Fire BFS - Precompute the time when fire reaches each cell
    while (!fireQueue.empty()) {
        auto [curRow, curCol] = fireQueue.front();
        fireQueue.pop();
        int curTime = fireTime[curRow][curCol];
        
        for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d) {
            int newRow = curRow + dir[d];
            int newCol = curCol + dir[d + 1];
            
            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && grid[newRow][newCol] != 1 && 
                fireTime[newRow][newCol] == INT_MAX) {
                fireTime[newRow][newCol] = curTime + 1;
                fireQueue.push({newRow, newCol});
            }
        }
    }

    // Player BFS - Try to escape
    queue<pair<int, int>> playerQueue;
    playerQueue.push({0, 0});
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
    visited[0][0] = true;
    int playerTime = 0;

    while (!playerQueue.empty()) {
        int levelSize = playerQueue.size();
        while (levelSize--) {
            auto [curRow, curCol] = playerQueue.front();
            playerQueue.pop();

            if (curRow == m-1 && curCol == n-1) {
                return true;
            }

            for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d) {
                int newRow = curRow + dir[d];
                int newCol = curCol + dir[d + 1];

                if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && grid[newRow][newCol] != 1 && 
                    !visited[newRow][newCol] && playerTime + 1 < fireTime[newRow][newCol]) {
                    playerQueue.push({newRow, newCol});
                    visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        playerTime++;
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Fire BFS**: O(m * n) because each cell is processed once.
- **Player BFS**: O(m * n) because each cell is processed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n), which should be efficient for typical input sizes.

This solution effectively and efficiently places you ahead of the spreading fire, helping you to see whether you can reach safety or not!
