[Leetcode 988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l988)
### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node has a value from `0` to `25` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`. Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Can the tree have duplicate values?
   - **Answer:** Yes, nodes can hold the same values representing the same characters.

2. **Question:** Are we guaranteed to have at least one leaf in the tree?
   - **Answer:** Yes, as every valid binary tree will have at least one leaf node.

3. **Question:** Should we handle large trees, or can we assume small to moderate-sized inputs?
   - **Answer:** We should write a solution that handles trees efficiently, as we are not given any constraints on the size of the tree.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We'll perform a depth-first search to explore all the paths from leaf nodes to the root.
2. **String Building**: As we explore each path, we'll build the corresponding string from the leaf node to the root.
3. **Compare Strings**: We'll keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during our search.
4. **Reverse the String**: Since we are building the string from leaf to root, we need to reverse it at the leaf node to get the correct string representation.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N * H), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree and H is the height of the tree. This is because we are visiting each node once and potentially generating strings proportional to the height of the tree.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, which is the maximum depth of the recursion stack (in the worst case for a skewed tree).

### Code

Here's the C++ code for the solution:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    string smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        string smallest = "~"; // '~' is lexicographically larger than any lower-case letter
        dfs(root, "", smallest);
        return smallest;
    }

private:
    void dfs(TreeNode* node, string path, string &smallest) {
        if (!node) return;

        // Convert current node value to corresponding character and prepend it to the path
        path = static_cast<char>('a' + node->val) + path;

        if (!node->left && !node->right) { // Leaf node
            if (path < smallest) {
                smallest = path;
            }
        }

        dfs(node->left, path, smallest);
        dfs(node->right, path, smallest);
    }
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Utility Function `dfs`**: This function performs a depth-first search. It constructs the string for each path from a leaf node to the root.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `TreeNode* node`: The current node.
     - `string path`: The current path string built so far.
     - `string &smallest`: The reference to the string holding the smallest path found.
2. We convert the node's value to its corresponding character and prepend it to the path string.
3. If the current node is a leaf node (both children are `nullptr`), we compare the path with the smallest string found so far.
4. The DFS call is recursively made for the left and right child nodes.
5. The result is the lexicographically smallest string starting from any leaf node to the root.
