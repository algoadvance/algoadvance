[Leetcode 2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2486)
## Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters. You want to form a subsequence of `s` that matches `t`. To do so, you are allowed to append any number of characters to the end of `s`. Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` to make `t` a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the lengths of the strings `s` and `t` be large?
   - This will help determine if we need an optimized solution.
2. Can `t` be an empty string?
   - Edge case to consider as an empty string `t` already trivially matches as a subsequence of any string `s`.
3. Can `s` be an empty string?
   - Clarifying this helps understand if we need to handle appending all of `t` to `s`.

## Strategy
1. We need to traverse through `s` using a pointer and compare each character in `t`.
2. We will use two pointers, one pointing to the start of `s` and the other to the start of `t`.
3. If the characters at the current positions of both pointers match, move both pointers forward; otherwise, move only the pointer of `s`.
4. Continue this process until we've either gone through all of `s` or have matched all characters in `t`.
5. If we've reached the end of `t` during this traversal, then `t` is already a subsequence of `s`.
6. If not, the remaining characters in `t` from the point where we left off will need to be appended to `s`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int appendCharacters(std::string s, std::string t) {
        int i = 0; // pointer for s
        int j = 0; // pointer for t
        
        while (i < s.size() && j < t.size()) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        
        // The number of characters in t that are left to be matched
        return t.size() - j;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. This is because we potentially traverse all characters of both strings once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

This solution is efficient and handles cases where `t` is a prefix or suffix of `s`, as well as any other order of characters in `t`. The main loop ensures every character in `s` is only considered once, making the solution optimal for the problem constraints.
