[Leetcode 260. Single Number III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l260)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once. You need to implement a function in C++ that returns these two unique numbers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be the return type of the function?
   **A:** The function should return a vector of integers containing the two unique numbers.
   
2. **Q:** Can the given array have negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
   
3. **Q:** Is the array length restricted to any specific range?
   **A:** There are no specific constraints given, but typically the array length will be within practical limits for a coding interview problem.

### Strategy
1. **Bit Manipulation: XOR Technique**
   - XOR of all elements in `nums` will result in the XOR of the two unique numbers because all paired numbers will cancel themselves out (XOR of a number with itself is 0).
   - Let the result of XORing these two unique numbers be called `xor2`. `xor2` is effectively `a ^ b` where `a` and `b` are the unique numbers.
   
2. **Finding a Differentiating Bit**
   - Find any bit that is set (1) in `xor2`. This can be used to differentiate between the two unique numbers because they have different bits at some position.
   - Use this bit to partition all numbers in `nums` into two groups: one with the differentiating bit set and the other with this bit not set.

3. **Extracting the Unique Numbers**
   - XOR all numbers in each group independently. This process will isolate the two unique numbers because all duplicates will cancel out within each group.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> singleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Step 1: Find the XOR of the two unique numbers (a ^ b)
    int xor2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        xor2 ^= num;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find a differentiating bit (rightmost set bit)
    int diffBit = xor2 & (-xor2);
    
    // Step 3: Divide numbers into two groups and find the unique numbers
    int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        if ((num & diffBit) == 0) {
            // Group where the bit is not set
            num1 ^= num;
        } else {
            // Group where the bit is set
            num2 ^= num;
        }
    }
    
    return {num1, num2};
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5};
    std::vector<int> result = singleNumber(nums);
    std::cout << "The two unique numbers are: " << result[0] << " and " << result[1] << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array:
- Computing the XOR of all elements takes O(n).
- Finding a differentiating bit is a constant time operation, O(1).
- Dividing the numbers into two groups and computing their XORs takes O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the number of elements in the array.
