[Leetcode 2040. Kth Smallest Product of Two Sorted Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2040)
### Problem Statement

You are given two sorted 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, as well as an integer `k`. Return the `k`th smallest product of the two arrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the integers in `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - How large can `nums1` and `nums2` get?
   
2. **Output Constraints:**
   - How do we define the output if there are duplicate products?
   - Should we consider the product of every pair `(nums1[i], nums2[j])` where `i` and `j` are indices in nums1 and nums2 respectively?

3. **Behavioral Constraints:**
   - Can either of the arrays be empty?
   - Should we worry about overflow for very large products?

I'll assume that the arrays can contain both negative and positive integers, including zero, and the sizes of both arrays are reasonably large though not unmanageable, e.g., less than 10^5 elements. Also, assume that products will fit in a standard 64-bit integer.

### Strategy

The problem asks for the `k`-th smallest product from two sorted arrays. Here is a step-by-step strategy to solve this:

1. **Pair Generation and Sorting:** 
   - We could generate all possible products and sort them, then find the `k`-th smallest. However, this is computationally expensive because the number of pairs is `O(n * m)`, which is large for high values of n and m.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Instead, we can use a binary search method to efficiently find the product. By searching within the range of the smallest possible product to the largest possible product, we try to find the k-th smallest product.
   - For each mid value during our binary search, we count the number of products less than or equal to `mid` using a two-pointer technique on the sorted arrays.

### Code

Below is the C++ code implementing the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

long long countLessEqual(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, long long x) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    int m = nums2.size();
    long long count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums1[i] > 0) {
            count += upper_bound(nums2.begin(), nums2.end(), x / nums1[i]) - nums2.begin();
        } else if (nums1[i] < 0) {
            count += nums2.end() - lower_bound(nums2.begin(), nums2.end(), (x + 1) / nums1[i]);
        } else if (x >= 0) {
            count += m;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

long long kthSmallestProduct(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2, long long k) {
    long long left = LLONG_MIN, right = LLONG_MAX;
    
    // Binary Search to find the k-th smallest product
    while (left < right) {
        long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (countLessEqual(nums1, nums2, mid) < k) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums1 = {-10, -3, 0, 5, 9};
    vector<int> nums2 = {2, 3, 8};
    int k = 10;
    
    cout << kthSmallestProduct(nums1, nums2, k) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search Complexity:** 
    - The binary search runs in `O(log(X))` where `X` is the difference between the maximum and the minimum possible product values.
    
2. **Counting Pairs Complexity:**
    - Counting pairs takes `O(n log m)` where `n` is the size of `nums1` and `m` is the size of `nums2`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log m log X)`, which is efficient enough for reasonably large values of `n` and `m`.
