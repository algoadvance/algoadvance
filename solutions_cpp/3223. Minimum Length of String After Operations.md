[Leetcode 3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3223)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you can perform the following operations as many times as you want:

1. Remove an equal number of characters from the front and back of the string if they are equal.

Your task is to return the minimum length of the string after performing these operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
   - Can the string contain any kind of characters (alphanumeric, special characters)?
   - Is the string guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - What should be returned if the entire string can be removed?

### Code

Here is the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minimumLength(std::string s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.length() - 1;

    while (left < right && s[left] == s[right]) {
        char currentChar = s[left];
        while (left <= right && s[left] == currentChar) {
            left++;
        }
        while (left <= right && s[right] == currentChar) {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return right - left + 1;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abccba";
    std::cout << "Minimum length: " << minimumLength(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the string and `right` at the end.

2. **Iterative Step:**
   - Check if the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers are equal.
   - If they are equal, move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left until the characters at both pointers are no longer equal to this character.
   - Repeat the process until the characters at the pointers are different or the pointers cross each other.

3. **Termination:**
   - The process terminates when the `left` and `right` pointers do not point to equal characters or have crossed each other.
   - The minimal length of the string is `right - left + 1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Worst-case scenario:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
  - In each iteration, either `left` or `right` (or both) pointers are moved, thus making at most `n` movements overall.

This algorithm is efficient for determining the minimal length of the string after performing the specified operations.
