[Leetcode 3090. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3090)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s`, find the length of the maximum substring that appears twice in the original string. These two substrings must not overlap.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the substrings case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, the comparison is case-sensitive.

2. **Can there be overlapping substrings?**
   - No, the substrings must not overlap.

3. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - Let's assume the string length can be up to \(10^5\) characters.

4. **Should the solution handle edge cases where the input string is empty or very short?**
   - Yes, handle cases where the string length is less than 2 since no non-overlapping substrings are possible in such cases.

### Strategy:
1. **Binary Search on Length**: We will use binary search to find the maximum length `L` such that some substring of length `L` appears at least twice in `s` with no overlap. This allows us to efficiently zoom in on the length rather than a direct brute force approach.

2. **Hashing and Sliding Window**: For checking if a substring of length `L` appears twice, we can use hashing (e.g., rolling hash) along with a sliding window algorithm. This helps in efficiently managing the hash values and quickly identifying repeated substrings.

3. **Hash Set for Storage**: Use a hash set to store substrings of the current length and check for repeats. Ensure to manage non-overlapping by keeping track of the previous indices.

### Code:
Here is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxLengthSubstringWithTwoOccurrences(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n < 2) return 0;

        // Helper function to determine if there's a non-overlapping substring of length len
        auto hasNonOverlappingSubstring = [&](int len) -> bool {
            unordered_set<string> substr_set;
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
                string current_sub = s.substr(i, len);
                if (substr_set.count(current_sub)) {
                    return true;
                }
                substr_set.insert(current_sub);
            }
            return false;
        };

        // Binary search for the maximum possible length
        int left = 1, right = n - 1, result = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (hasNonOverlappingSubstring(mid)) {
                result = mid;  // Possible valid length
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string s = "banana";
    cout << "The length of the maximum substring which appears twice: " << sol.maxLengthSubstringWithTwoOccurrences(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Binary Search**: We perform binary search on lengths from 1 to \(n-1\), which takes \(O(\log n)\).
2. **Checking Substrings**: For each length, the hash set check takes \(O(n)\) comparisons in the worst-case scenario, assuming efficient hashing and insertion in average case \(O(1)\).

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Recap:
This approach combines sliding window and hashing within a binary search framework, ensuring efficient computation while checking for non-overlapping repeated substrings in linearithmic time.
