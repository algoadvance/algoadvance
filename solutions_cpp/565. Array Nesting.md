[Leetcode 565. Array Nesting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l565)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 565: Array Nesting.

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums` is a permutation of the numbers in the range `[0, n - 1]`. You should build a set `S` traversing the array from a start index `i` such that the set `S` contains the values: 
```
S = {nums[i], nums[nums[i]], nums[nums[nums[i]]], ... }
```
The set stops adding values if a value that is already in the set is encountered. The goal is to find the longest length of set `S`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [5, 4, 0, 3, 1, 6, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
nums[0] = 5, nums[5] = 6, nums[6] = 2, nums[2] = 0
Thereby, `S` = {5, 6, 2, 0}
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input values?**
   - The input array `nums` consists of integers in the range `[0, n-1]`.
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of `n`?**
   - Yes, typically `n` is within the constraints for competitive programming (1 <= n <= 10^4).
3. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, based on the problem constraints, the array will not be empty.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Create a boolean vector `visited` of size `n` initialized to `false`. This will help us track if we have already visited an index.
2. **Iterate and Track:** Loop through each index of `nums`. If an index has not been visited yet, start a new set and keep track of its size.
   - For each set, follow the elements of `nums` as given by the problem statement. Mark each index as visited.
   - Track the length of the current set and update the maximum length if this set is longer than the previously found ones.
3. **Break Loops:** Since a cycle in the set would mean revisiting the same index, the process ensures that each element contributes to only one set.

### Code
Here's how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int arrayNesting(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int length = 0;
                int current = i;
                
                while (!visited[current]) {
                    visited[current] = true;
                    current = nums[current];
                    ++length;
                }
                
                maxLength = std::max(maxLength, length);
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We visit each element at most twice: once when we start exploring from it, and once when we revisit it within the set.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We need an additional vector of size `n` for the `visited` array.

This efficient solution ensures that we achieve the goal within optimal time, adhering to competitive programming constraints.
