[Leetcode 2383. Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2383)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2383: Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition

You are given two integers `initialEnergy` and `initialExperience`. You are also given two integer arrays `energy` and `experience`, both of length `n`.

You are competing in `n` training sessions where the `i-th` session has:
- An energy cost of `energy[i]`
- Requires `experience[i]` amount of experience to defeat the opponent in the training session.

You can defeat the opponent in the `i-th` session if you both:
1. Have enough energy to pass through the session, i.e., `initialEnergy` must be greater than `energy[i]`.
2. Have enough experience to defeat the opponent, i.e., `initialExperience` must be greater than `experience[i]`.

Each time you defeat an opponent, your experience increases by `experience[i]`. Also, you can choose to train to increase your experience by 1 unit in one hour, and you can increase your energy by 1 unit in one hour as well.

Return the minimum number of hours of training needed to defeat all the opponents in the `n` training sessions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The number of training sessions `n` can be up to 1000.

2. **Can the values inside the `energy` and `experience` arrays be negative or zero?**
   - No, the values inside `energy` and `experience` will be positive integers.

3. **Can `initialEnergy` or `initialExperience` be zero or negative?**
   - No, both `initialEnergy` and `initialExperience` will be positive integers.

4. **Is there a maximum limit for `initialEnergy` and `initialExperience`?**
   - Let's consider the typical constraints (e.g., within the range of `10^5`).

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves:
1. Iterating through each training session and checking if we need to train more energy or experience.
2. Keeping track of how much extra energy or experience is needed to defeat the current opponent.
3. Summing the total hours of training required across all sessions.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minNumberOfHours(int initialEnergy, int initialExperience, std::vector<int>& energy, std::vector<int>& experience) {
        int n = energy.size();
        int requiredEnergy = 0, totalHours = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total energy required to defeat all opponents.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            requiredEnergy += energy[i];
        }
        
        // If the initial energy is less than required, calculate the additional hours needed.
        if (initialEnergy <= requiredEnergy) {
            totalHours += requiredEnergy - initialEnergy + 1;
        }
        
        // Process each training session.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (initialExperience <= experience[i]) {
                totalHours += experience[i] - initialExperience + 1;
                initialExperience = experience[i] + 1;
            }
            // Simulate defeating the opponent and increasing experience.
            initialExperience += experience[i];
        }
        
        return totalHours;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), as we are iterating over the `energy` and `experience` arrays once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a few extra variables for calculations.

This solution ensures that you have enough energy and experience to win all training sessions while computing the minimal hours of training required efficiently.
