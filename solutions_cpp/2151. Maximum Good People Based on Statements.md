### Problem Statement 

LeetCode Problem 2151: Maximum Good People Based on Statements

You are given an array `statements` of `n` people. Every `statements[i]` is an integer array of length `n` where `statements[i][j]` can be:

- `0` indicating person `i` thinks person `j` is a bad person.
- `1` indicating person `i` thinks person `j` is a good person.
- `2` indicating person `i` has no belief about person `j`.

Return the maximum number of people who can be good and consistent with the statements.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem, we might need answers to the following questions:

1. Are there any constraints on the values of `n`?
2. How to handle cases where a person is inconsistent in their statements?

### Strategy

The problem is essentially about finding the maximum number of "good" people such that none of the given statements about them being good or bad is contradicted. We can solve this problem using bit manipulation and checking for consistency.

1. **Generate all Possible Combinations:** Since we have up to `n` people, there are `2^n` possible combinations of labeling people as "good" or "bad".
   
2. **Check Consistency:** For each combination:
   - Assume the current combination of people as good (represented by bit `1`) or bad (represented by bit `0`).
   - Verify if this combination is consistent with all the statements.
   
3. **Count and Compare:** Keep track of the maximum number of good people in valid combinations.

### Code

Here is the C++ solution to solve the problem using the strategy described above:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumGood(vector<vector<int>>& statements) {
        int n = statements.size();
        int maxGood = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all possible combinations
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
            if (isValid(mask, statements)) {
                maxGood = max(maxGood, __builtin_popcount(mask));
            }
        }
        
        return maxGood;
    }
    
private:
    bool isValid(int mask, vector<vector<int>>& statements) {
        int n = statements.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (mask & (1 << i)) { // If i-th person is good
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if (statements[i][j] == 1 && !(mask & (1 << j))) // i says j is good but j is bad
                        return false;
                    if (statements[i][j] == 0 && (mask & (1 << j))) // i says j is bad but j is good
                        return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm can be broken down as follows:

- **Generating Combinations:** There are `2^n` combinations to consider.
- **Checking Consistency:** For each combination, we need to check the statements of each person, leading to a complexity of `O(n^2)` for each combination.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n^2 * 2^n)`. This complexity might be feasible for small values of `n` (e.g., `n â‰¤ 15`).

This approach ensures that we explore all potential valid scenarios to find the maximum number of good people.
