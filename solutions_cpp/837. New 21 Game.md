[Leetcode 837. New 21 Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l837)
## Problem Statement

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game “21”.

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes are uniformly distributed.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` or more points. Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`, `k`, and `maxPts`:**
   - Are n, k, and maxPts within the range of typical constraints such as 0 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ maxPts ≤ 10^4?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if `k` is 0? In this case, Alice doesn't draw any cards, and the probability will depend on whether 0 ≤ n.
   - What if `maxPts` is 1? It may reduce the problem to a simpler scenario.

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming Approach
1. **Problem Insight**:
   - We need to track the probability of Alice having specific points from 0 to n.
   - The probability of reaching a state depends on previous states due to the uniformly distributed random drawing.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Let `dp[i]` be the probability of having `i` points after some number of draws.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1.0` because we start with 0 points.

3. **Sliding Window Sum**:
   - Use a sliding window sum to maintain the sum of probabilities of the last `maxPts` scores, reducing the complexity of computing the sum repeatedly.

4. **Transition**:
   - For `i` from 1 to `n`, `dp[i]` is computed based on the sliding window sum.
   - If `i` is less than `k`, update the sliding window.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - Sum up the probabilities of getting `i` points where `k ≤ i ≤ n`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        if (k == 0 || n >= k + maxPts) return 1.0;

        vector<double> dp(n + 1);
        dp[0] = 1.0;
        double windowSum = 1.0;
        double result = 0.0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = windowSum / maxPts;
            if (i < k) {
                windowSum += dp[i];
            } else {
                result += dp[i];
            }
            if (i >= maxPts) {
                windowSum -= dp[i - maxPts];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since we only iterate over the range once, and the sliding window sum operation is constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), used for the dp array.

This approach effectively computes the probability that Alice's score is less than or equal to `n` after stopping the draws using a dynamic programming approach combined with sliding window technique.
