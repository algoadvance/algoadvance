[Leetcode 495. Teemo Attacking](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l495)
## Problem Statement

In the game, "League of Legends," there is an item called "Teemo" that can poison enemies. When Teemo attacks an enemy, the enemy gets poisoned and stays poisoned for a duration given by `duration` seconds. If Teemo attacks again before the end of the poison duration, the poison timer is reset, and the target remains poisoned for another `duration` seconds.

You are given a **non-decreasing** integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes the time Teemo attacks the target at time `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return the total time that the target is poisoned.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: timeSeries = [1, 4], duration = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: At time 1, Teemo attacks and the target is poisoned for 2 seconds.
At time 4, Teemo attacks again, and the poison duration is reset for another 2 seconds.
Total poison time is 2 + 2 = 4 seconds.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: timeSeries = [1, 2], duration = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: At time 1, Teemo attacks and the target is poisoned.
At time 2, Teemo attacks again before the poison duration ends, so the poison duration is reset.
The total poison time is only extended by 1 second.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Values**:
   - What is the range of the lengths of `timeSeries`? (Typically constrained to keep computations feasible.)
   - What is the range for the values in `timeSeries` and `duration`?
   
2. **Boundary Cases**:
   - What should be the output if `timeSeries` is empty?
   
3. **Non-decreasing Array**:
   - Can we assume `timeSeries` is always sorted in non-decreasing order?

## Strategy

1. **Iterating Through the Time Series**:
   - Initialize `totalPoisonedTime` to zero.
   - Traverse through `timeSeries` and compute the poisoned time for each attack considering the current and the next attack.
   - Compare the difference between consecutive attack times (`timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i]`) and `duration` to determine if the poison duration is completely utilized or partially overlapped.
   
2. **Handling Last Attack**:
   - For the last attack in the series, simply add the full `duration` as there is no next attack to compare with.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of `timeSeries`, as we need to traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a few extra variables for storing the result and intermediate values.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findPoisonedDuration(vector<int>& timeSeries, int duration) {
        int totalPoisonedTime = 0;
        int n = timeSeries.size();

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            totalPoisonedTime += min(duration, timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i]);
        }

        // Add the duration for the last attack, it always lasts for 'duration' seconds
        if (n > 0) {
            totalPoisonedTime += duration;
        }

        return totalPoisonedTime;
    }
};
```
This solution traverses the `timeSeries` to calculate the total poisoned time, considering the duration overlaps properly for each attack.
