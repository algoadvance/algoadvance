[Leetcode 483. Smallest Good Base](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l483)
### Problem Statement
The problem asks us to find the smallest good base of a number, represented as a string `n`. A "good base" means that the number can be represented as `k` where `n` equals \( k^0 + k^1 + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} \) for some integer `m` greater than or equal to 2.

For example, if `n = "13"`, then the smallest good base is `3` because \( 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2 \). 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Question:** What is the range for the value of `n`?
   **Answer:** The value of `n` is guaranteed to be a valid number represented in string format, within a reasonable range for which base computations are feasible.
   
2. **Question:** What should the function return if there are multiple valid bases that represent `n` correctly?
   **Answer:** The function shall return the smallest valid base.

### Strategy
1. **Finding the Maximum Possible Length:** Convert `n` to a long integer. Determine the maximum possible `m` such that \( k^{m-1} \leq n \) when \( k \geq 2 \). This can be approximated using logarithms.
2. **Iterating over possible lengths:** Start with the largest `m` and iterate down to 2. For each `m`, binary search for the smallest base `k` such that:
   \[
   1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} = n
   \]
3. **Binary Search:** For each `m`, apply binary search to find the value of `k` within a feasible range, starting from 2 upwards.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string smallestGoodBase(string n) {
        unsigned long long num = stoull(n); // Convert string to number
        for (int m = log2(num) + 1; m >= 2; m--) {
            unsigned long long k = binarySearch(m, num);
            if (k != -1) return to_string(k);
        }
        return to_string(num - 1); // Base n-1 always works
    }

private:
    unsigned long long binarySearch(int m, unsigned long long num) {
        unsigned long long left = 2, right = pow(num, 1.0 / (m - 1)) + 1;
        while (left < right) {
            unsigned long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            unsigned long long sum = 1, current = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
                current *= mid;
                sum += current;
                if (sum > num) break;
            }

            if (sum == num) return mid;
            else if (sum < num) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return -1; // no valid base found
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string n = "4681";
    cout << sol.smallestGoodBase(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Storing the Input:** Convert the input string `n` to an unsigned long long to handle larger values.
2. **Iterate over Possible Lengths:** We start from the maximum m, which can be approximately `log2(n) + 1`, down to 2.
3. **Binary Search for Each Length:** For each candidate length `m`, perform a binary search to find an appropriate base `k`.
4. **Summing the Geometric Series:** For each base `k`, calculate the sum of the series \(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1}\) and compare it against `num`.
5. **Return the Smallest Valid Base:** If a valid base `k` is found, return it as a string.

### Time Complexity
- The outer loop runs approximately `log2(n)` times.
- The inner loop performs a binary search, which is `O(log(n))` for the value of `k`.
- Each check involves computing a series sum up to `m`, hence approximately `O(log(n))`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is roughly `O((log(n))^2 log(n))` due to nested logarithmic operations. This approach is feasible for the given constraints.
