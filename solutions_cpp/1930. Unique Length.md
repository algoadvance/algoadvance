[Leetcode 1930. Unique Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1930)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that is a palindrome.

You have to count the number of unique palindromic subsequences of length 3 in the given string `s`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are: "aba", "aca", "aaa".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in the string.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are: "bcb", "bab", "aba", "bbb".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
   - The length of `s` is in the range `[1, 1000]`.

2. **Character Set:**
   - Are there only lowercase English letters in the string?
   - Yes, the string consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. **Identifying Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences:**
   - We need to look for subsequences of the form `a_b_a` where `a` is any character and `b` can be any character including `a`.

2. **Algorithm Outline:**
   - Iterate through each character in the string and treat it as the middle character `b`.
   - For each `b`, look for the same character `a` both before and after `b` that can form a palindromic subsequence.
   - Use a set to store unique palindromic subsequences.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Use two arrays to track the left-most and right-most occurrence of each character in the string.
   - For each character position in the string, determine if it can act as the middle character of a length-3 palindrome by checking the tracked positions.

## Code

Here's the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int countPalindromicSubsequence(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<int> left(26, -1);
    std::vector<int> right(26, -1);
    
    // Fill right occurrence for each character
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        right[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
    }
    
    std::unordered_set<std::string> palindromes;

    // Traverse left to right and update palindromes
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        char midChar = s[i];
        // If this is the first time we see this character
        if (left[midChar - 'a'] == -1) {
            left[midChar - 'a'] = i;
        } else {
            // Loop through all characters to see if we can form a palindrome
            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                if (left[c - 'a'] != -1 && right[c - 'a'] > i) {
                    // Form the palindrome "c_midChar_c"
                    std::string palindrome = {c, midChar, c};
                    palindromes.insert(palindrome);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return palindromes.size();
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "aabca";
    std::cout << "Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences: " << countPalindromicSubsequence(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(26 * n) which simplifies to O(n), as there are a constant number of characters (26) in the alphabet.
- The space complexity is O(26), which is constant space for the `left` and `right` arrays.

This approach efficiently determines the number of unique length-3 palindromic subsequences by leveraging character positions and using sets to track unique palindromes.
