[Leetcode 1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1382)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary search tree (BST). Write a function to balance the BST. The balanced BST should have a minimum possible height; in other words, the difference in depth between any two leaves is at most one.

The function receives the root of a binary search tree and should return the root of the balanced binary search tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a balanced binary search tree?**
   - A balanced binary search tree is one where the depth of all leaves is as similar as possible. This typically means that the depth of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by no more than one.

2. **Can the input BST be empty?**
   - Yes, the input BST can be empty (i.e., the root can be `nullptr`).

3. **How is the BST represented?**
   - The BST is represented by a `TreeNode` class:
     ```cpp
     struct TreeNode {
         int val;
         TreeNode* left;
         TreeNode* right;
         TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
         TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
         TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
     };
     ```

### Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal to Get Sorted Array:**
   - Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get all elements in sorted order.
   
2. **Convert Sorted Array to Balanced BST:**
   - Use the sorted array to construct a balanced BST. This can be done by recursive division of the array, always choosing the middle element as the root to maintain balance.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to perform an in-order traversal and fill the result array
    void inorderTraversal(TreeNode* node, vector<int>& nodes) {
        if (!node) return;
        inorderTraversal(node->left, nodes);
        nodes.push_back(node->val);
        inorderTraversal(node->right, nodes);
    }
    
    // Helper function to build a balanced BST from sorted array
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nodes, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) return nullptr;
        
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nodes[mid]);
        root->left = sortedArrayToBST(nodes, start, mid - 1);
        root->right = sortedArrayToBST(nodes, mid + 1, end);
        return root;
    }
    
    // Main function to balance the BST
    TreeNode* balanceBST(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> nodes;
        inorderTraversal(root, nodes);  // Get sorted elements
        return sortedArrayToBST(nodes, 0, nodes.size() - 1);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **In-order Traversal:**
   - The in-order traversal takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of nodes in the BST.

2. **Building Balanced BST:**
   - Constructing the balanced BST from the sorted array also takes `O(n)` time.

- **Overall Time Complexity: `O(n)`**

The given solution is efficient with respect to both time and space, achieving the desired balance of the BST in linear time.
