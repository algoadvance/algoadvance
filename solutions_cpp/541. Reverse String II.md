[Leetcode 541. Reverse String II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l541)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string. 

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input string composed of only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the input string `s` will only contain lowercase English letters.

2. **What is the expected output for the function?**
   - The function should return the modified string after applying the described transformations.

3. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` and the integer `k`?**
   - The string `s` has a length of up to 10000 characters, and `k` is in the range from 1 to 10000.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate Over the String:**
   - I will iterate over the string in chunks of `2k` characters.
   
2. **Reverse the First `k` Characters of Each Chunk:**
   - For each chunk of `2k` characters, I will reverse the first `k` characters. If a chunk has less than `2k` characters left, the chunk will be accordingly smaller.
   - If the remaining characters are fewer than `k`, I will reverse all of them.
   - If they are more than `k` but fewer than `2k`, I will reverse the first `k` characters while keeping the rest unchanged.

3. **Concatenate the Results:**
   - After processing each chunk, concatenate the results into the final string.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>  // For std::reverse

std::string reverseStr(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    
    for (int start = 0; start < n; start += 2 * k) {
        // Determine the end of the current segment to process
        int end = std::min(start + k, n);
        
        // Reverse the first k characters in the current segment
        std::reverse(s.begin() + start, s.begin() + end);
    }
    
    return s;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. We are traversing the entire string one time and performing reversals on segments which are in total linear time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space, as we are performing in-place modifications on the input string.

This implementation efficiently processes the string with the given constraints and correctly applies the required transformations.
