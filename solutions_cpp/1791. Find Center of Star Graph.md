[Leetcode 1791. Find Center of Star Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1791)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1791: **Find Center of Star Graph**

There is an undirected star graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly `n-1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. Return the center of the given star graph.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the edges always form a valid star graph?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the graph is a valid star graph.
   
2. **What is the range for the number of nodes `n`?**
   - Given the constraints usually present in Leetcode problems, `n` can be reasonably small to medium-sized, typically in the order of up to a few thousand.

3. **Can there be multiple center nodes?**
   - No, in a valid star graph, there is a unique center node.

### Strategy

The star graph has one center node connected to all other nodes. This means that the center node will appear in every edge of the graph. To identify the center node:

1. We'll look at the first two edges provided in the array.
2. One of the nodes common in both edges must be the center node.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findCenter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Check the first two edges to find the common node which is the center
        int node1 = edges[0][0];
        int node2 = edges[0][1];
        
        // The center must be among node1 or node2; it will be whichever appears in the second edge.
        if (edges[1][0] == node1 || edges[1][1] == node1) {
            return node1;
        } else {
            return node2;
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation

- We look at the first two edges.
- The center node must be one of the nodes in the first edge.
- We check if this node (`node1` or `node2`) is present in the second edge. The one that appears in the second edge is the center.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because:
- We only need to look at the first two edges to determine the center node.
- The operations of comparison and retrieval are constant-time operations.
