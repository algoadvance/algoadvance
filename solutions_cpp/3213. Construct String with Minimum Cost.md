[Leetcode 3213. Construct String with Minimum Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3213)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of deleting the `i-th` character in `s`. You are allowed to delete any characters to create a new string. The goal is to delete characters from the string such that all characters in the resulting string are unique. Your task is to compute the minimum cost to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Are the characters in `s` only lowercase letters?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should we return the minimum cost as an integer?

3. **Constraints on `cost` Array:**
   - Is the `cost` array always the same length as string `s`?
   - Are the costs always non-negative integers?

### Assumptions (Based on Typical Constraints):
1. `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
2. `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
3. The `cost` array is of the same length as `s` and contains non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through String:**
   - Traverse the string while keeping track of previously seen characters.
   
2. **Using a Map for Tracking:**
   - Use a map (or a set) to keep track of characters that have appeared before.
   - Compare the costs of deleting the current character versus the previously encountered same character.
   
3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If a character is encountered that has already been seen, compare the costs and add the minimum of these to the total cost while keeping the higher cost character.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. Initialize a map to keep track of the last seen index of each character.
2. Initialize a variable to accumulate the total cost of deletions.
3. Loop through the string to process each character:
   - If the character has been seen before, choose the minimum cost of removing the duplicate character.
   - Update the map with the current index or replace it accordingly.
   
4. Return the accumulated cost.

### Code
Here's a C++ implementation for the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minCostToRemoveDuplicates(const std::string &s, const std::vector<int> &cost) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> lastSeenIndex;
    int totalCost = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        char currentChar = s[i];
        if (lastSeenIndex.find(currentChar) != lastSeenIndex.end()) {
            int prevIndex = lastSeenIndex[currentChar];
            totalCost += std::min(cost[i], cost[prevIndex]);
            if (cost[prevIndex] < cost[i]) {
                lastSeenIndex[currentChar] = i;
            }
        } else {
            lastSeenIndex[currentChar] = i;
        }
    }

    return totalCost;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abca";
    std::vector<int> cost = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::cout << "Minimum Cost: " << minCostToRemoveDuplicates(s, cost) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the alphabet size is fixed (only lowercase English letters), the map will at most contain 26 entries.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum cost to make the characters in the string unique with an optimal time complexity.
