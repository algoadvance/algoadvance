[Leetcode 509. Fibonacci Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l509)
**Problem Statement:**

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n), form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

- F(0) = 0,
- F(1) = 1,
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), for n > 1.

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. What is the maximum value for `n` that we need to handle?
   - This helps in understanding potential overflow issues or the need for optimization.

2. Is the use of additional data structures (e.g., arrays for memoization) allowed?
   - This helps in choosing between different implementations like recursive, iterative, or dynamic programming approaches.

3. Should the solution be optimized for time complexity or space complexity?
   - This helps in selecting whether to prioritize iterative solutions (which are usually space efficient) or recursive with memoization (which can be more time efficient).

Assuming the value of `n` can be large (e.g., up to 30) and additional data structures are allowed, we'll go for an iterative approach which is both time efficient and space efficient.

**Strategy:**

1. **Base Cases Handling:**
   - Directly return 0 for `n == 0`.
   - Directly return 1 for `n == 1`.

2. **Iterative Solution:**
   - Use two variables to keep track of the previous two Fibonacci numbers (`a` and `b`).
   - Iterate from 2 to `n`, computing the current Fibonacci number by summing the previous two.

**Code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int fib(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return 1;

    int a = 0, b = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        int temp = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = temp;
    }
    return b;
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example input
    std::cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is: " << fib(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The iterative solution makes a single pass from 2 to `n`, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the input `n`.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space (only a few integer variables), so the space complexity is considered constant (O(1)).

This code is efficient for calculating Fibonacci numbers even for relatively large values of `n` and avoids the pitfalls of stack overflow or excessive recomputation that a naive recursive solution might encounter.
