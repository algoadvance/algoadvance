[Leetcode 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2011)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations on a variable `X` that start at `0`, determine the final value of `X` after performing all the operations. Each operation is a string that can be one of the following: `"--X"`, `"X--"`, `"++X"`, `"X++"`.

* `"++X"` and `"X++"` increments the value of `X` by 1.
* `"--X"` and `"X--"` decrements the value of `X` by 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What will be the maximum length of the `operations` array?**
   - Typical size constraints apply, such as \(1 \leq \text{operations.length} \leq 1000\).

2. **Are the operation strings always valid strings as described?**
   - Yes, all strings in the `operations` array will be one of the four valid operations.

3. **What should be the initial value of `X`?**
   - The initial value of `X` is always 0.

### Strategy
1. Initialize a variable `X` to 0.
2. Traverse through each string in the `operations` array.
3. For each operation, update the value of `X` accordingly:
   - Increment `X` if the operation is `"++X"` or `"X++"`.
   - Decrement `X` if the operation is `"--X"` or `"X--"`.
4. Return the final value of `X` after applying all operations.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the plan in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int finalValueAfterOperations(std::vector<std::string>& operations) {
    int X = 0;
    for (const std::string& operation : operations) {
        if (operation == "++X" || operation == "X++") {
            X++;
        } else if (operation == "--X" || operation == "X--") {
            X--;
        }
    }
    return X;
}
```

### Explanation
- We start by initializing `X` as 0.
- We iterate over each string in the `operations` vector.
- Depending on the operation string, we modify the value of `X`:
  - If the operation string contains `"++X"` or `"X++"`, increment `X` by 1.
  - If the operation string contains `"--X"` or `"X--"`, decrement `X` by 1.
- Finally, return the value of `X`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the `operations` array.
- This is because we are making a single pass through the `operations` array and each operation (increment/decrement) is performed in constant time.
