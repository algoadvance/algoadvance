[Leetcode 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1171)
### Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, we want to remove every consecutive sequence of nodes that sum to 0 from the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What type of values does the linked list contain?
   - **A:** The values are integers and can be positive, negative, or zero.
   
2. **Q:** Can the linked list be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, the linked list can be empty.

3. **Q:** What should be returned if the entire linked list sums to zero?
   - **A:** Return an empty list.

4. **Q:** Is there a limit on the number of nodes in the linked list?
   - **A:** No specific limit, but we should assume it fits into memory.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a prefix sum and a hashmap to identify subsequences that sum to zero. The main idea here is to use a prefix sum to keep track of sums of the node values up to the current node and use a hashmap to store the first occurrence of each sum. If we encounter the same sum again, it means the nodes between the previous occurrence and the current node sum to zero. We'll remove these nodes.

Here are the steps in more detail:
1. Initialize a dummy node to handle edge cases where the head node is part of the consecutive sequence to be removed.
2. Use a hashmap to store the prefix sum and the corresponding node.
3. Traverse the linked list and compute the prefix sum.
4. If the prefix sum has been seen before, it means the nodes in between sum to zero.
5. Remove these nodes by adjusting the pointers appropriately.

### Code

Here is how you can implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode* head) {
        unordered_map<int, ListNode*> prefixSumMap;
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        
        int prefixSum = 0;
        ListNode* current = dummy;
        
        while (current != nullptr) {
            prefixSum += current->val;
            if (prefixSumMap.count(prefixSum)) {
                ListNode* prevNode = prefixSumMap[prefixSum];
                ListNode* start = prevNode->next;
                
                int sum = prefixSum;
                while (start != current) {
                    sum += start->val;
                    prefixSumMap.erase(sum);
                    start = start->next;
                }
                
                prevNode->next = current->next;
            } else {
                prefixSumMap[prefixSum] = current;
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Key Parts
1. **Dummy Node:** `ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);`
   - Use a dummy node which will simplify the edge cases, especially if the head is part of the zero-sum sequence.
2. **Prefix Sum Map:** `unordered_map<int, ListNode*> prefixSumMap;`
   - This hashmap stores the accumulated prefix sum and the corresponding node.
3. **Traversing the List:** `while (current != nullptr) { ... }`
   - Traverse the list while updating the prefix sum.
   - Check if the prefix sum has been seen before to identify zero-sum subsequences.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(N)\) since each node in the list is processed at most twice (once when the prefix sum is calculated and once if we need to remove a zero-sum subsequence).

### Conclusion
This approach efficiently removes zero-sum consecutive nodes using prefix sums and a hash map to track previously seen sums, making it optimal for this problem.
