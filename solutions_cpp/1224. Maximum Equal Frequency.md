[Leetcode 1224. Maximum Equal Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1224)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray such that after deleting at most one element, every frequency (the number of occurrences of each distinct element) in this subarray is the same.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,5,3,3,5]
Output: 7
Explanation: The subarray [2,2,1,1,5,3,3] can be transformed into [2,2,1,1,5,5] (element `3` is deleted) or [2,2,1,1,3,3] (element `5` is deleted) to satisfy the condition: frequency of elements is {2, 2, 2}.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `nums`?
   - `nums` contains positive integers, possibly up to 10^5 in length with values as large as 10^5.

2. Is the problem asking for deletion of exactly one element, or is deletion optional?
   - Deletion of at most one element. This means it’s optional whether we delete one element or not.

3. What should be returned if there is no such subarray?
   - You should return 0, but given the constraints, there will always be at least one such subarray.

## Strategy
1. We need to maintain a count of occurrences for each element and a count of frequencies.
2. As we process each element of `nums`, we'll update these counts.
3. We'll use a sliding window approach to find the maximum length where there are only:
   - One unique frequency.
   - One frequency that is off by ±1 which can be made uniform by deleting a single element.
4. We'll use a data structure to keep track of the frequency counts and maximum frequency observed.

## Code
Here's a C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxEqualFreq(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq, count;
        int maxFreq = 0, res = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (count[nums[i]]) {
                // Decrease the frequency count for the old frequency
                freq[count[nums[i]]]--;
                if (freq[count[nums[i]]] == 0) {
                    freq.erase(count[nums[i]]);
                }
            }

            // Increase the count for this element
            count[nums[i]]++;
            // Increase the frequency count for the new frequency
            freq[count[nums[i]]]++;
            // Update maxFreq
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, count[nums[i]]);

            // Now check if the condition holds
            bool possible = false;
            if (freq.size() == 1) {
                // All counts are the same
                if (freq.begin()->first == 1 || freq.begin()->second == 1) {
                    possible = true;
                }
            } else if (freq.size() == 2) {
                auto it = freq.begin();
                int x1 = it->first, cnt1 = it->second;
                it++;
                int x2 = it->first, cnt2 = it->second;

                // Case 1: One element occurs maxFreq times, the rest maxFreq-1
                if ((cnt1 == 1 && (x1 == 1 || x1 == maxFreq + 1)) || 
                    (cnt2 == 1 && (x2 == 1 || x2 == maxFreq + 1))) {
                    possible = true;
                }
                // Case 2: All elements occur maxFreq times, except one element with a count of 1
                if ((x1 == maxFreq && cnt1 == 1) || (x2 == maxFreq && cnt2 == 1)) {
                    possible = true;
                }
            }

            if (possible) {
                res = i + 1;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), as we loop through the `nums` array only once, and all operations within the loop (hashmap operations) are average O(1) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), used for the hashmaps to store frequencies and counts of elements.
