[Leetcode 3019. Number of Changing Keys](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3019)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` that contains only lowercase English letters. A "changing key-out" substring is one that contains a sequence of characters where each character appears the same number of times. Your task is to find the number of such substrings in the string `s`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**: What is the length of the string `s`? 
    * This helps in determining the approach and efficiency we need.
2. **Output**: Should the output be the number of substrings, or should we print each substring?
    * Here, the problem seems to ask for a count.
3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases we should consider such as an empty string or a string with a single character?

For this example, I will assume:
- Length of `s` is within reasonable limits for typical coding interviews (e.g., up to 10^5).
- Only the count of substrings is required.
- Standard edge cases (like empty strings) will be taken into consideration.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize**: Create a map to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
2. **Two-pointer Technique**: Use two pointers (say `left` and `right`) to represent the current window of the substring.
3. **Balance Checking**: For each character added to the window, check if the current window is a valid "changing key-out" substring.
4. **Expand and Contract**: Expand the right pointer to include more characters in the window; contract the left pointer to reduce from the left when the substring is valid.
5. **Count Substrings**: Keep a count of valid substrings found during the process.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool is_valid(const unordered_map<char, int>& freq) {
    if (freq.empty()) return true;
    int count = freq.begin()->second;
    for (const auto& [char_, cnt] : freq) {
        if (cnt != count) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

int countChangingKeyOutSubstrings(const string& s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int count = 0;

    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            freq[s[end]]++;
            if (is_valid(freq)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cout << "Enter the string: ";
    cin >> s;

    cout << "Number of changing key-out substrings: " << countChangingKeyOutSubstrings(s) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Outer Loop**: Runs `n` times representing the start pointer.
- **Inner Loop**: In the worst case, this runs `n` times for each start position.
- **Validation**: Validating the current window to ensure equality of character counts takes `O(26)` i.e., `O(1)` time since there are at most 26 lowercase English letters.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`. This is efficient enough given our constraints within typical coding interviews.

**Edge Cases**:
- **Empty String**: The function will correctly return `0`.
- **Single Character String**: This will return `1`.

This approach ensures all substrings are correctly evaluated for the frequency property, and counts are maintained efficiently using hashing (unordered_map).
