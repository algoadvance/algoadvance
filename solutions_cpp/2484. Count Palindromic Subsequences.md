[Leetcode 2484. Count Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2484)
## Problem Statement
Given a string s, return the number of palindromic subsequences in the string. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the length of the string \( s \)?
   - Are there any specific constraints related to the characters in \( s \)?
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the result be returned as an integer count?
   
3. **Subsequences**:
   - Should both single character and multi-character palindromic subsequences be counted?
   - Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?

## Strategy

To address the problem, consider the following approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   Utilize a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   Every single character is a palindromic subsequence by itself. Therefore initialize the diagonal `dp[i][i] = 1`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then all subsequences between `i+1` and `j-1` can be enclosed by `s[i]` and `s[j]` to form new palindromic subsequences, plus we need to count the palindromic subsequences from `i+1` to `j-1`, plus 2 more for the new palindromes `s[i]` and `s[j]`.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, then the number of palindromic subsequences is the sum of the palindromic subsequences in the range `[i+1, j]` and `[i, j-1]` minus the overlap (i.e., `dp[i+1][j-1]`).

4. **Construct the DP Table**:
   Fill the table in such a way that smaller substrings are computed first and used in longer substrings.

5. **Result**:
   The result will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string.

Here is the code implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int countPalindromicSubsequences(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    vector<vector<long long>> dp(n, vector<long long>(n, 0));
    long long mod = 1000000007;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i][i] = 1; // Every single character is a palindrome
    }
    
    for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j-1] + 1) % mod;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i+1][j-1] + mod) % mod;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n-1];
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\). We're filling an \( n \times n \) table with each cell being computed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\). We use a 2D table to store the number of palindromic subsequences for each substring.

This approach ensures an efficient solution within the constraints generally expected in coding interview settings.
