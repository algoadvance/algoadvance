[Leetcode 1405. Longest Happy String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1405)
## Problem Statement
A string is called `happy` if it does not have any of the substrings "aaa", "bbb" or "ccc". Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return any longest possible happy string containing at most `a` 'a' letters, `b` 'b' letters, and `c` 'c' letters. If there is no such string, return the empty string `""`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c`?**
   - Typically, they will be non-negative integers with some upper bound, but it is safe to assume they are relatively moderate, say, up to 100.

2. **What should we return if multiple results are possible?**
   - Any valid result is acceptable as long as it meets the criteria of being the longest possible happy string without "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc" substrings.

3. **Should we consider the result to be case-sensitive?**
   - For this problem, only lowercase characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' are used.

## Strategy
We need to construct the string in such a way that avoids the forbidden substrings while being as long as possible. A greedy approach can be effective, where we always try to append the most abundant character next, as long as it does not form a forbidden substring. 

1. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap) Approach:**
   - Use a max-heap to keep track of the counts of characters.
   - At each step, pick the character with the highest count that does not violate the happy string condition, append it to the result, and decrement its count.
   - If the most frequent character cannot be used due to the last two characters being the same, we temporarily use the next most frequent character from the heap.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all counts are zero, return an empty string.
   - Ensure proper handling when some characters deplete faster than others.

## Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

struct CharCount {
    char ch;
    int count;
    
    bool operator<(const CharCount& other) const {
        return count < other.count;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    string longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        priority_queue<CharCount> pq;
        if (a > 0) pq.push({'a', a});
        if (b > 0) pq.push({'b', b});
        if (c > 0) pq.push({'c', c});
        
        string result;
        
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            CharCount first = pq.top(); pq.pop();
            
            if (result.size() >= 2 && result[result.size() - 1] == first.ch && result[result.size() - 2] == first.ch) {
                if (pq.empty()) break;
                
                CharCount second = pq.top(); pq.pop();
                result += second.ch;
                if (--second.count > 0) {
                    pq.push(second);
                }
                pq.push(first);
            } else {
                result += first.ch;
                if (--first.count > 0) {
                    pq.push(first);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n log k)**, where `n` is the number of characters in the resultant string (upper bounded by `a + b + c`), and `k` is the number of different types of characters (which is 3 in this case). Each push and pop operation from the priority queue (heap) takes logarithmic time.
