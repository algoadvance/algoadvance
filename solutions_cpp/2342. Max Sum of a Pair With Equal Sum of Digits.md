[Leetcode 2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2342)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums` containing positive integers, you need to find the maximum sum of a pair of numbers such that the sum of the digits of the two numbers is equal. If no such pairs exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the range of the numbers in the array?**
   - Usually, the range is defined by the problem constraints. We should assume typical constraints for interview problems unless specified, like integers fitting within the standard 32-bit integer range.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicates.

3. **What if there are multiple pairs with the same digit sum but different sums?**
   - We only care about the maximum sum of any pair where the sum of the digits is the same.

### Strategy:

1. **Helper Function**: Create a helper function to compute the sum of digits of a number.
2. **Map to Store Digit Sums**: Use a `unordered_map` where the key is the digit sum and the value is a vector of numbers with that digit sum.
3. **Process the Array**:
   - For each number in the array, compute the digit sum and store it in the map.
4. **Find Maximum Pair Sum**:
   - Iterate through the map and for each key (digit sum), if there are at least two numbers, sort them and compute the maximum pair sum.
   - Track the overall maximum sum found.
5. **Return Result**:
   - If no valid pair is found, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the found max pair sum.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int sumOfDigits(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

int maxSumOfPairWithEqualDigitSum(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> digitSumMap;

    // Fill the map with digit sums
    for (int num : nums) {
        int digitSum = sumOfDigits(num);
        digitSumMap[digitSum].push_back(num);
    }

    int maxSum = -1;

    // Iterate over the map to find the maximum pair sum
    for (const auto& entry : digitSumMap) {
        const vector<int>& values = entry.second;
        if (values.size() > 1) {
            // Sort the values to get the two largest elements
            vector<int> sortedValues = values;
            sort(sortedValues.begin(), sortedValues.end(), greater<int>());
            
            // Check the sum of the two largest elements
            int pairSum = sortedValues[0] + sortedValues[1];
            maxSum = max(maxSum, pairSum);
        }
    }

    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {51, 71, 17, 42};
    cout << maxSumOfPairWithEqualDigitSum(nums) << endl;  // Output should be 93
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sum of Digits Calculation**: O(log10(N)) for each number, where N is the value of the number.
- **Filling the Map**: O(N * log10(M)) where N is the number of elements in `nums` and M is the maximum value in `nums`.
- **Sorting**: In the worst case, each bucket in the map could contain all N elements, leading to O(N log N) for each key.
- **Overall Complexity**: Considering all these, the overall time complexity is approximately **O(N log N)** where N is the number of elements in the array.

### Summary:

We leveraged the use of a map to group numbers by their digit sum and then found the maximum pair sum efficiently by sorting the groups. This approach balances clarity and efficiency for the given problem.
