[Leetcode 392. Is Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l392)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if either `s` or `t` is an empty string?**
   - If `s` is empty, it is trivially a subsequence of `t`, so return `true`.
   - If `t` is empty and `s` is not, return `false` since a non-empty string cannot be a subsequence of an empty string.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of `s` and `t`?**
   - Both `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.
   - The length of `s` and `t` can be up to 10^4.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize pointers:** Use two pointers, one for `s` (let's call it `i`) and one for `t` (let's call it `j`).
2. **Iterate through `t`:** Traverse the string `t` using the pointer `j`. Each time a character in `t` matches the character in `s` at pointer `i`, increment `i`.
3. **Check for completion:** If pointer `i` reaches the end of `s` (`i == s.length()`), it means all characters of `s` have been matched in order in `t`, so return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool isSubsequence(const std::string& s, const std::string& t) {
    int i = 0;  // Pointer for s
    int j = 0;  // Pointer for t

    while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
        if (s[i] == t[j]) {
            i++;
        }
        j++;
    }

    return i == s.length();
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abc";
    std::string t = "ahbgdc";
    
    bool result = isSubsequence(s, t);
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << result << std::endl;  // Should print "true"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. This is because we perform at most one pass through each string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few integer variables for pointers and the rest is constant space.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, making use of two-pointer technique which is appropriate given the constraints.
