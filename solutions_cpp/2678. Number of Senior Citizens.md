[Leetcode 2678. Number of Senior Citizens](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2678)
### Problem Statement

Given a data structure that holds the ages of a group of people, write a function to return the number of senior citizens in the group. A senior citizen is defined as someone who is at least 65 years old.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What data structure holds the ages?**
   - A vector of integers representing the ages.

2. **Can the ages data structure contain invalid ages (e.g., negative numbers or numbers greater than something like 130)?**
   - This is an edge case we can consider. We'll assume for now that all ages are valid integers within a reasonable range.

3. **Is the vector always non-empty, or do we need to handle empty input too?**
   - We need to handle empty input gracefully.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to 0.
2. **Iterate through the Ages**: For each age in the vector, check if it is greater than or equal to 65.
3. **Increment the Counter**: If the age is 65 or older, increment the counter.
4. **Return the Counter**: Once all ages have been checked, return the counter.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int countSeniorCitizens(const std::vector<int>& ages) {
    int seniorCount = 0;
    for (int age : ages) {
        if (age >= 65) {
            seniorCount++;
        }
    }
    return seniorCount;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Definition**: The function `countSeniorCitizens` takes a constant reference to a `std::vector<int>` which holds the ages.
2. **Initialize Counter**: We initialize an integer `seniorCount` to 0.
3. **Loop through Ages**: We use a range-based for loop to iterate through each age in the vector.
4. **Increment if Condition Met**: If the current age is 65 or more, we increment `seniorCount`.
5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, we return the value of `seniorCount`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector. We need to iterate through each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space (the integer `seniorCount`).

This straightforward approach ensures efficient counting with minimal overhead.
