[Leetcode 2980. Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2980)
## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer n, you need to determine whether the bitwise OR of this number and any one-bit number (i.e., a number that has exactly one 1-bit) has trailing zeros. Trailing zeros are zeros in the least significant positions of a binary number.

**Example:**

1. Input: n = 8 (binary representation: 1000)
   Output: True
   Explanation: The bitwise OR of 8 with 1s at positions 0, 1, and 2 does not have trailing zeros, but with 1 at position 3, it still has trailing zeros. As there exists at least one one-bit number that when OR'ed with 8 still results in trailing zeros, the result is True.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What range can the input integer `n` fall within?**
   - Typically, `n` will be a non-negative integer within the range of 32-bit or 64-bit integers.
  
2. **What will be considered as trailing zeros?**
   - Trailing zeros refer to sequences of zeros that occur at the end of the binary representation of the number.

## Strategy

1. **Understand trailing zeros and bitwise OR operation**:
   - Trailing zeros in a number `n` can be observed by looking at the binary form from the least significant bit onwards.
   - The number of trailing zeros in `n` can be determined using `n & (-n)`, which gives us the least significant 1-bit as a power of two. The number of trailing zeros corresponds to the position of this bit.

2. **Evaluate different cases**:
   - If `n` has trailing zeros, then the bitwise OR with any number that has the 1-bit higher than or equal to the position of the least significant 1-bit of n will keep the trailing zeros intact.

3. **Procedure to determine trailing zeros**:
   - Get the number of trailing zeros in `n`.
   - Loop through one-bit numbers with a `1` in positions greater than or equal to the position of the least significant 1-bit of `n` to see if trailing zeros are maintained.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

bool hasTrailingZeros(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return true; // OR with any 1-bit number will be non-zero, hence will have trailing zeros.
    }
    
    // Calculate the number of trailing zeros in n
    int trailingZerosCount = __builtin_ctz(n);
    
    // Generate a number with exactly one 1-bit in the position `trailingZerosCount`
    int positionBit = 1 << trailingZerosCount;
    
    // Check if OR operation with this number maintains trailing zeros
    int result = n | positionBit;
    return (__builtin_ctz(result) > trailingZerosCount);
}

int main() {
    int n = 8; // Example input
    bool result = hasTrailingZeros(n);
    std::cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because:
1. Calculating the number of trailing zeros using `__builtin_ctz` is a constant time operation, which is hardware-assisted.
2. The bitwise OR operation is also a constant time operation.
3. The operations and condition checks are performed in constant time.

Thus, this approach has efficient time complexity suitable for a competitive programming environment.
