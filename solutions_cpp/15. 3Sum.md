[Leetcode 15. 3Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l15)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, are there elements `a`, `b`, `c` in `nums` such that `a + b + c = 0`? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicate numbers?**
    - Yes, the array can contain duplicate numbers.
 
2. **What should be returned if no triplets are found?**
    - If no triplets are found, return an empty list.
  
3. **Is the order of the triplets in the output important?**
    - No, the order of triplets in the output is not important.

4. **What about the space and time complexity constraints?**
    - Optimize for better time complexity; a solution better than O(n^3) is preferred, and keep additional space usage in mind.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Begin by sorting the array. This will simplify the process of avoiding duplicates and using a two-pointer approach.
2. **Iterate with a Fixed Element**: Use a variable `i` to iterate through the array, considering each element as the potential first element of the triplet.
3. **Two-Pointer Approach for Remaining Two Elements**: For each fixed element `nums[i]`, use two pointers (`left` starting from `i+1` and `right` starting from the end of the array) to find pairs whose sum equals `-nums[i]`.
4. **Skip Duplicates**: To ensure the uniqueness of triplets, skip over duplicate elements by advancing the pointers past duplicate values.
5. **Collect Valid Triplets**: If a valid triplet `(nums[i], nums[left], nums[right])` is found, add it to the results and continue adjusting the left and right pointers, skipping any duplicates encountered.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
- The iteration of the array with two pointers takes O(n^2) in the worst case.

Thus, the time complexity is O(n^2).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> threeSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int n = nums.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; ++i) {
        // Skip duplicate elements for the first element of the triplet
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
        
        int left = i + 1;
        int right = n - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum == 0) {
                result.push_back({nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]});
                // Skip duplicate elements for the second and third elements of the triplet
                while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) ++left;
                while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) --right;
                ++left;
                --right;
            } else if (sum < 0) {
                ++left;
            } else {
                --right;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This code implements the strategy described and ensures that all triplets are unique by skipping over duplicates in both the initial iteration and the two-pointer process.
