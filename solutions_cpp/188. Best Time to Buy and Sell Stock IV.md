[Leetcode 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l188)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of k?**
   - k can be any non-negative integer, but if it's very large, it should be treated specially.
   
2. **What is the range of `prices`?**
   - The array `prices` can have any length, and the prices are integers.

3. **Can prices be negative?**
   - Typically in stock price problems, prices are non-negative.

4. **What should be returned if the `prices` array is empty or if `k` is 0?**
   - If `prices` is empty or `k` is 0, the maximum profit is 0.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a two-dimensional DP array `dp[i][j]` where:
     - `i` is the transaction count index (up to `k` transactions).
     - `j` is the day index in the `prices` array.
     - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit using at most `i` transactions up to day `j`.
  
2. **Transition Formula:**
   - The state transitions can be defined as:
     - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + maxDiff)`
     - `maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i-1][j-1] - prices[j])`
   
3. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the `dp` array with zeros.
   - Initialize `maxDiff` for each transaction level starting from negative infinity.

### Special Case:
   - If `k >= n/2`, where `n` is the number of days, then it is equivalent to having as many transactions as needed, so we use the simpler algorithm for unlimited transactions.

### Time Complexity:
   - The time complexity of this algorithm is O(k * n) where `k` is the number of transactions and `n` is the number of days.

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n == 0 || k == 0) return 0;

        // If k >= n/2, then it's essentially the unlimited transactions problem
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            return maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions(prices);
        }

        vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i-1][j-1] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][n-1];
    }

private:
    int maxProfitUnlimitedTransactions(const vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (size_t i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

This solution covers all edge cases, handles time efficiently, and adheres to the constraints given in the problem statement.
