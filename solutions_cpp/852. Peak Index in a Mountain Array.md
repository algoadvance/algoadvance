[Leetcode 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l852)
## Problem Statement

Given a mountain array `arr`, return the index `i` such that the following conditions hold:

- `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
- `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

You must solve it in `O(log(arr.length))` time complexity.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The length of `arr` will be at least 3.
- `arr` will be a mountain array (i.e., there exists exactly one `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to be a valid mountain array?**
   - Yes, it is explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

2. **Can there be duplicate values in the array?**
   - No, given the description, the array values are strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing.

## Strategy

Given the constraints and the requirement for O(log n) time complexity, a binary search approach is ideal.

- **Binary Search Approach**: 
  - Initialize two pointers: `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
  - Calculate the mid-point index.
  - Compare the middle element `arr[mid]` with the next element `arr[mid+1]`:
    - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, it means we are in the ascending part of the mountain, and the peak must be to the right of `mid`. Move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
    - If `arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]`, it means we are in the descending part of the mountain, and the peak can be at `mid` or to its left. Move the `right` pointer to `mid`.
  - Continue until `left` equals `right`. The `left` (or `right`) will be the peak index.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int peakIndexInMountainArray(std::vector<int>& arr) {
        int left = 0, right = arr.size() - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]) {
                // We are in the ascending part of the mountain
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // We are in the descending part of the mountain, or at the peak
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        // left and right converge to the peak index
        return left;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(log n)** because we are performing a binary search on the array.
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as no additional space is used except for a few variables for indexing.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the peak index in the mountain array using the constraints provided.
