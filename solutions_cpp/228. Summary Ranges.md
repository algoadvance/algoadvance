[Leetcode 228. Summary Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l228)
### Problem Statement

You are given a sorted unique integer array `nums`.

A range `[a,b]` is the smallest interval that includes every number between `a` and `b` (inclusive). In this case, if `a` != `b`, "a->b" should be returned instead of "a".

Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

### Example

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["0->2","4->5","7"]
```

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we return if the input list is empty?
   **A:** Return an empty list.

2. **Q:** Are the numbers in the input list always sorted in ascending order?
   **A:** Yes, they are always sorted and unique.

3. **Q:** Can elements in `nums` be negative or are they always non-negative?
   **A:** Elements can be negative.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Initialize an empty result vector `ranges` and two pointers, `start` and `end`, to traverse the list.
2. **Traversal:** Iterate through the array while keeping track of ranges.
   - If the current element continues the previous range (i.e., it is one more than the previous element), extend the current range.
   - If it doesn't, close the current range and start a new one.
3. **Range Closure:** Add the current range to the result when you find the end of a range.
4. **Final Check:** If there's any range left unadded after the loop, add it to the result.
5. **Edge Cases:** Handle scenarios where the array is empty or contains just one element.

### Code

Here's the C++ code to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

vector<string> summaryRanges(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<string> ranges;
    if (nums.empty()) return ranges;
    
    int n = nums.size();
    int start = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Check if it's the end of the range
        if (i == n || nums[i] != nums[i - 1] + 1) {
            // Add the range to the result
            if (start == i - 1) {
                ranges.push_back(to_string(nums[start]));
            } else {
                ranges.push_back(to_string(nums[start]) + "->" + to_string(nums[i - 1]));
            }
            // Update start for the next range
            start = i;
        }
    }
    
    return ranges;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - The list is traversed once, which gives a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` for the extra space used, not counting the space needed for the output, which is proportional to the number of ranges created.
