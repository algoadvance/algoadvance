[Leetcode 1652. Defuse the Bomb](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1652)
### Problem Statement

You have a bomb to defuse, and your experience tells you that defusing it will be much easier once you understand the code used to create this bomb.

You are given an integer array `code` and an integer `k`. The array `code` is of length `n` and is indexed from `0` to `n - 1`. The rounding rule for calculating the array value at index `i` is as follows:

- If `k > 0`, replace the element at index `i` with the sum of the next `k` elements.
- If `k < 0`, replace the element at index `i` with the sum of the previous `|k|` elements.
- If `k == 0`, replace the element at index `i` with `0`.

As `code` is circular, the next element of `code[n-1]` is `code[0]`, and the previous element of `code[0]` is `code[n-1]`.

Return the transformed array `code` into the new array as described above.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain any integers.
2. **What is the range of values for `k`?**
   - `k` can be any integer between `-n` and `n` inclusive.
3. **What constraints do we have on the length of the array `n`?**
   - The length of the array `n` will be between `1` and `10000`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `k == 0`, return an array of zeroes of the same length as `code`.
   
2. **Create the Circular Array:**
   - Since the array is circular, we need to handle wrap-around indices properly. This can be managed by treating the array as circular using modulo arithmetic.

3. **Iterate and Compute:**
   - For each element in the array, compute the sum of the next/previous `k` elements based on the value of `k`.
   - Use a sliding window approach where we keep a sum of the current window and adjust it as we slide through the array.

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves iterating through the array once to compute the sums, leading to a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for the problem's constraint.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> decrypt(vector<int>& code, int k) {
    int n = code.size();
    vector<int> result(n, 0);
    
    if (k == 0) {
        return result;
    }
    
    int start = k > 0 ? 1 : k;
    int end = k > 0 ? k : -1;
    int current_sum = 0;
    
    // Initial window sum calculation
    for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
        current_sum += code[(i + n) % n];
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        result[i] = current_sum;
        
        // Slide window right
        current_sum -= code[(i + start + n) % n];
        current_sum += code[(i + end + 1 + n) % n];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a result vector initialized to zero.
   - Handle the special case where `k == 0`.

2. **Sliding Window Setup:**
   - Depending on whether `k` is positive or negative, set up the initial sum of the window.
   - Use modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the array.

3. **Sliding the Window:**
   - For each position in the array, update the result with the current sum.
   - Slide the window by subtracting the element that is out of the window and adding the next element to the window.
   - Use modulo to ensure indices stay within bounds.

By following this approach, we ensure that the array is correctly transformed as per the problem's requirements in an efficient manner.
