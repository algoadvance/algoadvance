[Leetcode 2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2864)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary string `s`, you need to rearrange the characters of `s` such that the resultant binary number is the largest possible odd binary number. 

A binary number is odd if its last digit is `1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected input format?**
   - The input is a string `s` consisting only of `'0'` and `'1'`.

2. **What should be returned?**
   - The function should return the largest possible odd binary number that can be formed by rearranging the characters of `s`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - There may be a problem-specific constraint, but generally, a reasonable length constraint would be manageable within typical limits.

### Strategy
To form the largest possible binary number, you need to ensure the most significant bits are `1`s. However, to ensure the binary number is odd, its last digit must be `1`.

1. **Count the number of `1`s and `0`s** in the string.
2. **Place the largest possible `1`s** in the highest order positions but preserve at least one `1` to ensure the number ends in `1`.
3. **Fill the remaining positions with `0`s**.

### Steps
1. Count the occurrences of `1`s and `0`s.
2. Construct the largest number possible with all `1`s first except for one `1` at the end.
3. Append all `0`s.
4. Ensure the last digit is `1`.

### Code

Here is a C++ function to implement the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string maximumOddBinaryNumber(std::string s) {
    int count1 = std::count(s.begin(), s.end(), '1');
    int count0 = s.size() - count1;

    std::string result(count1 - 1, '1'); // Place count1-1 1's first
    result.append(count0, '0'); // Then append count0 0's
    result.append(1, '1'); // Finally append the last 1

    return result;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Count the `1`s and `0`s**:
   - `count1`: Total count of `1`s in the string.
   - `count0`: Total count of `0`s in the string (can be derived from total length - count1).

2. **Construct the result string**:
   - Start with `count1 - 1` `1`s to make the number as large as possible.
   - Append all the `0`s.
   - Finally, append a `1` to ensure the number is odd.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string, as we traverse the string to count `1`s and `0`s once and construct the new string in linear time.

This approach ensures we achieve the largest possible odd binary number by maximizing the number of leading `1`s and ensuring the last digit is `1`.
