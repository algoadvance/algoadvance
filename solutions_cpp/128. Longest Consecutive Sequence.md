[Leetcode 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l128)
### Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can `nums` contain duplicate elements? 
   - What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?
   
2. **Output**:
   - What should be returned if `nums` is an empty array?

#### Assumptions
1. `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
2. An empty array should return 0 as there are no consecutive sequences.

### Strategy
To achieve the `O(n)` time complexity:
1. **Using a Hash Set**:
   - Insert all elements into a hash set. This allows for `O(1)` average-time complexity checks for the presence of elements.
   
2. **Check for Starting Points**:
   - Iterate through each element in the list. For each element, check if it is the start of a sequence by checking if `element-1` does not exist in the set.
   - If it is the start of a sequence, expand the sequence by continuously checking the existence of the next element (`element + k`) in the set.
   
3. **Track the Longest Sequence**:
   - Keep track of the maximum length of consecutive sequences found.

### Code
Here's the C++ code that implements this strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;

        unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int longestStreak = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            // Check if it's the start of a sequence
            if (!numSet.count(num - 1)) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;

                // Check the length of the current streak
                while (numSet.count(currentNum + 1)) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }

                longestStreak = max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
            }
        }
        
        return longestStreak;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - Creating the hash set takes `O(n)` time.
  - The while loop inside the for loop will run at most `n` times total across all iterations because each element is checked only once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - Because we're storing all elements in a hash set, the space complexity is also `O(n)`.
