[Leetcode 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2458)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and an array 'queries' of integers. Each integer in the query array represents a node in the tree. For each query, remove the subtree rooted at that node and return the height of the tree after the removal.

The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

You need to return an array of heights, one for each query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a valid query?**
   Each query consists of an integer representing a node value present in the tree.

2. **What is the definition of the height of a tree in this problem?**
   The height of the tree is defined as the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf node.

3. **What should we return if the root node itself is removed?**
   If the root is removed, the height of the tree is zero.

4. **What is the structure of the tree node?**
   Each tree node has an integer value and pointers to its left and right children.
   
### Strategy

Our goal is to determine the height of the binary tree after removing the subtree rooted at each queried node. We will execute the following steps for a solution:

1. **Calculate Initial Tree Height:**
   - Compute the height of the binary tree before any removals.
   
2. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, simulate the removal of the subtree rooted at the node specified by the query.
   - If a subtree is removed, calculate the new height of the remaining tree.
   
3. **Tree Traversal and Height Calculation:**
   - We need a utility function to compute the height of a subtree.
   - Use depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree, and recalculate heights post-removal.
   
### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    std::unordered_map<TreeNode*, int> height_cache;

    int height(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        if (height_cache.count(root)) return height_cache[root];  
        height_cache[root] = 1 + std::max(height(root->left), height(root->right));
        return height_cache[root];
    }

    std::vector<int> treeHeightAfterQueries(TreeNode* root, const std::vector<int>& queries) {
        std::vector<int> result;
        height(root); // Pre-cache all subtree heights

        for (int query : queries) {
            TreeNode* node_to_remove = findNode(root, query);
            if (!node_to_remove) {
                result.push_back(height(root));
                continue;
            }

            int new_height = calculateTreeHeightAfterRemoval(root, node_to_remove);
            result.push_back(new_height);
        }

        return result;
    }

private:
    TreeNode* findNode(TreeNode* root, int value) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        if (root->val == value) return root;
        TreeNode* left_search = findNode(root->left, value);
        if (left_search) return left_search;
        return findNode(root->right, value);
    }

    int calculateTreeHeightAfterRemoval(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* node_to_remove) {
        if (root == node_to_remove) return 0;

        int left_height = (root->left == node_to_remove) ? 0 : height(root->left);
        int right_height = (root->right == node_to_remove) ? 0 : height(root->right);
        
        return 1 + std::max(left_height, right_height);
    }
};
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Height Function:** 
   Computes the height of the tree and caches results to reduce recomputation.

2. **Find Node Function:** 
   Locates the node in the tree corresponding to the value in the query.

3. **Calculate Post-Removal Height:** 
   Calculates the height of the tree after removal of a subtree rooted at the queried node.
   
### Time Complexity

- **Height Calculation:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Query Handling:**
  - **FindNode Function:** O(N) for each query.
  - **Post-Removal Height Calculation:** O(1) if the height is precalculated.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(Q * N) where Q is the number of queries.

This solution leverages caching and efficient traversal strategies to handle potentially large trees and multiple queries effectively.
