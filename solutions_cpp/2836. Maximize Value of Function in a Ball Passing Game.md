[Leetcode 2836. Maximize Value of Function in a Ball Passing Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2836)
## Problem Statement
We'll be given integers `m` and `k`, and an array `arr` of integers. We're involved in a game where a ball is passed in a circular manner. The game allows each player to pass the ball either to the left or to the right. We need to select exactly `k` passes such that the sum of the values of the elements where the ball lands on each pass is maximized. The ball starts at any position.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints for the array `arr` and integers `m` and `k`?**
    - Is there a maximum size for `m` and `k`?
    - What are the minimum and maximum possible values in `arr`?
2. **Are negative elements allowed in `arr`?**
    - This will help to clarify edge cases for the sum calculation.
3. **Is `k` always less than or equal to `m`?**
    - Ensuring that the number of passes `k` does not exceed the number of players `m`.

Let's assume:
- `1 <= arr.length == m <= 10^5` (length of the array `arr` is equal to `m` and at most 100,000)
- `1 <= k <= m` (number of passes is at least 1 and at most `m`)
- `-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4` (elements in the array can be negative)

## Strategy
To maximize the sum of the elements where the ball lands on each pass:
1. **Utilize sliding window technique**:
    - Given the circular nature of the array, we can simulate the circular array using concatenation.
    - Calculate sums of subarrays of length `k` to find the maximum sum.
    - Efficiently find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` using a sliding window.

2. **Steps**:
    - Extend the array to simulate the circular nature.
    - Use a sliding window to find the maximum sum subarray of size `k`.

## Time Complexity
- **O(m)**: To compute the sums of all subarrays of length `k`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxFunctionValue(vector<int>& arr, int m, int k) {
    // Extend the array to simulate the circular property.
    vector<int> extendedArr(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i)
        extendedArr.push_back(arr[i]);

    // Sliding window to find maximum sum subarray of length k.
    int currentSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        currentSum += extendedArr[i];

    int maxSum = currentSum;

    for (int i = k; i < (int)extendedArr.size(); ++i) {
        currentSum += extendedArr[i] - extendedArr[i - k];
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }

    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, -2, 3, 4, -5, 6};
    int m = arr.size();
    int k = 3;
    cout << "Maximized Function Value: " << maxFunctionValue(arr, m, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extend the Array**: We simulate a circular array by concatenating the first `k-1` elements to the end of the array.
2. **Sliding Window**: We maintain a sliding window to calculate the sum of subarrays of length `k`. We then track and update the maximum sum encountered.

This solution ensures efficient handling of the circular array while maintaining simplicity in understanding the sliding window mechanism.
