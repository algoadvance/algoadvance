[Leetcode 2842. Count K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2842)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. A subsequence of `s` is defined as a string that can be derived by deleting some or none of the characters in `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters. The beauty of a string is defined as the number of distinct characters in it.

Your task is to count the number of k-length subsequences of `s` that have the maximum beauty. Return this count modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `1 <= k <= s.length`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of "maximum beauty"?**
   "Maximum beauty" refers to having the maximum number of distinct characters in the subsequence. 

2. **What should be returned if there are no k-length subsequences with maximum beauty?**
   The result should be 0, as there would be no valid subsequences.

3. **Should the output be modulo `10^9 + 7`?**
   Yes.

4. **Are there any specific examples or edge cases to consider?**
   Consider strings with repeated characters and strings where all characters are distinct to ensure understanding edge cases concerning distinct characters and subsequence length.

## Strategy
1. **Character Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Determine Maximum Beauty**: Identify the top `k` frequent characters since having more of these would help in maintaining the k-length subsequences.
3. **Combining Characters**: Use combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming to calculate the number of k-length subsequences using these most frequent characters.
4. **Modulo Operation**: As required, reduce results modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Here is a C++ implementation:

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

int countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(string s, int k) {
    unordered_map<char, int> frequency;
    for (char ch : s) {
        frequency[ch]++;
    }

    vector<int> freqList;
    for (auto &pair : frequency) {
        freqList.push_back(pair.second);
    }
    
    sort(freqList.rbegin(), freqList.rend());

    // Edge case: If k is greater than the number of unique characters
    if (k > freqList.size()) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Calculating the threshold frequency to be included in the subsequence
    int threshold = freqList[k - 1];
    
    // Counting how many numbers are the same as the threshold
    int countThreshold = count(freqList.begin(), freqList.end(), threshold);
    
    // Counting how many of the top k have the same frequency as the threshold
    int needed = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        if (freqList[i] == threshold) {
            needed++;
        }
    }
    
    // Combination function - nCk
    auto comb = [](int n, int k) -> long long {
        if (k > n) return 0;
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            result = result * (n - (i - 1)) / i;
            result %= MOD;
        }
        return result;
    };
    
    long long result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        result *= freqList[i];
        result %= MOD;
    }

    result = (result * comb(countThreshold, needed)) % MOD;
    
    return (int)result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "aabbcc";
    int k = 3;
    cout << countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(s, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Frequency Calculation**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
2. **Sorting the Frequencies**: `O(d log d)` where `d` is the number of distinct characters (at most 26).
3. **Combination Calculation**: Efficient combinatorial calculations can be considered `O(k)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(n + d log d)`, which simplifies to `O(n + log n)` considering the constraints.
