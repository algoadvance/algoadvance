[Leetcode 76. Minimum Window Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l76)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `""`.

### Example:
1. `Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`
   `Output: "BANC"`

2. `Input: s = "a", t = "a"`
   `Output: "a"`

3. `Input: s = "a", t = "aa"`
   `Output: "" (since there's no substring containing two 'a's)`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the characters in `s` and `t` case-sensitive?
   - Yes, "A" and "a" are considered different characters.
2. What should be returned if `t` is longer than `s`?
   - Return an empty string `""` since it's impossible to find such a substring.
3. Are there any constraints on the character set?
   - Both strings `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, a sliding window approach can be employed alongside two hash maps to keep track of the counts of characters in `t` and the current window in `s`:
1. Use two pointers to represent the current window, and a hash map to represent the character counts needed from `t`.
2. Expand the window by moving the right pointer to the right.
3. Once a valid window is found (one that contains all characters from `t`), try to contract it by moving the left pointer to the right to reduce the size while still maintaining all required characters.
4. Keep track of the minimum window size found during these operations.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(m + n)` where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of string `t`. This is because both pointers traverse the array at most once, and updating counts and checking conditions are done in constant time.

Here is the the implementation in C++:

## Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

string minWindow(string s, string t) {
    if (t.size() > s.size()) return "";
    
    unordered_map<char, int> t_count, window_count;
    
    for (char c : t) {
        t_count[c]++;
    }
    
    int required = t_count.size();
    int formed = 0;
    int l = 0, r = 0;
    
    int min_length = INT_MAX;
    int min_left = 0;

    while (r < s.size()) {
        char c = s[r];
        window_count[c]++;
        
        if (t_count.find(c) != t_count.end() && window_count[c] == t_count[c]) {
            formed++;
        }
        
        while (l <= r && formed == required) {
            c = s[l];
            
            if (r - l + 1 < min_length) {
                min_length = r - l + 1;
                min_left = l;
            }
            
            window_count[c]--;
            if (t_count.find(c) != t_count.end() && window_count[c] < t_count[c]) {
                formed--;
            }
            
            l++;
        }
        r++;
    }
    
    return (min_length == INT_MAX) ? "" : s.substr(min_left, min_length);
}
```

The above C++ solution defines the function `minWindow` which takes in two strings `s` and `t` and returns the minimum window substring such that all characters from `t` are included. The sliding window approach ensures both time and space efficiency.
