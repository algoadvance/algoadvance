[Leetcode 1032. Stream of Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1032)
## Problem Statement

Design an algorithm to manage a stream of characters and determine if a given sequence of characters has appeared in the stream as a suffix. You need to be able to efficiently process incoming characters and answer queries about whether a given string is a suffix of any previously seen characters.

### Requirements:
- Your class should have the following methods:
  - `StreamChecker(vector<string>& words)`: Initializes the object with a list of strings `words`.
  - `bool query(char letter)`: Returns `true` if any of the given `words` is a suffix of the characters read so far, otherwise returns `false`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the order of `words` important?**
   - No, the order is not important. We are only concerned with whether a word from the list appears as a suffix of the characters read so far.

2. **What is the maximum length of the words and the stream?**
   - Let's assume the length of the words and the total number of queries is within reasonable limits for memory usage and processing time (such boundaries are typically around 10^5 for competitive programming problems).

3. **Can there be repeated characters in the stream?**
   - Yes, any character can appear multiple times in the stream.

4. **How do we handle non-alphabetic characters?**
   - For simplicity, we'll assume the input consists only of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').

## Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we can use a Trie (prefix tree), but instead of storing the words in their standard order, we will store them in reversed order. This allows us to efficiently check if any suffix matches as we build our stream of characters.

### Steps:

1. **Reversed Trie Construction:**
   - Construct a Trie where each word is inserted in reversed order. This means that the suffixes of any word can be checked by traversing from the root to the leaf in the Trie.
   
2. **Query Processing:**
   - Maintain a current stream history using a list, deque, or similar structure where characters are appended as they are queried.
   - For each incoming character, traverse the Trie from the root using the current stream in reverse order (starting from the most recent character) to identify any matching suffixes.

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`StreamChecker`):** Constructing and inserting a word into the Trie takes \(O(n)\) per word where `n` is the length of the word. So, with m words of average length L, it takes \(O(m \cdot L)\).
- **Query (`query`):** Each query can take up to \(O(L)\) time, where \(L\) is the length of the longest word, as we need to check if the current stream matches any suffix by traversing the Trie.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <deque>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class StreamChecker {
public:
    struct TrieNode {
        unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
        bool isWord;
        TrieNode() : isWord(false) {}
    };
    
    TrieNode* root;
    deque<char> stream;
    int maxWordLength;

    StreamChecker(vector<string>& words) {
        root = new TrieNode();
        maxWordLength = 0;
        // Build the trie in reverse order
        for (const string& word : words) {
            TrieNode* node = root;
            int wordLength = word.size();
            maxWordLength = max(maxWordLength, wordLength);
            for (int i = wordLength - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
                char ch = word[i];
                if (!node->children[ch]) {
                    node->children[ch] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node->children[ch];
            }
            node->isWord = true;
        }
    }

    bool query(char letter) {
        stream.push_back(letter);
        if (stream.size() > maxWordLength) {
            stream.pop_front();
        }

        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (auto it = stream.rbegin(); it != stream.rend(); ++it) {
            char ch = *it;
            if (!node->children[ch]) return false;
            node = node->children[ch];
            if (node->isWord) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Trie Construction:**
   - We initialize a root node for the Trie and then insert each word in reverse order into the Trie.

2. **Query Method:**
   - We keep track of the stream of characters using a deque.
   - For each new character, we check if any suffix formed by the most recent characters in the stream matches an inserted word by traversing the Trie.
   - We only keep at most `maxWordLength` characters in the deque to limit the number of characters we need to check for each query.

This approach provides a balance between time complexity for insertion and querying, making it efficient for large streams and word lists.
