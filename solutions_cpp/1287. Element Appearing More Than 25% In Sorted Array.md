[Leetcode 1287. Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1287)
### Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array of integers `arr`, where each element appears at least once. Return any element that appears more than 25% of the time in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can there be multiple elements that appear more than 25% of the time?
   - **A**: The problem specifies returning any such element, so it is fine to return one if multiple exist.
   
2. **Q**: Can the array be empty?
   - **A**: The constraints are not explicit about an empty array, but since each element appears at least once, we can assume the array is not empty.

3. **Q**: What is the range of the array and size constraints?
   - **A**: Typically, interview problems assume reasonable constraints (e.g., `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4`).

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Requirement**: For an element to appear more than 25% of the time, it must be present at least `n / 4` times in the array, where `n` is the size of the array.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - For each candidate at positions `i`, `i + n/4`, `i + 2*n/4`, and `i + 3*n/4` (ensuring no index out of bounds):
     - Use binary search to determine the leftmost and rightmost positions of the candidate.
     - Check if the count of occurrences of the candidate is more than `n / 4`.
   - Return the first candidate that meets the condition.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int findSpecialInteger(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int threshold = n / 4;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += threshold) {
        int candidate = arr[i];
        auto lower = std::lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), candidate);
        auto upper = std::upper_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), candidate);
        
        if (upper - lower > threshold) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    
    // This point should never be reached because there is always an element that appears more than 25%
    return -1;  // For safe return
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6};
    std::cout << "Element Appearing More Than 25%: " << findSpecialInteger(arr) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Operations**: Each call to `std::lower_bound` and `std::upper_bound` takes `O(log n)` time.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `n / (n / 4) = 4` times.
- **Total Time Complexity**: `4 * (O(log n) + O(log n)) = O(log n)`.

This approach is efficient and leverages the sorted nature of the array to achieve logarithmic time complexity in searching for the boundaries.
