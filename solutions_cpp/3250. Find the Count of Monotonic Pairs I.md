[Leetcode 3250. Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3250)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers. You need to find the number of monotonic pairs. A pair `(i, j)` is considered monotonic if `i < j` and either `arr[i] <= arr[j]` (non-decreasing) or `arr[i] >= arr[j]` (non-increasing).

**Example:**

For the input array `arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]`, the monotonic pairs are:

- (0, 1) with elements (1, 3)
- (0, 2) with elements (1, 2)
- (0, 3) with elements (1, 4)
- (1, 2) with elements (3, 2)
- (1, 3) with elements (3, 4)
- (2, 3) with elements (2, 4)

The number of monotonic pairs is 6.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate values.
2. **What are the constraints on the array size (n) and element values?**
   - Assume the array size n can go up to 10,000, and elements range from `-10^5` to `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Naive Approach:**
   - Use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
   - For each pair, check if the pair is monotonic (either non-decreasing or non-increasing).
   - Increment a counter for each monotonic pair found.
   
2. **Optimization Insight:**
   - The problem constraints (with an array size up to 10,000) suggest that an O(n^2) solution may be feasible but could be optimized further with advanced algorithms like segment trees or like-wise optimal data structures. However, for the sake of simplicity and clarity, we'll stick to the naive approach initially.

### Time Complexity

- **Naive Approach:** O(n^2). This is due to the nested iteration where each element is compared with every other element ahead of it.

### Code

Let's implement the naive approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int countMonotonicPairs(const std::vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j] || arr[i] >= arr[j]) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 3, 2, 4};
    std::cout << "Number of monotonic pairs: " << countMonotonicPairs(arr) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Function `countMonotonicPairs`:**
   - Takes a constant reference to a vector of integers.
   - Initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - Uses a nested loop to iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
   - Checks if the pairs are monotonic (non-decreasing or non-increasing) and increments the counter if true.
   - Returns the final count of monotonic pairs.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Demonstrates the usage of the `countMonotonicPairs` function with an example array.
   - Outputs the number of monotonic pairs found.

For larger inputs, consider optimizing the approach based on additional theoretical insights, but the given method suffices for typical interview constraints.
