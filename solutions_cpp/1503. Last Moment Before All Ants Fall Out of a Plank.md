[Leetcode 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1503)
## Problem Statement
You are given a plank of length `n` units. Some ants are moving to the right, and some ants are moving to the left. Each ant moves at the same speed of 1 unit per second. When two ants move towards each other and collide, they both change their directions. As these ants keep moving, eventually, they will all fall off the plank.

You are given two integer arrays, `left` and `right`, representing the positions of ants moving to the left and the positions of ants moving to the right respectively.

Find the moment when the last ant falls off the plank.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can ants fall off the plank sooner if they change direction due to collisions?**
   - No, since each collision effectively leads to the same result as if two ants passed through each other due to the uniform speed and directions of ants.
   
2. **Do we need to consider the change of direction due to collisions to determine the final falling moment?**
   - No, the time of falling will remain the same whether they change directions or not because each ant keeps moving at the same speed, and ultimately the time to fall off the plank depends only on their initial positions.

3. **What are the constraints on the length `n` and the lengths of the arrays `left` and `right`?**
   - Typical constraints on these variables are not given, but we can assume they follow practical limits for competitive programming problems (e.g., `n` could be large, but not excessively so).

## Strategy
To find the last moment before all ants fall off the plank, we need to consider the following observations:
- Ants moving to the left from position `p` will fall off the plank at `p` seconds.
- Ants moving to the right from position `p` will fall off the plank at `n - p` seconds.
  
Given these observations, we:
1. Compute the maximum fall-off time for ants moving to the left.
2. Compute the maximum fall-off time for ants moving to the right.
3. The answer will be the maximum of these two values.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int getLastMoment(int n, std::vector<int>& left, std::vector<int>& right) {
    int lastMoment = 0;
    
    // Calculate the maximum time for ants moving to the left
    for (int pos : left) {
        lastMoment = std::max(lastMoment, pos);
    }
    
    // Calculate the maximum time for ants moving to the right
    for (int pos : right) {
        lastMoment = std::max(lastMoment, n - pos);
    }
    
    return lastMoment;
}

int main() {
    int n = 4;
    std::vector<int> left = {4, 3};
    std::vector<int> right = {0, 1};
    std::cout << "Last moment before all ants fall out: " << getLastMoment(n, left, right) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(L + R), where `L` is the size of the `left` array and `R` is the size of the `right` array.
- We use a single pass through each array to determine the maximum times, making the solution efficient.

By following the described strategy and utilizing the given code, we can efficiently determine the last moment before all ants fall off the plank.
