[Leetcode 1897. Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1897)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, determine if it is possible to redistribute the characters in `words` so that every string in `words` is equal. All words must contain the exact same characters in the same quantities after redistribution.

### Clarifying Questions
- **What is the minimum length of a word in the array?**
  - Each word has at least one character.
- **What is the maximum length of a word in the array, and how many words can `words` contain?**
  - Each word has a length between 1 and 1000, and the total number of words in the array is between 1 and 1000.
- **Are the characters limited to lowercase alphabets?**
  - Yes, only lowercase English letters are considered.
  
### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to check whether we can reorganize the characters such that every word becomes the same. Here is the approach:

1. **Count the total frequency of each character in the entire list of words.**
2. **For each character count, check if it can be evenly divided by the number of words.**
   - This ensures that each character can be evenly distributed across all words.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

bool makeEqual(vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
    
    int numWords = words.size();
    
    // Count the total occurrences of each character in all the words
    for (const string& word : words) {
        for (char ch : word) {
            charCount[ch]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Check if each character count is divisible by the number of words
    for (const auto &entry : charCount) {
        if (entry.second % numWords != 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Characters:** We iterate through all characters in all words, which is O(N * M) where N is the number of words and M is the maximum length of a word.
- **Checking Divisibility:** We check divisibility for each unique character, which is O(1) since the number of unique characters is constant (26 for lowercase English letters).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(N * M)**. This should be efficient given the constraints.
