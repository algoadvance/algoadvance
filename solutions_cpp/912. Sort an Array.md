[Leetcode 912. Sort an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l912)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of values for elements in `nums`? (e.g., are they all within a certain range like -10^5 to 10^5?)
    - Is there a constraint on the length of the array? (e.g., a minimum of zero elements and a maximum of 50000 elements)

2. **Output:**
    - Should the output be a new sorted array, or should the sorting be done in place?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - How should the solution handle an already sorted array?
    - How should the solution handle an array with all identical elements?
    - How should the solution handle an empty array?

### Strategy
To solve the problem, various sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort can be considered. Since the prompt does not specify space constraints, merge sort is a good candidate due to its stable sort properties and O(n log n) time complexity.

### Time Complexity
- **Merge Sort:**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
  - **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the auxiliary space used for merging.

### Code

Here we will use Merge Sort:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() <= 1) return nums;
        mergeSort(nums, 0, nums.size()-1);
        return nums;
    }

private:
    void mergeSort(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {
        if (left >= right) return;

        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        mergeSort(nums, left, mid);
        mergeSort(nums, mid + 1, right);
        merge(nums, left, mid, right);
    }

    void merge(vector<int>& nums, int left, int mid, int right) {
        vector<int> leftPart(nums.begin() + left, nums.begin() + mid + 1);
        vector<int> rightPart(nums.begin() + mid + 1, nums.begin() + right + 1);

        int l = 0, r = 0, k = left;
        while (l < leftPart.size() && r < rightPart.size()) {
            if (leftPart[l] <= rightPart[r]) {
                nums[k++] = leftPart[l++];
            } else {
                nums[k++] = rightPart[r++];
            }
        }

        while (l < leftPart.size()) {
            nums[k++] = leftPart[l++];
        }

        while (r < rightPart.size()) {
            nums[k++] = rightPart[r++];
        }
    }
};

// Test the function
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {5, 2, 3, 1};
    vector<int> sortedNums = solution.sortArray(nums);

    for (int num : sortedNums) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Main Function (`sortArray`):**
   - Handles the base case of an array with one or zero elements.
   - Calls the `mergeSort` function with the full range of the array.

2. **`mergeSort` Function:**
   - Recursively splits the array into halves until each subarray has one element.
   - Calls `merge` to combine the sorted subarrays.

3. **`merge` Function:**
   - Creates temporary arrays for both halves of the array to be merged.
   - Merges these arrays back into the original array in sorted order.

By breaking down the array until they are trivially sorted (single-element arrays) and merging them back together in a way that results in sorted order, merge sort ensures O(n log n) time complexity for sorting.
