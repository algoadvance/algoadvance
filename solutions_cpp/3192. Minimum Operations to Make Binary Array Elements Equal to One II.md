[Leetcode 3192. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3192)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary array `nums`. A binary array only contains `0`s and `1`s. In one operation, you can:
- Choose two different indices `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i, j < len(nums)`, and `i != j`, and change `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` to `1`.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the binary array equal to `1`. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the array?**
   - The typical length of the array can be large, which could affect the time complexity of the approach.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the array contains some `1`s?**
   - If the array contains no `1`s, it would be impossible to make all elements `1`s.

3. **Can I assume the input is always a valid binary array?**
   - Confirm whether the array is constrained to contain only `0` and `1`.

## Strategy

1. **Count the Number of `1`s and `0`s:**
   - Calculate the number of `0`s and `1`s in the array.
   - If there are no `1`s, return `-1` since it is impossible to make all elements `1`.

2. **Determine the Minimum Operations:**
   - Each operation produces two `1`s. Therefore, if there are `n` `0`s, approximately `n // 2` operations are needed (assuming there are enough `1`s initially to facilitate the operations).

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the number of `0`s is odd, you will need an extra operation because pairing will skip one element.

## Time Complexity

- **Counting `0`s and `1`s: O(n)**
  - Since the array is traversed once to count the `0`s and `1`s.
- **Operation Calculation: O(1)**
  - Simple arithmetic operations to determine the minimal number of steps.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int countOnes = 0;
        int countZeros = 0;
        
        for(int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                countOnes++;
            } else {
                countZeros++;
            }
        }
        
        if (countOnes == 0) return -1; // If no 1s present, impossible
        
        int operations = (countZeros + 1) / 2; // Every pair of zeros can be changed to ones with one operation
        return operations;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0};
    std::cout << sol.minOperations(nums) << std::endl; // Expected output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

This approach makes sure we cover all scenarios efficiently, ensuring correctness and performance.
