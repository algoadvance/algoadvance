[Leetcode 2106. Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2106)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D index `fruits` and an integer `k`. The `fruits` array contains pairs `[position, amount]`, where `position` represents the location of the fruits on a one-dimensional axis, and `amount` is the number of fruits at that position. 

You start at position 0 and can move to the left or right. In one step, you can move to the position `position - 1` or `position + 1`. You can pick all fruits at each position. You need to return the maximum number of fruits you can collect in at most `k` steps.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the positions have fruit amounts of zero?
2. Are the positions sorted or should we consider sorting them?
3. Is starting at position 0 mandatory or can we start from any position within the range?
4. Are all positions guaranteed to have unique indexes?
5. Are there any constraints related to the size of the inputs?

### Code

Here is a C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFruits(vector<vector<int>>& fruits, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> fruitMap;
        for (const auto& fruit : fruits) {
            fruitMap[fruit[0]] = fruit[1];
        }

        int maxFruitsCollected = 0;
        for (int start = 0; start <= k / 2; ++start) {
            int leftMax = collectFruits(fruitMap, start, k);
            int rightMax = collectFruits(fruitMap, -start, k);
            maxFruitsCollected = max({maxFruitsCollected, leftMax, rightMax});
        }

        return maxFruitsCollected;
    }

private:
    int collectFruits(unordered_map<int, int>& fruitMap, int start, int k) {
        int collected = 0;
        int steps = k;
        if (start >= 0) {
            for (int pos = start; steps >= 0; ++pos) {
                collected += fruitMap[pos];
                steps -= 2;
            }
        } else {
            for (int pos = start; steps >= 0; --pos) {
                collected += fruitMap[pos];
                steps -= 2;
            }
        }
        return collected;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Mapping the Fruits**: First, map the positions to their respective fruit amounts using an unordered map for O(1) access time.

2. **Sweeping the Positions**: For each starting position from `0` to `k/2`, compute the maximum fruits you can collect:
   - **Collecting to the Left**: Start at position `0` and move left.
   - **Collecting to the Right**: Start at position `0` and move right.
   
3. **Traverse Both Directions**: Try collecting fruits for starting positions on the right of `0` (since `k` / 2 ensures you cover max possible within `k` steps).
   
4. **Optimization**: Ensure only necessary positions are visited within the `k` limit.

### Time Complexity

- **Mapping the Fruits**: O(n) where `n` is the number of positions in the fruits array.
- **Collecting Fruits**: Here, the worst-case scenario involves visiting all `k` positions, lending an overall complexity of O(k).
- Therefore, the total time complexity of the solution can be approximated to O(n + k).

This approach leverages the benefit of understanding the boundary constraints of `k` steps and optimally managing movement within a one-dimensional space.
