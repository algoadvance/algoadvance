[Leetcode 1701. Average Waiting Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1701)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` orders, each order consists of the `arrival time` and the `time it takes to prepare the food`. You need to calculate the average waiting time for all orders. Waiting time is defined as the time from when the order is placed until it is completed. Return the average waiting time rounded to five decimal places.

The `i-th` order is represented by `arrival[i]` and `preparation[i]`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
Output: 5.00000

Explanation:
1st order: waiting time = 3-1 = 2
2nd order: waiting time = 7-2 = 5
3rd order: waiting time = 10-4 = 6
Average waiting time = (2+5+6)/3 = 4.33333
```

### Clarifying Questions
- Are the orders sorted by their arrival times? (Assume yes for simplicity)
- Are the input values always valid and non-negative?
- How should we handle cases where there are no orders?

### Strategy
1. Initialize `current_time` to keep track of the current time.
2. Initialize `total_waiting_time` to accumulate the total waiting time.
3. Iterate through each order:
   - If the current time is less than the arrival time of the order, update current time to the arrival time (the chef is idle until this order arrives).
   - Calculate the waiting time for the current order.
   - Update the current time by adding the preparation time.
   - Accumulate the waiting time to `total_waiting_time`.
4. Compute the average waiting time by dividing `total_waiting_time` by the number of orders.
5. Return the average waiting time rounded to five decimal places.

### Time Complexity
- The solution iterates through each order exactly once, making the time complexity \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of orders.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

double averageWaitingTime(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& orders) {
    long long current_time = 0;
    long long total_waiting_time = 0;
    
    for (const auto& order : orders) {
        int arrival = order[0];
        int preparation = order[1];
        
        if (current_time < arrival) {
            current_time = arrival;
        }
        
        current_time += preparation;
        total_waiting_time += (current_time - arrival);
    }
    
    return static_cast<double>(total_waiting_time) / orders.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> orders = {{1, 2}, {2, 5}, {4, 3}};
    double avg_wait_time = averageWaitingTime(orders);
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(5) << avg_wait_time << std::endl; // Should output 4.66667
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
- We loop through each order, taking note of both arrival and preparation times.
- We ensure the `current_time` updates correctly to reflect the chef's schedule.
- The waiting time is calculated as the time from the arrival of the order until it is completed.
- Divide the total waiting time by the number of orders and return the result, formatted to five decimal places. 

This approach efficiently calculates the average waiting time for the orders list.
