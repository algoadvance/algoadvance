## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 784: Letter Case Permutation

Given a string `s`, we can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string. Return a list of all possible strings we could create.

### Example

- Input: `s = "a1b2"`
- Output: `["a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2"]`

### Constraints

- `s` will be a string with length between 1 and 12.
- `s` will consist only of letters and digits.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the transformation affect non-letter characters (e.g., digits)?**
   - No, only letters (both lowercase and uppercase) are transformed.

2. **Is there an expected order in the output permutations?**
   - No specific order is required for the output permutations.

3. **What should be returned if the input string contains no letters?**
   - The output should be a list containing the original string itself.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible transformations of the input string.
   - For each character in the string, decide whether to:
     - Keep the character as is (if it's a digit).
     - Convert the character to both lowercase and uppercase and continue the search.
   - Collect all transformed strings into a result list.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> letterCasePermutation(string s) {
        vector<string> result;
        backtrack(s, 0, "", result);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void backtrack(string &s, int index, string current, vector<string> &result) {
        if (index == s.size()) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }

        char c = s[index];
        if (isalpha(c)) {
            // Choice 1: Keep the current character in lowercase
            backtrack(s, index + 1, current + (char)tolower(c), result);
            // Choice 2: Change the current character to uppercase
            backtrack(s, index + 1, current + (char)toupper(c), result);
        } else {
            // If the character is not a letter, keep it as is
            backtrack(s, index + 1, current + c, result);
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity of the backtracking approach is \(O(2^N)\), where \(N\) is the number of letters in the string `s`. This is because each letter can be either in lowercase or uppercase, hence there are \(2^N\) possible combinations.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is also \(O(2^N \cdot N)\) due to the storage of each permutation which can have at most \(2^N\) permutations of length \(N\). The recursion depth can go up to \(N\) as well.

This solution should be efficient enough given the constraint that \(s\) can have a maximum length of 12.
