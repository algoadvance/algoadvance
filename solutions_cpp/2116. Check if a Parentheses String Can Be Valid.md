[Leetcode 2116. Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2116)
## Problem Statement

The problem asks us to determine whether a parentheses string can be valid after converting some positions that are marked with an asterisk `'*'` either to an open parenthesis `'('`, a close parenthesis `')'`, or to an empty string `''`.

A parentheses string is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding previous open bracket.

### Example: 
- Input: `s = *)((*))`, `locked = "011110"`
- Output: True

In the above example, by converting the first `')'` to `''` and the first `'('` to `''`, the string becomes `()()`, which is a valid parentheses string.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What are the constraints on the string length?**
   - Typically, the constraints would be from 1 to the length the system can handle efficiently.
   
2. **What characters can appear in the string `s`?**
   - The characters will be `'('`, `')'`, and `'*'`.

3. **What should be done if both `'('` and `')'` are locked?**
   - Follow the rules without making any changes to locked positions.

4. **Can we assume that the input will always have the same length for `s` and `locked`?**
   - Yes, we can assume `s` and `locked` will always be the same length.

5. **If all characters in the string are `'*'`, what should be returned?**
   - An empty string is valid, so return true.

## Strategy

1. **Handle Unconstrained Cases:** Iterate over the string and for each position where `locked[i]` is `0`, temporarily consider that as either `''`, `'('`, `')'`.

2. **Balance Count Approach:** 
   - Check if we can balance the parentheses from the left to right by counting the minimum and maximum number of unbalanced open parentheses we can have at every point.
   - Check from right to left similarly to ensure the balance both ways.

3. **Validity Checks:**
   - Use a balance approach with two variables, `minOpen` and `maxOpen`, to keep track of possible open counts.
   - If `minOpen` ever goes negative or `maxOpen` gets too high, return false.
   - At the end of the iteration, both values should be zero for a balanced expression.
   
## Code

```cpp
#include <string>

bool canBeValid(std::string s, std::string locked) {
    if (s.length() % 2 != 0) return false; // A valid string must have an even number of characters
    
    int minOpen = 0; // It represents the minimum number of open brackets needed
    int maxOpen = 0; // It represents the maximum number of open brackets possible
    
    // Traverse from left to right
    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (locked[i] == '0' || s[i] == '(') {
            ++maxOpen; // Either converting '*' to '(', an actual '(' or locked '('
            ++minOpen; // Either converting '*' to '(', an actual '(' or locked '('
        } else {
            --maxOpen; // It must be ')' which closes one open parenthesis
            if (minOpen > 0) {
                --minOpen; // Min open can only stay positive
            }
        }
        
        if (maxOpen < 0) return false; // Too many closing brackets
    }

    return minOpen == 0;
}

// Sample usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "*)((*))";
    std::string locked = "011110";
    bool result = canBeValid(s, locked);
    if(result) 
        std::cout << "The string can be valid." << std::endl;
    else 
        std::cout << "The string cannot be valid." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we perform a single pass over the string to maintain the balance of open and close parentheses.
