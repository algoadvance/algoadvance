[Leetcode 1936. Add Minimum Number of Rungs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1936)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **strictly increasing** integer array `rungs`. You are currently on the ground at position `0`, and you want to reach the last rung in the ladder. You can only climb to rungs that are at most `dist` away from the current rung.

Return the minimum number of rungs that you need to add to the ladder in order to be able to climb to the last rung.

#### Constraints
- `1 <= rungs.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= rungs[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= dist <= 10^9`
- `rungs` is strictly increasing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Example Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Input:** `rungs = [1, 3, 5, 10]`, `dist = 2`
   - **Output:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** You need to add one rung at position 7 to be able to reach the last rung.

2. **Can `dist` be equal to or greater than the largest gap between any two rungs?**
   - If `dist` is large enough, no additional rungs would be needed because we can always reach the next rung.

3. **Can there be duplicate values in `rungs`?**
   - No, as per the constraints `rungs` is strictly increasing.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a counter:** Start with the current position at 0 and a counter set to 0 for the minimum number of rungs to be added.
2. **Iterate over rungs:** For each rung, calculate the difference between the current rung and the previous rung.
3. **Check the difference:**
   - If the difference is greater than `dist`, calculate the number of additional rungs needed to make each step `â‰¤ dist` and update the counter.
4. **Move to the next rung:** Update your current position and repeat until all rungs are checked.

By the end of the loop, you'll have the minimum number of rungs needed to be added.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int addRungs(std::vector<int>& rungs, int dist) {
        int current = 0; // Starting from the ground
        int add_count = 0; // Counter for additional rungs
        
        for (int rung : rungs) {
            if (rung - current > dist) {
                // Calculate the number of additional rungs required
                int diff = rung - current;
                add_count += (diff - 1) / dist;
            }
            // Move to the next rung
            current = rung;
        }
        
        return add_count;
    }
};

// Example Usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> rungs = {1, 3, 5, 10};
    int dist = 2;
    std::cout << sol.addRungs(rungs, dist) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the `rungs` array once, so the time complexity is linear in relation to the input size `n` (number of rungs).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of rungs required to meet the given constraints.
