[Leetcode 765. Couples Holding Hands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l765)
### Problem Statement

There are `N` couples sitting in `2N` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that each couple is sitting together. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

The couples are numbered in a way that each couple is represented by two consecutive numbers in the range `[0, 2N - 1]`. For example, the couple `(0, 1)` represents one couple, `(2, 3)` represents another couple, and so on.

Given an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the person sitting in the `i-th` seat, return the minimum number of swaps to arrange all the couples next to each other.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on N**: 
   - What are the constraints on N (i.e., the number of couples)? 
   - Are there any large inputs we need to account for in terms of performance?

2. **Input Validity**: 
   - Can we assume that the input array `row` always contains each number exactly once, from `0` to `2N - 1`, and in pairs?
   - Is `row` always of even length (i.e., `2N`)?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Do we need to handle edge cases such as when `N = 0` or `N = 1`?

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row) {
        int N = row.size() / 2;
        int swaps = 0;
        
        // Create a position map
        unordered_map<int, int> pos;
        for (int i = 0; i < row.size(); ++i) {
            pos[row[i]] = i;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < row.size(); i += 2) {
            int first = row[i];
            int second = first ^ 1;  // Calculate pair (0 ^ 1 = 1, 2 ^ 1 = 3, etc.)

            if (row[i + 1] != second) {
                ++swaps;

                int secondPosition = pos[second];

                // Swap the person at i + 1 with the person at secondPosition
                pos[row[i + 1]] = secondPosition;
                pos[second] = i + 1;

                swap(row[i + 1], row[secondPosition]);
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize**: 
   - Calculate the number of couples, `N`, from the length of the `row` list.
   - Initialize a swap counter to zero.
   
2. **Position Map**: 
   - Create a map to store the current positions of each person in the `row`. This helps in O(1) look-up time for swapping positions.

3. **Find Couples**: 
   - Loop through the `row` in increments of 2 (as couples sit together).
   - For every couple, determine the pair they need to be with using the operation `first ^ 1`.

4. **Swapping**: 
   - If the current person is not next to their pair, determine the correct position of their pair.
   - Swap the person next to them with the person sitting at the correct position.
   - Update the positions in the map and increment the swap counter.

### Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in O(N) time, where N is the number of couples:
- Creating the position map takes O(2N) time.
- Each swap operation involves a constant time look-up and update, leading to O(N) operations overall.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N), which is efficient for the problem's constraints.
