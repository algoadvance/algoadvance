[Leetcode 3234. Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3234)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s`, which consists only of characters '0' and '1'. A substring of `s` is considered dominant if the number of '1's in the substring is strictly greater than the number of '0's.

Write a function `countDominantSubstrings(string s)` that returns the number of dominant substrings in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string?**
   - Assume the length can range from 1 to 10^5.
  
2. **Can the string be empty?**
   - According to constraints, the string will not be empty as per the problem description.
  
3. **What if the string contains only '0's or only '1's?**
   - If the string contains only '1's, every possible substring will be dominant. 
   - If the string contains only '0's, there will be no dominant substrings.

4. **Are overlapping substrings counted separately?**
   - Yes, overlapping substrings are counted as separate valid substrings.
  
### Strategy

The problem requires counting substrings where '1's outnumber '0's. A brute-force solution that generates all substrings and counts the '1's and '0's would be too slow, especially for the upper limits of the input size.

#### Efficient Approach:
1. **Prefix Sum with Balance:**
   - Define a balance where we increment the balance for '1' and decrement for '0'.
   - Track the prefix balances using a hashmap to count the occurrences of each balance value.
   - A positive balance at any point means there are more '1's than '0's up to that point.
   - For each position, calculate the number of valid substrings ending at the current position using the balance values.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   1. Maintain a prefix balance initialized at zero.
   2. Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each prefix balance value.
   3. Traverse the string and update the prefix balance.
   4. For each position, if the current balance is positive, record the number of substrings (from the start to the current position) contributing to dominant substrings.
   5. Update the hashmap with the current balance.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int countDominantSubstrings(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    unordered_map<int, int> balanceCount;
    int balance = 0;
    int dominantCount = 0;
    
    balanceCount[0] = 1; // Initial balance zero has one count

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        char c = s[i];
        if (c == '1')
            balance++;
        else
            balance--;
        
        if (balance > 0) {
            dominantCount += i + 1; // All substrings from start to i are dominant
        } else {
            dominantCount += balanceCount[balance - 1]; // Count of previous balances that make current balance dominant
        }

        balanceCount[balance]++;
    }
    
    return dominantCount;
}

int main() {
    string s = "1101";
    cout << "Number of dominant substrings: " << countDominantSubstrings(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:** 
- The algorithm runs in O(n) where n is the length of the string `s` because it processes each character exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** 
- The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the hashmap storing the frequency of each balance value, though typical usage is much less due to the range of balance values.
