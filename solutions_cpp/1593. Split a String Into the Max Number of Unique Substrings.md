[Leetcode 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1593)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, split `s` into the maximum number of unique substrings. This requires determining the maximum number of unique substrings you can create from `s`.

**Example:**

- `Input: s = "ababccc"`
- `Output: 5`

**Explanation:**

One possible way to split the string "ababccc" into the maximum number of unique substrings is ["a", "b", "ab", "c", "cc"].

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are we guaranteed that the input string `s` will only contain lowercase English letters?
   - **A:** Yes, we can assume that.

2. **Q:** Do the substrings need to maintain order in which they appear in the original string?
   - **A:** Yes, the order must be maintained.

3. **Q:** Is it necessary to use all characters from the string for substrings?
   - **A:** Yes, the whole string should be used up by the substrings.

4. **Q:** Can the substrings overlap?
   - **A:** No, substrings cannot overlap.

## Strategy

To tackle this problem, a backtracking approach can be employed. The primary idea here is to explore all possible ways to split the string and backtrack if a substring combination doesnâ€™t lead to a solution with the maximum number of unique substrings.

**Steps:**
1. Use a set to keep track of the unique substrings.
2. Define a recursive function that attempts splitting at each possible position and backtracks if the substring is not unique.
3. Recursively call the function for the rest of the string.
4. Keep track of the maximum number of unique substrings encountered during the process.

## Time Complexity
Considering the nature of backtracking, the worst-case time complexity would be O(2^n) where `n` is the length of the string. This happens because we are exploring all potential splits, which can be exponential in nature.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxUniqueSplit(string s) {
        unordered_set<string> seen;
        return backtrack(s, 0, seen);
    }

private:
    int backtrack(const string& s, int start, unordered_set<string>& seen) {
        if (start == s.size()) {
            return 0;
        }

        int max_splits = 0;
        for (int end = start + 1; end <= s.size(); ++end) {
            string substring = s.substr(start, end - start);
            if (seen.find(substring) == seen.end()) {
                // Choose
                seen.insert(substring);
                
                // Explore
                int result = 1 + backtrack(s, end, seen);
                max_splits = max(max_splits, result);
                
                // Unchoose (backtrack)
                seen.erase(substring);
            }
        }
        return max_splits;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string s = "ababccc";
    cout << sol.maxUniqueSplit(s) << endl;  // Output: 5
    return 0;
}
```

This code implements the described backtracking approach to find the maximum number of unique substrings by splitting the given string `s`. We iterate over possible splits, using a set to track substrings that have already been used and recursively explore further splits. Backtracking ensures that we explore all combinations efficiently.
