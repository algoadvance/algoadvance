[Leetcode 290. Word Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l290)
## Problem Statement
290. Word Pattern

Given a pattern and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in `s`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= pattern.length <= 300`
- `pattern` contains only lower-case English letters.
- `1 <= s.length <= 3000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there multiple spaces between words in `s`?**
   - No, `s` is well-formatted with a single space separating the words.
2. **Do we need to consider letter case variations (e.g., "Dog" vs "dog")?**
   - No, the problem statement specifies that `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
3. **Is an empty `s` or `pattern` possible?**
   - No, given constraints assure the length of `pattern` is between 1 and 300 and `s` between 1 and 3000.

## Strategy
1. **Split the string `s`** into individual words.
2. **Check the length** of the `pattern` and the list of words derived from `s`. If they do not match, return `false`.
3. Use two hash maps (dictionaries):
   - **`patternToWord`** to map each character in the pattern to a corresponding word in `s`.
   - **`wordToPattern`** to map each word in `s` to a corresponding character in the pattern.
4. Loop through the `pattern` and the words simultaneously:
   - If a character in the pattern is already mapped but does not map to the current word or vice versa, return `false`.
   - If no conflicts arise, map the character to the word and the word to the character.
5. If the loop completes without conflicts, return `true`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

bool wordPattern(string pattern, string s) {
    // Split s into words
    vector<string> words;
    stringstream ss(s);
    string word;
    while (ss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }

    // If pattern length and words' length doesn't match
    if (pattern.length() != words.size()) return false;

    unordered_map<char, string> patternToWord;
    unordered_map<string, char> wordToPattern;

    for (int i = 0; i < pattern.length(); i++) {
        char p = pattern[i];
        string w = words[i];

        // Check if there is a conflict in pattern to word mapping
        if (patternToWord.count(p) > 0 && patternToWord[p] != w) return false;
        if (wordToPattern.count(w) > 0 && wordToPattern[w] != p) return false;

        // Establish new mapping
        patternToWord[p] = w;
        wordToPattern[w] = p;
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    string pattern = "abba";
    string s = "dog cat cat dog";
    cout << (wordPattern(pattern, s) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output: true
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Splitting the string `s`:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `s`.
- **Loop through the pattern and words:** O(m), where `m` is the length of the pattern.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n + m), realistically O(n), considering `m` is significantly smaller than `n`.

This code and strategy ensure the solution is efficient and clear.
