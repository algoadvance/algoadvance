[Leetcode 136. Single Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l136)
### Problem Statement
136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - A: Yes, the array can contain both negative and positive integers.
2. **Q: What is the size range of the array?**
   - A: The array size can range from 1 to \(10^4\).
3. **Q: Is it guaranteed that there is exactly one single number and all other numbers appear exactly twice?**
   - A: Yes, it is guaranteed.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently (O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space), we can take advantage of the properties of the XOR bitwise operation:
1. XOR of two same numbers is 0 (e.g., `a ^ a = 0`).
2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., `a ^ 0 = a`).

Thus, if we XOR all the numbers in the array, the numbers that appear twice will cancel out each other, leaving the single number as the result.

### Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int single = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            single ^= num; // XOR all elements
        }
        return single;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    std::vector<int> test1 = {2, 2, 1};
    std::cout << "Test 1: " << solution.singleNumber(test1) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    
    std::vector<int> test2 = {4, 1, 2, 1, 2};
    std::cout << "Test 2: " << solution.singleNumber(test2) << std::endl; // Output: 4
    
    std::vector<int> test3 = {1};
    std::cout << "Test 3: " << solution.singleNumber(test3) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), constant space because we are only using one integer variable to keep track of the XOR result.
