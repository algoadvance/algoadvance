## Problem Statement

1488. Avoid Flood in The City

Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the ith lake, the ith lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is already full, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.

Given an integer array `rains` where:

- `rains[i] > 0` means the `i`-th day it rains over the `rains[i]`-th lake.
- `rains[i] == 0` means the `i`-th day is a dry day and you can choose one lake this day and drain it.

Return an array `ans` where:

- `ans.length == rains.length`
- `ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.
- `ans[i] > 0` if `rains[i] == 0` and you chose to dry `ans[i]`-th lake, which must be full.

If it is not possible to avoid flood, return an empty array `[]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should we do if there are more dry days than needed?
   - Any dry day not needed for preventing a flood can be arbitrarily assigned to any lake that was previously flooded, just for convention.

2. Are there constraints on the size of the input array `rains` or the values within it?
   - Yes, typical constraints should be taken into consideration as per usual for such problems (e.g., length of `rains` could be up to `10^5`).

## Strategy

1. **Tracking Full Lakes**: Use a map (unordered_map) to track the day on which each lake was last filled.
2. **Dry Day Management**: Use a priority queue (or any suitable data structure) to manage the dry days and ensure they are used optimally.
3. **Iterate Through the Rains**:
   - For rainy days (`rains[i] > 0`):
     - Check if the lake `rains[i]` was already filled and there has not been any dry day to empty it. If yes, it's impossible to avoid the flood, return `[]`.
     - Otherwise, mark the lake as filled and note the day it was filled.
   - For dry days (`rains[i] == 0`):
     - Try to find a previously filled lake that needs to be dried using stored information from our data structures.
     - Mark the selected lake as dried.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The use of a map allows quick lookups and updates for filled lakes, and a priority queue for managing dry days allows efficient retrieval of the earliest fill day to empty.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

vector<int> avoidFlood(vector<int>& rains) {
    int n = rains.size();
    vector<int> ans(n, -1);
    unordered_map<int, int> lakeMap;  // to track the index at which a lake is last filled
    set<int> dryDays;  // to store indices of dry days

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (rains[i] > 0) {
            int lake = rains[i];
            if (lakeMap.count(lake)) {
                // Find a dry day to dry this lake
                auto it = dryDays.lower_bound(lakeMap[lake]);
                if (it == dryDays.end()) {
                    // No suitable dry day available to prevent flood
                    return {};
                }
                ans[*it] = lake;  // we decide to dry 'lake' on dry day *it
                dryDays.erase(it);
            }
            lakeMap[lake] = i;
        } else {
            dryDays.insert(i);
            ans[i] = 1;  // placeholder, will be updated later
        }
    }
    
    // Replace placeholders in dry days
    for (int i : dryDays) {
        ans[i] = 1;  // Arbitrarily dry some lake
    }

    return ans;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the length of the `rains` array. The `log n` factor comes from the operations on the `set` data structure used to manage dry days.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), used by the unordered_map and set to store information about lakes and dry days.
