[Leetcode 1749. Maximum Absolute Sum of Any Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1749)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. The maximum absolute sum of any subarray is defined as the maximum of the absolute values of the sums of any of its subarrays.

Return the maximum absolute sum of any subarray of `nums`.

### Example
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `nums = [1,-3,2,3,-4]`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The subarray `[2,3]` has the maximum sum `5` and the subarray `[-3,2,3]` has the maximum absolute negative sum `-5`. Therefore, the maximum absolute sum is `5`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `nums = [2,-5,1,-4,3,-2]`
  - Output: `8`
  - Explanation: The subarray `[-5,1,-4,3]` has the maximum absolute sum `-8`. 

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the subarray be of length 1?**
   - Yes, the subarray can be of length 1.
2. **Do we consider the absolute value of the entire array sum?**
   - We are focused on subarrays, which means we need to consider all possible contiguous segments of the array.
3. **Should we optimize for time and space complexity?**
   - Yes, given the constraint `nums.length` can go up to `10^5`, we need to ensure that our solution is efficient with time complexity better than O(n^2). 

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum absolute sum among all subarrays. This can be approached via Kadane's Algorithm, which finds the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum efficiently. We'll adjust it twice: once to track the maximum sum subarray and once to track the minimum sum subarray. The highest of the absolute values of these min and max sums will be our answer.

1. **Track the Maximum Subarray Sum (`max_sum`):**
   - We traverse the array and keep updating the running maximum sum for each subarray. 
   
2. **Track the Minimum Subarray Sum (`min_sum`):**
   - Similarly, we traverse the array and keep updating the running minimum sum for each subarray. 
   
3. The result is the highest absolute value between the absolute values of those two sums.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n) as we only need a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int maxAbsoluteSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_sum = 0;
    int min_sum = 0;
    
    int current_max = 0;
    int current_min = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        current_max = std::max(nums[i], current_max + nums[i]);
        max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_max);
        
        current_min = std::min(nums[i], current_min + nums[i]);
        min_sum = std::min(min_sum, current_min);
    }
    
    return std::max(std::abs(max_sum), std::abs(min_sum));
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, -3, 2, 3, -4};
    std::cout << "Example 1: " << maxAbsoluteSum(nums1) << std::endl; // Output: 5

    std::vector<int> nums2 = {2, -5, 1, -4, 3, -2};
    std::cout << "Example 2: " << maxAbsoluteSum(nums2) << std::endl; // Output: 8

    return 0;
}
```

By using this approach, we efficiently determine the maximum absolute sum of any subarray in quadratic time.
