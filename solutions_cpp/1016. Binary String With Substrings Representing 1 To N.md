[Leetcode 1016. Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1016)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `n`, return `true` if the binary representations of all the integers from `1` to `n` are substrings of `s`, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 10^9`
   
2. **What could be the length of the binary string `s`?**
   - The binary string `s` can have a length up to `10^5`.

3. **Do we consider leading binary zeros for comparison?**
   - No, binary numbers should not have leading zeros for valid comparisons.

4. **What characters are present in the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` contains only characters '0' and '1'.

## Strategy

1. **Convert Number to Binary String:** For each number from `1` to `n`, convert it to its binary representation.
2. **Check Substring:** Check if the binary representation of each number from `1` to `n` is a substring of `s`.
3. **Early Termination:** If at any point a number's binary representation is not found in `s`, return `false`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool queryString(string s, int n) {
    // Iterate from 1 to n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Convert the number to a binary string
        string binaryRep = bitset<32>(i).to_string().substr(bitset<32>(i).to_string().find('1'));
        
        // Check if the binary string is a substring of s
        if (s.find(binaryRep) == string::npos) {
            return false; // If any binary representation is not found, return false
        }
    }
    return true;
}

int main() {
    // Given binary string s and integer n
    string s = "0110";
    int n = 3;
    
    // Check if the binary representations of all integers from 1 to n are substrings of s
    bool result = queryString(s, n);
    cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy Explanation

1. **Bitset Conversion:** Converting each number into its binary form using `std::bitset`.
2. **Removing Leading Zeros:** Removing leading zeros to ensure we only have the relevant binary representation.
3. **Substring Check:** Using `s.find(binaryRep)` to check if the binary string is part of the main string.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity can approach `O(n * k)`, where `k` is the average length of the binary representations of numbers from `1` to `n`. On average, `k = O(log n)`, leading to an approximate time complexity of `O(n * log n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity mainly depends on creating binary strings for each number, which is `O(log n)`.

This solution should efficiently handle the constraints provided. If you'd like any further detail or optimization, let me know!
