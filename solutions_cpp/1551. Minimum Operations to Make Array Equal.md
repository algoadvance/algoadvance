[Leetcode 1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1551)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1551: Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal

You have an array `arr` of length `n` where `arr[i] = 2*i + 1` for all valid values of `i` (i.e. `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`).

In one operation, you can select two different indices `i` and `j` and decrease `arr[i]` by `1` and increase `arr[j]` by `1`. Your goal is to make all elements of the array equal. Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem states standard constraints typical to Leetcode without specifying `n` here, but usually, `n` could be up to `10^4`.

2. **What kind of values will be stored in the array?**
   - The array is defined as `arr[i] = 2*i + 1`, meaning it contains odd numbers starting from `1` (for `i=0`).

3. **Are there any constraints on the types of operations?**
   - Each operation reduces one element by 1 and increases another by 1.

### Strategy
Given the array defined by `arr[i] = 2*i + 1`, notice:
- `arr` will always be symmetric around the middle value (median), and our goal is to transform all elements to the median value.

#### Key Observations:
1. If `n` is odd, the median is exactly the middle element.
2. If `n` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

In terms of equalizing the array, transforming to the median minimizes the total number of operations due to properties of absolute differences.

For operations count:
- Pair first and last elements, second and second-last elements, etc. This pairing helps realize minimal transformation to the median value.

For `n` elements, sum of distances from each element to the median gives the number of required operations.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(int n) {
        int median;
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            median = n - 1;
        } else {
            median = 2 * (n / 2) + 1;
        }

        int total_operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
            total_operations += (median - (2 * i + 1));
        }

        return total_operations;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.minOperations(3) << endl;  // Output: 2
    cout << sol.minOperations(6) << endl;  // Output: 9
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(n/2)`, which simplifies to `O(n)`. This is due to the loop through half of the elements to calculate the total operations needed.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution leverages the structure of the array and arithmetic properties to minimize and count operations efficiently.
