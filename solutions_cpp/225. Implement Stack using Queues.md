[Leetcode 225. Implement Stack using Queues](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l225)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode problem 225 requires us to implement a Stack using Queues. The goal is to implement the following operations for the stack:

- `void push(int x)`: Push element x onto stack.
- `int pop()`: Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
- `int top()`: Get the top element.
- `bool empty()`: Returns whether the stack is empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Queue Type**: Can we use both single-ended queues (like `std::queue`) or double-ended queues (`std::deque`), or is it restricted to a specific type?
   - We'll assume standard single-ended queues (`std::queue`) are to be used.
2. **Efficiency Concerns**: Is there a preference for more efficient operations for `push` or `pop` or should we try to balance the efficiency of both?
   - We'll assume that there's no specific preference and that both operations should be reasonably efficient.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the Stack using Queues:

```cpp
#include <queue>

class MyStack {
private:
    std::queue<int> q1; // Main queue to hold stack elements

public:
    MyStack() {
    }
    // Push element x onto stack.
    void push(int x) {
        int size = q1.size();
        q1.push(x);

        // Move all elements before x to the back of the queue to maintain stack order
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            q1.push(q1.front());
            q1.pop();
        }
    }
    
    // Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.
    int pop() {
        int topElement = q1.front();
        q1.pop();
        return topElement;
    }
    
    // Get the top element.
    int top() {
        return q1.front();
    }
    
    // Returns whether the stack is empty.
    bool empty() {
        return q1.empty();
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Using a Single Queue**: We use a single queue `q1` to simulate stack operations.
   
   - **Push Operation**: 
     - When we push an element `x`, we first get the size of the queue.
     - We then enqueue the new element `x`.
     - We move all the other elements that were in the queue prior to `x` to the back of the queue. This ensures that element `x` is always at the front, simulating stack behavior.
   
   - **Pop Operation**:
     - Simply dequeue the front element since it represents the top of the stack.
   
   - **Top Operation**:
     - Directly return the front element of the queue without removing it.
   
   - **Empty Operation**:
     - Check if the queue is empty.

### Time Complexity
- **Push Operation**: O(n), where **n** is the number of elements in the queue before the push operation. This is because we need to reorder the elements in the queue after inserting a new one.
- **Pop Operation**: O(1), as we are directly dequeuing the front element.
- **Top Operation**: O(1), as we are directly accessing the front element.
- **Empty Operation**: O(1), as we are simply checking if the queue is empty.

By leveraging a single queue and adjusting its order during insertions, we maintain the stack's LIFO (Last In, First Out) property efficiently for typical stack operations.
