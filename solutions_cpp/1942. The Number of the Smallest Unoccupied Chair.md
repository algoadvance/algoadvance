[Leetcode 1942. The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1942)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `times` that contains the arrival and leaving times of `n` guests, where `times[i] = [arrival_i, leaving_i]`. Every guest will occupy the unoccupied chair that has the smallest number when they arrive. If multiple guests arrive at the same time, they will choose the smallest numbered chair among the available ones.

You are also given an integer `targetFriend` which indicates which guest you want to inquire about. Return the chair number that the `targetFriend` will take.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `n` (the number of guests)?
   - Up to 10^4 guests.
2. What are the ranges for the times?
   - Times can vary widely; each time is a positive integer up to 10^6.
3. Can guests arrive and leave at the same time?
   - Yes, guests can arrive and leave at the same time.
4. Can there be multiple guests with the same arrival or leaving time?
   - Yes, there can be multiple guests arriving or leaving at the same time.
5. How is the chair numbering done?
   - Chairs are numbered sequentially from 0.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Store Events:** Create an array of events where each event signifies either arrival or departure of a guest.
2. **Handle Events appropriately:** Sort all events by time. If times are the same, prioritize departure over arrival to free up chairs before potentially assigning them again.
3. **Use Priority Queues:** Use two priority queues:
   - One min-heap to manage available chairs.
   - Another priority queue (min-heap) to track when current chairs will get free by departure times.
4. **Simulate the Process:** Iterate through these sorted events while maintaining the smallest available chair for each arriving guest using the priority queues.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int smallestChair(vector<vector<int>>& times, int targetFriend) {
    int n = times.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> events; // (time, event type with index)

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        events.push_back({times[i][0], i});   // Arrival events
        events.push_back({times[i][1], -i});  // Departure events
    }

    sort(events.begin(), events.end(), [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
        if (a.first == b.first) return a.second < b.second; // prioritize departure
        return a.first < b.first;
    });

    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> availableChairs;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        availableChairs.push(i); // initially, all chairs are available
    }
    
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> inUseChairs;
    vector<int> chairAssign(n, -1); // to keep track of the chair each guest will take

    for (auto& event : events) {
        int time = event.first;
        int index = event.second;

        if (index >= 0) { // arrival
            while (!inUseChairs.empty() && inUseChairs.top().first <= time) {
                availableChairs.push(inUseChairs.top().second);
                inUseChairs.pop();
            }
            int chair = availableChairs.top();
            availableChairs.pop();
            chairAssign[index] = chair;
            inUseChairs.push({times[index][1], chair});
            if (index == targetFriend) return chair;
        } else { // departure
            // This will be implicitly handled by arrival checks
        }
    }
    return -1; // If the targetFriend was not found (should not happen given problem constraints)
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the events list takes **O(n log n)**.
- Processing each guest's arrival and departure takes **O(n log n)** due to the priority queues.
- Overall time complexity: **O(n log n)**.
