[Leetcode 2195. Append K Integers With Minimal Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2195)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`. Find the minimal possible sum of `k` unique positive integers that are not present in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicates but we are only interested in unique integers not in `nums`.
   
2. **Is the input size constrained?**
   - Constraints will generally be within the typical LeetCode bounds unless otherwise specified.

3. **Should the minimal sum be strictly the least possible without considering if some numbers are already in nums?**
   - Yes, the numbers chosen to append must be unique and not present in `nums`.

### Strategy
1. **Sort and Populate:**
   - We can first sort `nums` and convert it to a set for O(1) membership checking.
2. **Iterate and Collect:**
   - Iterate from 1 upwards and keep appending integers not present in the set. Stop when we have appended `k` such numbers.
3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of these k integers.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

long long minimalKSum(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Convert nums to a set for O(1) membership checking
    unordered_set<int> num_set(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    long long sum = 0;
    int current = 1;
    
    while (k > 0) {
        // If current is not in num_set, add it to the sum
        if (num_set.find(current) == num_set.end()) {
            sum += current;
            k--;
        }
        current++;
    }
    
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 4, 25, 10, 25};
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Minimal K sum: " << minimalKSum(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Set Construction:** O(n) for converting `nums` to a set.
- **Iterative Check and Sum Calculation:** In the worst case, we might need to check up to the first k + n integers, resulting in O(k + n).
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n + k)

### Explanation
1. **Input Conversion:** Convert `nums` into a set for efficient membership tests.
2. **Iterative Search:**
   - Initialize `current` to 1.
   - For each `current`, if itâ€™s not in the set, add it to the sum and decrement `k`.
   - Increment `current` and repeat until `k` reaches 0.

The loop ensures that we only include integers not present in `nums` and stop once we have collected `k` integers. This method ensures finding the minimal sum of `k` integers efficiently.
