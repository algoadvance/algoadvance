[Leetcode 653. Two Sum IV ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l653)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer `k`, return `true` if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to `k`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do the BST nodes contain only integer values?**
   - *Yes*.
2. **Can the BST contain duplicate values?**
   - Typically, BSTs do not contain duplicate values, so we can assume no duplicates unless otherwise specified.
3. **What is the range of values that the BST can contain?**
   - The values can be any integers within the range that C++ integers allow.

### Strategy

We can leverage the properties of a BST to solve this problem efficiently.

1. **In-Order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal to get a sorted list of node values.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Using the sorted list, apply the two-pointer technique to find if there are two numbers that add up to `k`.

This approach uses an additional list for storing the BST values, but it allows us to utilize the efficient two-pointer technique to solve the problem in linear time with respect to the number of nodes.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool findTarget(TreeNode* root, int k) {
        std::vector<int> values;
        
        // In-order traverse to get the sorted values from the BST.
        inOrderTraverse(root, values);
        
        // Apply the two-pointer technique on the sorted values.
        int left = 0;
        int right = values.size() - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = values[left] + values[right];
            if (sum == k) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < k) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

private:
    void inOrderTraverse(TreeNode* node, std::vector<int>& values) {
        if (node == nullptr) {
            return;
        }
        
        inOrderTraverse(node->left, values);
        values.push_back(node->val);
        inOrderTraverse(node->right, values);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **In-Order Traversal**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the BST.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: O(n), since both pointers traverse the vector at most once.
  
Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the additional vector used to store the node values.
