[Leetcode 2742. Painting the Walls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2742)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` walls that need to be painted, where `n` can be large. Each wall has a certain cost associated with painting it. You can paint each wall yourself, which costs `cost[i]`, or you can hire a professional painter to do some of the work. The cost of hiring a painter decreases according to a fixed professional discount rule. Your task is to determine the minimum cost to paint all the walls, either by yourself or by hiring professionals under the given constraints.

Output the minimum cost needed to paint all walls.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the costs array contain zero or negative values?**
   - Let's assume the costs are all positive integers since it typically costs money to paint walls.

2. **Is hiring a professional an option for each wall or only for specific walls?**
   - Assume that hiring a professional is an option for each wall with a fixed discount applied.

3. **Is there a limit to the number of walls that a professional can paint compared to the number you can paint yourself?**
   - This may need clarification; let's assume for now that there's a limit based on some factor described in the prompt.

4. **Discount Rule Clarification:**
   - The prompt indicates a discount but does not provide details. Assume a fixed percentage discount is provided.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use dynamic programming to track the minimum cost to paint up to the `i-th` wall considering two scenarios:
     - Painting the wall yourself.
     - Hiring a professional.

2. **State Representation:**
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum cost to paint up to and including the `i-th` wall.

3. **Transition:**
   - For each wall, calculate both scenarios and choose the minimal cost:
     - If painted by yourself: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + cost[i]`.
     - If hiring a professional with a discount: considering a factor `p` denotes the discount, then `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + cost[i] * (1 - p / 100)`.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `dp[0]` appropriately for the first wall.

5. **Result:**
   - The final result for all walls painted will be in `dp[n-1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

double paintingWalls(vector<int>& costs, double discount) {
    int n = costs.size();
    vector<double> dp(n, 0);
    
    dp[0] = costs[0];
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        // Cost if painted by yourself
        double costIfSelf = dp[i-1] + costs[i];
        
        // Cost if hiring a professional with discount
        double costIfProfessional = dp[i-1] + costs[i] * (1 - discount / 100);
        
        // Choose the lesser cost
        dp[i] = min(costIfSelf, costIfProfessional);
    }
    
    return dp[n-1];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> costs = {10, 20, 30, 40}; // Example costs
    double discount = 20; // 20% discount

    cout << "Minimum cost to paint all walls: " << paintingWalls(costs, discount) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of walls, since we iterate through each wall once. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the storage required for the `dp` array. This solution efficiently calculates the minimum cost based on the given constraints.
