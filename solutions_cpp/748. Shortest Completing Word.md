[Leetcode 748. Shortest Completing Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l748)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the shortest completing word in `words`. A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in the `licensePlate` (case insensitive). The letters in the `licensePlate` can be both uppercase and lowercase letters. Ignore numbers and spaces in the `licensePlate`. Return the shortest completing word in `words`. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that appears in `words`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the `licensePlate` contain special characters?**
   - Generally, it contains only alphanumeric characters, but for this problem, we only need to consider ignoring digits and spaces.

2. **Is the length of each word in the `words` array constrained?**
   - Typically, the length will be reasonably constrained as per usual interview problem constraints.

3. **Are there constraints about the size of the `licensePlate` and the array `words`?**
   - We can assume that both the `licensePlate` and the `words` array will be within a range suitable for typical coding interview problems.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Extract the character counts from `licensePlate`, ignoring non-letter characters.
2. For each word in `words`, check if it can be a completing word.
3. Track the shortest completing word by comparing lengths.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cctype>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

string shortestCompletingWord(string licensePlate, vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_map<char, int> charCount;

    // Helper lambda function to convert character to lowercase and check if it's a letter
    auto adjustAndCount = [&](char ch) {
        if (isalpha(ch)) {
            charCount[tolower(ch)]++;
        }
    };

    // Count frequencies of each letter in the licensePlate
    for (char ch : licensePlate) {
        adjustAndCount(ch);
    }

    string result;
    size_t minLen = numeric_limits<size_t>::max();

    for (const string& word : words) {
        unordered_map<char, int> wordCount;

        for (char ch : word) {
            wordCount[tolower(ch)]++;
        }

        bool isCompleting = true;

        for (const auto& pair : charCount) {
            if (wordCount[pair.first] < pair.second) {
                isCompleting = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isCompleting && word.length() < minLen) {
            result = word;
            minLen = word.length();
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string licensePlate = "1s3 PSt";
    vector<string> words = {"step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"};
    string result = shortestCompletingWord(licensePlate, words);
    cout << "Shortest completing word: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis for this solution involves:

1. **Processing License Plate Characters:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `licensePlate`.
2. **Iterating through Words:** O(m * k), where `m` is the number of words and `k` is the maximum length of a word.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m * k), which is efficient for typical constraints expected in interviews.
