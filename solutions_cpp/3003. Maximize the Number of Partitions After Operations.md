[Leetcode 3003. Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3003)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

1. Pick any element in `nums` and decrease it by 1.

Your task is to find the maximum number of partitions you can split the array into such that the sum of each partition is less than or equal to `threshold`.

-----

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `nums`?
   - What is the range of the `threshold` value?
   - Are there any limits on the size of the array `nums`?

2. **Outcome:**
   - Is there only one valid partitioning or multiple valid ways?
   - If multiple partitions are possible, do we just need to return their maximum count?

Assume the interviewer provides the following clarifications:
1. `nums` can contain values up to \(10^9\) and the size of the array can be up to \(10^5\).
2. The threshold can be up to \(10^9\).
3. We need to return a single integer representing the maximum number of partitions.

## Strategy

To achieve the goal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Decrease Elements Function:** Create a helper function to decrease an element in the array.
2. **Calculate Partitions:** Calculate possible partitions based on the modified array.

We can leverage a greedy algorithm to calculate the partitions. The idea is to find contiguous subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is less than or equal to the threshold.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Iterate over the elements of the array while maintaining a running sum of the current partition.
2. If adding the next element exceeds the threshold, start a new partition.
3. Keep track of the number of partitions formed.

## Time Complexity

- **Iterating through the array:** \(O(n)\)
- The algorithm runs in linear time relative to the size of the input array, which is efficient.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizePartitions(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int partitions = 1; // We start with at least one partition
        long long currentSum = 0; // To handle large sums

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (currentSum + num > threshold) {
                partitions++;
                currentSum = num;  // Start a new partition
            } else {
                currentSum += num;
            }
        }

        return partitions;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. Initialize the number of partitions to one because there must be at least one partition.
2. Loop through the `nums` array and maintain a running sum.
3. If adding the next number to the current sum exceeds the threshold, increment the partition counter and reset the current sum to the current number.
4. Return the total number of partitions formed.

This approach ensures that we form the maximum number of valid partitions where each partition's sum does not exceed the given threshold.
