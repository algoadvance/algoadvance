[Leetcode 3203. Find Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3203)
### Problem Statement
Given two trees already rooted at indices `root1` and `root2`, you need to merge these two trees by connecting an edge between some node `a` in the first tree and some node `b` in the second tree (aâ‰ b). Your task is to find the minimum possible diameter among all possible ways of merging the two trees. 

The diameter of a tree is defined as the maximum distance between any two vertices in the tree. The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How do we represent the trees?** 
   Typically, trees are represented as adjacency lists or edge lists.

2. **What is the maximum number of nodes in each tree?** 
   This helps us understand constraints and scalability.

3. **Are all edge weights equal (i.e., unweighted graph)?**
   If not, weights must be considered in distance calculations.

4. **Are the trees guaranteed to be connected?**
   This ensures that the diameter calculations are valid.

5. **Can `a` and `b` be any nodes in the first and second trees, respectively?**
   This affects how we approach finding possible merge points.

### Code
Here's an approach in C++ to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

typedef pair<int,int> pii;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> bfs(int start, vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
        int n = adj.size();
        vector<int> dist(n, -1);
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(start);
        dist[start] = 0;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
                if (dist[neighbor] == -1) {
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                    q.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dist;
    }

    int diameter(vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
        // Find the farthest node from an arbitrary node
        vector<int> dist1 = bfs(0, adj);
        int farthest = max_element(dist1.begin(), dist1.end()) - dist1.begin();
        // BFS from the farthest node found
        vector<int> dist2 = bfs(farthest, adj);
        // The diameter is the maximum distance found in dist2
        return *max_element(dist2.begin(), dist2.end());
    }

    int findMinDiameter(vector<vector<int>>& tree1, vector<vector<int>>& tree2) {
        int dia1 = diameter(tree1);
        int dia2 = diameter(tree2);

        // Distance from root1 and root2, respectively
        vector<int> distTree1 = bfs(0, tree1);
        vector<int> distTree2 = bfs(0, tree2);

        int maxDist1 = *max_element(distTree1.begin(), distTree1.end());
        int maxDist2 = *max_element(distTree2.begin(), distTree2.end());

        return max(max({dia1, dia2, (maxDist1 + maxDist2 + 1)}));
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Diameter Calculation:**
   - Use BFS twice to calculate the diameter: 
     - First, find the farthest node from an arbitrary starting node.
     - Second, use BFS from the farthest node to find the maximum distance.
     
2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Perform BFS from the roots of both trees to get the distance arrays.

3. **Merge Diameter Calculation:**
   - Calculate the diameter individually for both trees.
   - Compute possible new diameter after merging by connecting node pairs from both trees.
   - The new diameter can potentially be `max(diameter1, diameter2, maxDistTree1 + maxDistTree2 + 1)`.

### Time Complexity

- **BFS:** O(V + E) per tree, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Diameter Calculation:** O(V + E) per tree, as it involves two BFS runs.
- Total complexity is heavily dependent on the sizes of the trees combined.

Thus for two trees with `V1` and `V2` nodes respectively, the overall time complexity will be O((V1 + E1) + (V2 + E2)).

This approach ensures that we find the minimum possible diameter efficiently.
