[Leetcode 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l907)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, find the sum of `min(b)`, where `b` ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of `arr`. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the expected range of the length of `arr`?
   - **A:** The length of the array can be up to `30000`.

2. **Q:** Can the elements in `arr` be negative?
   - **A:** No, the problem constraints guarantee that the elements in `arr` are positive integers.

3. **Q:** What should we return when the array is empty?
   - **A:** Though the problem specifies the array is non-empty, it is implied we don't need to handle such a case.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we'll employ a stack-based approach to find out how many times each element of the array is the minimum of some subarray.

1. **Prev and Next Arrays:**
   - We will use two auxiliary arrays `Previous Less` (`prev`) and `Next Less` (`next`). These arrays help to store the distance to the previous and next less element for every element in the array.
   - The `prev[i]` array stores the number of contiguous subarrays ending at index `i` where `arr[i]` is the minimum.
   - The `next[i]` array stores the number of contiguous subarrays starting at index `i` where `arr[i]` is the minimum value.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Initialize `prev` and `next` arrays to store the lengths of subarrays in terms of indices.
   - Use a monotonic stack to calculate the `prev` array.
   - Use a monotonic stack to calculate the `next` array, but in a reverse iteration.
   - Calculate the result using the values from `prev` and `next`.

### Code

Let's implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int sumSubarrayMins(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> prev(n), next(n);
        stack<int> s;

        // Calculate previous less element distances
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while (!s.empty() && arr[s.top()] >= arr[i]) {
                s.pop();
            }
            prev[i] = s.empty() ? i + 1 : i - s.top();
            s.push(i);
        }

        while (!s.empty()) s.pop(); // clear the stack

        // Calculate next less element distances
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            while (!s.empty() && arr[s.top()] > arr[i]) {
                s.pop();
            }
            next[i] = s.empty() ? n - i : s.top() - i;
            s.push(i);
        }

        // Calculate result
        long long result = 0;
        int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result = (result + (long long)arr[i] * prev[i] * next[i]) % MOD;
        }

        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> arr = {3, 1, 2, 4};
    cout << sol.sumSubarrayMins(arr) << endl; // Output: 17
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, needed for the `prev`, `next`, and stack arrays.

This solution efficiently computes the sum of the minimums of all subarrays within the constraints provided.
