[Leetcode 3193. Count the Number of Inversions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3193)
## Problem Statement

Inversion Count for an array indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If the array is already sorted, then the inversion count is 0. If the array is sorted in reverse order, the inversion count is the maximum. 

Formally, two elements `a[i]` and `a[j]` form an inversion if `a[i] > a[j]` and `i < j`.

Given an array `arr`, your task is to count the number of inversions in the array.

#### Example:
```
Input: arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The inversions are (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the size range of the array? This will help determine the most efficient algorithm.
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of values in the array? Are all values distinct or can there be duplicates?
3. **Output**: Should the output just be the count of inversions, or do we need to list the pairs as well?

## Strategy

To solve this problem interactively, we can use a merge sort based approach, which inherently helps in counting inversions with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\). This is significantly more efficient than the brute-force approach with \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.

### Steps:
1. **Divide**: Divide the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively count inversions in each half.
3. **Combine**: Count inversions where one element is in the left half and the other element is in the right half while merging the two halves.
4. Use a helper method to merge arrays and count cross inversions efficiently.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to merge two halves and count cross inversions
int mergeAndCount(vector<int>& arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
    // Creating temporary arrays
    vector<int> leftArr(arr.begin() + left, arr.begin() + mid + 1);
    vector<int> rightArr(arr.begin() + mid + 1, arr.begin() + right + 1);
    
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = left, inversions = 0;
    
    // Merge the two halves and count inversions
    while (i < leftArr.size() && j < rightArr.size()) {
        if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
            arr[k++] = leftArr[i++];
        } else {
            arr[k++] = rightArr[j++];
            inversions += leftArr.size() - i;
        }
    }
    
    // Copy remaining elements of leftArr[], if any
    while (i < leftArr.size()) {
        arr[k++] = leftArr[i++];
    }
    
    // Copy remaining elements of rightArr[], if any
    while (j < rightArr.size()) {
        arr[k++] = rightArr[j++];
    }
    
    return inversions;
}

// Function to use merge sort and count inversions
int mergeSortAndCount(vector<int>& arr, int left, int right) {
    int inversions = 0;
    
    if (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        // Count inversions in the left half
        inversions += mergeSortAndCount(arr, left, mid);
        
        // Count inversions in the right half
        inversions += mergeSortAndCount(arr, mid + 1, right);
        
        // Count cross inversions and merge the two halves
        inversions += mergeAndCount(arr, left, mid, right);
    }
    
    return inversions;
}

// Main function to count inversions
int countInversions(vector<int>& arr) {
    return mergeSortAndCount(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);
}

// Driver code
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 4, 1, 3, 5};
    cout << "Number of inversions are: " << countInversions(arr) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the merge sort algorithm.
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the use of temporary arrays during the merging process.

The above solution should efficiently handle larger input sizes as well.
