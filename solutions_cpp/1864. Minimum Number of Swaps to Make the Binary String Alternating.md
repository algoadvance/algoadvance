[Leetcode 1864. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1864)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, return the minimum number of swaps to make the string alternating, or -1 if it is impossible.

An alternating binary string is a string where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, "0101" and "1010" are alternating, while "1100" and "1001" are not.

A swap is defined as swapping any two distinct positions in the string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length of the binary string `s`? Are there any constraints on the size?
     - **Answer**: The length of the string can be up to 10^5.
2. **Output Specifications**:
   - If multiple solutions are possible, do we need to find all of them?
     - **Answer**: No, we just need to find the minimum number of swaps.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Should we handle the case where the string is already alternating?
     - **Answer**: Yes, the number of swaps for an already alternating string is 0.

## Strategy

1. **Count Characters**:
   - Count the number of '0's and '1's in the string.
   
2. **Determine Possible Patterns**:
   - For a string of length `n`, two possible alternating patterns are:
     - Start with '0': "010101..." of length `n`
     - Start with '1': "101010..." of length `n`

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - For the string to be able to convert into either of the patterns:
     - A string starting with '0' should have either `(n+1)//2` zeros and `n//2` ones or `n//2` zeros and `(n+1)//2` ones.
     - A string starting with '1' should have either `(n+1)//2` ones and `n//2` zeros or `n//2` ones and `(n+1)//2` zeros.
   - If it fails these conditions, return -1.

4. **Calculate Swaps**:
   - Calculate mismatches for both patterns and select the one with the minimum swaps.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minSwaps(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count0 = 0, count1 = 0;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '0') count0++;
        else count1++;
    }

    if (abs(count0 - count1) > 1) return -1;
    
    int mismatch1 = 0, mismatch2 = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            if (s[i] != '0') mismatch1++;
            if (s[i] != '1') mismatch2++;
        } else {
            if (s[i] != '1') mismatch1++;
            if (s[i] != '0') mismatch2++;
        }
    }

    if (count0 > count1) return mismatch1 / 2;
    if (count1 > count0) return mismatch2 / 2;
    return min(mismatch1, mismatch2) / 2;
}

int main() {
    string s = "111000"; // Example input
    cout << minSwaps(s) << endl; // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting the number of '0's and '1's**: O(n)
- **Checking mismatches for both patterns**: O(n)
- The total time complexity is **O(n)**.
