[Leetcode 1284. Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1284)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`. Each step, you can choose one cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (flip means `change 1 to 0 or 0 to 1`). A binary matrix is a matrix with all the cells equal to `0` or `1`.

Return the minimum number of steps required to convert `mat` to a zero matrix or `-1` if you cannot achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the matrix?**
   - The matrix dimensions `m` and `n` are both `1 <= m, n <= 3`.

2. **What are the values inside the matrix?**
   - The matrix contains only binary values `0` or `1`.

3. **Can we assume that the matrix will not be empty?**
   - Yes, the matrix will always have a size within the specified range.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here are the steps:

1. **State Representation**: Represent the matrix as a single integer using bit manipulation, where each bit represents the state of a cell (0 or 1).
2. **Initial State**: The initial state is created from the given binary matrix.
3. **Target State**: The desired state is an integer with all bits set to 0 (zero matrix).
4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to store the current state and the number of flips made.
   - Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid redundant calculations.
   - From each state, generate all possible next states by flipping each cell and its neighbors, then push them to the queue if not visited.
5. **Termination**:
   - If during BFS, we reach the target state, return the number of steps.
   - If the queue is empty without reaching the target, return `-1`.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation based on the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
        int start = 0, target = 0; 

        // Encode the initial state to a single integer
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    start |= (1 << (i*n + j));
                }
            }
        }

        // Directions array for flipping neighbors: right, left, down, up
        vector<int> directions = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        unordered_set<int> visited;

        q.push({start, 0});
        visited.insert(start);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int curr = q.front().first;
            int steps = q.front().second;
            q.pop();

            if (curr == target) return steps;

            for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    int next = curr;
                    // Flip the current cell and its neighbors
                    next ^= (1 << (i*n + j));
                    for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
                        int ni = i + directions[k];
                        int nj = j + directions[k + 1];
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n) {
                            next ^= (1 << (ni*n + nj));
                        }
                    }
                    if (visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                        visited.insert(next);
                        q.push({next, steps + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is `O(2^(m*n))`, where each state is represented by an `m*n` bit integer. This is feasible because the maximum value of `m` and `n` is 3, meaning the maximum number of states to explore is `2^9 = 512`. This ensures that the solution is efficient given the constraints.
