[Leetcode 528. Random Pick with Weight](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l528)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `w` of positive integers where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`, write a function `pickIndex` that randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

Implement the `Solution` class:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& w);
    int pickIndex();
};
```

- `Solution(vector<int>& w)` Initializes the object with the given array `w`.
- `int pickIndex()` Returns a random index based on the weight distribution.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values that `w` can take?
    - What is the range of the length of `w`?

2. **Randomness**:
    - Is there a specific random seed we should use, or do we assume truly random behavior?

3. **Performance**:
    - Are there any performance constraints or requirements, especially regarding time complexity for initialization and pick operations?

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>

class Solution {
public:
    Solution(std::vector<int>& w) : prefixSums(w.size(), 0) {
        // Calculate the prefix sums
        prefixSums[0] = w[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < w.size(); ++i) {
            prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i - 1] + w[i];
        }
    }
    
    int pickIndex() {
        int totalSum = prefixSums.back();
        int randWeight = rand() % totalSum;

        // Binary search for the correct index
        int low = 0, high = prefixSums.size() - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (randWeight >= prefixSums[mid]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

private:
    std::vector<int> prefixSums;
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization (`Solution` constructor)**:
    - Calculate prefix sums of the input weights. This enables us to map the weights to ranges, which will facilitate the index selection later.
    - `prefixSums[i]` will hold the sum of `w[0]` to `w[i]`.

2. **Index Picking (`pickIndex` method)**:
    - Generate a random number between 0 and the total sum of weights minus one.
    - Use binary search to find the smallest index such that the prefix sum is greater than the random number. This index corresponds to the weight ranges correctly.
    - The binary search ensures that the "search" part of picking an index is efficient.

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**:
    - Time complexity is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input vector `w`.
  
- **Pick Index**:
    - Time complexity is \(O(\log n)\) due to the binary search on the prefix sums.

This solution ensures that the `pickIndex` operation is efficient even for large input sizes, striking a balance between preprocessing time and query time.
