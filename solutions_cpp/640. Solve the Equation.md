[Leetcode 640. Solve the Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l640)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to solve a linear equation represented as a string `equation`. The equation contains one variable `x` and is in the format of `ax + b = cx + d`. Here `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers (they can be positive, negative or zero). The goal is to find the value of `x`.

When parsing the equation, note:
- The equation contains and an equal sign `=` to represent the equality.
- The equation may have spaces, digits, '+' (which can be omitted), '-' (before integers and variables), and variable `x`.

Output either the solution, "No solution" if the equation has no solution, or "Infinite solutions" if the equation has infinitely many solutions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** Should the input be considered as always being in a linear form involving one variable `x`?
   - Yes, the input is guaranteed to be a valid linear equation involving one variable `x`.

2. **Spaces:** Do we need to handle spaces in the equation?
   - Spaces are part of the input string and should be handled appropriately, although typical inputs may not contain spaces.

3. **Integer Values:** Are we expecting integer coefficients and constants only?
   - Yes, the coefficients and constants will be integers.

## Strategy

1. **Parse the Equation:**
   - Split the equation into two parts around the `=` sign.
   - Parse each part to evaluate the coefficients of `x` and the constants.

2. **Evaluate Each Side Independently:**
   - For each side of the equation, go through terms to identify and accumulate coefficients of `x` and constants.

3. **Combine Results:**
   - After parsing, combine the results from both sides and solve the linear equation `ax + b = 0` form.

4. **Determine Output:**
   - If the coefficient of `x` equals zero:
     - If the constant term is also zero, output "Infinite solutions".
     - Otherwise, output "No solution".
   - Else compute the solution for `x` and output it in the required format.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

pair<int, int> parseEquationSide(const string& side) {
    int coefficient = 0, constant = 0;
    int sign = 1; // for the leading sign
    int num = 0;
    bool numStarted = false;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < side.size(); ++i) {
        char c = side[i];
        
        if (isdigit(c)) {
            numStarted = true;
            num = num * 10 + (c - '0');
        } else if (c == 'x') {
            // When x is directly prefixed by a digit, complete the number read so far
            if (!numStarted) num = 1;
            coefficient += sign * num;
            numStarted = false;
            num = 0;
        } else if (c == '+' || c == '-') {
            // Complete the previous number if any
            if (numStarted) {
                constant += sign * num;
                numStarted = false;
                num = 0;
            }
            // Update the sign for the next number/x
            sign = (c == '-') ? -1 : 1;
        }
    }
    
    // If a number was in progress at the end
    if (numStarted) constant += sign * num;
    
    return {coefficient, constant};
}

string solveEquation(string equation) {
    size_t pos = equation.find('=');
    string left = equation.substr(0, pos);
    string right = equation.substr(pos + 1);
    
    // Parse both sides
    auto leftResult = parseEquationSide(left);
    auto rightResult = parseEquationSide(right);
    
    // Left: ax + b, Right: cx + d
    int coefficient = leftResult.first - rightResult.first;
    int constant = rightResult.second - leftResult.second;
    
    if (coefficient == 0) {
        if (constant == 0) return "Infinite solutions";
        else return "No solution";
    }
    
    int x = constant / coefficient;
    return "x=" + to_string(x);
}

int main() {
    string equation = "2x+3x-6x=x+2";
    cout << solveEquation(equation) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for parsing and solving the equation is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The operations include parsing the string and performing constant-time arithmetic, both of which are linear concerning the input string length.
