[Leetcode 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1626)
## Problem Statement
You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to select the team with the highest overall score. The score for each player is calculated as the sum of their individual scores. However, the team must be chosen such that no conflicts arise; a conflict occurs if a younger player has a higher score than an older player.

Given two arrays `scores` and `ages`, where `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represent the score and age of the i-th player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be more than one player with the same age and score?**
   - Yes, multiple players can have the same age and score.
   
2. **Can a team consist of all players provided?**
   - Yes, as long as there are no conflicts in terms of ages and scores.
   
3. **What constraints are given for the input sizes?**
   - `1 <= scores.length, ages.length <= 1000`
   - `scores.length == ages.length`
   - `1 <= scores[i] <= 10^6`
   - `1 <= ages[i] <= 1000`

## Strategy
We can think of this problem as a variant of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. We'll solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). The strategy is as follows:

1. **Combine and Sort**: First, combine the ages and scores into a single list of tuples. Sort the list primarily by age in ascending order and secondarily by score in ascending order.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: Create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score we can achieve by selecting players from the subset ending at player `i`.
   
3. **Fill the DP Array**: Iterate over each player and for each player, iterate over all previous players to update the DP value. If the current player's score is not less than the previous player's score, update the DP value to consider this player as part of the team without causing conflicts.

4. **Compute the Result**: The answer will be the maximum value in the DP array.

## Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int bestTeamScore(vector<int>& scores, vector<int>& ages) {
    vector<pair<int, int>> players;
    int n = scores.size();
    
    // Create a list of players with (age, score) pairs
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        players.push_back({ages[i], scores[i]});
    }
    
    // Sort players first by age, then by score
    sort(players.begin(), players.end());
    
    // Initialize DP array
    vector<int> dp(n);
    int bestScore = 0;
    
    // Fill DP array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = players[i].second; // The best team including only this player
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            // Ensure no conflicts
            if (players[i].second >= players[j].second) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + players[i].second);
            }
        }
        bestScore = max(bestScore, dp[i]);
    }
    
    return bestScore;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of players.
- **DP computation**: O(n^2) in the worst case since we iterate over all pairs of players.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**, which is efficient given the constraints.
