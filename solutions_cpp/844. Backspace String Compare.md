## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 844: Backspace String Compare

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue to be empty.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters can the strings contain besides `#`?**
   - The strings will contain lowercase letters and the `#` character.

2. **Is the comparison case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, the comparison is case-sensitive.

3. **What is the maximum length for the strings `s` and `t`?**
   - Both strings can have lengths up to 200.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem efficiently using a two-pointer approach working from the end of both strings towards the beginning:

1. **Iterate backward through strings `s` and `t`**:
    - Use pointers to iterate backwards through both strings.
    - Skip characters when a `#` is encountered and adjust pointers appropriately to account for backspaces.
   
2. **Character Comparison**:
    - Compare the non-backspaced versions of `s` and `t` by iterating over them from the end to the beginning.
    - If at any point the characters being compared are different, return `false`.
    - If all characters match, return `true`.

This approach avoids explicitly building the final strings, thus optimizing space and time complexities.

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool backspaceCompare(string s, string t) {
        int i = s.size() - 1, j = t.size() - 1;
        int skipS = 0, skipT = 0;

        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
            // Process backspaces in s
            while (i >= 0) {
                if (s[i] == '#') {
                    skipS++;
                    i--;
                } else if (skipS > 0) {
                    skipS--;
                    i--;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }

            // Process backspaces in t
            while (j >= 0) {
                if (t[j] == '#') {
                    skipT++;
                    j--;
                } else if (skipT > 0) {
                    skipT--;
                    j--;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && s[i] != t[j]) {
                return false;
            }

            // If one string is finished and the other isn't, they aren't equal
            if ((i >= 0) != (j >= 0)) {
                return false;
            }

            i--;
            j--;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m) where `n` and `m` are the lengths of strings `s` and `t` respectively. In the worst case, each character in the strings is processed once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we are using a constant amount of additional space for the pointers and skip counters.
