[Leetcode 2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2457)
## Problem Statement:

Given two positive integers `n` and `target`, an integer is considered "beautiful" if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`. You are asked to find the minimum non-negative integer `x` that needs to be added to `n` so that the resulting integer is beautiful.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** What are the range constraints for `n` and `target`?
   - **A:** Both `n` and `target` are positive integers. There are no explicit constraints provided, but we should assume typical integer range constraints.

2. **Q:** Can `n` and `target` be very large?
   - **A:** Yes, they can be large given the typical constraints in coding problems.

3. **Q:** Can the result of adding `x` to `n` overflow standard integer types in C++?
   - **A:** We can handle large numbers using the `long long` data type to prevent overflow issues.

## Strategy:

1. **Sum of Digits Function:** Create a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
2. **Iterative Check:** Starting from 0, continually add numbers to `n` until the digit sum of the resulting number is less than or equal to `target`.
3. **Optimal Approach:** Given that large additions quickly grow the sum, consider refining the approach by generating the next candidate more intelligently to reduce iterations.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to compute the sum of digits of a number.
long long sumOfDigits(long long num) {
    long long sum = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

// Function to find the minimum addition x such that n + x is beautiful.
long long makeBeautiful(long long n, int target) {
    if (sumOfDigits(n) <= target) return 0;

    long long result = 0;
    long long increment = 1;

    while (sumOfDigits(n + result) > target) {
        // Find the next digit boundary we need to round up to.
        long long nextRound = (n / increment + 1) * increment;
        result = nextRound - n;
        increment *= 10; // Move to the next digit place.
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    long long n;
    int target;
    
    // Sample Input
    cout << "Enter n: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter target: ";
    cin >> target;

    long long result = makeBeautiful(n, target);
    cout << "The minimum addition x: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is O(log10(n)) due to iterating through the digits of `n` and checking boundary conditions.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results.
