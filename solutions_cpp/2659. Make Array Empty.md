[Leetcode 2659. Make Array Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2659)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty. In one operation, you can:
1. Choose any index `i` (0 <= i < nums.size()) and remove `nums[i]` from the array.
2. If you remove `nums[i]`, all elements `nums[j]` for which `nums[j] <= nums[i]` are also considered as removed.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the array size or values within the array?**
   - Typical constraints are:
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
     - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

2. **Do we need to handle duplicate elements in any specific manner?**
   - No special handling for duplicates. The problem statement's condition will treat duplicates naturally under the given rules.

3. **Is the order of operations affecting the final count?**
   - Yes, the order of operations matters in order to minimize the total number of operations.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: Sort the array so that we can efficiently manage the condition `nums[j] <= nums[i]`. By processing in non-decreasing order, once an element is removed, all smaller elements have already been handled or will be handled in the current operation.
  
2. **Efficiency**: Use a greedy approach to count distinct elements that require separate operations. As we sort the array, we can iterate through it while skipping elements that are already considered "removed" by a previous operation.

3. **Implementation**: Keep track of the number of unique highest elements needing individual removal.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int makeArrayEmpty(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Sort the array
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    int operations = 0;
    unordered_set<int> removed_elements;
    
    // Iterate over the sorted array
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        // If the current element is already removed (or considered), skip it
        if (removed_elements.find(nums[i]) != removed_elements.end()) {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Increment the operation count for this distinct element
        operations++;
        
        // Mark the current element and all who are less than or equal to it as removed
        removed_elements.insert(nums[i]);
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time.
2. **Iteration and Operations**: Iterating through the array takes O(n) time, and each insertion into the set is O(1) on average.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.

With this approach, we ensure that the array is emptied using the minimum number of operations by leveraging the sorted order to handle multiple elements in a single operation effectively.
