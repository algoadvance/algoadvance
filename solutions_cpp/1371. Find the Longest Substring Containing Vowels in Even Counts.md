[Leetcode 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1371)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters. A substring is considered valid if each vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`) appears an even number of times in it.

Return the length of the longest valid substring.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input string empty?**
   - No, we can assume the input string has at least one character.
2. **Are vowels case-sensitive?**
   - No, we only consider lowercase English letters.
3. **What should be returned if no such substring exists?**
   - If no valid substring exists, the function should return 0.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use bit manipulation and a hashmap to keep track of the first occurrence of each bitmask state. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Bitmask to Track Vowel Counts**: Use a bitmask of size 5 to represent the count of each vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`), where each bit in the mask represents whether the respective vowel count is even or odd.
   - For example, if the bitmask is `01010`, it means:
     - `'a'` count is even (0)
     - `'e'` count is odd (1)
     - `'i'` count is even (0)
     - `'o'` count is odd (1)
     - `'u'` count is even (0)

2. **HashMap to Store States**: Maintain a hashmap to store the earliest occurrence of each state (bitmask) so we can quickly calculate the length of the substring when we encounter the same state again.

3. **Iterate Through the String**: As we iterate through the string, we update the state based on the current character, check if this state has been seen before, and calculate the maximum length of valid substrings.

4. **Handle Initial State**: The initial state (all vowel counts even) should be handled as well.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int findTheLongestSubstring(const std::string& s) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> state_map;
    state_map[0] = -1;  // Initial state: all counts even, positioned before the start of the string.
    int state = 0;
    int max_length = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        // Update the state based on the current character
        switch (s[i]) {
            case 'a':
                state ^= 1 << 0;
                break;
            case 'e':
                state ^= 1 << 1;
                break;
            case 'i':
                state ^= 1 << 2;
                break;
            case 'o':
                state ^= 1 << 3;
                break;
            case 'u':
                state ^= 1 << 4;
                break;
        }

        // Check if the current state has been seen before
        if (state_map.find(state) != state_map.end()) {
            max_length = std::max(max_length, i - state_map[state]);
        } else {
            state_map[state] = i;
        }
    }

    return max_length;
}

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     std::string s = "eleetminicoworoep";
//     std::cout << "Longest substring with even vowel counts: " << findTheLongestSubstring(s) << std::endl;
//     return 0;
// }
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. We traverse the string once and all operations (bitwise checks and hashmap operations) are \(O(1)\).
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(2^5) = O(1)\) due to the fixed size (32 states) of our bitmask states, but also considering an auxiliary space for the hashmap which might take additional space based on the particular string used.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring with all vowels appearing an even number of times.
