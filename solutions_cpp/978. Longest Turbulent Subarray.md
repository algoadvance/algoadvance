[Leetcode 978. Longest Turbulent Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l978)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of `arr`.

A subarray `arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[j]` is considered turbulent if and only if:

For `i <= k < j`:
- `arr[k] > arr[k+1]` when `k` is odd, and `arr[k] < arr[k+1]` when `k` is even; OR,
- `arr[k] < arr[k+1]` when `k` is odd, and `arr[k] > arr[k+1]` when `k` is even.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Single Element Array**: What should be the output for arrays with only one element?
   - If the array has only one element, the longest turbulent subarray has length 1.
2. **Array with All Elements the Same**: What should be the output if all elements in the array are the same?
   - If all elements are the same, the longest turbulent subarray is just any single element with length 1.
3. **Constraints**: Is there any constraint on the length of the array or value of elements?
   - Yes, `1 <= arr.length <= 4 * 10^4` and `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`.

## Strategy
We will use a sliding window approach to dynamically find the maximum length of the turbulent subarray:
1. Initialize two pointers for the sliding window (`left` and `right`).
2. Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer and adjust the `left` pointer to maintain the turbulent condition.
3. For each position, determine if the subarray between `left` and `right` is turbulent.
4. Update the maximum length when a valid turbulent subarray is found.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxTurbulenceSize(vector<int>& arr) {
    if (arr.size() == 1) return 1;
    
    int n = arr.size();
    int maxLength = 1;
    int left = 0;
    
    for (int right = 1; right < n; ++right) {
        int comp = (arr[right] > arr[right - 1]) ? 1 
                   : (arr[right] < arr[right - 1]) ? -1 
                   : 0;
        
        if (right == 1 || (comp == 0) || (comp == 1 && arr[right - 1] <= arr[right - 2]) || (comp == -1 && arr[right - 1] >= arr[right - 2])) {
            left = right - 1;
        }

        if (comp != 0) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. The algorithm traverses the array once with the sliding window technique.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a constant amount of additional space.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the maximum length of a turbulent subarray using a linear pass through the array.
