[Leetcode 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1437)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. The array only contains the integers `0` and `1`. Return `true` if all `1`s are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second and third 1s are only one position apart from each other.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length - 1`
- `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any edge cases to consider?**
   - An edge case might be where the array contains all `0`s or only one `1`.
   
2. **How should we handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array?**
   - It is given that `0 <= k <= nums.length - 1`, so we don’t need to handle those cases.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the input will always be valid?**
   - Yes, according to the constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a variable `last_index` to store the index of the previous `1` encountered and set it to -1 initially.**
2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - When you encounter a `1`, check if `last_index` is not -1 (indicating it’s not the first `1` you are encountering).
   - If it is not, calculate the distance from the last encountered `1` and see if it is less than `k`.
   - If the distance is less than `k`, return `false`.
   - Update `last_index` to the current index.
3. **If the loop completes without returning `false`, return `true`.**

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool kLengthApart(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int last_index = -1;  // To store the index of the last encountered `1`

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == 1) {
            if (last_index != -1) {  // Check the distance from the last `1`
                if (i - last_index - 1 < k) {
                    return false;  // Distance is less than `k`
                }
            }
            last_index = i;  // Update the last index to the current index
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we only perform a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
