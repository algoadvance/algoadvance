[Leetcode 2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2311)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`, you need to return the length of the longest binary subsequence of `s` that is less than or equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a subsequence in this context?**
   A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **What are the constraints on the length of the input string `s` and the value of `k`?**
   Typically, constraints would be something like:
   - The length of `s` will be between `1` and `1000`.
   - `k` will be a positive integer up to `10^9`.

3. **Should the output be the exact length of the subsequence, or is there any other specific formatting required?**
   The output should be the integer length of the longest binary subsequence that is less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Can `s` contain characters other than `0` and `1`?**
   No, `s` will only contain the characters `0` and `1`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we will use the following approach:

1. **Understanding Binary and Subsequences:**
   - We need to construct a binary number from the subsequence and compare it with `k`.
   - The most significant bits ('1's at higher places) will significantly increase the value. Thus, we'll prioritize including less significant '1's (towards the right) first.

2. **Iterate Backwards:**
   - We'll check the string from the end to the start.
   - Whenever a '0' is encountered, it can always be part of our subsequence without increasing the subset value.
   - For '1's, their inclusion needs careful checking since they increase the value more drastically.

3. **Keep Track of the Value:**
   - Maintain a current value of the subsequence and a counter to track how many bits are included.
   - Use bit manipulation or simple arithmetic to track and ensure the value stays within bounds of `k`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int longestSubsequence(std::string s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    int length = 0;
    int value = 0;
    int power = 1; // Represents the value of the current bit in binary (2^0, 2^1, 2^2 ...)
    
    // Traverse the string from the end to the beginning
    for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if(s[i] == '0') {
            // '0' can always be included without affecting the value
            length++;
        } else if(s[i] == '1') {
            // Check if adding this '1' would still make the value <= k
            if(value + power <= k) {
                value += power;
                length++;
            }
        }
        // Update the power of 2 (shift left by 1 in subsequent iterations)
        if(power <= k) {
            power <<= 1; // or power *= 2;
        }
    }
    return length;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "1001010";
    int k = 5;
    std::cout << "Result: " << longestSubsequence(s, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. We iterate over the string once from the end to the beginning.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. We use a few integer variables irrespective of the input size.

This approach ensures that we maximize the length of the binary subsequence while keeping its resultant value less than or equal to `k`.
