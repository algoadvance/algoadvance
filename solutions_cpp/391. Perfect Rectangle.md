[Leetcode 391. Perfect Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l391)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]` represents an axis-aligned rectangle. For example, a rectangle with bottom-left corner (x1, y1) and top-right corner (x2, y2). We are to determine if these rectangles together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

For these rectangles to form a perfect rectangle cover:
1. All rectangles must perfectly cover a rectangular region without overlaps.
2. The combined shape formed by these rectangles must be a rectangle itself.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we jump into the solution, let's clarify a few things:
1. Can rectangles overlap partially or entirely? (They should not overlap if they form a perfect rectangle).
2. Are the coordinates guaranteed to be integers?
3. Is the input guaranteed to be non-empty?

### Strategy

To determine if the rectangles form a perfect rectangle, we need to check the following:

1. **Sum of Areas:** The sum of the areas of all given rectangles should equal the area of the bounding rectangle formed by the minimum and maximum corner points of all rectangles.
2. **Corner Points:** The perfect cover should have exactly 4 corners once all rectangles' corners are considered (the four corners of the bounding rectangle).
3. **Overlap Check:** Using the set of corners, ensure each internal corner point appears an even number of times.

### Steps to Implement

1. Calculate the sum of the areas of all rectangles.
2. Track the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` values to determine the overall bounding rectangle.
3. Use a set to track corner points:
   - For each rectangle, toggle the inclusion of its four corners in the set.
   - After processing all rectangles, the set should only contain the four corners of the bounding rectangle if thereâ€™s no overlap.
4. Verify the area and the number of distinct corners.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isRectangleCover(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles) {
        // To keep track of all corners
        set<pair<int, int>> cornerSet;
        
        // Variables to find the minimum enclosing rectangle
        int minX = INT_MAX, minY = INT_MAX, maxX = INT_MIN, maxY = INT_MIN;
        long long areaSum = 0;
        
        for (const auto& rect : rectangles) {
            int x1 = rect[0], y1 = rect[1], x2 = rect[2], y2 = rect[3];
            
            // Update the bounding rectangle
            minX = min(minX, x1);
            minY = min(minY, y1);
            maxX = max(maxX, x2);
            maxY = max(maxY, y2);
            
            // Compute area of the current rectangle
            areaSum += (long long)(x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1);
            
            // Process all 4 corners of the current rectangle
            pair<int, int> corners[] = { {x1, y1}, {x1, y2}, {x2, y1}, {x2, y2} };
            
            for (const auto& corner : corners) {
                if (cornerSet.count(corner)) {
                    cornerSet.erase(corner);
                } else {
                    cornerSet.insert(corner);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check the sum of areas against the bounding rectangle's area
        long long boundingArea = (long long)(maxX - minX) * (maxY - minY);
        if (areaSum != boundingArea) return false;
        
        // Ensure there are exactly 4 corners left in the set
        if (cornerSet.size() != 4) return false;
        
        // Ensure the corner set contains the bounding rectangle's corners
        if (!cornerSet.count({minX, minY}) || !cornerSet.count({minX, maxY}) ||
            !cornerSet.count({maxX, minY}) || !cornerSet.count({maxX, maxY})) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of rectangles. This is because we:
1. Traverse and process each rectangle once to calculate areas, update corner set, and bounding rectangle.
2. The set operations (insert, erase, count) are `O(log k)` where `k` is the number of elements in the set, but in the worst case, `k` is small because it's bounded by the number of corners.

Thus, our approach effectively ensures a linear relationship with the number of input rectangles.
