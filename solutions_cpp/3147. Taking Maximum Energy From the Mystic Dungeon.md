[Leetcode 3147. Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3147)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `2D` grid `G` representing a mystic dungeon. Each cell in the grid has an integer value representing the energy one gains or loses on stepping into that cell. Your task is to find a path from the top-left corner of the grid `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right corner of the grid `(m-1, n-1)` that maximizes the total energy acquired along the path.

You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Write a function `maximumEnergy(grid: vector<vector<int>>) -> int` to return the maximum energy that can be collected from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [[1, 3, 1], [1, -5, 1], [4, 2, 1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: The path 1→3→1→1→1→1 ensures maximum energy of 8.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[1, 3], [1, 5]]
Output: 9
Explanation: The path 1→3→5 ensures maximum energy which is 9.
```

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.size()`
- `n == grid[i].size()`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100` 
- `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we move diagonally?**
   * No, only move right or down.
2. **Are there any negative values in the grid?**
   * Yes, cells can also represent energy losses with negative values.
   
## Strategy

- Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem.
- Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum energy collected to reach cell `(i, j)` from cell `(0, 0)`.
- Initialize `dp[0][0]` with `grid[0][0]` since that is the starting point.
- For each cell `(i, j)`, the energy can be maximized by coming either from the cell above `(i-1, j)` or the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.
- Update the DP table using the formula:
  - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]` if `i > 0` and `j > 0`

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int maximumEnergy(vector<vector<int>> &grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
    
    // Initialize first column
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
    }
    
    // Initialize first row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
    }
    
    // Fill the rest of the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {{1, 3, 1}, {1, -5, 1}, {4, 2, 1}};
    cout << "Output: " << maximumEnergy(grid) << endl;  // Output should be 8
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) because we need to fill out each cell in the dp table exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) for the DP table.
