[Leetcode 2751. Robot Collisions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2751)
### Problem Statement

You are given two lists, `positions` and `speeds`, which represent the initial positions and speeds of a list of robots on a number line. All robots move at their constant speed. If two robots collide, they stop.

You need to determine all possible collisions and report the times these collisions will occur.

**Input Format:**

- `positions`: A list of integers where each integer represents the initial position of a robot.
- `speeds`: A list of integers where each integer represents the speed of the respective robot in `positions`.

**Output Format:**

- Return a list of floats where each float represents the time at which a collision will occur. The list should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Direction and Speed:**
   - Are all robots moving in the same direction or opposite directions, or is it mixed?
   - Speeds can be negative (indicating opposite directions)?

2. **Output:**
   - What if multiple collisions occur at the same time?
   - Are we supposed to only report the first collision for each pair of robots?

Assuming the basic scenario where robots are moving rightward and we just report the first collision involving each robot, we could proceed. Here's the solution:

### Strategy

1. **Understand Basic Case:**
   - Two robots will collide if one is behind the other and moves faster.
   - Calculate collision times for each possible pair of robots.
   - If `position1 < position2` and `speed1 > speed2`, they will collide.

2. **Collision Time Calculation:**
   - Relative speed: \( \text{relative\_speed} = \text{speed2} - \text{speed1} \)
   - Collision time: \( \text{time} = (\text{position2} - \text{position1}) / \text{relative\_speed} \)
   
3. **Store and Sort:**
   - Store each calculated collision time in a list.
   - Sort the list in non-decreasing order.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) - due to checking every possible pair for collisions and sorting the resulting list.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n^2) \) - in the worst case, every pair results in a collision time being stored.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<double> getCollisionTimes(const std::vector<int>& positions, const std::vector<int>& speeds) {
    int n = positions.size();
    std::vector<double> collision_times;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            // Calculate if i and j will collide, and when
            if (positions[i] < positions[j] && speeds[i] > speeds[j]) {
                double time = static_cast<double>(positions[j] - positions[i]) / (speeds[i] - speeds[j]);
                collision_times.push_back(time);
            } else if (positions[j] < positions[i] && speeds[j] > speeds[i]) {
                double time = static_cast<double>(positions[i] - positions[j]) / (speeds[j] - speeds[i]);
                collision_times.push_back(time);
            }
        }
    }

    // Sort the collision times in non-decreasing order
    std::sort(collision_times.begin(), collision_times.end());
    return collision_times;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    std::vector<int> positions = {1, 3, 7};
    std::vector<int> speeds = {5, 2, 4};

    std::vector<double> collisionTimes = getCollisionTimes(positions, speeds);
    for (double time : collisionTimes) {
        std::cout << time << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code calculates and prints out the times at which the robots will collide, sorted in non-decreasing order. Adjustments can be made based on further clarifications or edge cases.
