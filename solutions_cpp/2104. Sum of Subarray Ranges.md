[Leetcode 2104. Sum of Subarray Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2104)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 2104: "Sum of Subarray Ranges"

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of all subarray ranges of `nums`.

A subarray range is the difference between the largest and smallest element in the subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of input size?**
   - The length of the array `nums` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
2. **What kind of values can the elements in the array take?**
   - Each element of `nums` will be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.
3. **Do we need to handle inputs that don't conform to these constraints?**
   - We can assume that all inputs provided will adhere to the given constraints.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sum of subarray ranges efficiently:

1. Iterate through all possible subarrays.
2. For each subarray, find the minimum and maximum values.
3. Calculate the range (difference between maximum and minimum values).
4. Accumulate the sum of these ranges.

Even though this involves nested loops and might seem inefficient, for an array size limited to `1000`, even an O(n^3) solution should work within the constraints.

### Code
Below is the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // For std::max and std::min

class Solution {
public:
    long long subArrayRanges(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        long long result = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int minVal = nums[i], maxVal = nums[i];
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                minVal = std::min(minVal, nums[j]);
                maxVal = std::max(maxVal, nums[j]);
                result += (maxVal - minVal);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    std::cout << solution.subArrayRanges(nums) << std::endl; // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2):

- The outer loop runs `n` times.
- The inner loop also runs up to `n` times for each iteration of the outer loop.

Thus, in total, we have O(n^2) operations, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) additional space aside from the input array. We're only using a few extra integer variables to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values.

This implementation should work efficiently for the given constraints.
