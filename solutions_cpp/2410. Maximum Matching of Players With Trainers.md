[Leetcode 2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2410)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `players` and `trainers`, where:
- `players[i]` and `trainers[j]` represent the skill levels of the `ith` player and `jth` trainer, respectively.

A player and a trainer can only be matched if the player's skill level is less than or equal to the trainer's skill level. Each player can be matched with at most one trainer and vice versa.

Return the maximum number of matching pairs that can be formed.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
players = [4, 7, 9]
trainers = [8, 2, 5, 8]
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:** 
- Player with skill 4 can be matched with Trainer with skill 8.
- Player with skill 7 can be matched with Trainer with skill 8.
- Player with skill 9 cannot be matched with any trainer.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the arrays always non-empty?**
   Yes, you can assume the arrays will contain at least one element.

2. **Are the arrays sorted?**
   No, the arrays are not necessarily sorted.

3. **Is it guaranteed that both arrays will have no duplicate values?**
   No such constraint is given. Both arrays can have duplicate values.

## Strategy

1. **Sort both arrays:**
   To maximize the number of matches efficiently, we can sort both arrays in non-decreasing order.

2. **Two-pointer technique:**
   Use two pointers to traverse through the sorted `players` and `trainers` arrays.
   - Initialize pointers `i` and `j` to the start of `players` and `trainers` arrays, respectively.
   - Loop until one of the pointers reaches the end of the respective array.
   - If `players[i]` is less than or equal to `trainers[j]`, we have a match:
     - Increment both `i` and `j` and count the match.
   - Otherwise, just increment `j` because the current trainer `j` cannot match any player who has a lower skill level than `players[i]`.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   Sorting both arrays takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the longer array. Scanning both arrays with two pointers is `O(n)`. Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to sorting.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int matchPlayersAndTrainers(std::vector<int>& players, std::vector<int>& trainers) {
        // Sort both arrays.
        std::sort(players.begin(), players.end());
        std::sort(trainers.begin(), trainers.end());
        
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int matched_pairs = 0;
        
        // Use two-pointer technique to find the maximum number of matches.
        while (i < players.size() && j < trainers.size()) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                // Found a match.
                matched_pairs++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                // Move to the next trainer.
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return matched_pairs;
    }
};
```

This implementation efficiently finds the maximum number of matching pairs using sorting and the two-pointer technique.
