[Leetcode 407. Trapping Rain Water II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l407)
## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the height values in the `heightMap`?**
   Typically, height values would be non-negative integers, but it would be ideal to confirm this as it affects input validation.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the dimensions `m` and `n` of the `heightMap`?**
   Confirming the limits for `m` and `n` will help in understanding if the solution needs to be optimized for very large matrices.
   
3. **How should we handle edge cases?**
   For example, what should be returned if either dimension `m` or `n` is less than or equal to 2 (since no water can be trapped in such a case)?

For now, assuming typical constraints:
- Heights are non-negative integers.
- `m` and `n` are such that the matrix is reasonably large.

## Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The task involves calculating the trapped water in a 2D elevation map.
   - Water trapped at a point depends on the minimum height boundary enclosing that point.

2. **Priority Queue Approach:**
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always process the shortest boundary cell first.
   - Expand outwards from the shortest boundary, updating the trapped water as we go.

3. **Algorithm Steps:**
   1. Use a boolean matrix to mark visited cells.
   2. Insert all boundary cells into a min-heap and mark them as visited.
   3. While the heap is not empty, extract the minimum element; for each of its valid neighboring cells:
      - If it is not visited, calculate the water it can trap (based on the difference between the current boundary height and the neighboring cell's height).
      - Update the neighboring cell height if it's trapping water and push it into the heap.
4. Sum up the trapped water as we process each cell.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int trapRainWater(vector<vector<int>>& heightMap) {
        if (heightMap.empty()) return 0;
        int m = heightMap.size(), n = heightMap[0].size();
        if (m <= 2 || n <= 2) return 0; // If the grid is too small, no water can be trapped

        // Priority queue to process cells by their height.
        auto comp = [](const pair<int, int>& a, const pair<int, int>& b) {
            return a.first > b.first;
        };
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, decltype(comp)> minHeap(comp);
        
        // Visited matrix to avoid reprocessing cells
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));

        // Add all boundary cells to the heap and mark as visited
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i == 0 || i == m - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1) {
                    minHeap.push({heightMap[i][j], i * n + j});
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // 4 possible directions to move in the grid
        vector<int> dirs = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};
        int waterTrapped = 0;

        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            auto [height, idx] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            int x = idx / n, y = idx % n;

            // Checking all 4 directions
            for (int k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
                int nx = x + dirs[k], ny = y + dirs[k + 1];
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                    // Water trapped is the difference between the current cell height
                    // and the neighboring cell height
                    int trapped = max(0, height - heightMap[nx][ny]);
                    waterTrapped += trapped;
                    
                    // Update the height of the cell being considered, and push it onto the heap
                    minHeap.push({max(heightMap[nx][ny], height), nx * n + ny});
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return waterTrapped;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \cdot n \log (m \cdot n))\) because:
- Each cell is processed once, giving \(O(m \cdot n)\) cells.
- Priority queue operations (insert and extract-min) take \(O(\log (m \cdot n))\) time.

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(m \cdot n \log (m \cdot n))\). The space complexity is \(O(m \cdot n)\) due to the use of the visited matrix and the heap.
