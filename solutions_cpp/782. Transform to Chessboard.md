[Leetcode 782. Transform to Chessboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l782)
## Problem Statement

In an N x N grid representing a chessboard, each cell is either a 0 or a 1. You are allowed to swap any two rows or columns. The goal is to transform the board into a "chessboard" where no two adjacent cells are the same.

A board is a chessboard if and only if each cell is different from any of its 8 surrounding cells (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

Return the minimum number of swaps to transform the given board into a chessboard. If it is not possible to transform the board into a chessboard, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of N?**
   - Typically, values of N will be in the range from 2 to 30 for such problems.

2. **Can the board contain values other than 0 or 1?**
   - No, the board will only contain 0s and 1s as per the problem statement.

3. **Is it guaranteed that there is always a solution?**
   - No, it is not guaranteed. If a transformation is not possible, we should return -1.

4. **Are there any constraints on the execution time?**
   - Yes, solution needs to be optimized to run within a reasonable time frame given N=30.

## Strategy

1. **Check Validity**: First, let's check if it's possible to transform the given board to a chessboard.
   - Every row and every column must match one of two patterns: either alternating starting with 0 or alternating starting with 1.
   - Every row and column should have equal counts of 0s and 1s (or differ by at most 1 if N is odd).

2. **Calculate Swaps**:
   - The basic approach is to figure out how many swaps are needed to get all rows to match one of the two row patterns and all columns to match one of the two column patterns.
   - We calculate swaps needed for rows and columns separately and ensure minimal swaps to achieve the alternating pattern.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Counts swaps needed to alternate starting with 0 or starting with 1.
   - Choose the option with fewer swaps.

## Code

```c++
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int movesToChessboard(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int N = board.size();
        vector<int> rows(N), cols(N);
        
        for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
                rows[i] |= (board[i][j] << j);
                cols[j] |= (board[i][j] << i);
            }
        }

        int rowMask1 = (1 << (N/2)) - 1;
        int rowMask2 = ((1 << (N-N/2)) - 1) << (N/2);

        int rowDiff = 0, colDiff = 0, rowOnes = 0, colOnes = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            if(__builtin_popcount(rows[0] ^ rows[i]) % 2 || 
               __builtin_popcount(cols[0] ^ cols[i]) % 2) 
                return -1;

            rowOnes += rows[0] == rows[i];
            colOnes += cols[0] == cols[i];
            
            rowDiff += (i % 2 == 0) ? (rows[i] & 1) : !(rows[i] & 1);
            colDiff += (i % 2 == 0) ? (cols[i] & 1) : !(cols[i] & 1);
        }

        if(abs(N - 2 * rowOnes) > 1 || abs(N - 2 * colOnes) > 1)
            return -1;

        int rowMoves = min(N-rowDiff, rowDiff);
        int colMoves = min(N-colDiff, colDiff);

        return (rowMoves + colMoves) / 2;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N^2) - The solution involves iterating over the board multiple times to build bitmasks and check for valid configurations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) - for the rows and columns vectors used to store bitmasks.

This solution ensures we efficiently check and minimize swaps necessary to transform the given board into a valid chessboard pattern. If the transformation isn't feasible, the algorithm correctly returns -1.
