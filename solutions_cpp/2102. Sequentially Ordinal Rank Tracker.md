[Leetcode 2102. Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2102)
### Problem Statement

You need to design a data structure called `SORTracker` that supports the following operations:
1. `void add(string name, int score)`: Add a name with a given score to the data structure.
2. `string get()`: Retrieve the name with the k-th highest score (with ties being broken by the name lexicographically) and change the internal state so that a new call to get() would return the next name in the sorted order according to k-th highest score.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the `add` function add unique name and score pairs, or can we have multiple identical pairs?
2. How is the state maintained between successive `get` operations? Should it always return the next k-th highest even if `add` is called repeatedly between `get` calls?
3. What is the expected range for the number of add operations and the range for scores?

### Strategy

We need a balance between insertion and retrieval operations, ensuring that we can efficiently adjust the internal state of the tracker. 

Our strategy will involve:
- Using a balanced binary search tree (BST) to maintain the sorting of added pairs of names and scores.
- A priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the k-th largest element efficiently.

### Code

Here's how we can implement this using a combination of `set` for automatic sorting and a vector to manage the sequential `get` operation:

```cpp
#include <set>
#include <string>
#include <queue>

class SORTracker {
private:
    std::set<std::pair<int, std::string>> items; // Naturally ordered (score first, then name)
    std::queue<std::pair<int, std::string>> tracker; // For sequential get operations
    int getOperations;

public:
    SORTracker() : getOperations(0) {}

    void add(std::string name, int score) {
        // We insert with (-score) to mimic max-heap behavior using a set
        items.insert({-score, name});
    }

    std::string get() {
        // If this is the first get operation, we need to populate the tracker
        if (getOperations == 0) {
            for (const auto& item : items) {
                tracker.push(item);
            }
        }

        // Get the k-th element (corresponding to the `getOperations + 1`)
        auto topItem = tracker.front();
        tracker.pop();
        getOperations++;
        return topItem.second;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    SORTracker tracker;
    tracker.add("bradford", 2);
    tracker.add("branford", 3);
    cout << tracker.get() << endl; // Output: "branford"
    tracker.add("alps", 2);
    cout << tracker.get() << endl; // Output: "bradford"
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy Breakdown

1. **`add` operation:** 
   - Inserts into a set which orders the elements by score in descending order (hence, using negative scores) and then by name.

2. **`get` operation:**
   - If itâ€™s the first `get`, populate a queue from the set maintaining the order.
   - Sequentially pop the front of the queue to get the k-th largest element according to the order established.

### Time Complexity

- **Inserting (add)**: Each insertion into the set is O(log n) due to the balanced nature of the set.
- **Retrieving (get)**: Assuming an incremental approach, each `get` operation is effectively O(1) after initial queue preparation as long as elements are continuously fetched sequentially.

This ensures that both operations are efficient and suitable for larger datasets within reasonable constraints.
