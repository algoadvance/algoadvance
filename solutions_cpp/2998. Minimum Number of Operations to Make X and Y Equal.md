[Leetcode 2998. Minimum Number of Operations to Make X and Y Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2998)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `X` and `Y`. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make `X` equal to `Y`. 

In one operation, you can:
1. Increment `X` by 1.
2. Decrement `Y` by 1.
3. Double `X`.
4. Halve `Y` (If `Y` is even).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `X` and `Y` always positive integers?**
   - Yes, you can assume `X` and `Y` are always positive integers.
   
2. **Can `X` become greater than `Y` or vice versa in the process?**
   - Yes, the operations do not restrict `X` from becoming greater than `Y` or vice versa.

3. **Is there any constraint on the maximum value of `X` and `Y`?**
   - For the purpose of the problem, assume that the values can fit within standard integer limits (typically up to \(2^{31} - 1\)).

### Strategy

Since the problem involves multiple operations and requires finding the minimal number of them, a breadth-first search (BFS) approach would be suitable. This allows exploring the shortest path (in terms of operations) from `X` to `Y`.

### Steps

1. **Use a queue to implement BFS** where each element in the queue is a pair `(current_value, steps_taken)`.
2. **Initialize the queue** with `(X, 0)`, indicating the starting value and the initial number of steps taken.
3. **Track visited nodes** to avoid processing the same state multiple times.
4. **For each state `(current_value, steps_taken)`**, explore all possible operations:
    - Increment `current_value` by 1.
    - Double `current_value`.
    - Decrement from `current_value`.
    - Halve the other value, if itâ€™s even.
5. **Check if we reach `Y`** in each step, and return the number of steps if we do.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int minOperations(int X, int Y) {
    if (X == Y) return 0;
    
    queue<pair<int, int>> q; // Pair of (current_value, steps_taken)
    unordered_set<int> visited; // Set to track visited nodes
    
    q.push({X, 0});
    visited.insert(X);
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current_value, steps_taken] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        // Generate all possible next steps
        int next_steps[] = {current_value + 1, current_value - 1, current_value * 2};
        
        for (int next : next_steps) {
            if (next == Y) {
                return steps_taken + 1;
            }
            
            // If we haven't visited this state and it's positive
            if (next > 0 && visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                q.push({next, steps_taken + 1});
                visited.insert(next);
            }
        }
        
        // If current_value can be halved and it's positive
        if (current_value % 2 == 0) {
            int halved = current_value / 2;
            if (halved == Y) {
                return steps_taken + 1;
            }
            if (visited.find(halved) == visited.end()) {
                q.push({halved, steps_taken + 1});
                visited.insert(halved);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // Return -1 if no solution found, shouldn't happen with given constraints
}

int main() {
    int X = 5;
    int Y = 8;
    cout << "Minimum number of operations: " << minOperations(X, Y) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is difficult to pin down exactly due to the nature of BFS and the number of operations. However, it will largely be proportional to the number of states we explore. In the worst case, it would visit each state once before finding the solution. Therefore, **time complexity can be considered `O(N)` for large `N`, where `N` is the range we need to explore to find the shortest path between `X` and `Y`.**
