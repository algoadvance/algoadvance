[Leetcode 3161. Block Placement Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3161)
### Problem Statement

You are given the dimensions of a 2D grid and a series of queries. Each query consists of placing a square block of 1s in the grid. The block can be of any size (within the bounds of the grid) and can be placed anywhere, but you should handle overlap correctly. Your task is to return the state of the grid after all queries have been processed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Dimensions:** What are the dimensions of the grid (rows x columns)?
2. **Queries Format:** How are the queries formatted? Do they contain the top-left corner coordinates and the dimensions of the block?
3. **Number of Queries:** How many queries are we processing?
4. **Initial State:** What is the initial state of the grid (all zeros)?
5. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the grid and the number of queries?

Let's assume a typical format for the queries based on the problem statement:

- The grid dimensions will be given as `n` (rows) and `m` (columns).
- Each query will be given as four integers `x1, y1, x2, y2` corresponding to the top-left and bottom-right corners of the subgrid that should be turned into 1s.
- The grid initially contains only `0`s.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> processQueries(int n, int m, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    // Create the initial grid filled with 0s
    vector<vector<int>> grid(n, vector<int>(m, 0));

    // Iterate over each query
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int x1 = query[0], y1 = query[1], x2 = query[2], y2 = query[3];

        // Update the grid for the current query
        for (int i = x1; i <= x2; ++i) {
            for (int j = y1; j <= y2; ++j) {
                grid[i][j] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return grid;
}

int main() {
    int n = 4; // number of rows in the grid
    int m = 5; // number of columns in the grid
    vector<vector<int>> queries = \{\{1, 1, 2, 3}, {0, 0, 1, 1}, {3, 2, 3, 4}};
    
    vector<vector<int>> result = processQueries(n, m, queries);
    
    for (const auto& row : result) {
        for (int val : row) {
            cout << val << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Grid Initialization:** Initialize a 2D vector of dimensions `n x m` filled with zeros.
2. **Query Processing:** For each query, iterate through the specified subgrid and set all elements to 1.
3. **Output:** Return the final state of the grid after processing all queries.

### Time Complexity

- **Grid Initialization:** \(O(n \times m)\)
- **Query Processing:** For each query, if the subgrid defined by `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` has `a` rows and `b` columns, the cost is \(O(a \times b)\).

If there are `q` queries, and the total number of grid updates across all queries sums to \(K\):
- **Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(K)\)
- **Worst Case:** \(O(q \times n \times m)\) if every query affects the entire grid.

This solution balances simplicity and efficiency for typical inputs, but note that performance could degrade if queries cover large grid regions repetitively.
