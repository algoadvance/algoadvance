### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2414: "Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring"

Given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters, we need to find the length of the longest alphabetical continuous substring. An alphabetical continuous substring is one in which the letters form a continuous sequence without any interruptions in alphabetical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - The problem can typically handle strings up to length 100,000.
2. **Character Set**: Are the characters in the string limited to lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the string consists only of lowercase English letters.
3. **Expected Result**: What should be returned if the string is empty?
   - If the string is empty, the function should return 0 since there would be no substrings.
4. **Performance**: Is there a specific time complexity we should aim for?
   - An efficient solution should ideally work in linear time, O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.

### Strategy

The plan is to iterate through the string once (O(n) complexity) and keep track of the current length of the alphabetical continuous substring. If at any point the alphabetical order is broken, we compare the current length with the maximum length found so far and reset the current length counter. By the end of the iteration, we should have the length of the longest continuous alphabetical substring.

### Code

Here's the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int longestContinuousSubstring(const std::string& s) {
    if (s.empty()) return 0;

    int maxLength = 1;
    int currentLength = 1;

    for (size_t i = 1; i < s.length(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == s[i - 1] + 1) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }

    // Compare the length of the last continuous substring
    maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize `maxLength` and `currentLength` to 1. The `maxLength` will keep track of the longest alphabetical continuous substring encountered so far, and `currentLength` will keep track of the current continuous substring length.
2. Loop through the string from the second character to the end:
   - Check if the current character is exactly the next in the alphabetical sequence from the previous character (`s[i] == s[i - 1] + 1`).
   - If true, increment `currentLength`.
   - If false, update `maxLength` if `currentLength` is greater, and then reset `currentLength` to 1.
3. At the end of the loop, ensure to update `maxLength` one last time in case the longest substring is at the end of the string.
4. Return `maxLength`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the string only once. The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space proportional to the input size is used.
