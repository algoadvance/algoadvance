[Leetcode 2656. Maximum Sum With Exactly K Elements ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2656)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of exactly `k` elements from the array. 

You can choose elements more than once and place them into a list, `list1`, and the sum of the elements in `list1` should be as large as possible.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
If we add the largest element 4 twice (4 + 4), we get 8 which is the largest possible sum.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: 
If we add the largest element 3 three times (3 + 3 + 3), we get 9 which is the largest possible sum.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can elements be reused multiple times in the sum?
   - Yes, elements can be reused multiple times to form the list `list1`.

2. Are there any constraints on the values of `k` and the size of the array?
   - Assume standard input size constraints for competitive programming (e.g., array size up to 10^5).

3. Can `k` be larger than the size of the array?
   - Yes, `k` can be larger, and elements can be reused to match `k`.

## Strategy

1. The problem asks for the maximum sum of exactly `k` elements, where elements can be reused.
2. To maximize the sum, the most optimal approach is to choose the largest element in the array and multiply it by `k`.
3. Steps:
    - Find the maximum element in the array.
    - Multiply the largest element by `k` to get the final sum.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxSumWithKElements(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Find the maximum element in the array
    int maxElement = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    // Calculate the maximum sum with exactly k elements
    return maxElement * k;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k1 = 2;
    std::cout << maxSumWithKElements(nums1, k1) << std::endl; // Output: 8
    
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {1, 2, 3};
    int k2 = 3;
    std::cout << maxSumWithKElements(nums2, k2) << std::endl; // Output: 9
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the maximum element**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Multiplication operation**: O(1).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
