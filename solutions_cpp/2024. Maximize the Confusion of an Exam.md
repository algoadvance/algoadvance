[Leetcode 2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2024)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with maximizing the confusion of an exam. The problem is described as follows:

You have a string `answerKey` consisting of characters 'T' (true) and 'F' (false), which represents the answers to an exam. You are allowed to perform a certain number of changes `k` where you can change any 'T' to 'F' or any 'F' to 'T'. Your goal is to maximize the length of a contiguous substring consisting of only 'T's or only 'F's.

Given that:
- `answerKey` is a string containing only 'T' and 'F'.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of changes allowed.

Return the maximum length of a contiguous substring consisting of only 'T's or only 'F's after performing at most `k` changes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we allowed to change the string in place?**
   Yes, you can modify the string or use additional space if needed to arrive at the solution.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string `answerKey`?**
   According to typical problem constraints, the length of the input string can go up to `10^5`.

3. **Can `k` be larger than the length of the string?**
   Practically, `k` should be handled such that `k <= length of the string`. If `k` is larger, you can assume `k` is effectively as large as the string, so the answer would be the length of the string.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem efficiently using the sliding window (two-pointer) approach:

1. **Define Two Helper Functions**: 
   - One to calculate the maximum length by converting 'T' to 'F'.
   - One to calculate the maximum length by converting 'F' to 'T'.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Maintain a window with a maximum of `k` changes within it.
   - Expand the window by incrementing the end pointer.
   - If the count of conversions exceeds `k`, move the start pointer until the condition is satisfied.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxConsecutiveChar(const string &answerKey, char ch, int k) {
    int max_len = 0, start = 0, count = 0;
    for (int end = 0; end < answerKey.length(); ++end) {
        if (answerKey[end] != ch) ++count;
        while (count > k) {
            if (answerKey[start] != ch) --count;
            ++start;
        }
        max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1);
    }
    return max_len;
}

int maxConsecutiveAnswers(string answerKey, int k) {
    return max(maxConsecutiveChar(answerKey, 'T', k), maxConsecutiveChar(answerKey, 'F', k));
}

int main() {
    string answerKey = "TTFTTFTT";
    int k = 1;
    
    cout << "Maximum length of a contiguous substring: " << maxConsecutiveAnswers(answerKey, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the sliding window solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `answerKey` string. Each character is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it).

The space complexity is `O(1)`, as only a fixed amount of extra space is utilized regardless of the input size.
