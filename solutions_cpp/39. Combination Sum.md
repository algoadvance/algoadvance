[Leetcode 39. Combination Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l39)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The input parameters are:

- `candidates`: an array of integers with no duplicates.
- `target`: an integer.

Example:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[7],[2,2,3]]

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2], [2,3,3], [3,5]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the output list of combinations be sorted in any particular order?**
   - No, the problem statement specifies that the combinations can be returned in any order.

2. **Can the array `candidates` be modified?**
   - No, you should not modify the input array.

3. **Are negative numbers allowed in `candidates`?**
   - In typical implementations of this problem, negative numbers are not expected because we are summing up to a positive target.

4. **Is the input guaranteed to have at least one solution?**
   - No, there might be cases where no combination sums up to the target, and an empty list should be returned in such cases.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using backtracking. The idea is to build the combinations incrementally, starting with an empty combination.

1. Sort `candidates` - although this step isn't strictly necessary, it can help with pruning branches early.
2. Use a recursive function to explore each candidate:
   - Include the candidate in the current path.
   - Recur with the updated target reduced by the candidate's value.
   - If the updated target is exactly 0, we have found a valid combination and append it to the results.
   - If the updated target is less than 0, we discard the current path.
   - After exploring, backtrack by removing the candidate from the current path to try the next candidate.

Let's proceed to the implementation.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    void backtrack(std::vector<int>& candidates, int target, std::vector<int>& current, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& result, int start) {
        if (target == 0) {
            result.push_back(current);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.size(); ++i) {
            if (candidates[i] > target) continue;
            
            current.push_back(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(candidates, target - candidates[i], current, result, i);
            current.pop_back();
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> combinationSum(std::vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        std::vector<int> current;
        std::sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());
        backtrack(candidates, target, current, result, 0);
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is a bit tricky to analyze due to the nature of the backtracking approach, but let's consider some upper bounds:
- For each candidate, in the worst case, we try it multiple times (as many times as it can fit into the target).
- The average branching factor (rate at which recursion tree grows) is `O(N)` where `N` is the number of candidates.
- The depth of recursion is proportional to `target / min(candidates)`, where `min(candidates)` is the smallest value in the `candidates` array.

Thus, the time complexity can be approximated by `O(2^T * N)`, where `T` is the target and `N` is the number of candidates. This means the solution can handle small targets and smaller sets of candidates more efficiently.
