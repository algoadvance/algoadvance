[Leetcode 1855. Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1855)
## Problem Statement

This problem comes from LeetCode:

**1855. Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values**

You are given two non-increasing 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. A pair of indices `(i, j)` is valid if:

- `0 <= i < nums1.length`
- `0 <= j < nums2.length`
- `i <= j`
- `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`

The task is to find the maximum distance between a valid pair `(i, j)`, using the formula `j - i`.

Return the maximum distance between a pair of values. If no valid pair exists, return `0`.

### Example:

```cpp
Input: nums1 = [55,30,5], nums2 = [100,20,10,10,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The valid pairs are (0,2), (1,4), and (2,4). The maximum distance is 2 with pair (0,2).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - No, the problem constraints state that both arrays have at least one element.
   
2. **What are the possible sizes for the arrays?**
   - The problem constraints typically limit the size of arrays, but let's assume standard constraints to be within practical limits like `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 100000`.
   
3. **Are all elements of the arrays non-negative or can there be negative values?**
   - Typically, elements are non-negative but we will handle negative values if there are no explicit constraints against it.

4. **What are the time complexity constraints?**
   - We should aim for an O(n) or O(n log n) solution given typical competitive programming constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a two-pointer strategy:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**
   - Start with `i` initialized to 0 for `nums1` and `j` initialized to 0 for `nums2`.

2. **Iterate through Arrays:**
   - While both pointers are within bounds of their respective arrays, check if `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`.
   - If the condition is true and `(i, j)` is a valid pair, calculate the distance `j - i` and update the maximum distance if the current distance is greater.
   - If `nums1[i]` is less than or equal to `nums2[j]`, increment `j` to find a larger distance with the same `i`.
   - Otherwise, increment `i` to potentially find a new valid pair.

3. **Output the Maximum Distance:**
   - Return the maximum distance computed from the valid pairs.
   
This approach ensures we efficiently traverse both arrays in linear time.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int maxDist = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < nums1.size() && j < nums2.size()) {
            if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
                maxDist = max(maxDist, j - i);
                j++;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDist;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the longer array (`nums2` in this case). Each element of both arrays is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables.
