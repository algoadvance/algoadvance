[Leetcode 3120. Count the Number of Special Characters I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3120)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. Count the number of special characters in the string. Special characters are defined as characters that are not alphanumeric (i.e., they are neither letters nor numbers).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What characters are considered alphanumeric?
   - **A**: Alphanumeric characters include the uppercase letters 'A' to 'Z', lowercase letters 'a' to 'z', and the digits '0' to '9'.

2. **Q**: Should whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) be considered special characters?
   - **A**: Yes, whitespace should be considered special characters since they are not alphanumeric.

3. **Q**: Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - **A**: Yes, you can assume that the input string is non-empty.

4. **Q**: Should I handle potential corner cases, such as strings that contain only special characters or only alphanumeric characters?
   - **A**: Yes, handle all possible input scenarios including those where the string contains only special characters.

### Strategy

1. **Iteration**: Iterate over each character of the string `s`.
2. **Checking**: For each character, check if it is alphanumeric using the `isalnum` function from the C++ standard library.
3. **Counting**: If the character is not alphanumeric, increment a counter by 1.
4. **Result**: Return the counter as the result.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cctype>

int countSpecialCharacters(const std::string& s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (!isalnum(ch)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "Hello, World! 123"; // Example input
    std::cout << "Number of special characters: " << countSpecialCharacters(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

- **`isalnum` function**: This function checks if the character is alphanumeric. If `isalnum` returns `false`, then the character is a special character.
- **`for` loop**: Iterate through each character in the string.
- **`count` variable**: Tracks the number of special characters encountered.
- **`if (!isalnum(ch))`**: Increment the counter `count` if the character is not alphanumeric.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the algorithm involves a single pass through the string, performing a constant-time check for each character.
