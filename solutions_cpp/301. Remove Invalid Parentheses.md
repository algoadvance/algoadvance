[Leetcode 301. Remove Invalid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l301)
### Problem Statement

Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses in order to make the input string valid. Return all possible results.

**Note:**
1. The input string may contain characters other than `(` and `)`.
2. You may return the results in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "()())()"
Output: ["()()()", "(())()"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: "(a)())()"
Output: ["(a)()()", "(a())()"]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: ")("
Output: [""]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string be empty?
   - Yes, the input string can be empty, and in that case, the output should be an array containing an empty string.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - There's no explicit constraint provided, but we can assume it fits within reasonable limits for a typical problem of this nature (e.g., length â‰¤ 1000).

3. What characters beyond '(' and ')' should we expect in the input?
   - The input may contain lowercase letters and possibly some other valid characters which need to be preserved in their positions.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible states of the string by removing one parenthesis at a time until we find all valid strings. The steps are:

1. Create a queue to store the current state of strings and initialize it with the input string.
2. Use a set to keep track of visited strings to avoid processing the same string multiple times.
3. Perform BFS:
   - Dequeue a string and check if it's valid using a helper function.
   - If valid, add it to the result list.
   - If not valid, generate all possible states by removing each parenthesis one at a time, and enqueue these new states.
4. Continue this process until we find all valid strings of the minimum length (minimum number of deletions).

The helper function `isValid` will count the balance of parentheses to ensure the string is valid.

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

bool isValid(const string &s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '(') count++;
        else if (c == ')') count--;
        if (count < 0) return false; // More closing brackets
    }
    return count == 0;
}

vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
    vector<string> result;
    if (s.empty()) {
        result.push_back("");
        return result;
    }

    queue<string> q;
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    q.push(s);
    visited.insert(s);
    bool found = false;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        string cur = q.front();
        q.pop();

        if (isValid(cur)) {
            result.push_back(cur);
            found = true; // Once found at this level, only add valid strings of this length
        }

        if (found) continue;

        for (int i = 0; i < cur.length(); i++) {
            if (cur[i] != '(' && cur[i] != ')') continue;
            string next = cur.substr(0, i) + cur.substr(i + 1);
            if (visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                q.push(next);
                visited.insert(next);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "()())()";
    vector<string> result = removeInvalidParentheses(s);
    for (const string &res : result) {
        cout << res << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - In the worst case, we might have to remove every character from the string, leading to exploring all subsets which is O(2^n) in terms of different states.
   - Each string state generation and checking its validity incurs O(n) operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n * 2^n), where n is the length of the input string. This can be expensive for large strings, but it ensures we find all possible valid strings of minimum deletions.
