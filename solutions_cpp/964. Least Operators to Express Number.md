## Problem Statement

**964. Least Operators to Express Number**

Given an integer `x` and a target number `target`, you might need to express `target` as a formula containing the +, -, *, and / operators and integer constants. The formula should use the least number of operators possible.

You can only use the integer constants `x` and '1' (if necessary). You can't use floating-point numbers, so Division using '/' should yield integer results only.

Given these constraints, find the least number of operators needed to express the target using the provided constraints.

Function Signature:
```cpp
int leastOpsExpressTarget(int x, int target);
```

### Example 1:
```cpp
Input: x = 3, target = 19
Output: 5
Explanation: 3 * 3 + 3 * 3 + 3 / 3. There are 5 operators used.
```
### Example 2:
```cpp
Input: x = 5, target = 501
Output: 8
Explanation: 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 - 5 * 5 * 5 + 5 / 5. There are 8 operators used.
```
### Example 3:
```cpp
Input: x = 100, target = 100000000
Output: 3
Explanation: 100 * 100 * 100 * 100. There are 3 operators used.
```

### Constraints:
- `2 <= x <= 100`
- `1 <= target <= 2 * 10^8`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we use parentheses in the expression?
   - Yes, but they do not count as operators.
2. Should the output be the minimal number of operations possible?
   - Yes, the formula should use the least number of operators possible.

## Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - We can use recursion to break down the problem. The key insight is to express the target in terms of powers of `x`.
   - We can recursively attempt to either overshoot the target (using higher powers of `x`) or undershoot the target (using lower powers of `x`) to find the minimal operations.
   
2. **Memoization**:
   - To avoid repetitive calculations, store results of subproblems in a hash map (memoization).

3. **Dynamic Programming / Greedy Approach**:
   - Alternatively, a more sophisticated dynamic programming approach might optimize the minimal operations calculation further.
   
## Code

Here's the recursive solution with memoization:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<int, int> memo;

int dfs(int x, int target) {
    if (target < x) {
        return min(2 * target - 1, 2 * (x - target));
    }
    if (memo.count(target)) return memo[target];
    
    long long cur = x;
    int k = 0;
    while (cur < target) {
        cur *= x;
        ++k;
    }
    
    if (cur == target) return memo[target] = k;
    
    int res1 = INT_MAX, res2 = INT_MAX;
    if (cur - target < target) {
        res1 = dfs(x, cur - target) + k;
    }
    res2 = dfs(x, target - cur / x) + k - 1;
    
    return memo[target] = min(res1, res2 + 1);
}

int leastOpsExpressTarget(int x, int target) {
    memo.clear();
    return dfs(x, target);
}

int main() {
    cout << leastOpsExpressTarget(3, 19) << endl; // Output: 5
    cout << leastOpsExpressTarget(5, 501) << endl; // Output: 8
    cout << leastOpsExpressTarget(100, 100000000) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is not straightforward to analyze due to the recursion and memoization. For each sub-problem, the recursion dives deeper logarithmically relative to the target value by powers of `x`.
- In general, for any given target, the depth of recursion is roughly `O(log_x target)`.
- Memoization ensures that each state is computed only once.

Overall, the optimized recursion with memoization should handle target values up to the given constraint efficiently.
