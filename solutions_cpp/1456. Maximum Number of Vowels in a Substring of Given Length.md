[Leetcode 1456. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1456)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

Vowel letters in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. Can the input string contain uppercase letters, or is it limited to lowercase only?
3. What should be returned if `k` is greater than the length of the string?
4. Are there any constraints on the size of the input string `s`?

Let's assume:
1. Yes, the input string is non-empty.
2. The input string contains only lowercase letters.
3. If `k` is greater than the length of the string, return `0`.
4. The length of the input string is within a manageable range (e.g., up to 10^5 characters).

### Strategy

We will use a sliding window approach to solve this problem efficiently:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_vowels` to store the maximum number of vowels found in any substring and `current_vowels` to store the number of vowels in the current window of length `k`.
2. Traverse the first `k` characters of the string to initialize `current_vowels`.
3. Slide the window from left to right, updating the `current_vowels` count by subtracting the effect of the outgoing character (left end of the window) and adding the effect of the incoming character (right end of the window).
4. At each step, update `max_vowels` if `current_vowels` exceeds the previously recorded maximum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxVowels(string s, int k) {
        unordered_set<char> vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'};
        int max_vowels = 0;
        int current_vowels = 0;
        
        // Count vowels in the initial window of size k
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            if (vowels.find(s[i]) != vowels.end()) {
                current_vowels++;
            }
        }
        max_vowels = current_vowels;
        
        // Slide the window across the string
        for (int i = k; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (vowels.find(s[i - k]) != vowels.end()) {
                current_vowels--;
            }
            if (vowels.find(s[i]) != vowels.end()) {
                current_vowels++;
            }
            max_vowels = max(max_vowels, current_vowels);
        }
        
        return max_vowels;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "abciiidef";
    int k = 3;
    cout << "Maximum number of vowels: " << solution.maxVowels(s, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of the first window**: \(O(k)\)
- **Sliding the window across the string**: Each slide involves constant-time operations, and we slide it \(n - k\) times where \(n\) is the length of the string. So, this part is \(O(n)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(n)\)

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since the extra space required does not depend on the input size; we only use a fixed amount of extra space. The `unordered_set` for vowels is of fixed size (5 elements), and other variables are simple integers.

This solution is efficient and suitable for large input sizes.
