[Leetcode 2706. Buy Two Chocolates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2706)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array, `prices`, representing the prices of various chocolates in a store. You also have a certain amount of money in your wallet. You need to find out whether you can buy exactly two different chocolates such that the total cost does not exceed the amount of money you have. Return `true` if you can buy the chocolates and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the prices in the `prices` array? (e.g., 1 to 1000)
   - What is the maximum length of the `prices` array?
   - What is the range of the money you have?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if the `prices` array has fewer than 2 elements?
   - Are the prices always positive integers?

For the sake of this solution, let's assume:
- Prices are positive integers.
- The length of the `prices` array is between 0 and 10^4.
- The prices are between 1 and 10^5.
- The amount of money you have is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a two-pointer technique:

1. **Sort** the `prices` array.
2. **Use two pointers**: One at the start (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the sorted array.
3. **Sum Direction**: Check the sum of the `prices` at these pointers:
    - If the sum is less than or equal to the amount of money, return `true`.
    - If the sum is greater, move the `right` pointer to the left to reduce the sum.
    - If the sum is less, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
4. Continue this until the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer.

The idea is to find any two distinct elements whose sum is less than or equal to the given amount of money.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

bool canBuyTwoChocolates(std::vector<int>& prices, int money) {
    int n = prices.size();
    // Early return if there are less than 2 chocolates to buy
    if (n < 2) {
        return false;
    }

    // Sort the price array
    std::sort(prices.begin(), prices.end());

    // Two pointers technique
    int left = 0;
    int right = n - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        int sum = prices[left] + prices[right];
        if (sum <= money) {
            return true; // Found two chocolates within the budget
        } else if (sum > money) {
            --right; // Decrease sum by moving right pointer to the left
        } else {
            ++left; // Increase sum by moving left pointer to the right
        }
    }

    // If we exit the loop, it means we couldn't find such a pair
    return false;
}

// Example to test the function
int main() {
    std::vector<int> prices = {12, 7, 22, 10, 5};
    int money = 17;

    if (canBuyTwoChocolates(prices, money)) {
        std::cout << "Yes, can buy two chocolates" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "No, cannot buy two chocolates" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We sort the `prices` array to apply the two-pointer technique efficiently.
2. **Two Pointers Approach**:
   - Initialize `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end of the sorted array.
   - Check the sum of elements at these indices.
   - Adjust pointers based on the sum compared to the given amount of money.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The **Two-Pointer** traversal takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `prices` array. This is efficient for the given constraints.
