[Leetcode 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l406)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i]` = [h_i, k_i] represents the `i-th` person of height `h_i` with exactly `k_i` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to h_i.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j]` = [h_j, k_j] is the attributes of the `j-th` person in the queue (`queue[j]` is `people[i]` in the input).

### Example 1:
```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= people.length <= 2000
- 0 <= h_i <= 10^6
- 0 <= k_i < people.length
- It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be identical `[h, k]` pairs in the input?**
   - No, each `[h_i, k_i]` pair is unique as per the problem constraints.

2. **What should be returned if the input list is empty?**
   - The input list will always contain at least one element based on the constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting**:
   - First, we need to sort `people` by height in descending order. For people with the same height, we sort them by their `k` value in ascending order.
   - This helps because when inserting into the queue, if two people have the same height, the one with a smaller `k` value should be positioned first.

2. **Insertion**:
   - Iterate over the sorted `people` list and insert each person at the index equal to their `k` value in the result queue.
   - The insert operation respects the `k` value since inserting at an index shifts elements to the right.

### Detailed Steps
- Sort `people` using a custom comparator:
  - First by height in descending order.
  - Second by `k` in ascending order.

- Initialize an empty `result` list.
- Insert each person into the `result` list at the index equal to their `k` value.

### Example Walkthrough
Input: [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]

- Sorted: [[7,0],[7,1],[6,1],[5,0],[5,2],[4,4]]
- Step-by-step insertions:
  - Insert [7,0] at index 0 -> [[7,0]]
  - Insert [7,1] at index 1 -> [[7,0],[7,1]]
  - Insert [6,1] at index 1 -> [[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]]
  - Insert [5,0] at index 0 -> [[5,0],[7,0],[6,1],[7,1]]
  - Insert [5,2] at index 2 -> [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[7,1]]
  - Insert [4,4] at index 4 -> [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> reconstructQueue(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& people) {
        // Sorting the people array
        std::sort(people.begin(), people.end(),
                  [](const std::vector<int>& a, const std::vector<int>& b) {
                      return a[0] > b[0] || (a[0] == b[0] && a[1] < b[1]);
                  });

        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        // Inserting each person into the result based on their k value
        for (const auto& person : people) {
            result.insert(result.begin() + person[1], person);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the `people` array.
- **Insertion**: \(O(N^2)\) in the worst case due to the need for shifting elements.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N^2)\), which is efficient enough for the given constraint \(1 <= people.length <= 2000\).
