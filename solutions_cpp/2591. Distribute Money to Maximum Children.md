[Leetcode 2591. Distribute Money to Maximum Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2591)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `money` representing the total amount of money you have, and an integer `children` representing the number of children to distribute the money to. You need to distribute all the money according to the following rules:

1. Each child must receive at least 1 dollar.
2. Each child can receive at most 8 dollars.

Your goal is to maximize the number of children who receive exactly 8 dollars.

Return the maximum number of children who can receive exactly 8 dollars.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed, let's clarify a few points to ensure the problem is well-understood:
- What should be returned if the money is less than the number of children?
  - If the total money is less than the number of children, it is impossible to give at least 1 dollar to each child. The return value in this case should be 0.
  
- What happens if the distribution is not possible?
  - If it's not possible to distribute the money such that all conditions are met, return 0.

## Strategy
1. Check if the `money` is less than `children`. If yes, return 0.
2. Calculate the maximum number of children that can be given exactly 8 dollars by dividing `money` by 8 and then taking the minimum with `children` (`min(money / 8, children)`).
3. Distribute money giving the maximum number of children 8 dollars each, then distribute the remaining money to ensure that every child gets at least 1 dollar.
4. Adjust the counts if any child receiving 8 dollars needs to be lowered to accommodate the remaining money and conditions.

## Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int distMoney(int money, int children) {
        // Check if not enough money to give each child 1 dollar
        if (money < children) return 0;

        // Calculate initial number of children we can give exactly 8 dollars
        int maxChildrenWithEightDollars = min(money / 8, children);
        
        // Calculate remaining money after giving 8 dollars to maxChildrenWithEightDollars children
        int remainingMoney = money - (8 * maxChildrenWithEightDollars);
        int remainingChildren = children - maxChildrenWithEightDollars;

        // Adjust the counts if we have more children than remaining money
        while (remainingMoney < remainingChildren && maxChildrenWithEightDollars > 0) {
            // We need to adjust by reducing the number of children getting exactly 8 dollars
            maxChildrenWithEightDollars--;
            remainingMoney += 8;
            remainingChildren++;
        }

        // If there is still not enough remaining money for the remaining children, return 0
        if (remainingMoney < remainingChildren) return 0;

        return maxChildrenWithEightDollars;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\). The operations performed are simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks, which run in constant time.
