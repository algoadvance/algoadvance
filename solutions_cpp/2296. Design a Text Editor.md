[Leetcode 2296. Design a Text Editor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2296)
### Problem Statement

Design a text editor with the following operations:

1. `void addText(string text)`: Appends `text` to the text editor.
2. `int deleteText(int k)`: Deletes the last `k` characters from the text editor and returns the number of characters actually deleted.
3. `string cursorLeft(int k)`: Moves the cursor to the left by `k` characters and returns the last 10 characters to the left of the cursor after the move.
4. `string cursorRight(int k)`: Moves the cursor to the right by `k` characters and returns the last 10 characters to the left of the cursor after the move.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is there a maximum length for the text that can be appended to the editor?
2. Should the text editor handle only ASCII characters, or do we need to consider Unicode characters?
3. How should cases be handled where `deleteText` attempts to delete more characters than present?
4. What should be the initial state of the text editor?
5. How should the text editor handle edge cases like moving the cursor beyond the start or end of the text?

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

class TextEditor {
public:
    TextEditor() {
        cursorPos = 0;
    }

    void addText(string text) {
        for (char ch : text) {
            content.insert(content.begin() + cursorPos, ch);
            cursorPos++;
        }
    }

    int deleteText(int k) {
        int charsDeleted = 0;
        while (k > 0 && cursorPos > 0) {
            content.erase(content.begin() + cursorPos - 1);
            cursorPos--;
            k--;
            charsDeleted++;
        }
        return charsDeleted;
    }

    string cursorLeft(int k) {
        cursorPos = max(0, cursorPos - k);
        return getLast10Chars();
    }

    string cursorRight(int k) {
        cursorPos = min((int)content.size(), cursorPos + k);
        return getLast10Chars();
    }

private:
    deque<char> content;
    int cursorPos;
    
    string getLast10Chars() {
        int start = max( 0, cursorPos - 10);
        string result;
        for (int i = start; i < cursorPos; ++i) {
            result += content[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure**:
   - We'll use a `deque<char>` to store the text because it allows efficient insertions and deletions from both ends.
   
2. **Operations**:
   - `addText`: Insert characters at `cursorPos` and increment `cursorPos`.
   - `deleteText`: Delete up to `k` characters before the `cursorPos`.
   - `cursorLeft`: Move the cursor left by `k` positions or to the start and return the last 10 characters before the cursor.
   - `cursorRight`: Move the cursor right by `k` positions or to the end and return the last 10 characters before the cursor.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - `getLast10Chars()`: A helper function to return the last 10 characters or fewer before the current cursor position.

### Time Complexity

- `addText`: O(n) where `n` is the length of the text to be added. This is due to the potential shift operations needed in the `deque`.
- `deleteText`: O(k) for deleting k characters.
- `cursorLeft` and `cursorRight`: O(1) for moving the cursor, but O(10) which is equivalent to O(1) for extracting the last 10 characters.

### Conclusion

This approach should be efficient for most typical usage patterns of a text editor, leveraging the deque for efficient insertions and deletions at any position. The helper function ensures we return the correct substring for cursor movements.
