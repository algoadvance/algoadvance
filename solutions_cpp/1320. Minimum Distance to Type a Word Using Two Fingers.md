[Leetcode 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1320)
## Problem Statement

You are given a function signature `int minimumDistance(string word)` which represents typing a string `word` with two fingers on a standard QWERTY keyboard. Your objective is to return the minimum distance required to type the word using both fingers optimally.

The keyboard layout is designed as follows:

```
[ 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' ]
[ 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L' ]
[ 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R' ]
[ 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X' ]
[ 'Y', 'Z', '_', '_', '_', '_' ]
```

The distance between any two keys `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is defined as the Manhattan distance, i.e., `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - How long can the input string `word` be?
        - Up to 300 characters.

2. **Characters in String:**
    - Will the string only consist of upper-case English letters?
        - Yes, only 'A' to 'Z'.

3. **Initial Finger Positions:**
    - Do we need to consider the initial positions of the two fingers on the keyboard?
        - No, the initial positions can be arbitrary but usually assumed at the first position of the string (i.e., both fingertips initially at the same place).

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming

1. **State Representation:**
    - Use a 3D DP array `dp[i][f1][f2]` where:
        - `i` is the index of the current character in `word`.
        - `f1` is the position of the first finger (encoded as a single integer).
        - `f2` is the position of the second finger (also encoded as a single integer).

2. **Transition:**
    - For each character at index `i`, decide which finger to move to minimize the total distance:
        - Either move the first finger from `f1` to the current character's position.
        - Or move the second finger from `f2` to the current character's position.

3. **Encoding Position:**
    - Each key can be identified by its `(row, column)` pair. Encode each position in the form `pos = 6*row + col` where `0 <= row < 5` and `0 <= col < 6`.

4. **Initialization:**
    - Start with both fingers initialized in the same position.

5. **Base Case:**
    - Start with no distance for the initial positions: `dp[0][start][start] = 0`.

6. **Final Result:**
    - The result will be the minimum value of `dp[length of word]` for any valid positions of both fingers.

### Time Complexity

- O(n * p^2), where `n` is the length of the word and `p` is the number of positions (maximum 26).

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDistance(string word) {
        int n = word.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n+1, vector<vector<int>>(27, vector<int>(27, INT_MAX)));
        dp[0][26][26] = 0; // Both fingers start at position 26 (which is an imaginary pos out of matrix)

        // Function to calculate the Manhattan distance between two positions
        auto dist = [](int a, int b) {
            if (a == 26 || b == 26) return 0;
            int ax = a / 6, ay = a % 6;
            int bx = b / 6, by = b % 6;
            return abs(ax - bx) + abs(ay - by);
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int currPos = word[i] - 'A';
            for (int f1 = 0; f1 <= 26; ++f1) {
                for (int f2 = 0; f2 <= 26; ++f2) {
                    if (dp[i][f1][f2] == INT_MAX) continue;
                    // Move first finger:
                    dp[i+1][currPos][f2] = min(dp[i+1][currPos][f2], 
                                               dp[i][f1][f2] + dist(f1, currPos));
                    // Move second finger:
                    dp[i+1][f1][currPos] = min(dp[i+1][f1][currPos], 
                                               dp[i][f1][f2] + dist(f2, currPos));
                }
            }
        }

        int result = INT_MAX;
        for (int f1 = 0; f1 <= 26; ++f1) {
            for (int f2 = 0; f2 <= 26; ++f2) {
                result = min(result, dp[n][f1][f2]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.minimumDistance("CAKE") << endl;  // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

This solution initializes the DP table and iterates through possible states, updating the minimum distances dynamically. It returns the minimum distance required to type the entire word.
