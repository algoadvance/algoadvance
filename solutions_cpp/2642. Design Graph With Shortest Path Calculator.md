[Leetcode 2642. Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2642)
### Problem Statement:

Design a graph data structure that supports adding edges and calculating the shortest path between any two given vertices.

### Main Features:
1. **addEdge(u, v, w)**: Adds a directed edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v` with a weight `w`.
2. **shortestPath(start, end)**: Calculates the shortest path from vertex `start` to vertex `end`. If there is no path, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Directed or Undirected**: Are the edges directed or undirected?
   - Assumption: The edges are directed as commonly seen in such problems.
2. **Negative Weights**: Can the weights be negative?
   - Assumption: For simplicity, weights are non-negative. If negative weights are allowed, we might need to use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to handle negative weight cycles.
3. **Graph Scale**: How large can the graph be in terms of vertices (V) and edges (E)?
   - Assumption: The graph can be reasonably large, so the solution should handle V up to 10^4 and E up to 10^5 efficiently.

### Strategy:

We will use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path, which is efficient for graphs with non-negative weights. Dijkstra’s algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the shortest known distance to each vertex.

1. **Data Structures**:
   - An adjacency list to store the graph.
   - A map to store the edges and their weights.
   - A priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently get the next vertex with the smallest distance.

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `addEdge(u, v, w)`: Adds an edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v` with weight `w` to the adjacency list.
   - `shortestPath(start, end)`: Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from `start` to `end`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Graph {
private:
    unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> adjList; // adjacency list

public:
    // Adds a directed edge from u to v with weight w
    void addEdge(int u, int v, int w) {
        adjList[u].emplace_back(v, w);
    }

    // Computes the shortest path from start to end
    int shortestPath(int start, int end) {
        // Min-Heap to store (distance, vertex)
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> minHeap;
        unordered_map<int, int> distances; // stores shortest distances

        // Initialize distances with maximum value
        for (const auto& node : adjList) {
            distances[node.first] = INT_MAX;
        }

        // Start from the start node
        minHeap.emplace(0, start);
        distances[start] = 0;

        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            int currentDistance = minHeap.top().first;
            int currentNode = minHeap.top().second;
            minHeap.pop();

            if (currentNode == end) {
                return currentDistance;
            }

            for (const auto& neighbor : adjList[currentNode]) {
                int nextNode = neighbor.first;
                int edgeWeight = neighbor.second;
                int newDistance = currentDistance + edgeWeight;

                // Update shortest distance if a shorter path is found
                if (newDistance < distances[nextNode]) {
                    distances[nextNode] = newDistance;
                    minHeap.emplace(newDistance, nextNode);
                }
            }
        }

        // If the end node is unreached
        return distances[end] == INT_MAX ? -1 : distances[end];
    }
};

int main() {
    Graph g;
    g.addEdge(0, 1, 4);
    g.addEdge(0, 2, 2);
    g.addEdge(1, 2, 3);
    g.addEdge(1, 3, 2);
    g.addEdge(2, 3, 1);
  
    cout << g.shortestPath(0, 3) << endl; // Output: 3

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **addEdge(u, v, w)**: O(1)
- **shortestPath(start, end)**:
  - Initialization of distances: O(V)
  - Main loop (each node and edge processing): O((V + E) log V)
  
Where **V** is the number of vertices and **E** is the number of edges.

### Summary:
This design leverages Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient shortest path calculation in weighted directed graphs, providing both edge addition and shortest path querying functionalities. Adjustments may be necessary for handling specific requirements such as negative weights.
