[Leetcode 3013. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3013)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You want to split the array into some number of non-empty subarrays. For the cost of a subarray, we define it to be equal to the number of distinct elements in the subarray plus `k`.

Return the minimum total cost to split the array into subarrays.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3,3], k = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: We can split nums into the [1, 2, 1], [2, 3], and [3] subarrays. The cost is calculated as follows:
- The cost of [1, 2, 1] is 3 + 2 = 5.
- The cost of [2, 3] is 2 + 2 = 4.
- The cost of [3] is 1 + 2 = 3. 
The total minimum cost is 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range for the length `n` of the input array?
2. **Number Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?
3. **Subarray Requirements**: Is there any restriction on the minimum or maximum size of the subarrays?
4. **Additional Constraints**: Are there any other constraints on the input values that should be considered?

## Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP). We can use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to split the array `nums[0...i]`. Here's the plan:

1. **Initialize a `dp` array** where `dp[i]` will store the minimum cost to split `nums[0...i]`.
2. **Use a nested loop** to iterate over possible subarrays from `0` to `i` to determine optimal splits.
3. **Track distinct elements** in the current subarray using a map or set.
4. **Update the DP array** based on the calculated costs of forming the subarray and adding the previous costs.

The resultant DP array at the position `n - 1` will give the minimum cost needed to split the entire array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minCost(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);  // dp[i] will store the minimum cost to split nums[0:i-1]
    dp[0] = 0;  // Base case: cost to split an empty array is 0
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;  // to count the frequency of elements in the current subarray
        int distinctCount = 0;  // to count distinct elements in the current subarray
        for (int j = i; j > 0; --j) {
            if (freq[nums[j - 1]] == 0) distinctCount++;  // new distinct element
            freq[nums[j - 1]]++;
            // The cost of current subarray [j-1:i-1] will be 'distinctCount + k'
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + distinctCount + k);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3};
    int k = 2;
    cout << minCost(nums, k) << endl;  // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Inner loop operation**: Traverses the subarray to calculate distinct elements, which involves checking up to `n` elements, resulting in an `O(n^2)` complexity.
- **Nested loop**: Experiencing an iterative combination results in `O(n^2)` complex operation within the nested loop.

Therefore, **total time complexity** of our solution is `O(n^2)` and space complexity is `O(n)` for the DP array. This should be efficient given the typical constraints in coding interview problems.
