[Leetcode 481. Magical String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l481)
### Problem Statement

A magical string `S` consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

- The string is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string itself.

The first few elements of the magical string `S` is str = "1221121221221121122......" 

If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in `S`, it will be:
1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 .....

and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in the groups are:
1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 .....

You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the same as `S`. 

Given an integer `n`, return the number of `1`s in the first `n` number of the magical string `S`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be zero or negative?**
   - No, according to the problem, `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
2. **Is there an upper limit on `n`?**
   - There is no specific upper limit mentioned, but the solution should handle reasonably large values efficiently.

### Strategy
1. **Generate the Magical String:** Generate at least `n` characters of the magical string `S` dynamically.
2. **Count '1's in the First `n` Characters:** Once the string is generated up to length `n`, count the number of '1's in the first `n` characters.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int magicalString(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n <= 3) return 1;
    
    std::vector<int> magical = {1, 2, 2};
    int count_of_ones = 1; // initially, there is one '1' in "122"
    int idx = 2; // start from index 2, considering given initial string "122"
    int num_to_add = 1;
    
    while (magical.size() < n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < magical[idx]; ++i) {
            magical.push_back(num_to_add);
            if (num_to_add == 1 && magical.size() <= n) {
                count_of_ones++;
            }
        }
        num_to_add = (num_to_add == 1) ? 2 : 1;
        idx++;
    }

    return count_of_ones;
}

int main() {
    int n = 6; // example input
    std::cout << "Number of '1's in the first " << n << " characters of the magical string: " << magicalString(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` because we iterate through the length of the string only once while generating it.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to storing the generated magical string in a vector for up to `n` characters. 

This strategy ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle reasonably large values of `n` effectively.
