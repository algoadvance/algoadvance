[Leetcode 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1011)
## Problem Statement
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `D` days.

The `i-th` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `D` days.

**Example:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), etc. is not allowed.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the ship's capacity change from day to day?
    - No, the ship's capacity is fixed for the entire duration of the shipping.
2. Are there any constraints on the weights, like negative values?
    - No, weights are all positive integers.
3. Do the packages need to be shipped in the order given in the array?
    - Yes, packages must be shipped in the order given by `weights`.

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:** 
   - Use binary search to find the minimum weight capacity required to ship the packages within `D` days.
   - The lower bound of the ship's capacity will be the maximum weight in the weights array because no day can exceed carrying the maximum weight of the single heaviest package.
   - The upper bound of the ship's capacity will be the sum of all weights, which would be the capacity needed to ship all packages in one day.

2. **Feasibility Function:**
   - Implement a function to check if a given ship capacity can ship all packages within `D` days.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canShipWithCapacity(vector<int>& weights, int D, int capacity) {
        int days_needed = 1, current_load = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (current_load + weight > capacity) {
                days_needed++;
                current_load = 0;
            }
            current_load += weight;
        }
        return days_needed <= D;
    }
    
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int D) {
        int left = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        int right = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canShipWithCapacity(weights, D, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search over Optimal Capacity:** `O(log(Sum(weights) - Max(weights)))`
- **Feasibility Check per Binary Search Step:** `O(weights.size())`
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- **O(weights.size() * log(Sum(weights) - Max(weights)))**

This should efficiently handle the constraints typically expected in such problems.
