[Leetcode 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l341)
### Problem Statement
You are given a nested list of integers. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the `NestedIterator` class:

- `NestedIterator(vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList)` initializes the iterator with the nested list `nestedList`.
- `int next()` returns the next integer in the nested list.
- `bool hasNext()` returns `true` if there are still some integers in the nested list and `false` otherwise.

Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:

```plaintext
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []
while iterator.hasNext()
    append iterator.next() to the end of res
return res
```
The input `nestedList` is a list of `NestedInteger` objects.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the nested list be empty?**
   - Yes, the nested list can be empty.

2. **Are the integers positive or can they include negative numbers and zero as well?**
   - They can include negative numbers and zero as well.

3. **What should be returned if the input list is empty?**
   - If the input list is empty, `hasNext()` should return `false` immediately and `next()` should not be called.

4. **Will `next()` be called only if `hasNext()` returns `true`?**
   - Yes, it can be assumed that `next()` will be called only if `hasNext()` returns `true`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use a stack to keep track of the nested lists and their current indices.

1. **Initialize the stack** with the given `nestedList`.
2. **Flatten the list** as you traverse it using the `hasNext` and `next` methods.
3. **Use a helper function** to handle the flattening of nested structures recursively.

### Code

Below is the C++ implementation of the `NestedIterator` class:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

// This is the interface that allows for creating nested lists.
class NestedInteger {
public:
    // Return true if this NestedInteger holds a single integer, rather than a nested list.
    bool isInteger() const;
    
    // Return the single integer that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a single integer.
    // The result is undefined if this NestedInteger holds a nested list.
    int getInteger() const;
    
    // Return the nested list that this NestedInteger holds, if it holds a nested list.
    // The result is undefined if this NestedInteger holds a single integer.
    const vector<NestedInteger> &getList() const;
};

class NestedIterator {
public:
    NestedIterator(vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList) {
        flattenList(nestedList);
    }
    
    int next() {
        int value = flattenedList[idx];
        ++idx;
        return value;
    }
    
    bool hasNext() {
        return idx < flattenedList.size();
    }
    
private:
    vector<int> flattenedList;
    size_t idx = 0;
    
    void flattenList(const vector<NestedInteger> &nestedList) {
        for (const auto& ni : nestedList) {
            if (ni.isInteger()) {
                flattenedList.push_back(ni.getInteger());
            } else {
                flattenList(ni.getList());
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Constructor (`NestedIterator`):** O(n), where n is the total number of integers in the nested list, because we traverse the entire list to flatten it initially.
- **`next()` and `hasNext()`:** Both are O(1), as we are just reading from a pre-flattened list and maintaining an index.

This approach ensures that the list is traversed once and all subsequent operations are efficient.
