[Leetcode 2834. Find the Minimum Possible Sum of a Beautiful Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2834)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to create an array of size `n` where the array is "beautiful". An array `arr` is considered beautiful if the sum of the sum of every pair of adjacent elements in the array is minimized. Your goal is to find the minimum possible sum of this beautiful array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a "beautiful" array?**
   - A beautiful array is an array where the sum of the sums of every pair of adjacent elements is minimized.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values the elements of the array can take?**
   - This is not mentioned in the problem statement. Assuming we can use any integers.

3. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Let's assume typical leetcode constraints, for example, `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

### Strategy

To minimize the sum of adjacent pairs, you want to keep your numbers as close as possible. Consider the following approach:
1. If `n` is 1, the minimum possible sum is 0 because there are no pairs.
2. For `n > 1`, a sequence of numbers starting from 1 in arithmetic progression with a difference of 1 (i.e., [1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]) minimizes the sum of adjacent pair sums.
   - This is because the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]` minimizes the difference between any two adjacent elements, thereby minimizing their sum.
   
### Implementing the Strategy

For an array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`:
- The pairs are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), ..., (n-1, n).
- The sum of these pairs is `(1+2) + (2+3) + (3+4) + ... + (n-1+n)`.

To compute this sum:
- Notice that every element from 2 to n appears twice except for 1 and n which appear once.
- The total sum can be computed as `2*(sum of [2, n-1]) + (1 + n)`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> constructBeautifulArray(int n) {
        std::vector<int> beautifulArray;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            beautifulArray.push_back(i);
        }
        return beautifulArray;
    }

    long long minimumPossibleSum(int n) {
        // Construct the beautiful array
        std::vector<int> arr = constructBeautifulArray(n);
        long long sum = 0;
        
        // Compute the sum of sums of adjacent pairs
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            sum += arr[i] + arr[i + 1];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 5; // Example input
    std::cout << "Minimum possible sum: " << sol.minimumPossibleSum(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **constructBeautifulArray Function**:
    - Constructs an array of size `n` with values `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **minimumPossibleSum Function**:
    - Uses the array constructed by `constructBeautifulArray` and then calculates the sum of the sums of adjacent pairs.
    
3. **Main Function**:
    - Demonstrates the usage with an example input.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the array takes `O(n)`.
- Calculating the sum of adjacent pairs also takes `O(n)`.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient for `n` up to `10^5`.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage of the array.
