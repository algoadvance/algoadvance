[Leetcode 1556. Thousand Separator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1556)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, add a dot (".") as the thousands separator and return it in string format.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 987
Output: "987"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1234
Output: "1.234"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 123456789
Output: "123.456.789"
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 0
Output: "0"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the input number be negative?
   - **A**: No, the problem states 'given an integer `n`', and examples are for non-negative integers only.

2. **Q**: What is the max value of integer `n` we need to handle?
   - **A**: In C++, integer can be very large but we'll assume it's within the range of a standard 32-bit integer unless otherwise specified.

### Strategy

We will convert the integer `n` to a string to manipulate its characters easily. Starting from the end of the string, we will insert a dot ('.') every three characters. Finally, we will return the modified string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string thousandSeparator(int n) {
    string numStr = to_string(n);
    string result;
    int len = numStr.length();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        if (i > 0 && (len - i) % 3 == 0) {
            result += '.';
        }
        result += numStr[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Testing the function
int main() {
    int test1 = 987;            // Output: "987"
    int test2 = 1234;           // Output: "1.234"
    int test3 = 123456789;      // Output: "123.456.789"
    int test4 = 0;              // Output: "0"
    
    cout << thousandSeparator(test1) << endl;
    cout << thousandSeparator(test2) << endl;
    cout << thousandSeparator(test3) << endl;
    cout << thousandSeparator(test4) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m)**, where **m** is the number of digits in the integer `n` (i.e., the length of the string representation of `n`). Inserting characters into a string in C++ which may involve reallocations internally is generally **O(n)**. Since we are only dealing with integers and their string representations efficiently, the overall time complexity remains linear concerning the number of digits (`m`).
