[Leetcode 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1333)
### Problem Statement

Given the array `restaurants` where `restaurants[i] = [id_i, rating_i, veganFriendly_i, price_i, distance_i]`, you need to filter the restaurants using three filters.

- The `veganFriendly` filter will be either `true` (1) meaning you should only include restaurants with `veganFriendly_i` set to `true`, or `false` (0) meaning you can include any restaurant.
- In addition to these filters, you want to sort the remaining restaurants by *rating* from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, sort them by *id* from highest to lowest.
- Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering (in the described sorting order).

### Parameters:

- `restaurants`: A list of lists, where each sublist represents a restaurant with values `[id, rating, veganFriendly, price, distance]`.
- `veganFriendly`: Integer, either 0 or 1.
- `maxPrice`: Integer, represents the maximum price you can afford for a meal.
- `maxDistance`: Integer, represents the maximum distance you are willing to travel to a restaurant.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: 
restaurants = [[1, 4, 1, 40, 10], [2, 8, 0, 50, 5], [3, 8, 1, 30, 4], [4, 10, 0, 10, 3], [5, 1, 1, 15, 1]]
veganFriendly = 1
maxPrice = 30
maxDistance = 10

Output: [3, 1, 5]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be duplicate `id` values within the `restaurants` list?
2. Are there any guaranteed constraints on the size of the `restaurants` list and its values? (e.g., maximum number of restaurants and value constraints)
3. Is the input list always guaranteed to be non-empty?

### Strategy

1. **Filter** the restaurants based on `veganFriendly`, `maxPrice`, and `maxDistance`.
2. **Sort** the filtered list by `rating` in descending order. If ratings are equal, sort by `id` in descending order.
3. **Extract** and return the IDs of the sorted restaurants.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> filterRestaurants(vector<vector<int>>& restaurants, int veganFriendly, int maxPrice, int maxDistance) {
        // Filter the restaurants based on the given conditions
        vector<vector<int>> filteredRestaurants;
        for (const auto& restaurant : restaurants) {
            if ((veganFriendly == 0 || restaurant[2] == 1) &&
                restaurant[3] <= maxPrice &&
                restaurant[4] <= maxDistance) {
                filteredRestaurants.push_back(restaurant);
            }
        }

        // Sort the filtered list by rating and id
        sort(filteredRestaurants.begin(), filteredRestaurants.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
            if (a[1] != b[1]) return a[1] > b[1];  // Sort by rating (descending)
            return a[0] > b[0];                    // Sort by id (descending)
        });

        // Extract the ids of the sorted restaurants
        vector<int> result;
        for (const auto& restaurant : filteredRestaurants) {
            result.push_back(restaurant[0]);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- Filtering Step: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of restaurants.
- Sorting Step: \(O(n \log n)\), sorting the filtered list of restaurants.
- Overall Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\). The sorting step dominates the complexity.

This approach ensures we efficiently filter and sort the restaurants according to the given constraints.
