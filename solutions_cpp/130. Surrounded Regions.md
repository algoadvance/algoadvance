[Leetcode 130. Surrounded Regions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l130)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`. Capture all regions that are surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],
                ["X","O","O","X"],
                ["X","X","O","X"],
                ["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","O","X","X"]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Should the board be modified in-place?
   Yes, the board should be modified in place.
   
2. Is there guaranteed to be at least one 'O' in the board?
   No, there may be boards with only 'X's.

## Strategy:

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find regions of 'O's that are completely surrounded by 'X's and flip them to 'X'.
  
2. **Boundary Check**: 'O's that are connected to the border cannot be captured. So, we need to identify these 'O's first.

3. **Traversal Method**: Use either DFS or BFS to mark 'O's connected to the border as non-capturable.

4. **Modify the Board**:
   - Traverse the boundary of the board, and for each 'O' on the boundary, use DFS or BFS to mark all connected 'O's as temporary characters (e.g., 'T').
   - Once the boundary traversal is complete, traverse the entire board and flip:
     - 'O' to 'X' (captured region).
     - 'T' back to 'O' (regions connected to the border).

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        int m = board.size();
        if (m == 0) return;
        int n = board[0].size();
        
        // Helper lambda to mark connected 'O's from the border
        auto markBorderConnected = [&](int i, int j) {
            if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] != 'O') return;
            board[i][j] = 'T'; // Mark as temporary
            markBorderConnected(i - 1, j); // up
            markBorderConnected(i + 1, j); // down
            markBorderConnected(i, j - 1); // left
            markBorderConnected(i, j + 1); // right
        };

        // Traverse the border to mark all 'O's connected to the boundary
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            markBorderConnected(i, 0); // First column
            markBorderConnected(i, n - 1); // Last column
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; ++j) { // Avoid corners since they are already checked
            markBorderConnected(0, j); // First row
            markBorderConnected(m - 1, j); // Last row
        }
        
        // Flip all remaining 'O' to 'X' and 'T' back to 'O'
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O') {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                } else if (board[i][j] == 'T') {
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Traversal of the Border**: O(m + n) since we traverse the entire border, consisting of the first and last rows and columns.
- **DFS/BFS Traversal**: In the worst case, every cell of the board will be visited once. Thus, O(m * n).
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(m * n).

This solution ensures that all regions of 'O's surrounded by 'X's are accurately flipped while keeping the border-connected 'O's unchanged.
