[Leetcode 1346. Check If N and Its Double Exist](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1346)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exist two indices `i` and `j` such that:
- `i != j`
- `0 <= i, j < arr.length`
- `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]` or `arr[j] == 2 * arr[i]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** What is the maximum size of the input array?
   - Let's assume the size can be up to 10^4.
2. **Element Range:** What are the possible values for the array elements?
   - The elements can vary widely, considering they can be positive, negative, or zero.
3. **Duplicates:** Can the array have duplicate values?
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate values.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash set. Here's the step-by-step strategy:
1. Iterate through each element in the array and store each element in a hash set.
2. For each element `x`, check if `2 * x` or `x / 2` (only if `x` is even) exists in the set.
3. If either condition is satisfied for any element, return `true`.
4. If no such pairs are found after checking all elements, return `false`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool checkIfExist(vector<int>& arr) {
    unordered_set<int> seen;
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (seen.count(2 * num) > 0 || (num % 2 == 0 && seen.count(num / 2) > 0)) {
            return true;
        }
        seen.insert(num);
    }
    return false;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Data Structure**: We use an unordered_set `seen` to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far.
2. **Iteration and Condition Checks**:
   - For each number in the array:
     - Check if `2 * num` (double of the current number) already exists in the hash set.
     - If the current number is even, also check if `num / 2` (half of the current number) exists in the hash set.
3. **Insertion**: After checking the two conditions, insert the current number into the set.
4. **Return**: If any of the conditions are met during the iteration, return `true`. If no conditions are met by the end of the loop, return `false`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We are doing a constant-time lookup and insertion for each element in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` because we store each element in the hash set.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the conditions in linear time with respect to the size of the input array.
