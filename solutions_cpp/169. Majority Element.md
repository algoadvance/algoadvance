[Leetcode 169. Majority Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l169)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `n / 2` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** Are we guaranteed that the input array will always have a majority element?
   - Yes, it is guaranteed as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Data type for elements:** What type of elements does the array contain?
   - The array contains integer elements.

3. **Array size:** Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   - There is no explicit constraint on the size of the array, but the focus should be on achieving the solution with the lowest possible time complexity.

4. **Output format:** What should be the return type of the function?
   - The return type should be an integer representing the majority element.

Given these clarifications, we can proceed to solve the problem.

### Strategy

One efficient method to solve this problem is by using the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. This algorithm works in linear time \(O(n)\) and constant space \(O(1)\). The idea behind the algorithm is to maintain a `candidate` for the majority element and a `count` that represents how many times we have found the candidate element.

1. **Initialize**: Start with the first element as the `candidate` and set `count` to 1.
2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - If the current element is the same as `candidate`, increment `count`.
   - If the current element is different from `candidate`, decrement `count`.
   - If `count` becomes 0, change the `candidate` to the current element and reset `count` to 1.
3. **Return the candidate** after completing the iteration since the majority element is guaranteed to exist.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int candidate = nums[0];
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }

            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = nums[i];
                count = 1;
            }
        }

        return candidate;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm iterates through the array once, which means the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses a constant amount of space, i.e., \(O(1)\), for storing variables `candidate` and `count`.

This solution is optimal for solving the majority element problem under the given constraints.
