[Leetcode 479. Largest Palindrome Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l479)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the largest palindromic integer that can be represented as the product of two `n`-digit integers. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `1337`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of n:** What is the range of `n` that we should consider?
   - Typically, `n` ranges from 1 to 8.
2. **Definition of a Palindrome:** A number is palindromic if it reads the same backward as forward.
3. **Modulo Operation:** Should the final result be returned modulo 1337?
   - Yes, the problem specifies that the result should be returned modulo 1337.

### Strategy
1. **Determine Bounds for n-digit Numbers:** For `n`-digit numbers, the range is from `10^(n-1)` to `10^n - 1`.
2. **Generate Palindromes in Descending Order:** Since we want the largest palindrome, we should start checking from the largest possible numbers.
3. **Multiplication and Palindrome Check:** 
   - Iterate through all pairs of `n`-digit numbers.
   - Check if the product is a palindrome.
   - Keep track of the largest palindromic product encountered.
4. **Modulo Operation:** Return the result modulo `1337`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 9; // Special case for single-digit numbers

        int upper_bound = pow(10, n) - 1;
        int lower_bound = pow(10, n - 1);

        long maxNumber = (long) upper_bound * (long) upper_bound;

        int firstHalf = (int) (maxNumber / pow(10, n)); // Get the first half of the max number
        bool found = false;
        long palindrome = 0;

        while (!found) {
            palindrome = createPalindrome(firstHalf);
            for (long i = upper_bound; i >= lower_bound; --i) {
                if (i * i < palindrome)
                    break;
                if (palindrome % i == 0 && (palindrome / i) <= upper_bound) {
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            firstHalf--;
        }
        return palindrome % 1337;
    }

private:
    long createPalindrome(int firstHalf) {
        string str = to_string(firstHalf);
        string reverseStr = str;
        reverse(reverseStr.begin(), reverseStr.end());
        return stol(str + reverseStr);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the value of n: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Largest Palindrome Product: " << sol.largestPalindrome(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy Explained
1. **Bounds Determination:** Determine the upper and lower bounds for the n-digit numbers.
2. **Max Number Calculation:** Compute the maximum possible product of two n-digit numbers.
3. **Palindrome Generation:** Start from the largest potential palindrome and check if it can be factored into two n-digit numbers.
4. **Palindrome Check:** Generate each palindrome by considering it as `firstHalf` concatenated with its reverse.
5. **Verification:** Verify if the palindrome can be expressed as the product of any two n-digit numbers.
6. **Modulo Operation:** Return the result modulo 1337.

### Time Complexity
- **Palindrome Generation:** O(1) each time.
- **Inner Loop:** Potentially runs in O(n^2) time if factors need to be checked exhaustively for each palindrome, where n is the range of n-digit numbers.
- For larger values of n, the time complexity can be considerably reduced by early break conditions, but the worst-case complexity remains O(n^2).
