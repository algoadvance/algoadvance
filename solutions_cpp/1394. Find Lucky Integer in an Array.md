[Leetcode 1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1394)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `arr`, a lucky integer is an integer which has a frequency in the array equal to its value. Write a function to return a lucky integer in the array. If there are multiple lucky integers return the largest of them. If there is no lucky integer return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - How large can the array be?
    - What is the range of integer values in the array?

2. **Output:**
    - What should be returned if no lucky integer is found?
  
3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What if the array is empty?
    - What if all elements in the array are the same?

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int findLucky(std::vector<int>& arr) {
        // Hashmap to store the frequency of each number
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        
        // Calculate frequencies
        for (int num : arr) {
            freqMap[num]++;
        }
        
        int result = -1;  // Default result if no lucky integer is found
        
        // Iterate through the hashmap to find lucky integers
        for (const auto& elem : freqMap) {
            if (elem.first == elem.second) {
                result = std::max(result, elem.first);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     std::vector<int> arr = {2, 2, 3, 4};
//     std::cout << sol.findLucky(arr) << std::endl;  // Output: 2
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Strategy:

1. **Frequency Mapping:**
   - We use an unordered map to store the frequency of each integer in the array.
   - Traverse the array and update the frequency map accordingly.

2. **Finding Lucky Integer:**
   - Iterate through the frequency map to check if there is any integer whose frequency matches its value.
   - Keep track of the largest lucky integer found.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If a lucky integer is found, return the largest one; otherwise, return -1.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Building the frequency map involves a single pass through the array: \(O(n)\).
  - Iterating through the elements of the frequency map adds another pass: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique elements (which in the worst case can be \(O(n)\)).
  - Overall time complexity: \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - Storing the frequency map requires additional space: \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique elements.
  - Overall space complexity: \(O(n)\) in the worst case where all elements are unique.
