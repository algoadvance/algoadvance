[Leetcode 984. String Without AAA or BBB](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l984)
### Problem Statement
Given two integers `A` and `B`, create a string that contains exactly `A` 'a' characters and exactly `B` 'b' characters, and does not contain the strings "aaa" or "bbb" as a substring.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `A` and `B` be zero?**
   - Yes, `A` or `B` can be zero. In such cases, the string would just be composed of the other character.

2. **What is the largest value for `A` and `B`?**
   - The problem does not specify this, so we will assume it to be within reasonable integer limits.

3. **Should the string be lexicographically smallest?**
   - The problem does not mention anything about the lexical order. So, we will just ensure that "aaa" or "bbb" substrings are not present.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, an alternating approach can be used where we prioritize adding characters that are more frequent:

1. Initialize two counters for 'a' and 'b' based on `A` and `B`.
2. Use a greedy algorithm:
   - Always try to add the character that has more remaining instances to avoid triple occurrences.
   - If adding the more frequent character would cause three consecutive characters, then add the other character.
3. Use a loop to continue the process until both counters reach zero.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is O(A + B) because we construct the string by adding each character exactly once.

### Code
```cpp
#include <string>

std::string strWithout3a3b(int A, int B) {
    std::string result;
    while (A > 0 || B > 0) {
        if (A > B) {
            // Add 'a' character
            if(A > 1 && A > B) {
                result += "aa";
                A -= 2;
            } else {
                result += "a";
                A--;
            }

            // Add 'b' character if there are any left, to balance
            if (B > 0 && A > B) {
                result += "b";
                B--;
            }
        } else {
            // Add 'b' character
            if(B > 1 && B > A) {
                result += "bb";
                B -= 2;
            } else {
                result += "b";
                B--;
            }

            // Add 'a' character if there are any left, to balance
            if (A > 0 && B > A) {
                result += "a";
                A--;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Approach Explanation
1. The loop continues as long as there are 'a' or 'b' characters to be added.
2. The check `if (A > B)` drives us to add more 'a' when `A` exceeds `B` to avoid the possibility of having three consecutive 'b'.
3. Similarly, when `B > A`, 'b's are prioritized.
4. When adding two of the same character, we also check and add one of the other character if possible to keep a balance and avoid three consecutive identical characters.

This approach ensures no "aaa" or "bbb" substrings, maintaining the required conditions.
