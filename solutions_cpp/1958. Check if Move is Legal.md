[Leetcode 1958. Check if Move is Legal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1958)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `board` that represents an 8x8 matrix of pieces, where the following values are assigned to each piece:
- '.' : an empty square
- 'W' : a white piece
- 'B' : a black piece

You are given a location `(rMove, cMove)` and a color `color` (either 'W' or 'B'). The piece at the given location is attempting to replace an empty square with a new piece of the given color. A move is legal if after placing the new piece on the board:
1. One or more of the opponent's pieces are flipped to the current player's color.
2. This is happen in at least one of the eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

Return `true` if the move is legal; otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will the given position `(rMove, cMove)` always be valid and within the boundaries of the board?
2. Will `(rMove, cMove)` always be an empty square (i.e., always '.') before the move?
3. Can the entire board configuration be assumed to be valid at the start?

Let's assume that:
1. Yes, `(rMove, cMove)` is always valid.
2. Yes, the starting point will be an empty square.
3. Yes, the board configuration is valid at the start.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool checkMove(vector<vector<char>>& board, int rMove, int cMove, char color) {
        const int n = 8;
        const vector<int> directions = {-1, 0, 1};
        char opponent = (color == 'W') ? 'B' : 'W';

        auto isLegalDirection = [&](int rowDir, int colDir) {
            int r = rMove + rowDir;
            int c = cMove + colDir;
            bool seenOpponent = false;

            while (r >= 0 && r < n && c >= 0 && c < n) {
                if (board[r][c] == '.') return false;  // Empty cell path should not be followed further
                if (board[r][c] == opponent) {
                    seenOpponent = true;
                } else if (board[r][c] == color) {
                    return seenOpponent;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
                r += rowDir;
                c += colDir;
            }
            return false;
        };

        for (int i : directions) {
            for (int j : directions) {
                if (i == 0 && j == 0) continue;  // Skip checking the same cell
                if (isLegalDirection(i, j)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

The task is to determine if placing a piece at `(rMove, cMove)` is a legal move according to the game rules.

- **Initialization**:
  - Define the opponent's color based on the current player's color.

- **Helper Function**:
  - `isLegalDirection` function checks if placing a piece will capture at least one opponent's piece in the given direction (rowDir, colDir).
    
- **Direction Checks**:
  - Iterate over each of the potential directions (8 possible ones).
  - For each direction, utilize `isLegalDirection` to verify if it's a capturing move.
  - If any direction returns `true`, the move is legal.

- **Return**:
  - If no direction allows capturing, return `false`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the size of the board (here, 8).
  - We iterate over all 8 possible directions.
  - Each direction can potentially iterate up to `n` cells in the worst-case scenario.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we are not using any extra space that scales with input size.

This solution is efficient for the board size of 8x8 as per typical Reversi/Othello rules.
