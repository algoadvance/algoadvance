[Leetcode 664. Strange Printer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l664)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, the task is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print the string. The printer can print a sequence of the same character at a time and then it can move to another character.

### Example:
- Input: `s = "aaabbb"`
  Output: `2`
- Input: `s = "aba"`
  Output: `2`

The printer can print "aaa" first and then "bbb", which takes two turns.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input string guaranteed to contain only lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, it is stated that the input will consist of only lowercase letters.
2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - This isn't provided, but we assume it can be reasonably long within typical constraints for such problems (e.g., up to 1000 characters).

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP). Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum number of turns needed to print the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

1. **Initialization**: Base case where `i == j`, `dp[i][i] = 1` since a single character requires one turn.
2. **Transition/Recurrence Relation**:
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]`.
   - Otherwise, we need to try partitioning the string into two parts and combining the results.

The main idea is to find the minimum number of turns needed to print each substring and use those results to build up to the solution for the full string.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation for the given strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int strangePrinter(std::string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        // dp[i][j] means the minimum turns to print the substring s[i..j]
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n, std::vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1; // single character substrings
        }
        
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1; // initialize with one more than the substring s[i..j-1]

                for (int k = i; k < j; ++k) {
                    if (s[k] == s[j]) {
                        dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j - 1]);
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = std::min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n^3)** due to the three nested loops:
1. Looping through the possible lengths of the substring.
2. Looping through the starting index.
3. Looping through the partitioning index k.

Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough for typical input sizes.

## Conclusion

This detailed approach using Dynamic Programming efficiently solves the problem of determining the minimum number of turns the printer needs to print the given string. By breaking down substrings and combining results, we ensure our solution is both systematic and optimal.
