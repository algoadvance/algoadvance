[Leetcode 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l863)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node in the tree, and an integer `k`, return an array of the values of all nodes that have a distance `k` from the target node.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2
Output: [7,4,1]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - A: No, values are unique.

2. **Q: What should be returned if there are no nodes at distance `k`?**
   - A: Return an empty list.

3. **Q: How is the tree represented for input/output?**
   - A: The tree is represented using the binary tree node structure, where each node has a `val`, `left`, and `right`.

4. **Q: Will the target node always exist in the tree?**
   - A: Yes, we can assume the target node exists.

## Strategy

1. **Convert the Tree to a Graph**: Use a map to store the adjacency list, treating the binary tree as an undirected graph.
2. **Perform BFS from the Target Node**: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS), explore nodes starting from the target node to find all nodes that are `k` distance away.

### Steps:

1. **Tree Traversal to Graph Construction**:
   - Traverse the tree and build an adjacency list representation of the graph using a map.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - From the target node, perform BFS to find all nodes at distance `k`.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;

    void buildGraph(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return;
        if (node->left) {
            graph[node->val].push_back(node->left->val);
            graph[node->left->val].push_back(node->val);
            buildGraph(node->left);
        }
        if (node->right) {
            graph[node->val].push_back(node->right->val);
            graph[node->right->val].push_back(node->val);
            buildGraph(node->right);
        }
    }

public:
    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int k) {
        if (!root) return {};
        buildGraph(root);

        unordered_set<int> visited;
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(target->val);
        visited.insert(target->val);

        int distance = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            if (distance == k) {
                vector<int> result;
                while (!q.empty()) {
                    result.push_back(q.front());
                    q.pop();
                }
                return result;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                int node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                    if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                        visited.insert(neighbor);
                        q.push(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
            ++distance;
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**:
  - **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node and its children are visited once.
  
- **BFS Traversal**:
  - **O(N)**, in the worst case, each node might be added to the queue once.
  
Overall, the time complexity is **O(N)**.

The space complexity is also **O(N)** due to the space used to store the graph and the BFS queue.
