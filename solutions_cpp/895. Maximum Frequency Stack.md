[Leetcode 895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l895)
## Problem Statement

Design a stack-like data structure that supports the following operations:

1. **`push(int x)`**: Push element x onto the stack.
2. **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the element from the stack that occurs most frequently. If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

You need to implement the `FreqStack` class:

- `FreqStack()` initializes the object.
- `void push(int x)` adds an integer x to the stack.
- `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack. If there is a tie, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

### Example:
```
Input
["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]

Output
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]

Explanation
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop(); // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.pop(); // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4]
freqStack.pop(); // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4]
freqStack.pop(); // return 4, as 4, 5, and 7 have the same frequency, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7]
```
**Constraints:**
- The number of `push` and `pop` operations will be at most `2 * 10^4`.
- Values of elements will be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack when `pop` is called?**
   Yes, only valid operations will be provided as input.

2. **What should be returned when there are no elements in the stack?**
   This situation will not occur based on the problem statement constraints.

3. **Is there any upper bound on the frequency of any element?**
   No specific upper bound other than the total number of operations.

## Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the following data structures:
1. **`unordered_map<int, int> freq_map`**: To keep track of the frequency of each element.
2. **`unordered_map<int, stack<int>> freq_stack_map`**: To map each frequency to a stack of elements with that frequency.
3. **`int max_freq`**: To keep track of the maximum frequency encountered.

### Operations:
- **`push(int x)`**
  1. Update the frequency of x in `freq_map`.
  2. Update the `max_freq` if necessary.
  3. Push x onto the appropriate stack in `freq_stack_map` based on its frequency.
  
- **`pop()`**
  1. Pop the top element from the stack corresponding to `max_freq`.
  2. Decrement the frequency of the popped element.
  3. If the stack for `max_freq` is empty after popping, decrement `max_freq`.

By maintaining these data structures, both `push` and `pop` operations can be performed in O(1) time complexity.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

class FreqStack {
public:
    FreqStack() : max_freq(0) {}

    void push(int x) {
        int freq = ++freq_map[x];
        max_freq = max(max_freq, freq);
        freq_stack_map[freq].push(x);
    }

    int pop() {
        int x = freq_stack_map[max_freq].top();
        freq_stack_map[max_freq].pop();
        if (freq_stack_map[max_freq].empty()) {
            max_freq--;
        }
        freq_map[x]--;
        return x;
    }

private:
    unordered_map<int, int> freq_map; // element -> frequency
    unordered_map<int, stack<int>> freq_stack_map; // frequency -> stack of elements
    int max_freq;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **`push(int x)`**: O(1) - Increment frequency, update maps, and stack operations are constant time.
- **`pop()`**: O(1) - Pop the top element from the stack, update maps, and `max_freq` management are constant time.
