[Leetcode 2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2901)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, the task is to form the longest subsequence such that no two adjacent characters in the subsequence are the same. A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the length range of the input string `s`?
2. **Character Set**: Does the string `s` contain only lowercase alphabets, or can it contain other characters, including uppercase letters, digits, etc.?
3. **Output**: Should the output be the length of the longest subsequence or the subsequence itself?

## Example

Given a string `s = "aab"`, one of the longest subsequences is "ab". For a string `s = "abcd"`, the whole string already satisfies the condition.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Approach**:
    - Iterate through the string `s` and construct the subsequence.
    - To form the subsequence, we need to ensure that no two adjacent characters are the same.

2. **Algorithm**:
    - Initialize an empty string to store the result subsequence.
    - Traverse the input string character by character.
    - Append the current character to the result if it is not the same as the last character in the result.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm involves iterating through the string once, performing constant time checks and operations for each character. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

std::string longestUnequalAdjacentSubsequence(const std::string &s) {
    if (s.empty()) return "";

    std::string result;
    result.push_back(s[0]);
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] != s[i-1]) {
            result.push_back(s[i]);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s; 
    std::cout << "Enter the string: ";
    std::cin >> s;
    std::string result = longestUnequalAdjacentSubsequence(s);
    std::cout << "Longest unequal adjacent subsequence: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This function `longestUnequalAdjacentSubsequence` constructs the longest subsequence such that no two adjacent characters are the same, by iterating through the input string and maintaining a result string. This meets the problem requirements with an O(n) time complexity.
