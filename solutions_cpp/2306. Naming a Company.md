[Leetcode 2306. Naming a Company](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2306)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with helping a group of entrepreneurs to come up with unique names for their new company. The group follows a peculiar rule: they generate company names by concatenating a lasting word from one domain with a lasting word from another domain.

Given two arrays, `ideas1` and `ideas2`, representing the list of words for each domain, you need to find out the number of unique company names formed by concatenating a word from `ideas1` with a word from `ideas2`. The order of concatenation cannot be reversed, i.e., a name formed by `idea1 + idea2` is different from `idea2 + idea1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of `ideas1` and `ideas2`?**
   - Typical constraints: Length of arrays and length of each string might be constrained by system limits.
  
2. **Are the words in `ideas1` and `ideas2` distinct?**
   - Assuming all given words in `ideas1` and `ideas2` are distinct.

3. **Are there any specific character restrictions for the words?**
   - Typically, only alphabetic characters might be used.

With these clarifications, let's move forward with the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Concatenate each word from `ideas1` with each word from `ideas2`**: 
    - We will generate each possible concatenation and store it in a set to ensure uniqueness.
    
2. **Count the unique combinations**:
    - By storing the amalgamated strings in a set, duplicates will be inherently ignored, so the size of the set will give the count of unique names.

### Time Complexity

- Let \( n \) be the length of `ideas1` and \( m \) be the length of `ideas2`.
- For each word in `ideas1`, we concatenate it with every word in `ideas2`: This results in a time complexity of \( O(n \times m) \). 
- Adding each concatenated string to the set takes average-case \( O(1) \) time, making the overall complexity \( O(n \times m) \).

### Code

Hereâ€™s the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int uniqueCompanyNames(vector<string>& ideas1, vector<string>& ideas2) {
    unordered_set<string> uniqueNames;
    
    for (const string& idea1 : ideas1) {
        for (const string& idea2 : ideas2) {
            uniqueNames.insert(idea1 + idea2);
        }
    }
    
    return uniqueNames.size();
}

int main() {
    vector<string> ideas1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"};
    vector<string> ideas2 = {"pie", "cake", "tart"};
    
    int result = uniqueCompanyNames(ideas1, ideas2);
    cout << "Number of unique company names: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Include Dependencies**: Include the necessary headers for I/O operations and data structures.
2. **uniqueCompanyNames Function**:
    - Create an unordered set `uniqueNames` to store the unique concatenated names.
    - Use nested loops to concatenate each idea from `ideas1` with each idea from `ideas2` and insert the result into the set.
3. **Return the Size of the Set**: This gives the count of unique company names.
4. **Main Function**:
    - For testing purposes, the main function defines some test data (`ideas1` and `ideas2`) and calls the `uniqueCompanyNames` function. It prints the result.

This solution ensures all unique concatenations are counted effectively.
