[Leetcode 1834. Single](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1834)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTime_i, processingTime_i]` means that the `i-th` task will be available to process at `enqueueTime_i` and will take `processingTime_i` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will finish the current task before starting another one. The CPU will choose the next task in the following way:

1. If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks, the CPU remains idle.
2. If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the task with the smallest processing time. If there are multiple tasks with the same smallest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
3. Once a task is started, the CPU will process it completely without stopping.

Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How large can the input `tasks` array be? 
     - The number of tasks (n) can be up to 100,000.
   - What are the ranges for `enqueueTime_i` and `processingTime_i`?
     - Both `enqueueTime_i` and `processingTime_i` are in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a list of task indices in the order they are processed by the CPU.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if all tasks have the same `enqueueTime` and `processingTime`?
   - What if `enqueueTime` of the first task is very large compared to others?
   - What if no two tasks overlap in terms of `enqueueTime`?

### Strategy

1. **Sorting and Priority Queue:**
   - Sort the tasks based on their `enqueueTime`.
   - Use a priority queue to manage the tasks based on their `processingTime` and `index`.

2. **Simulation using Greedy Approach:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current time.
   - Iterate over the sorted tasks and simulate the processing by pushing tasks into the priority queue as they become available.
   - Always pick the task with the smallest processing time from the priority queue to process next.
   - Update the current time accordingly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<int> getOrder(vector<vector<int>>& tasks) {
    int n = tasks.size();
    vector<int> result;

    // Augment tasks with their original indices
    vector<tuple<int, int, int>> sortedTasks;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sortedTasks.emplace_back(tasks[i][0], tasks[i][1], i);
    }
    // Sort tasks by enqueue time
    sort(sortedTasks.begin(), sortedTasks.end());

    // Min-heap to store available tasks by processing time, and break ties by index
    auto compare = [](pair<int, int>& a, pair<int, int>& b) {
        if (a.first == b.first) return a.second > b.second;
        return a.first > b.first;
    };
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, decltype(compare)> pq(compare);

    long long currentTime = 0;
    int i = 0;

    while (i < n || !pq.empty()) {
        // Load tasks that become available up to the current time into the priority queue
        while (i < n && get<0>(sortedTasks[i]) <= currentTime) {
            pq.emplace(get<1>(sortedTasks[i]), get<2>(sortedTasks[i]));
            ++i;
        }
        
        if (!pq.empty()) {
            // Process the next task
            auto [processingTime, index] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            result.push_back(index);
            currentTime += processingTime;
        } else if (i < n) {
            // No tasks available, jump to the next task's enqueue time
            currentTime = get<0>(sortedTasks[i]);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`
- **Handling the Priority Queue:** Each task is pushed and popped from the priority queue once, so the operations cost `O(n log n)`.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)` 

This ensures the solution efficiently handles the input constraints.
