[Leetcode 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2265)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, count the number of nodes that are equal to the average of values in their subtree. A subtree of a node consists of the node itself and all its descendants. The average of N nodes is defined as the sum of the node values divided by N (integer division).

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
For the node with value 4: The average of its subtree is (4 + 8 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 6)/6 = 24/6 = 4.
For the node with value 8: The average of its subtree is (0 + 1 + 8)/3 = 9/3 = 3.
For the node with value 5: The average of its subtree is 5/1 = 5.
For the node with value 0: The average of its subtree is 0/1 = 0.
For the node with value 1: The average of its subtree is 1/1 = 1.
For the node with value 6: The average of its subtree is 6/1 = 6.
```

Note:
1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
2. The value of nodes is in the range `[0, 1000]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the node values be negative? 
    - **No**, the values in nodes are in the range `[0, 1000]`.
2. Should we consider the rounding for average calculation?
    - **No**, integer division is used for the average calculation.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Traverse the tree to calculate the sum and count of each subtree.
2. During the traversal, check if the current node's value equals the integer division of the sum of its subtree by the number of nodes in that subtree.
3. Implement a helper function that returns both the sum and count of nodes in a subtree.
4. Use that helper function to count the number of nodes that meet the condition.

We can implement this solution using Depth-First Search (DFS) as it makes it easier to process the children before the parent.

## Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
private:
    int result = 0;
    
    // Helper function to calculate the sum and count of a subtree.
    pair<int, int> subtreeSumAndCount(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return {0, 0};
        
        // Recursively get sum and count of the left and right subtrees.
        auto left = subtreeSumAndCount(root->left);
        auto right = subtreeSumAndCount(root->right);
        
        int sum = root->val + left.first + right.first;
        int count = 1 + left.second + right.second;
        
        // Check if current node's value is equal to the average of its subtree.
        if (root->val == (sum / count)) {
            result++;
        }
        
        return {sum, count};
    }
    
public:
    int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        subtreeSumAndCount(root);
        return result;
    }
};

// Helper function to create a new tree node
TreeNode* newNode(int val) {
    TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(val);
    node->left = node->right = nullptr;
    return node;
}

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    // Constructing the example tree: [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
    TreeNode* root = newNode(4);
    root->left = newNode(8);
    root->right = newNode(5);
    root->left->left = newNode(0);
    root->left->right = newNode(1);
    root->right->right = newNode(6);

    cout << solution.averageOfSubtree(root) << endl; // Output should be 5
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once as we perform a DFS traversal to calculate the sum and count of all subtrees.
