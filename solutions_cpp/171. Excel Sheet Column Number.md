[Leetcode 171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l171)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `columnTitle` that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number. For example:

- "A" -> 1
- "B" -> 2
- "C" -> 3
- ...
- "Z" -> 26
- "AA" -> 27
- "AB" -> 28
- ...

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `columnTitle` string?
   - Will the string always be in uppercase?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the function return an integer corresponding to the column number?

### Strategy

This problem is analogous to converting a number from a base-26 numeral system to a decimal (base-10) numeral system.

1. **Understanding the Mapping:**
   - The character 'A' maps to the number 1, 'B' maps to 2, ..., 'Z' maps to 26.
   - For multi-character strings, it follows a positional system similar to base-10 numbers but with base-26.
     - For example "AB":
       - 'A' = 1, but as it's the first character from the left, it represents \(26^1\) * 1.
       - 'B' = 2, and as the second character, it represents \(26^0\) * 2.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize a variable to store the resultant number.
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - For each character, calculate its contribution based on its position.

3. **Steps:**
   - Initialize `result = 0`.
   - Iterate over each character in the string.
     - Convert the character to its corresponding base-26 value.
     - Update `result` with the current character's positional value.
   - Return the final `result`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int titleToNumber(const std::string& columnTitle) {
    int result = 0;
    for (char c : columnTitle) {
        int value = c - 'A' + 1;
        result = result * 26 + value;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string columnTitle = "AB"; // Example input
    std::cout << "The column number is: " << titleToNumber(columnTitle) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `columnTitle` string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), except for the input string and insignificant additional space used.

This method ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently even for longer column titles, adhering to a linear time complexity.
