[Leetcode 2162. Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2162)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers: `startAt` (the starting position of the timer) and `targetMinutes` (the target number of minutes for cooking). You are also given an integer `moveCost` which represents the cost to move from one number to another and an integer `pushCost` which represents the cost to press a number on the timer. You can only input the time in minutes (up to four digits). The timer presets the numbers according to the digits pressed. You need to find the minimum cost to set the cooking time to exactly `targetMinutes`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs:** What is the range of `targetMinutes`?
   - The range of `targetMinutes` should likely be between 0 and 9999 as we can only input up to four digits on the timer.

2. **Integer Overflow:** Should we worry about integer overflow?
   - Standard constraints for many problems suggest integers are safely within 32-bit range, so typical C++ `int` can handle common cases.

3. **Valid States:** Is it always possible to set the timer to exactly `targetMinutes`? If not, what should be returned?
   - We'll assume for this problem that it's always possible to set the timer to exactly `targetMinutes`.

### Strategy

1. **Possible Ways to Decompose the Task:**
   - Direct approach would involve figuring out costs and possible configurations of the target time.
   - Consider various decompositions of minutes into up to four digits, noting leading zeros where necessary.
   - Compute different configurations, taking into account the initial state of `startAt`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - Move cost if the current digit is not the same as the previous digit.
   - Push cost for every digit (whether moved or not).

3. **Minimal Cost Approach:**
   - Track the minimal cost while exploring valid decompositions of the `targetMinutes`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <climits>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minCostToSetCookingTime(int startAt, int moveCost, int pushCost, int targetMinutes) {
    string timeStr = to_string(targetMinutes);
    int minCost = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= targetMinutes; ++i) {
        int hours = i / 60;
        int minutes = i % 60;
        string config = to_string(hours * 100 + minutes);
        
        if (stoi(config) == targetMinutes) {
            int cost = 0;
            int currentPosition = startAt;
            
            for (char c : config) {
                if (c - '0' != currentPosition) {
                    cost += moveCost;
                }
                cost += pushCost;
                currentPosition = c - '0';
            }
            
            minCost = min(minCost, cost);
        }
    }
    
    return minCost;
}

int main() {
    int startAt = 1;
    int moveCost = 2;
    int pushCost = 3;
    int targetMinutes = 600;
    
    cout << minCostToSetCookingTime(startAt, moveCost, pushCost, targetMinutes) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of minutes (up to 9999). For every minute, it calculates different configurations and checks their costs.

### Explanation and Edge Cases

1. **Directly computing the cost:** The above code calculates the cost for every possible time configuration for the given number of minutes.
2. **Edge case:** If `targetMinutes` is zero, the method should handle zero as well.
3. **Valid configurations:** We ensure all configurations are valid by converting minutes to hours and minutes string format.

This approach ensures we explore all possible configurations and find the minimum cost setup for the cooking timer.
