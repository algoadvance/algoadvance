[Leetcode 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l974)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - No, `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer based on typical problem constraints.
   
2. **What are the size constraints on `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints are given such that `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Should the result always be non-negative?**
   - Yes, since we're counting subarrays, the result will be non-negative.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can't afford to use a nested loop to check the sum of every possible subarray due to the potential size of `nums`. Instead, we'll use a hashmap (or unordered_map in C++) to track the cumulative sum remainders when divided by `k`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a hashmap to store frequencies of remainders and a variable to count valid subarrays.
2. **Cumulative Sum and Remainder Calculation**: Traverse through the array while maintaining a running cumulative sum and compute the remainder when divided by `k`.
3. **Adjust Non-Positive Remainders**: If a remainder is negative, adjust it to provide the correct modulus operation by adding `k`.
4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: If the remainder has been seen before, it means there are some subarrays whose sums are divisible by `k`. Add the frequency of that remainder to the result.
5. **Update the HashMap**: Update the hashmap with the current remainder.

This approach ensures we only pass through the array once, achieving a time complexity of O(N), where `N` is the length of `nums`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int subarraysDivByK(const std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> remainder_count{{0, 1}};
    int cumulative_sum = 0;
    int subarrays = 0;
    
    for (const int &num : nums) {
        cumulative_sum += num;
        int remainder = cumulative_sum % k;
        
        // Adjusting remainder to be positive
        if (remainder < 0) {
            remainder += k;
        }
        
        if (remainder_count.find(remainder) != remainder_count.end()) {
            subarrays += remainder_count[remainder];
        }
        
        remainder_count[remainder]++;
    }

    return subarrays;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where `N` is the length of the `nums` array. We are iterating through the array once and performing constant-time operations within the loop.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(K), where `K` is the number of possible remainders, because in the worst case we could store up to `k` different remainders in the hashmap.

This ensures the solution is optimal and can handle the upper constraints effectively.
