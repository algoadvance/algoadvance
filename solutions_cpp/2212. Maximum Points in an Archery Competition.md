[Leetcode 2212. Maximum Points in an Archery Competition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2212)
## Problem Statement

You are the coach of a 12-player archery team. The team is participating in an archery competition where there are `numArrows` arrows available. Points are distributed across 11 different segments (indexed 0 through 10) on the archery target.

You are given an integer array `aliceArrows` of size 12, where `aliceArrows[i]` represents the number of arrows Alice (the competing team) shot in the `i-th` segment. The goal is to maximize the points for your team.

You need to determine the number of arrows to shoot in each segment such that:

1. Your team wins more points than Alice.
2. The total number of arrows used does not exceed `numArrows`.

Return an integer array `result` of size 12 where `result[i]` denotes the number of arrows your team decided to shoot in the `i-th` segment. If there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum points, you can return any one of them.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the `aliceArrows` array always of size 12?**
   - Yes, the `aliceArrows` array will always be of size 12.

2. **Can the points only be distributed among the first 11 segments (0 to 10)?**
   - Yes, points are only distributed across the 11 segments (0 to 10). The 12th entry represents surplus arrows.

3. **Is it possible to distribute arrows such that no arrows are left unused?**
   - Yes, the solution should ensure that the arrows are fully utilized or that the maximum possible points are gained even if some arrows are left.

4. **What should be done if multiple solutions exist that yield the same maximum points?**
   - Any valid solution that yields the maximum points can be returned.

## Strategy

The strategy involves using dynamic programming to maximize the score. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Setup a Dynamic Programming table** where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points achieved considering up to the `i-th` segment with `j` arrows left.
2. **Initialize the DP table** with zeros.
3. **Fill the DP table** by iterating through each segment and determining whether to allocate arrows to that segment or not.
4. Use a **backtracking** approach to determine the actual segments to which arrows were allocated.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maximumBobPoints(int numArrows, vector<int>& aliceArrows) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(12, vector<int>(numArrows + 1, 0));
        vector<vector<bool>> picked(12, vector<bool>(numArrows + 1, false));

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= 11; ++i) {
            int requiredArrows = aliceArrows[i - 1] + 1;
            for (int j = 0; j <= numArrows; ++j) {
                // Do not pick the current segment
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];

                // Pick the current segment if enough arrows are available
                if (j >= requiredArrows) {
                    int scoreWithCurrent = dp[i - 1][j - requiredArrows] + (i - 1);
                    if (scoreWithCurrent > dp[i][j]) {
                        dp[i][j] = scoreWithCurrent;
                        picked[i][j] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Backtrack to determine which segments should be picked
        vector<int> result(12, 0);
        int remainingArrows = numArrows;

        for (int i = 11; i > 0; --i) {
            if (picked[i][remainingArrows]) {
                result[i - 1] = aliceArrows[i - 1] + 1;
                remainingArrows -= result[i - 1];
            }
        }

        // Allocate remaining arrows to the last segment (index 11)
        result[11] = remainingArrows;

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(12 * numArrows)**, which is efficient given the constraints of the problem since `12` is a constant representing the number of segments, and `numArrows` represents the total number of arrows.

By applying this dynamic programming strategy, we ensure that we can achieve the maximum possible points in the archery competition within a reasonable computational limit.
