[Leetcode 2398. Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2398)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`, and an integer `budget`. The `i-th` robot costs `chargeTimes[i]` to activate and consumes `runningCosts[i]` energy per unit of time it runs. You start with a single robot which can be selected at any moment in time, but you can activate (switch it off and on) any robot you want, provided that the total activation and running costs do not exceed the given budget. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of robots you can have running simultaneously such that the total cost does not exceed the budget.

The total cost for running k robots is calculated as follows:
Total cost = max(chargeTimes[i]) + k * (sum of runningCosts[i])

You need to return the maximum number of robots that can be running simultaneously within the provided budget.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of values for `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`**: What are the minimum and maximum values for elements in these arrays?
2. **Constraints on `n`**: What is the maximum size of the arrays `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`?
3. **Budget**: Is the budget always a positive integer?
4. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider any special edge cases like empty arrays or very small lengths?

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to return the maximum number of robots within the budget
int maximumRobots(std::vector<int>& chargeTimes, std::vector<int>& runningCosts, long long budget) {
    int n = chargeTimes.size();
    long long totalRunningCost = 0;
    std::deque<int> maxChargeDeque;
    int left = 0;
    int maxRobots = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        totalRunningCost += runningCosts[right];
        
        while (!maxChargeDeque.empty() && chargeTimes[maxChargeDeque.back()] <= chargeTimes[right]) {
            maxChargeDeque.pop_back();
        }
        maxChargeDeque.push_back(right);
        
        long long currentCost = chargeTimes[maxChargeDeque.front()] + (right - left + 1) * totalRunningCost;
        
        while (currentCost > budget && left <= right) {
            totalRunningCost -= runningCosts[left];
            if (left == maxChargeDeque.front()) {
                maxChargeDeque.pop_front();
            }
            left++;
            if (left <= right) {
                currentCost = chargeTimes[maxChargeDeque.front()] + (right - left + 1) * totalRunningCost;
            }
        }
        
        maxRobots = std::max(maxRobots, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxRobots;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window**: The problem can be approached using a sliding window technique.
2. **Dequeue for Max Charge**: Utilize a deque to keep track of the maximum charge time in the current window.
3. **Total Running Cost**: Keep a running total of the running costs for the current window.
4. **Adjust Window**: Move the window to the right, ensuring that the total cost does not exceed the budget. Adjust the window size (left pointer) when the cost exceeds the budget.

## Time Complexity

- **Maintaining Deque**: Pushing and popping into deque for each element is O(n) since each element is added and removed at most once.
- **Total Running Cost Calculation**: Updating the running cost and adjusting the window has a complexity of O(n).

Thus the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
