[Leetcode 3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3170)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters and star (`*`) characters. 

You need to remove all the stars from the string in one pass. Each star removes the nearest non-star character to its left. 

Return the lexicographically smallest string after removing all the stars. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. What happens if there are no characters to the left of a star when it appears?
   - This situation wouldn't happen by design as each star removes the nearest non-star character to its left.

2. What should be done if there are consecutive stars?
   - Each star should remove the nearest preceding non-star character one after the other.

3. Do we need to handle any special cases for input validation, or can we assume the input is always valid?
   - We can assume the input is always valid according to the problem constraints.

## Strategy

To achieve this in optimal time, we can utilize a stack-like approach where we push characters into the stack until a `*` is encountered. When a `*` is encountered, we simply pop the top character from the stack, thus effectively removing the nearest preceding character.

Steps:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the characters in the string `s`.
3. For each character:
   - If the character is not a `*`, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a `*`, pop the top character from the stack.
4. After iterating through the string, the stack will contain all the characters of the final resulting string.
5. Convert the stack to a string and return it.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. Since each character is pushed and possibly popped from the stack exactly once, this ensures linear time complexity.

## C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>

std::string removeStars(std::string s) {
    std::stack<char> st;
    for(char c : s) {
        if (c != '*') {
            st.push(c);
        } else {
            if (!st.empty()) {
                st.pop();
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Build the result string from the stack
    std::string result;
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result += st.top();
        st.pop();
    }
    
    // Since the stack builds the result string in reverse order, we need to reverse it
    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string s = "leet**cod*e";
    std::cout << removeStars(s) << std::endl; // Output: "lecoe"

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initial Setup**: We use a stack to keep track of non-star characters.
2. **Iteration**: As we iterate through each character of the string:
   - Push non-star characters onto the stack.
   - Pop characters from the stack when a star (`*`) is encountered.
3. **Building Result**: After the traversal, the stack contains the characters in reverse order. We pop from the stack to build the result string and then reverse the final string to get the correct order.

This code ensures that we handle all removals in one pass and construct the lexicographically smallest string efficiently.
