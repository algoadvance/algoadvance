[Leetcode 3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3170)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that contains only lowercase English letters and the character '*'. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose a '*' in the string, remove the closest non-star character to its left, and then remove the '*' itself.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain after removing all stars.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems would be up to \(10^5\).
  
2. **Can the input string be empty or contain only stars?**
   - Let's assume the string will have at least one non-star character to ensure a valid processing.

3. **Should we consider only valid inputs where every star can find a corresponding non-star character to its left?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, let's assume all stars will have a corresponding non-star character on the left.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. Use a stack to manage the characters.
3. When encountering a non-star character, push it onto the stack.
4. When encountering a star '*', pop the top element from the stack (i.e., the last added character) because a star removes the most recent character to its left.
5. At the end of traversal, the stack will contain the lexicographically smallest string that meets the criteria.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string removeStars(string s) {
    stack<char> st;
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (ch == '*') {
            if (!st.empty()) {
                st.pop();
            }
        } else {
            st.push(ch);
        }
    }
    
    // Construct the resulting string from the stack
    string result;
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result += st.top();
        st.pop();
    }
    reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}

// Example usage and testing
int main() {
    string s;
    cout << "Enter a string with '*' characters: ";
    cin >> s;
    cout << "Lexicographically smallest string after removing stars: " << removeStars(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm operates in O(n) time where n is the length of the string. This is because we are traversing the string once and performing constant-time operations like push and pop on the stack.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are non-star characters and are stored in the stack.

In summary, this solution is efficient in terms of both time and space, making it well-suited for large input sizes typically encountered in such problems.
