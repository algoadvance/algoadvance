[Leetcode 1090. Largest Values From Labels](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1090)
Sure, let's go through this problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
You have `n` items where each item has a value and a label. The restriction is that you can only choose at most `num_wanted` items, and you can use at most `use_limit` items with the same label.

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the values of the items you choose.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
values: [5,4,3,2,1]
labels: [1,1,2,2,3]
num_wanted: 3
use_limit: 1

Output: 12
```

**Explanation:**
Values with selected labels are [5, 4, 3]. We use the maximum value from each label up to the given limit.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can values or labels arrays be empty?
   - No, it is guaranteed that there are values and labels.
2. Is the length of the values array the same as the length of the labels array?
   - Yes, both arrays have the same length.
3. What should be returned if it's not possible to pick any items due to constraints?
   - Return 0 in such cases.

Now, let's move onto the strategy.

### Strategy
1. **Combine Values and Labels:**
   - Pair each value with its corresponding label.

2. **Sort the Combined List:**
   - Sort the combined list based on values in descending order. This helps in getting the maximum value first when picking items.

3. **Pick Items with Constraints:**
   - Use a dictionary to track the count of items picked per label.
   - Iterate through the sorted list and pick items until you reach `num_wanted` or you can't pick any more items without exceeding the `use_limit`.

### Code
Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int largestValsFromLabels(std::vector<int>& values, std::vector<int>& labels, int num_wanted, int use_limit) {
        // Combine values and labels
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> items;
        for (size_t i = 0; i < values.size(); ++i) {
            items.push_back({values[i], labels[i]});
        }
        
        // Sort the combined list by values in descending order
        std::sort(items.begin(), items.end(), [](auto& a, auto& b) {
            return a.first > b.first;
        });
        
        // Result calculation with constraints
        std::unordered_map<int, int> labelCount;
        int totalValue = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (const auto& item : items) {
            if (count == num_wanted) {
                break;
            }
            
            int value = item.first;
            int label = item.second;
            
            if (labelCount[label] < use_limit) {
                totalValue += value;
                labelCount[label]++;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return totalValue;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the list of `n` items takes \(O(n \log n)\).
  
- **Selection:** 
  - Selecting items involves a single pass through the sorted list, which is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \(O(n \log n)\).
