[Leetcode 963. Minimum Area Rectangle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l963)
## Problem Statement

Given a set of points in a 2D plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed by any four points (with sides not necessarily parallel to the x and y axes). If there isn't any rectangle possible, return 0.

### Example
```
Input: [[1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 2.00000
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - How many points are there? 
    - What is the range of coordinates for each point?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the result be returned as a floating-point number value with exact precision (like 2.00000)?
    
3. **Format**:
    - Are there any restrictions on the combinations of points considered (e.g., minimum distance between points)?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, you need to:

1. **Identify Valid Rectangles**:
    - Utilize the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
    - For every pair of points, consider them as potential diagonals of a rectangle.
    - Calculate the possible centers and half diagonal lengths, and store these in a map.

2. **Calculate Minimum Area**:
    - If two pairs of points share the same center and have the same half-diagonal length, they form a rectangle.
    - Calculate the area for such combinations and update the minimum area.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Handle scenarios where fewer than 4 points are provided or no valid rectangles are formed.

## Code

Here is a C++ implementation to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

double minAreaFreeRect(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
    int N = points.size();
    if (N < 4) return 0;

    unordered_map<string, vector<pair<pair<int, int>, pair<int, int>>>> map;

    // Loop over pairs of points and consider them as potential diagonals of a rectangle.
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < N; j++) {
            int x1 = points[i][0], y1 = points[i][1];
            int x2 = points[j][0], y2 = points[j][1];
            // Calculate the center and half-diagonal length
            int cx = x1 + x2, cy = y1 + y2;
            long long d2 = (long long)(x2 - x1) * (x2 - x1) + (long long)(y2 - y1) * (y2 - y1);
            string key = to_string(cx) + "," + to_string(cy) + "|" + to_string(d2);
            map[key].emplace_back(points[i], points[j]);
        }
    }

    double minArea = numeric_limits<double>::max();
    bool found = false;

    // Identify valid rectangles and calculate their area
    for (auto it = map.begin(); it != map.end(); ++it) {
        const vector<pair<pair<int, int>, pair<int, int>>>& candidates = it->second;
        int m = candidates.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < m; j++) {
                auto [p1, p2] = candidates[i];
                auto [p3, p4] = candidates[j];
                double area = sqrt(pow(p1.first - p3.first, 2) + pow(p1.second - p3.second, 2)) * 
                              sqrt(pow(p1.first - p4.first, 2) + pow(p1.second - p4.second, 2));
                minArea = min(minArea, area);
                found = true;
            }
        }
    }

    return found ? minArea : 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
   - The code involves nested loops over the set of points, resulting in O(N^2) pairs.
   - Each insertion and lookup in the unordered_map is average O(1), so handling N pairs leads to O(N^2) operations overall.

- **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is primarily due to storing the pairs in the unordered_map, which is also O(N^2) in the worst case.

This completes the solution for finding the minimum area of a rectangle formed by any four points in a 2D plane.
