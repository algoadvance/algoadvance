[Leetcode 1436. Destination City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1436)
## Problem Statement

You are given the `paths` array where `paths[i] = [cityA_i, cityB_i]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityA_i` to `cityB_i`. 

Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo"
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: All possible trips are: 
"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A". 
"A" is the only city with no outgoing paths.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
Output: "Z"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that there is exactly one destination city?
   - Yes, we can assume there is exactly one destination city.
   
2. How large can the `paths` array be?
   - The `paths` array can have up to 100 paths.

3. Are there any constraints on the names of the cities?
   - No specific constraints, names can be any string.

## Strategy

1. Use a set to store all the cities that have outgoing paths.
2. Traverse through the `paths` array to add all cities that appear as the starting city of a path to the set.
3. Traverse through the `paths` array again and for each destination city, check if it is not in the set of cities with outgoing paths. The first such city found is our destination city.

## Code

Here is the C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

string destCity(vector<vector<string>>& paths) {
    unordered_set<string> outgoing;
    
    // Add all cities that have outgoing paths to the set
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
        outgoing.insert(path[0]);
    }
    
    // Find the city that does not have any outgoing path
    for (const auto& path : paths) {
        if (outgoing.find(path[1]) == outgoing.end()) {
            return path[1];
        }
    }
    
    // This return statement will never be reached because there is
    // always one destination city according to the problem statement
    return "";
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of paths. 
  - This is because we traverse the list of paths twice: once to populate the outgoing set, and once to find the destination city.
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage in the `unordered_set`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution that runs in linear time and uses additional space proportional to the number of cities with outgoing paths.
