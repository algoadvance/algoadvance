[Leetcode 2580. Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2580)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` where `ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents an interval that ranges from `start_i` to `end_i` (inclusive).

You need to determine the number of ways to group the ranges such that:

1. Each interval in a single group overlaps with at least one other interval in that group.

Return the total number of possible groups.

A range `[start1, end1]` overlaps with `[start2, end2]` if `max(start1, start2) <= min(end1, end2)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint of the `ranges` array?**
   - This will help determine the efficiency needed for the solution.
   
2. **Can the ranges contain negative numbers or zero?**
   - Clarifies any constraints related to the values of `start_i` and `end_i`.

For this problem, we will assume that the range array `ranges` can be reasonably large (up to 10^4 elements), and the values in each range are valid integers within a standard range (-10^6 to 10^6).

### Strategy

1. **Sort Ranges**: First, sort the ranges based on their start points. This simplifies merging intervals.
2. **Merge Intervals**: Use a merged list to create groups where intervals overlap.
3. **Count Groups**: As intervals can only belong to one group if they overlap, each resulting merged interval represents one group.
4. **Return Result**: The number of merged intervals (groups) is the result.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the intervals will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- Merging intervals will take \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges(vector<vector<int>>& ranges) {
        if (ranges.empty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Step 1: Sort ranges based on the starting points
        sort(ranges.begin(), ranges.end());
        
        // Step 2: Initialize merged intervals
        vector<vector<int>> merged;
        
        for (const auto& range : ranges) {
            if (merged.empty() || merged.back()[1] < range[0]) {
                // No overlap, start a new group
                merged.push_back(range);
            } else {
                // Merge the current range into the last group
                merged.back()[1] = max(merged.back()[1], range[1]);
            }
        }
        
        // The size of merged intervals is the number of groups
        return merged.size();
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> ranges = {{1, 3}, {2, 6}, {8, 10}, {15, 18}};
    cout << "Number of groups: " << sol.countWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges(ranges) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting the intervals**: Ensures intervals that could potentially be merged come in sequence.
2. **Merging Intervals**: If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in `merged`, extend the last interval.
3. **Counting Groups**: The number of merged intervals left indicates non-overlapping groups.

This solution is efficient and ensures that all overlapping intervals are counted correctly.
