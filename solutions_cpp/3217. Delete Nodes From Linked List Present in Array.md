[Leetcode 3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3217)
## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list and an integer array `nums` which contains a subset of the linked list's values. You need to delete all the nodes in the linked list that are present in `nums` and return the head of the modified linked list.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if all nodes are deleted?**
   - If all nodes are deleted, you should return `nullptr` or `NULL`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the linked list or `nums` array?**
   - Typically, the problem constraints would be mentioned, but for now, let's assume that both the linked list and the `nums` array can be of reasonable sizes that fit in memory.

3. **Can the `nums` array contain duplicate values?**
   - Usually, `nums` contains unique values as it's referred to as a "subset." Assume the values are unique unless otherwise stated.

4. **Is the linked list singly or doubly linked?**
   - Assume it is a singly linked list unless specified otherwise.

## Strategy

1. **Use a HashSet:**
   - Store the values of `nums` into a `std::unordered_set` for O(1) average time complexity lookups.
2. **Traverse the Linked List:**
   - Iterate through the linked list and check if the current node's value exists in the `unordered_set`.
   - If it exists, modify the pointers to bypass the node, effectively deleting it.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The head node itself might need to be deleted, so start with a dummy node to simplify edge cases handling.

## Code

Below is the C++ implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteNodes(ListNode* head, std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        ListNode dummy(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode* prev = &dummy;
        ListNode* current = head;

        while (current != nullptr) {
            if (numSet.find(current->val) != numSet.end()) {
                prev->next = current->next; // Delete the node
            } else {
                prev = current;
            }
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Constructing the unordered_set from `nums` takes O(m) time if `m` is the size of the `nums` array.
  - Traversing the linked list takes O(n) time if `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The `unordered_set` used for storing `nums` takes O(m) space.
  - No additional space is used besides the input data, so the space complexity is O(m).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient both in terms of time and space, making it suitable for large datasets.
