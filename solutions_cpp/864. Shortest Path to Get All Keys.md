[Leetcode 864. Shortest Path to Get All Keys](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l864)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid `grid` where:
- Each cell of `grid` represents either an empty cell `'.'`, a wall `'#'`, a user start point `'@'`, a key (lowercase letter), or a lock (uppercase letter).

You start at the start point, and you need to determine the shortest path in moves to collect all keys and return to the start point. Every cell you walk over must be accessible and not a wall.

Note:
- You cannot walk over a wall.
- You cannot walk over a lock unless you have the corresponding key.
- Every key and every lock has a distinct letter associated.

Return **the minimum number of moves** to collect all keys and return to the start point. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if the grid is empty?**
   - It is assumed that the grid will always have at least the start point `'@'`.
   
2. **What is the maximum size of the grid?**
   - There is typically a reasonable constraint specified (e.g., `m, n <= 30`).

3. **Can there be multiple start points?**
   - No, there is only one start point `'@'`.

4. **Is there a guarantee that each key has a corresponding lock?**
   - Yes, for every key `'a'` there is a corresponding lock `'A'`.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach extended to include the bitmasking technique to manage keys collection state. Here's the overall plan:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Identify the starting position.
   - Identify all keys to determine the final state when all keys are collected.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Use a queue to manage the BFS along with storing the position and keys collected so far (using bitmasking).
   - Track visited states (position and keys collected) to avoid reprocessing.

3. **Processing**:
   - From the current position, attempt to move in all four possible directions.
   - If a key is found, update the keys collected bitmask.
   - If a lock is encountered, only move past it if the corresponding key has been collected.

4. **Termination**:
   - If all keys have been collected and the start point is reached, record the number of moves.
   - If the queue is exhausted without having collected all keys, return `-1`.

This strategy ensures an optimal solution leveraging BFS which inherently finds the shortest path.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

struct State {
    int x, y, keys, steps;
};

int shortestPathAllKeys(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    int allKeys = 0;
    State start;

    // Find starting point and total number of keys needed
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '@') {
                start = {i, j, 0, 0};
            } else if (grid[i][j] >= 'a' && grid[i][j] <= 'f') {
                allKeys |= (1 << (grid[i][j] - 'a'));
            }
        }
    }

    queue<State> que;
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    que.push(start);
    visited.insert(to_string(start.x) + "," + to_string(start.y) + "," + to_string(start.keys));
    
    // Directions for moving up, down, left, right
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    while (!que.empty()) {
        State curr = que.front();
        que.pop();

        // If current state has collected all keys, return steps
        if (curr.keys == allKeys) {
            return curr.steps;
        }

        for (auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = curr.x + dir.first;
            int ny = curr.y + dir.second;
            int nkeys = curr.keys;

            // Skip invalid positions
            if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n || grid[nx][ny] == '#') {
                continue;
            }

            char cell = grid[nx][ny];
            
            // If it's a key
            if (cell >= 'a' && cell <= 'f') {
                nkeys |= (1 << (cell - 'a'));
            }
            
            // If it's a lock
            if (cell >= 'A' && cell <= 'F' && !(nkeys & (1 << (cell - 'A')))) {
                continue;  // If we do not have the corresponding key, skip
            }
 
            string new_state = to_string(nx) + "," + to_string(ny) + "," + to_string(nkeys);

            // If we haven't visited this state, add to queue
            if (visited.find(new_state) == visited.end()) {
                visited.insert(new_state);
                que.push({nx, ny, nkeys, curr.steps + 1});
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;  // If all possible states are exhausted and we don't have all keys
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<char>> grid = {
        {'@', '.', '.', '#', 'B', 'b'},
        {'.', '#', '.', '.', 'A', '.'},
        {'.', '.', '#', 'a', '#', '.'}
    };

    cout << shortestPathAllKeys(grid) << endl;  // Output expected: 8
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity in the worst case scenario is `O(m * n * 2^k)`, where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `k` is the number of keys. Each position with each possible key set state can be visited in the BFS traversal. This ensures that our approach is efficient yet comprehensive for typical grid constraints.
