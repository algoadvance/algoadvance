[Leetcode 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l898)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to find the number of distinct values that can be obtained by performing bitwise OR on all subarrays of a given array.

### Example:
**Input:**
```
A = [1, 2, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
6
```
**Explanation:**
The subarrays are [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 4], [2], [2, 4], [4]. Their corresponding bitwise ORs are 1, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4. The distinct values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the length of array \( A \)?**
   - The length \( n \) of the array can go up to 5000.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the values within the array \( A \)?**
   - The values within the array are non-negative integers and within the range [0, 10^9].

3. **Is performance a concern due to potentially large values in the input array?**
   - Yes, performance is a key factor since the size of the array can be up to 5000, making a direct brute-force approach inefficient.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a set to keep track of all distinct values obtained by bitwise OR operations on subarrays.
   - Use two additional sets to keep track of current OR values and new OR values generated in each iteration.

2. **Logic:**
   - Iterate through each element in the array.
   - For each element, update the new set of OR values by OR-ing the current element with each element in the current set of OR values.
   - Also, add the element itself to cater to single-element subarrays.
   - Update the overall set of distinct OR values.

3. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Using sets ensures that only unique values are retained without duplicates.
   - This approach minimizes redundant computations compared to checking every possible subarray individually.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int subarrayBitwiseORs(std::vector<int>& A) {
    std::unordered_set<int> res;
    std::unordered_set<int> cur;
    
    for (int num : A) {
        std::unordered_set<int> next;
        next.insert(num);
        
        for (int val : cur) {
            next.insert(num | val);
        }
        
        cur = std::move(next);
        
        for (int val : cur) {
            res.insert(val);
        }
    }
    
    return res.size();
}
```

## Explanation:

- Initialize `res` to store all distinct OR results and `cur` to store current OR results.
- For every number `num` in the array:
  - Create a new set `next` and initialize it with `num` (this handles the single-element subarray case).
  - For each value in `cur`, compute the OR with `num` and add it to `next`.
  - Update `cur` to be `next`, effectively shifting the currently considered subarray window.
  - Add all values in `cur` to the result set `res`.
- At the end, `res` contains all distinct OR values from subarrays.

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is as follows:
- Let \( n \) be the length of the array.
- In the worst case, every OR operation results in a new unique value, leading to \( O(n^2) \) overall operations because each number can be involved in multiple subarray OR computations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \( O(n^2) \). This should be efficient enough for \( n \) up to 5000.
