[Leetcode 1839. Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1839)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1839: **Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order**

Given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters, your task is to find the length of the longest substring that contains only the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and these vowels appear in alphabetical order (i.e., a substring where the vowels appear in sequence 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').

### Example:
```cpp
Input: word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"
Output: 13
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaaaeiiiiouu".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - **A:** Yes, `1 <= word.length <= 100000`.

2. **Q:** Do we consider non-vowel characters in the word?
   - **A:** No, we are only interested in substrings consisting of vowels in alphabetical order.

3. **Q:** Can we assume the input string only contains lowercase English letters?
   - **A:** Yes, the input string consists of lowercase English letters only.

### Strategy
The plan to solve the problem is:
1. Traverse through the input string while maintaining the current length of a substring that follows the required vowel order.
2. Keep a variable to track the last seen vowel so that every new character can be compared to see if it extends the current valid substring.
3. Whenever an invalid character is found, or the sequence breaks, reset the tracking variables.
4. Keep updating the maximum length as you find valid substrings.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int longestBeautifulSubstring(string word) {
    int n = word.length();
    // Variables to keep track of the longest valid substring.
    int maxLength = 0;
    int curLength = 0;
    // Variable to track the number of distinct vowels in the current valid substring.
    int vowelCount = 0;
    // Track the last valid character we've seen.
    char lastChar = ' ';

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Check if the current character extends a valid sequence.
        if (word[i] == lastChar) {
            curLength++;
        } else if (
            (lastChar == ' ' && word[i] == 'a') ||
            (lastChar == 'a' && word[i] == 'e') ||
            (lastChar == 'e' && word[i] == 'i') ||
            (lastChar == 'i' && word[i] == 'o') ||
            (lastChar == 'o' && word[i] == 'u')) {
            curLength++;
            lastChar = word[i];
            // Increment vowelCount only when we move to the next vowel in sequence.
            vowelCount++;
        } else {
            // Check if the current substring is valid and update maxLength.
            if (vowelCount == 5) {
                maxLength = max(maxLength, curLength);
            }
            // Reset counters and start a new substring if we see an 'a'.
            if (word[i] == 'a') {
                curLength = 1;
                vowelCount = 1;
                lastChar = 'a';
            } else {
                curLength = 0;
                vowelCount = 0;
                lastChar = ' ';
            }
        }
    }

    // Final check for the last substring in the string.
    if (vowelCount == 5) {
        maxLength = max(maxLength, curLength);
    }

    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    string word = "aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu";
    cout << "Longest beautiful substring length: " << longestBeautifulSubstring(word) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. The string is scanned once, making this approach linear in time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we use a fixed amount of extra space for variables regardless of the input size.

The provided code efficiently finds the length of the longest substring that satisfies the given conditions.
