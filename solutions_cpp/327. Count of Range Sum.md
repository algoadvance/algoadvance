[Leetcode 327. Count of Range Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l327)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.

A range sum is the sum of elements `nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + ... + nums[j]` for a given `i` â‰¤ `j`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the size of the input array?
   - **A:** The input array can have up to `10^4` elements.
   
2. **Q:** Can the elements in `nums` be negative?
   - **A:** Yes, elements can be negative, zero, or positive.

3. **Q:** Will the range `[lower, upper]` always be valid, i.e., `lower <= upper`?
   - **A:** Yes, it is guaranteed that `lower <= upper`.

4. **Q:** What is the expected output for an array of size 1?
   - **A:** For an array of size 1, if the element itself lies within `[lower, upper]`, the output should be 1; otherwise, it should be 0.

### Strategy

The problem requires an efficient solution because a straightforward approach of calculating range sums for all subarrays would be too slow for large input sizes (`O(n^2)` complexity). 

We can use a **modified merge sort** technique, which can count the number of valid range sums in `O(n log n)` time complexity. This approach involves:
1. Calculating the prefix sums of the array.
2. Using a modified merge sort to count the number of valid range sums during the merge process.

Here is the step-by-step strategy:
1. Compute the prefix sums of the input array.
2. Use a recursive merge sort function to count the number of range sums that fall within the specified bounds during the merge operation:
   - For each prefix sum during the merge process, determine the number of times a prefix sum from the left half can be paired with a prefix sum from the right half such that their difference lies within `[lower, upper]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int countRangeSum(std::vector<int>& nums, int lower, int upper) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        std::vector<long long> prefixSums(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        return countRangeSumRecursive(prefixSums, lower, upper, 0, n + 1);
    }

private:
    int countRangeSumRecursive(std::vector<long long>& prefixSums, int lower, int upper, int left, int right) {
        if (right - left <= 1) return 0;
        
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        int count = countRangeSumRecursive(prefixSums, lower, upper, left, mid) +
                    countRangeSumRecursive(prefixSums, lower, upper, mid, right);
        
        int j = mid, k = mid, t = mid;
        std::vector<long long> temp(right - left);
        
        for (int i = left, r = 0; i < mid; ++i, ++r) {
            while (k < right && prefixSums[k] - prefixSums[i] < lower) ++k;
            while (j < right && prefixSums[j] - prefixSums[i] <= upper) ++j;
            while (t < right && prefixSums[t] < prefixSums[i]) temp[r++] = prefixSums[t++];
            temp[r] = prefixSums[i];
            count += j - k;
        }
        
        std::copy(temp.begin(), temp.begin() + (mid - left), prefixSums.begin() + left);
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The merge sort approach sorts `n` elements in `O(n log n)` time.
- During the merge operation, the counting also takes `O(n log n)` as the merge step itself is `O(n)` and is executed `log n` times for the entire array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:

\[ O(n \log n) \]

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently even for the upper limit of the array size.
