[Leetcode 3084. Count Substrings Starting and Ending with Given Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3084)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and a character `ch`. Your task is to count how many substrings of `s` start and end with the character `ch`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input size?**
   - The typical constraints for LeetCode problems are up to \(10^5\) characters for the string length.

2. **What should be returned or printed as output?**
   - Return a single integer representing the number of substrings that start and end with the character `ch`.

3. **Does the string contain only lowercase/uppercase letters, or can it include other characters?**
   - Assume it can contain any characters for generality, but usually, these interview questions deal with lowercase and uppercase letters.

4. **Can `ch` be a character that does not appear in `s`?**
   - Yes, in such cases, the output should be 0 since there can't be any substring starting and ending with `ch`.

5. **Are there any constraints related to memory usage or time complexity?**
   - Aim for an efficient solution preferably in \(O(n)\) time complexity where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Positions of `ch`**: Traverse the string and store the indices where the character `ch` occurs.
2. **Count Substrings**:
   - For each index where `ch` occurs (`start_idx`), consider it as a starting point and find the end points (`end_idx`) that can form valid substrings.
   - If `start_idx <= end_idx` and both characters at those indices are `ch`, it forms a valid substring.
   
3. **Mathematical Summation**:
   - For each occurrence at index `i`, all substrings ending at any occurrence index `j` where `j >= i` are valid.
   - The number of substrings formed from a single `ch` position is `(total count of ch) - current_position_of_this_ch`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int countSubstringsWithGivenChar(const std::string& s, char ch) {
    std::vector<int> positions;
    
    // Collect all positions where character `ch` occurs
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == ch) {
            positions.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    int n = positions.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0; // no occurrences of `ch`
    
    // Calculate the number of valid substrings
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        count += (n - i); // Substrings starting from positions[i] to positions[n-1]
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abacaba";
    char ch = 'a';
    std::cout << "Number of substrings starting and ending with '" << ch << "': " << countSubstringsWithGivenChar(s, ch) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We perform two passes over the string: one for collecting positions of `ch` and one for summing up valid substrings. Both operations are linear in terms of the string length.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of occurrences of `ch` in the string, as we store the positions in a vector.

This approach ensures an efficient and concise solution to the problem.
