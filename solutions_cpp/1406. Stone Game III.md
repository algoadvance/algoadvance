[Leetcode 1406. Stone Game III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1406)
### Problem Statement
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an integer value. Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the row. The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones they have taken. The objective of the game is to maximize the score’s difference—Alice's score minus Bob's score.

Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if they will end up with the same score.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Order of play**: Alice always starts first, right?
2. **Input format**: What is the format of the provided stones? Is it an array of integers?
3. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the number of stones and their values?

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
   - Define a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score difference (Alice's score minus Bob's score) starting from the i-th stone.
   - Initialize a variable for the length of the stones array.
   - Iterate backwards from the last stone to the first, updating the DP array with the best possible move (taking 1, 2, or 3 stones).

### Code
Here's an implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string stoneGameIII(std::vector<int>& stoneValue) {
        int n = stoneValue.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MIN); // dp[i]: maximum score difference when starting from i-th stone
        dp[n] = 0; // Base case: no stones left means score difference is 0

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int take = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < 3 && i + k < n; ++k) {
                take += stoneValue[i + k];
                dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], take - dp[i + k + 1]);
            }
        }

        if (dp[0] > 0)
            return "Alice";
        else if (dp[0] < 0)
            return "Bob";
        else
            return "Tie";
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse the stones array once, and within each position, we consider up to 3 further positions, leading to a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use an additional DP array that scales with the input size.

This solution should effectively determine the winner of the game while taking into account optimal strategies for both players.
