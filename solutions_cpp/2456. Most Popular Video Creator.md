[Leetcode 2456. Most Popular Video Creator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2456)
Absolutely, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
The problem "Most Popular Video Creator" typically involves determining which video creators are most popular based on various metrics provided. While the exact problem from LeetCode 2456 can be interpreted in different ways, it's generally about finding creators with maximum views or likes for their videos.

Given:
- A list of video creators.
- Metrics such as number of views or likes for each video.

The goal:
- To identify which creator(s) have the highest total metrics (like views or likes).

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few points:
1. How is the input data structured? For instance, is it a list of tuples where each tuple represents a video and its creator?
2. Are views/likes integers or could they be floating-point numbers?
3. Can multiple creators have the same highest total metric, and if so, should they all be included in the output?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The input is a vector of tuples where each tuple contains a video creator's name and the number of views that video got.
- Views are integers.
- We need to return all creators who have the highest total views.

### Strategy
We'll use a hash map to store the total views for each creator:
1. Iterate through the list of videos.
2. Keep a running total of views for each creator in a hash map.
3. Find the maximum total views.
4. Collect all creators who have this maximum total.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of videos. This is because we make a single pass through the list of videos to compute total views and another pass through the hash map to find creators with the maximum views.

### Code
Here's a simple C++ code implementation for this problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to find most popular video creators based on views
vector<string> mostPopularCreators(const vector<pair<string, int>>& videos) {
    unordered_map<string, int> creatorViews;
    int maxViews = 0;

    // Step 1: Aggregate views per creator
    for (const auto& video : videos) {
        const string& creator = video.first;
        int views = video.second;

        // Increment the views for the creator
        creatorViews[creator] += views;

        // Track the maximum views
        if (creatorViews[creator] > maxViews) {
            maxViews = creatorViews[creator];
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Find all creators with the maximum views
    vector<string> result;
    for (const auto& entry : creatorViews) {
        if (entry.second == maxViews) {
            result.push_back(entry.first);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<pair<string, int>> videos = {
        {"Alice", 100},
        {"Bob", 200},
        {"Alice", 150},
        {"Bob", 50},
        {"Charlie", 200}
    };

    vector<string> result = mostPopularCreators(videos);

    cout << "Most popular video creators are: ";
    for (const string& creator : result) {
        cout << creator << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We define a hash map `creatorViews` to store the total views for each creator and an integer `maxViews` to keep track of the maximum views encountered.
2. **Aggregation**: Iterate over the list of videos and update the running total of views for each creator in `creatorViews`. Also, keep updating `maxViews` if the current creator's views exceed the current maximum.
3. **Identifying Max Views**: Iterate over the hash map to collect all creators who have the maximum views.
4. **Output**: Return the list of most popular creators.

This solution is efficient and concise, adhering to the \(O(n)\) time complexity.
