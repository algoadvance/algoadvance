[Leetcode 1797. Design Authentication Manager](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1797)
## Problem Statement

You need to design an Authentication Manager that supports the following functionalities:

1. **`AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive)`**: Constructs the AuthenticationManager instance with the `timeToLive` parameter - the time in seconds that an authentication token is valid for after its issuance.
  
2. **`void generate(string tokenId, int currentTime)`**: Generates a new token with the specified `tokenId` at the given `currentTime`. The new token will expire `timeToLive` seconds after the `currentTime`.
  
3. **`void renew(string tokenId, int currentTime)`**: Renews the unexpired token with the specified `tokenId` at the given `currentTime`. If the token does not exist or has already expired, it does nothing. If the renewal is successful, the token's expiry time should be updated to `currentTime + timeToLive`.
  
4. **`int countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime)`**: Returns the count of all unexpired tokens at the given `currentTime`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum number of tokens we can assume in the system at any given moment?
2. Should we handle edge cases like negative `currentTime` values, or can we assume all provided times are valid non-negative integers?
3. Can token IDs be considered unique strings?

Assuming reasonable constraints based on typical problem scenarios, we proceed to the implementation.

## Strategy
We will use a dictionary (or unordered_map in C++) to store tokens and their expiration times. Here's the proposed plan:

1. Use an unordered_map where the key is a `string` (the `tokenId`) and the value is an integer (expiration time).
2. For the `generate` method, insert the token with its expiration time.
3. For the `renew` method, only renew if the token exists and is not expired.
4. For the `countUnexpiredTokens` method, iterate over all tokens and count those with an expiration time greater than `currentTime`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

class AuthenticationManager {
public:
    AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) : ttl(timeToLive) {}

    void generate(std::string tokenId, int currentTime) {
        tokens[tokenId] = currentTime + ttl;
    }

    void renew(std::string tokenId, int currentTime) {
        if (tokens.find(tokenId) != tokens.end() && tokens[tokenId] > currentTime) {
            tokens[tokenId] = currentTime + ttl;
        }
    }

    int countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) {
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& token : tokens) {
            if (token.second > currentTime) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

private:
    int ttl;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> tokens;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **`generate` method**: O(1) - direct insertion into an unordered_map.
- **`renew` method**: O(1) - lookup and potential update in an unordered_map.
- **`countUnexpiredTokens` method**: O(n) - iterates over all tokens, where n is the number of tokens.

This problem assumes efficient operations due to the use of hash table (unordered_map) features provided by the C++ Standard Library for average-case constant-time complexity in insertions, deletions, and accesses.
