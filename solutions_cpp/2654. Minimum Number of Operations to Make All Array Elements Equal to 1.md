[Leetcode 2654. Minimum Number of Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to 1](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2654)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers, you need to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in `nums` equal to `1`. In each operation, you can choose a subarray and replace each element of the subarray with the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the subarray.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the length of the array:**
   - What is the range of the length of the array `nums`?
     - Let's assume `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`.

2. **Range of elements in the array:**
   - Is there a constraint on the values of the elements in `nums`?
     - Let's assume `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.

3. **Initial elements:**
   - Can the array already contain multiple `1`s initially?
   
4. **Output if the array already contains all ones:**
   - If the array already consists of all ones, should the number of operations be zero?
     - Yes.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:**
   - First, check if the entire array initially consists of all ones. If so, return `0` operations needed.

2. **GCD Utilization:**
   - If not all elements are ones, it's key to utilize the GCD concept to reduce elements to 1.
   - Traverse the array and try to find segments where a minimum GCD operation can be beneficial.

3. **Finding Minimum Operations:**
   - We will iterate through the array to find the smallest subarray that has a GCD of 1. If found, that subarray can be used to convert all its elements to `1` in a single operation.
   - If the entire array's GCD is greater than one, it's impossible to reduce any element to `1`.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - We may need a nested loop to find the GCD of subarrays.
   - Use a helper function for calculating GCD.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric> // for std::gcd

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        // Check if already all 1s
        if (all_of(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](int x) { return x == 1; })) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Find the minimum subarray length with GCD = 1
        int minOps = n; // the maximum operations would be replacing each element one by one
        bool found = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int currentGCD = nums[i];
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                currentGCD = gcd(currentGCD, nums[j]);
                if (currentGCD == 1) {
                    minOps = min(minOps, j - i);
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If no subarray with GCD = 1 found, return -1
        if (!found) return -1;
        
        // Other elements are converted to 1 in n-1 operations
        return minOps + n - 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<int> nums = {2, 6, 3, 4};
    cout << "Minimum Operations: " << solution.minOperations(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Checking all elements are 1:** O(n)
- **Nested Loop for GCD Calculation:** 
  - Worst-case scenario, the inner loop runs `(n*(n+1))/2` times, as it calculates the GCD for each subarray.
  - The GCD function itself runs in O(log(min(a,b))).

Overall, the worst-case time complexity can be approximated as **O(n^2 log(min(a,b)))**, where `n` is the size of the array and `a` and `b` are elements in the array.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

By applying this approach, you should be able to determine the minimum number of operations to make all array elements equal to 1.
