[Leetcode 1632. Rank Transform of a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1632)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `matrix`. The rank of a matrix is defined as follows:
1. The rank is an integer that represents the position of an element relative to other elements in the matrix.
2. The rank is 1-based and starts from the smallest element.
3. An element's rank is one more than the number of distinct elements that are less than it in the matrix.

Your task is to return the matrix with the rank of each element as described.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** What are the constraints on the number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) for the matrix?
   - Typically, we assume the constraints to be reasonably small for matrix problems unless otherwise specified. E.g., `1 <= m, n <= 500`.
2. **Element Range:** What are the constraints on the elements inside the matrix?
   - We assume standard integer constraints unless specified otherwise. E.g., `-10^9 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^9`.
3. **Tie Handling:** How do we handle elements with the same value?
   - Elements with the same value should get the same rank.

### Strategy

1. **Flatten and Sort the Elements:** Flatten the matrix and sort the elements to determine their ranks.
2. **Use Union-Find to Maintain Rank Constraints:** We need to apply union-find to ensure rows and columns ordering constraints are satisfied.
3. **Update Elements Based on Ranks:** Traverse the matrix and update each element based on the computed rank.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> matrixRankTransform(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        
        // Flatten and sort the elements with their original indexes
        vector<tuple<int, int, int>> elements;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                elements.emplace_back(matrix[i][j], i, j);
            }
        }
        
        sort(elements.begin(), elements.end());

        vector<int> ranks(m + n, 0);
        vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(n, 0));

        for (int i = 0; i < elements.size(); ) {
            int value = get<0>(elements[i]);
            vector<tuple<int, int, int>> group;
            
            // Collect all elements with the same value
            while (i < elements.size() && get<0>(elements[i]) == value) {
                group.push_back(elements[i]);
                i++;
            }
            
            // Disjoint set union-find initialization
            vector<int> parent(m + n);
            iota(parent.begin(), parent.end(), 0);
            vector<int> rank(m + n, 0);
            
            function<int(int)> find = [&](int x) {
                if (x == parent[x]) return x;
                return parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            };
            
            for (const auto& [val, row, col] : group) {
                int u = find(row);
                int v = find(col + m);
                if (u != v) {
                    parent[u] = v;
                    rank[v] = max(rank[v], rank[u]);
                }
            }

            // Update ranks for each group
            for (const auto& [val, row, col] : group) {
                int new_rank = rank[find(row)] + 1;
                ranks[row] = ranks[col + m] = new_rank;
                result[row][col] = new_rank;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(m * n log(m * n)):** The sorting step takes \(O(m * n \log(m * n))\).
- **O(m * n):** The union-find operations are efficiently managed with amortized time complexity.

Overall, the proposed solution efficiently handles the problem within allowable constraints.
