[Leetcode 488. Zuma Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l488)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a variation of the Zuma game. 

In this version, you have infinite colored balls in your hand, and there is a string `board` representing the initial state of the board. The balls on the board are represented by characters in `board` and are sorted from left to right and ordered by their positions. 

Different characters represent different colored balls. You may only insert a ball among the existing balls on the board (including at the very beginning and end). The goal is to clear all the balls from the board. 

You need to find the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear the board. If you cannot clear the board, return -1.

### Example:
- **Input:**
  - `board = "WRRBBW"`
  - `hand = "RB"`
- **Output:** `-1`
  
- **Input:**
  - `board = "WWRRBBWW"`
  - `hand = "WRBRW"`
- **Output:** `2`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= board.length <= 16`
- `1 <= hand.length <= 5`
- Both `board` and `hand` contain only characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are we allowed to manipulate the board after each insertion?
2. Can we insert multiple balls consecutively before clearing the board?
3. What happens when three or more consecutive balls of the same color appear? Will they be removed automatically?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we would adopt a recursive backtracking approach. Given the constraints, the board length is small enough to permit recursion with acceptable performance.

Here's the high-level strategy:
1. **Insertion and Clearing Mechanism:**
   - Insert balls from `hand` into `board` at different positions.
   - Check if inserting a ball results in three or more consecutive balls of the same color and clear those balls.
   - Repeat the clearing process as long as new sequences are formed.
   
2. **Recursive Backtracking:**
   - At each step, simulate the insertion of each ball from `hand` into each position of the `board`.
   - Use recursion to try all possible insertions.
   - Keep track of the minimum number of insertions required.

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - A helper function to clear the board by removing sequences of three or more consecutive balls.
   - A helper function to insert a ball into the board.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<string, int> memo;
    
    int findMinStep(string board, string hand) {
        int result = helper(board, hand);
        return result == INT_MAX ? -1 : result;
    }
    
    int helper(string board, string hand) {
        if (board.empty()) return 0;
        if (hand.empty()) return INT_MAX;
        string key = board + " " + hand;
        if (memo.count(key)) return memo[key];
        
        int result = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < hand.size(); ++i) {
            char ch = hand[i];
            string new_hand = hand.substr(0, i) + hand.substr(i + 1);

            for (int j = 0; j <= board.size(); ++j) {
                if (j > 0 && board[j - 1] == ch) continue; // Skip duplicates
                string new_board = board.substr(0, j) + ch + board.substr(j);
                new_board = clearBoard(new_board);

                result = min(result, 1 + helper(new_board, new_hand));
            }
        }
        
        memo[key] = result;
        return result;
    }
    
    string clearBoard(string board) {
        int n = board.size();
        while (true) {
            bool found = false;
            for (int i = 0, j; i < n; ++i) {
                j = i;
                while (j < n && board[j] == board[i]) j++;
                if (j - i >= 3) {
                    board = board.substr(0, i) + board.substr(j);
                    n = board.size();
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) break;
        }
        return board;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string board = "WWRRBBWW";
    string hand = "WRBRW";
    int result = sol.findMinStep(board, hand);
    cout << "Minimum steps: " << result << endl; // Output: 2
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is challenging to analyze precisely due to the recursive nature and multiple recursive calls with reducing `board` and `hand` sizes. However, we can say that due to memoization, the recursion ensures that each unique state is computed once, which limits the exponential growth:

- `O(5^m * n^2)`, where `m` is the length of `hand` and `n` is the length of `board`. Each step involves making a decision for one of the 5 possible balls in hand, and inserting in one of n positions, then simplifying the board which may be analyzed within O(n^2) operations in worst case (considering greedy removal of elements).
