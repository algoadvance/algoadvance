[Leetcode 2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2965)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` containing `n` integers where the integers are in the range `[1, n]`. One number appears **once** (missing number) and another number appears **twice** (repeated number). Your task is to find these two numbers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the typical size of the array `nums` we should expect?
2. **Range of Values**: Are the values in the array strictly within the range `[1, n]`?
3. **Output Format**: Should the result be returned as a vector/array or is any other format acceptable?
  
Assuming it's a typical LeetCode medium level problem:
- The array size `n` can be at most \(10^4\).
- The values are guaranteed to be within the range `[1, n]`.
- Return the result as a `vector` of integers in C++.

### Strategy
We need to solve two parts of the problem: identifying the missing number and the repeated number. Let's utilize the properties of the sum and squared sum of the first `n` natural numbers for this.

1. **Sum Property**:
   - Sum of the first `n` natural numbers: \( S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \)
   - Sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers: \( P = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \)
   
2. **Given the array `nums`**:
   - Let `sum(nums)` be the sum of elements in the array.
   - Let `sum(nums^2)` be the sum of the squares of elements in the array.

3. **Equations**:
   - \( \text{repeated} - \text{missing} = \text{sum(nums)} - S \)
   - \( \text{repeated}^2 - \text{missing}^2 = \text{sum(nums^2)} - P \)
   - This simplifies to \( (\text{repeated} + \text{missing}) \times (\text{repeated} - \text{missing}) = \text{sum(nums^2)} - P \)

By solving these equations, we can find the repeated and missing values.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findErrorNums(vector<int>& nums) {
    long long n = nums.size();
    long long sum_n = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    long long sum_n2 = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6;

    long long sum_nums = 0, sum_nums2 = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum_nums += num;
        sum_nums2 += (long long)num * num;
    }

    long long diff = sum_nums - sum_n; // repeated - missing
    long long sq_diff = sum_nums2 - sum_n2; // repeated^2 - missing^2

    // Solving the equations:
    // repeated + missing = sq_diff / diff
    long long sum = sq_diff / diff;

    int repeated = (diff + sum) / 2;
    int missing = sum - repeated;

    return {repeated, missing};
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 2, 4};
    vector<int> result = findErrorNums(nums);
    cout << "Repeated: " << result[0] << ", Missing: " << result[1] << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate over the array to calculate the sums and the squared sums which takes linear time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for storing the sums and differences.

This method leverages mathematical properties and is efficient for the given problem constraints.
