[Leetcode 3260. Find the Largest Palindrome Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3260)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `k`, write a function that finds the largest palindrome that is divisible by `k`. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. You need to return this number or `-1` if no such palindrome exists.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of k:** What are the constraints on the value of `k`? (Assuming `1 <= k <= 10^6` based on typical ranges on such problems.)
2. **Result Range:** What is the maximum size of palindrome we are looking for? (Considering typical constraints, let's take it as `10^8` or `10^9`).
3. **Return Value:** Do we return the largest palindrome or `-1` if no palindrome is found within reasonable bounds?

## Strategy

1. **Reverse String Method:** Generate palindromes by reversing strings, starting from the highest possible values within constraints.
2. **Check Divisibility:** Check if the generated palindrome is divisible by `k`.
3. **Iterative Reduction:** Start from the highest possible values and iterate downwards to ensure we get the largest palindrome.

### Steps

1. Define a function `isPalindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome.
2. Define a main function `largestPalindromeDivisibleByK` that:
   - Starts checking from the highest possible number within constraints.
   - Form a palindrome by reversing the number and appending it to itself.
   - Check if the formed palindrome is divisible by `k`.
   - Return the first palindrome found or `-1` if none are found within specified constraints.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

bool isPalindrome(int num) {
    std::string s = std::to_string(num);
    std::string rev_s = s;
    std::reverse(rev_s.begin(), rev_s.end());
    return s == rev_s;
}

int largestPalindromeDivisibleByK(int k) {
    // Starting from largest possible palindromic base (999999)
    for (int i = 999999; i >= 1; --i) {
        std::string s = std::to_string(i);
        std::string rev_s = s;
        std::reverse(rev_s.begin(), rev_s.end());

        // Generate the full palindrome
        std::string candidate_str = s + rev_s;
        long long candidate = stoll(candidate_str);
        
        // Check if it's divisible by k
        if (candidate % k == 0) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    int k;
    std::cout << "Enter value of k: ";
    std::cin >> k;
    int result = largestPalindromeDivisibleByK(k);
    std::cout << "Largest Palindrome Divisible by " << k << " is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is determined primarily by the loop that generates potential palindromic numbers and checks their divisibility by `k`. Given the loop runs from `999999` down to `1`, the worst-case scenario would involve examining up to 1 million numbers. Each check involves generating a palindrome string and checking for divisibility, both of which are efficient operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(n*m)`, where `n` is the number of iterations (up to 1 million) and `m` is the time to generate and check each palindrome (constant-time operations).

In practical terms, the solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
