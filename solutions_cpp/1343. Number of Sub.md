[Leetcode 1343. Number of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1343)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the number of sub-arrays of size `k` and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Values:** What is the expected range of values for the elements in the array `arr`?
   - Typical integer range.
2. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the array `arr` and the values of `k` and `threshold`?
   - 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
   - 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
   - 1 <= k <= arr.length
   - 0 <= threshold <= 10^4

3. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if no subarray meets the criteria?
   - Return 0.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr, int k, int threshold) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int requiredSum = k * threshold;
        int currentSum = accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + k, 0);
        int result = 0;

        if(currentSum >= requiredSum) {
            result++;
        }

        for(int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            currentSum = currentSum - arr[i - k] + arr[i];
            if(currentSum >= requiredSum) {
                result++;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Accumulate Initial Sum**: Leverage `<numeric>`'s `accumulate` function to compute the sum of the first subarray of size `k`.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
    - Calculate the sum of each subsequent subarray by subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the element that is entering the window.
    - If at any point the current sum of the elements is greater than or equal to `k * threshold`, increment the result counter.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k` is larger than the length of the array (though constraints ensure this won't happen), or if no subarray satisfies the condition, the function returns 0.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The algorithm traverses the array exactly once, making it efficient with a linear time complexity. Calculating the initial sum takes O(k) time, and adjusting the sum for the sliding window also operates in O(n - k), totaling to O(n).

By keeping the code clear, leveraging built-in functions, and applying efficient techniques such as sliding window, we ensure both simplicity and optimal performance.
