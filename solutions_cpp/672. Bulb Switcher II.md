[Leetcode 672. Bulb Switcher II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l672)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` bulbs in a row numbered from `1` to `n`. Initially, all the bulbs are turned on. You are given a number `m`, which represents the number of operations. You can perform one of the following operations exactly once on any bulb:

1. Flip all the bulbs.
2. Flip every second bulb.
3. Flip every third bulb.
4. Flip bulbs with positions that are 1 modulo 3 (1, 4, 7, ...).

Given `n` and `m`, return the number of different possible states of the n bulbs after performing all `m` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What do the operations mean by "flip"?**
   - "Flip" means changing the state of the bulb: if the bulb is on, it turns off; if it is off, it turns on.

2. **How does the initial state affect the result?**
   - Initially, all bulbs are turned on.

3. **What constraints are on `n` and `m`?**
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= m <= 1000`, but for practical problem-solving, there are much smaller constraints due to combinatorial limits.

4. **What is the smallest and largest possible value for the primary elements (n and m)?**
   - The smallest value is `1` and the largest is generally `1000` for `n` and `m`.

### Strategy

1. **Explore Patterns:**
   - Due to periodic flipping, patterns will emerge which simplify the problem.
   - For large values of `n` (more than 6), the pattern starts to repeat, so we don't need to worry about `n` greater than 6.
   - When `n` is greater than 6, we can reduce `n` to 6 because all bulbs after the 6th bulb will encounter similar shifts and flips as the first 6 bulbs.

2. **Cases Based on `m`:**
   - When looking at the number of different states possible, we realize that beyond 4 operations, the state space saturates and different operations might not create new distinct states.
   - Thus, we focus mainly on the 4 operations leading to these primary cases:
     - `m == 0`: Only 1 state (initial).
     - `m == 1`: Up to 4 distinct states.
     - `m == 2`: Up to 7 distinct states.
     - `m >= 3`: All possible states (8 distinct states with n reduced to 6).

### Code

Let's implement the above logic with C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int flipLights(int n, int m) {
    // Simplify the problem by reducing n to max 6
    if (n > 6) n = 6;
    
    unordered_set<vector<int>> states;
    
    // Explanation based on `n` and `m`:
    if (m == 0) return 1; // No operations => 1 state
    
    if (m == 1) {
        if (n == 1) return 2; // All on or all off 
        if (n == 2) return 3; // 11, 00, 10 (or 01)
        return 4; // max for up to 6 bulbs
    }
    
    if (m == 2) {
        if (n == 1) return 2; // All on or all off 
        if (n == 2) return 4; // more combinations 11, 00, 10, 01
        return 7;
    }
    
    if (m >= 3) {
        if (n == 1) return 2;  // All on or all off 
        if (n == 2) return 4;  // max for 2 bulbs
        return 8;
    }
    
    return 8; // Simplification for any case not directly matched.
}

int main() {
    // Example test cases
    cout << flipLights(1, 1) << endl;     // Output: 2
    cout << flipLights(2, 1) << endl;     // Output: 3
    cout << flipLights(3, 1) << endl;     // Output: 4
    cout << flipLights(1, 0) << endl;     // Output: 1
    cout << flipLights(1, 2) << endl;     // Output: 2
    cout << flipLights(2, 2) << endl;     // Output: 4
    cout << flipLights(3, 2) << endl;     // Output: 7
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(1)` because it does a constant-time calculation based on the given criteria.
- The space complexity is also `O(1)` as we store a limited number of states.

This solution efficiently handles the constraints and gives the correct number of possible states for the bulbs after `m` operations.
