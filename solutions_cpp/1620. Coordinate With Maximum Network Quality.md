[Leetcode 1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1620)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `towers`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the coordinates `(xi, yi)` of the i-th cell tower and its quality factor `qi`. You are also given an integer `radius` denoting the distance within which a tower's signal can be perceived. The signal received by a tower at a distance `d` is calculated as:

\[ \text{Signal} = \left\lfloor \frac{q_i}{1 + d} \right\rfloor \]

where `d` is the Euclidean distance between the coordinate `(x, y)` and `(xi, yi)`, and the signal strength must be considered only if `d` is less than or equal to the `radius`.

Construct the coordinate `(x, y)` which has the maximum network quality. If there are multiple coordinates with the same quality, choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Coordinates:**
    - Can coordinates of towers be negative, or are they always non-negative?
    
    **Answer:** Coordinates can be any integer values.

2. **Number of Towers:**
    - Is there a limit to the number of towers we might expect?
    
    **Answer:** Constraints will ensure that the problem is solvable within reasonable limits.

3. **Radius:**
    - Can the radius be zero, effectively meaning that no signal can be received?
    
    **Answer:** Yes, but in such cases, the maximum network quality will be zero.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
    - Loop through a range of potential coordinates `(x, y)`.
    - For each coordinate, calculate the total network quality considering all towers.
    - Compare and track the coordinates with the highest network quality.
    - Ensure to stay within the radius constraint when calculating signal contributions.

2. **Range of Search:**
    - Based on the coordinate values given in the towers array, define the boundaries for `(x, y)` search. Since all contributions are most influential nearest to the coordinates, we don't need to search infinitely far.

3. **Distance and Signal Calculation:**
    - Use the Euclidean distance formula to compute the distance between coordinates.
    - Sum up the network quality for every possible coordinate and track the best one.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> bestCoordinate(vector<vector<int>>& towers, int radius) {
        int maxQuality = 0;
        vector<int> bestCoord = {0, 0};
        
        int maxX = INT_MIN, maxY = INT_MIN;
        int minX = INT_MAX, minY = INT_MAX;
        
        // Determine the bounds of our search space
        for (auto& tower : towers) {
            int x = tower[0];
            int y = tower[1];
            maxX = max(maxX, x);
            maxY = max(maxY, y);
            minX = min(minX, x);
            minY = min(minY, y);
        }
        
        // Search within the defined boundaries
        for (int x = minX; x <= maxX; ++x) {
            for (int y = minY; y <= maxY; ++y) {
                int currentQuality = 0;
                
                for (auto& tower : towers) {
                    int tx = tower[0];
                    int ty = tower[1];
                    int q = tower[2];
                    
                    double distance = sqrt((tx - x) * (tx - x) + (ty - y) * (ty - y));
                    if (distance <= radius) {
                        currentQuality += floor(q / (1 + distance));
                    }
                }
                
                if (currentQuality > maxQuality) {
                    maxQuality = currentQuality;
                    bestCoord = {x, y};
                } else if (currentQuality == maxQuality && make_pair(x, y) < make_pair(bestCoord[0], bestCoord[1])) {
                    bestCoord = {x, y};
                }
            }
        }
        
        return bestCoord;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Loop through coordinates:** \(O((x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min}))\)
- **Loop through towers for each coordinate:** \(O(T)\), where \(T\) is the number of towers.

So, the overall time complexity would be \(O((x_{max} - x_{min}) \times (y_{max} - y_{min}) \times T)\). This is effectively a brute force approach.

Given the constraints in competitive programming problems typically ensure feasibility, this approach should be acceptable unless specified otherwise.
