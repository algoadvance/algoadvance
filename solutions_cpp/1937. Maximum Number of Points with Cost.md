[Leetcode 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1937)
# Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i][j]` represents the number of points you can collect from cell `(i, j)`.

While traversing the grid, you can move to any cell in the next row but choosing to move diagonally incurs a cost proportional to the horizontal distance moved. Specifically, moving from cell `(i, j)` to cell `(i + 1, k)` incurs a cost of `|j - k|`.

Return the maximum number of points you can collect.

# Clarifying Questions:
1. **Dimensions**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the `points` array?
   - Usually, for competitive programming problems, 1 <= points.size(), points[0].size() <= 105.

2. **Values**: What are the value ranges for elements in the `points` array?
   - Elements can typically range from -10^5 to 10^5.

3. **Traversal**: Is it guaranteed that we can always move to the next row?
   - Yes, you can always move from a cell in the current row to any cell in the next row.

4. **Objective**:
  - Maximize the points collected while accounting for the costs incurred due to horizontal movements.

# Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to dynamically keep track of the maximum number of points that can be obtained at each cell (i, j) considering the cost of moving horizontally between columns of consecutive rows.

We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach:
1. **Initialization**: Set the first row's points as the starting values in our DP table.
2. **Transition**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in a row, we'll compute the maximum points obtainable from any cell of the previous row. This requires adjusting for costs due to horizontal movements.
   - By using two sweeps (left-to-right and right-to-left) through the previous row's DP array, we can efficiently calculate the optimal points one can gather by transitioning to a cell in the current row.
3. **Result**: The maximum value in the last row of the DP table will give the result.

# Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maxPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int m = points.size(), n = points[0].size();
        vector<long long> prev(n), curr(n);
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            prev[j] = points[0][j];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            vector<long long> leftMax(n), rightMax(n);
            
            leftMax[0] = prev[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                leftMax[j] = max(leftMax[j - 1], prev[j] - j);
            }
            
            rightMax[n - 1] = prev[n - 1] - (n - 1);
            for (int j = n - 2; j >= 0; --j) {
                rightMax[j] = max(rightMax[j + 1], prev[j] + j);
            }
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                curr[j] = max(leftMax[j] + j, rightMax[j] - j) + points[i][j];
            }
            
            prev.swap(curr);
        }
        
        return *max_element(prev.begin(), prev.end());
    }
};
```

# Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we are essentially iterating over each element of the matrix and performing constant-time operations for each element.

The space complexity is `O(n)` since we maintain only two arrays of size `n` (previous and current rows).

This solution efficiently computes the maximum points while handling the transition costs between columns.
