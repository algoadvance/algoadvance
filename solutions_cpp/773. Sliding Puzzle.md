[Leetcode 773. Sliding Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l773)
Sure, let's break down solving the LeetCode problem #773: Sliding Puzzle.

### Problem Statement
You are given a 2x3 board of characters representing a sliding puzzle, where a `0` represents an empty space you can move tiles into. You need to determine the fewest number of moves required to solve the puzzle. The puzzle is considered solved when the board is in the order: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]`.

The allowed moves are to slide any adjacent tile into the empty space. Your output should be the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle, or `-1` if it cannot be solved.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:**
   - Is the input always a valid 2x3 board containing digits `0` to `5`?
     - Yes.

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should we return the number of moves or a specific message for unsolvable cases?
     - Return `-1` if the puzzle can't be solved.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The board is always a 2x3 grid.
   - The moves are done by sliding tiles into the position of the empty slot (`0`).

### Strategy
This problem can be solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm since BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here, each board configuration is a node, and moving a tile corresponds to an edge.

Steps:
1. **Convert the Board to a String:** Since we deal with permutations, transforming the 2D board into a 1D string helps in easy comparison and hashing.
2. **Define Possible Moves:** Determine the possible moves for the empty slot depending on its current position.
3. **Use BFS:** Use a queue to explore all possible board configurations by performing valid moves. Keep track of visited configurations to avoid redundant processing.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int slidingPuzzle(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        string goal = "123450";           // Target configuration
        string start = "";                // Start from given board configuration
        for (const auto& row : board) {
            for (int num : row) {
                start += to_string(num);
            }
        }

        // Possible moves based on the index of the '0' in the 1D string representation
        vector<vector<int>> moves = {
            {1, 3},        // for index 0
            {0, 2, 4},     // for index 1
            {1, 5},        // for index 2
            {0, 4},        // for index 3
            {1, 3, 5},     // for index 4
            {2, 4}         // for index 5
        };

        // BFS initialization
        queue<string> q;
        unordered_set<string> visited;  // set to keep visited nodes
        q.push(start);
        visited.insert(start);
        int steps = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                string cur = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                // If the current configuration is the goal, return the number of steps.
                if (cur == goal) {
                    return steps;
                }
                
                // Find the position of '0' in the current configuration.
                int zeroPos = cur.find('0');

                // Explore all possible moves
                for (int move : moves[zeroPos]) {
                    string newBoard = cur;
                    swap(newBoard[zeroPos], newBoard[move]);
                    if (visited.find(newBoard) == visited.end()) {
                        q.push(newBoard);
                        visited.insert(newBoard);
                    }
                }
            }
            ++steps;
        }

        return -1;  // If the board is unsolvable
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of possible states of the board (720) and \(E\) is the number of edges (moves). Since we are dealing with BFS on permutations of 6 elements, the upper bound for V is \(6!\) (720).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(V)\) for storing the visited configurations and queue.

This approach ensures that all possible configurations are explored in the shortest path manner, providing the minimum number of moves or determining if it's unsolvable.
