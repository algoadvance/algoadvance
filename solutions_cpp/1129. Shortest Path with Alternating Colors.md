[Leetcode 1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1129)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an edge list representing a directed graph, where each edge is either red or blue. Nodes are indexed from 0 to n-1. You need to find the length of the shortest path from node 0 to each node, where the path alternates in colors (e.g., red-blue-red or blue-red-blue). If such a path does not exist for a node, return -1 for that node.

The input is given in three arrays:
- `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes.
- `redEdges`: A list of pairs representing the red edges.
- `blueEdges`: A list of pairs representing the blue edges.

The output should be an array of integers where the value at the i-th index represents the shortest alternating path to node `i` from node `0`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the nodes uniquely identified by integers from 0 to n-1?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Can there be self-loops or multiple edges?**
   - The problem should ideally avoid multiple edges of the same color between the same pair of nodes, but if present, the algorithm should handle these gracefully. Self-loops are generally not useful in shortest path computations and can be ignored.

3. **Should the solution handle disconnected components?**
   - Yes, if there is no alternating path to a specific node, the result for that node should be -1.

4. **Can the graph be cyclic?**
   - Yes, the graph can contain cycles.

### Strategy:

We can solve this problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, considering the alternating color constraint. 

Hereâ€™s the high-level approach:
1. **Graph Representation**: Use two separate adjacency lists for red and blue edges.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Use a queue to perform BFS. The queue will store tuples (current_node, current_distance, last_edge_color).
3. **Handling Visits**: Use a 3D array or two 2D arrays to keep track of visited nodes with the color constraint to avoid re-processing the same state.
4. **Processing Nodes**: For each node, alternate the color of the edge as we expand the path from the current node.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
#include <array>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestAlternatingPaths(int n, vector<vector<int>>& redEdges, vector<vector<int>>& blueEdges) {
        // Step 1: Create adjacency lists for red and blue edges
        vector<vector<int>> redAdj(n);
        vector<vector<int>> blueAdj(n);
        
        for(auto& edge : redEdges)
            redAdj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        
        for(auto& edge : blueEdges)
            blueAdj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        
        // BFS queue with tuple: (current_node, current_distance, last_edge_color)
        queue<tuple<int, int, int>> q;
        
        // Visited arrays for red and blue edges
        vector<vector<int>> visited(n, vector<int>(2, 0)); // visited[node][0]=red, visited[node][1]=blue
        
        // Initialize BFS
        q.push({0, 0, -1}); // -1 means no last color
        visited[0][0] = visited[0][1] = 1;
        
        // Result array
        vector<int> res(n, -1);
        res[0] = 0;
        
        // BFS loop
        while(!q.empty()) {
            auto [node, dist, lastColor] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if(lastColor != 1) { // Last color is not blue, so we take red edge
                for(int nxt : redAdj[node]) {
                    if(!visited[nxt][0]) {
                        visited[nxt][0] = 1;
                        q.push({nxt, dist + 1, 0});
                        if(res[nxt] == -1)
                            res[nxt] = dist + 1;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            if(lastColor != 0) { // Last color is not red, so we take blue edge
                for(int nxt : blueAdj[node]) {
                    if(!visited[nxt][1]) {
                        visited[nxt][1] = 1;
                        q.push({nxt, dist + 1, 1});
                        if(res[nxt] == -1)
                            res[nxt] = dist + 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + E_r + E_b)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes, \(E_r\) is the number of red edges, and \(E_b\) is the number of blue edges. Each node and edge is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + E_r + E_b)\) for storing the adjacency lists and the visited states.

This solution efficiently handles the alternating path constraints with a classic BFS strategy.
