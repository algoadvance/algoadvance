[Leetcode 3113. Find the Number of Subarrays Where Boundary Elements Are Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3113)
Sure, let's break this down step by step.

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the number of subarrays where both the first and last elements of the subarray are equal to the maximum element in that subarray.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the length range of the array `nums`?
2. Can the array contain negative numbers?
3. Are there any constraints on how large the numbers in the array can be?

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the array to find all positions where the element is the maximum value of the array.
2. For each pair of such positions `(i, j)` where `i <= j`, consider the subarray formed by the elements between these positions [i..j].
3. Count all such subarrays.

### Example
For an array `nums = [1, 3, 2, 3, 1]`, the maximum element is `3`. The positions of `3` in the array are at indices 1 and 3. The valid subarrays where the boundary elements are maximum and also maximum within the subarray are:

- Subarray [3, 2, 3] starting at index 1 and ending at index 3.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxElement = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Positions where the max element appears
        vector<int> maxPositions;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == maxElement) {
                maxPositions.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        // Counting valid subarrays
        for (int i = 0; i < maxPositions.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < maxPositions.size(); ++j) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 2, 3, 1};
//     int result = sol.numOfSubarrays(nums);
//     cout << "Number of valid subarrays: " << result << endl;
// }
```

### Time Complexity
- Finding the maximum element in the array takes O(N) time.
- Collecting positions of the maximum element in the array takes O(N) time.
- Counting valid subarrays requires looping through pairs of positions. If there are `k` positions, it results in O(k^2) subarray counts. In the worst case, `k` is equal to `N`, so it can be considered as O(N^2).

Overall, the time complexity is O(N) + O(N) + O(N^2) = O(N^2).

### Space Complexity
- Storing the positions of maximum elements requires O(N) space in the worst case.
