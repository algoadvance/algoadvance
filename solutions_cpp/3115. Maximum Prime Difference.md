[Leetcode 3115. Maximum Prime Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3115)
Sure, let's tackle the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `numbers`, your task is to find the maximum difference between any two prime numbers in the array. If the array does not contain at least two prime numbers, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the size range of the input array?
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of the numbers in the array? This is important for efficiently deciding primality.
3. **Output Specification**: Do we need to handle the case when the array contains fewer than two primes explicitly by returning -1, or can we assume the input will always have at least two primes?

Let's assume that:
1. The array size \( n \) can be up to \( 10^5 \).
2. The array elements are positive integers up to \( 10^6 \).
3. If there are fewer than two prime numbers, we return -1.

### Strategy
1. **Find Primes Using Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Given the maximum possible value, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to precompute prime numbers up to \( 10^6 \).
2. **Filter Primes from the Array**: Using the precomputed list of primes, filter out the primes present in the array.
3. **Calculate Maximum Difference**: If there are at least two primes, compute the maximum difference between any two primes in the filtered list. Otherwise, return -1.

#### Steps:
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Precompute primes up to \( 10^6 \).
2. **Filter the Array**: Extract those numbers from `numbers` that are prime.
3. **Compute Differences**: If the list of primes contains fewer than two elements, return -1. Otherwise, find the largest and smallest primes in the list and return their difference.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MAX_VAL = 1000000;

std::vector<bool> sieveOfEratosthenes(int max_val) {
    std::vector<bool> is_prime(max_val + 1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false; 

    for(int p = 2; p * p <= max_val; ++p) {
        if(is_prime[p]) {
            for(int multiple = p * p; multiple <= max_val; multiple += p) {
                is_prime[multiple] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    return is_prime;
}

int maxPrimeDifference(const std::vector<int>& numbers) {
    // Step 1: Find all primes up to MAX_VAL using Sieve of Eratosthenes
    std::vector<bool> is_prime = sieveOfEratosthenes(MAX_VAL);

    // Step 2: Filter the prime numbers from the array
    std::vector<int> primes;
    for(int num: numbers) {
        if(num <= MAX_VAL && is_prime[num]) {
            primes.push_back(num);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Check if we have at least two primes
    if(primes.size() < 2) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Step 4: Compute the max prime difference
    auto min_max = std::minmax_element(primes.begin(), primes.end());
    return *min_max.second - *min_max.first;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 10, 15, 3, 7, 11, 50};
    int result = maxPrimeDifference(numbers);
    if(result != -1) {
        std::cout << "Maximum Prime Difference: " << result << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Not enough prime numbers in the array." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: \( O(n \log \log n) \) for numbers up to \( MAX_VAL \).
2. **Filtering Primes**: \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the size of the input array.
3. **Min-Max Computation**: \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of primes found.

Overall, the dominant factor is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, making the solution \( O(n \log \log n) \) in terms of \( n \), the maximum value in the array.

This should efficiently handle the problem within the given constraints.
