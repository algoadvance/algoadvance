[Leetcode 1829. Maximum XOR for Each Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1829)
### Problem Statement
You are given a sorted array `nums` of `n` non-negative integers, and an integer `maximumBit`. You need to perform the following query `n` times:

1. Find the `maximum xor` of the first `i` elements of `nums`.
2. Store the result and remove the `i-th` element from `nums`.

Return an array of answers, where the `i-th` answer is the answer of the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input array `nums` and the integer `maximumBit`?**
   - `nums` is a sorted array of non-negative integers.
   - `maximumBit` is a positive integer indicating the number of bits considered.

2. **Is there any constraint on the size of `nums` array?**
   - The size `n` of `nums` is a non-negative integer, generally derived from problem constraints.

3. **What does "maximum xor" mean in this context?**
   - "Maximum xor" here refers to finding the number that when XORed with the prefix XOR of the array (considering `maximumBit`), results in the largest possible value.

### Strategy
1. **Optimization hints:**
   - Notice that you can keep track of the prefix XORs of the array. Removing a single element each time and computing the new prefix XOR is the efficient way to go.

2. **Overall Approach:**
   - Calculate the prefix XOR for all elements.
   - Derive the maximum possible XOR value by using `(1 << maximumBit) - 1`, which sets all the bits to 1 up to `maximumBit`.
   - Compute the results by iterating from the back and continually removing the last element from the prefix.

### Code
Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<int> getMaximumXor(std::vector<int>& nums, int maximumBit) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<int> result(n);
        int maxXor = (1 << maximumBit) - 1; // Compute the maximum possible value for the given number of bits
        int prefixXor = 0;

        // Calculate the prefix XOR for the entire array initially
        for (const int &num : nums) {
            prefixXor ^= num;
        }
        
        // We will go from the back to the front, removing the last element each time
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result[i] = prefixXor ^ maxXor;
            prefixXor ^= nums[n - i - 1]; // Remove current last element
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Calculating the initial prefix XOR takes O(n) time.
  - Each step involving prefix XOR adjustment and result calculation takes O(1) time, performed `n` times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The space required to store the result array is O(n).

This solution is efficient and operates within linear time for both time and space complexities, making it well-suited for large input sizes within typical constraints.
