[Leetcode 2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2163)
### Problem Statement
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove any `n` elements from the array to form two new arrays:
- `nums1`, which consists of the first `2 * n` elements.
- `nums2`, which consists of the remaining `n` elements. 

Let the sums of the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` be `sum1` and `sum2`, respectively. Return the minimum possible value of `|sum1 - sum2|`.

### Strategy
We need to choose `n` elements from the `3n` array such that the absolute difference between the sum of the remaining `2n` elements and the sum of the removed `n` elements is minimized. This involves careful selection processes to ensure that the distributions yield a minimal difference in their sums.

### Code
Below is the C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size() / 3;

    // Priority queues to store the top N elements
    priority_queue<int> leftMaxHeap;  // Max-heap for the left part
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> rightMinHeap;  // Min-heap for the right part

    vector<long long> leftSums(2 * n + 1, 0), rightSums(2 * n + 1, 0);

    long long leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0;

    // Calculate the maximum sum for the first 2*n elements from the left
    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
        leftMaxHeap.push(nums[i]);
        leftSum += nums[i];
    }

    leftSums[2 * n] = leftSum;

    for (int i = 2 * n; i >= n; --i) {
        leftSum -= leftMaxHeap.top();
        leftMaxHeap.pop();
        leftSums[i - 1] = leftSum;
    }

    // Calculate the minimum sum for the last 2*n elements from the right
    for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= n; --i) {
        rightMinHeap.push(nums[i]);
        rightSum += nums[i];
    }

    rightSums[n] = rightSum;

    for (int i = n; i <= 2 * n; ++i) {
        rightSum -= rightMinHeap.top();
        rightMinHeap.pop();
        rightSums[i] = rightSum;
    }

    long long minDiff = LLONG_MAX;

    for (int i = n; i <= 2 * n; ++i) {
        minDiff = min(minDiff, abs(leftSums[i] - rightSums[i]));
    }

    return minDiff;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Heap Utilization**:
    - Use a max-heap to track the largest `n` elements for `nums1`.
    - Use a min-heap to track the smallest `n` elements for `nums2`.
2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**:
    - Calculate prefix sums for the remaining elements after retaining/removing `n` elements in both heaps.
3. **Absolute Difference Calculation**:
    - Iterate through calculated prefix sums and determine the minimum possible absolute difference.

### Time Complexity
- **Heap operations**: `O(n log n)` time complexity for each insertion and deletion operation.
- **Prefix sums calculation**: `O(n)` time complexity for iterating through sums.
- **Overall**: `O(n log n)` since the heap operations dominate the time complexity.

This optimized solution efficiently ensures the minimal absolute difference by carefully selecting and comparing the sums derived from the remaining elements of the array.
