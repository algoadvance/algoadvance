[Leetcode 3196. Maximize Total Cost of Alternating Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3196)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of even length `n` and an integer `k`. The array consists of exactly `n / 2` even and `n / 2` odd elements.

We want to select `k` elements from the array following these two rules:
1. We cannot select two consecutive elements from the original array.
2. One can only choose to start selecting from an odd index or an even index.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the selected `k` elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
    - What are the range limits for `n` and `k`?
    - Are all elements in the `nums` array distinct?
    - What is the range of values the elements in `nums` can have?

2. **Example**:
    - If `nums = [3, 2, 1, 4]` and `k = 2`, would the valid subarrays and the expected output be explained?

Once these details are clarified, I would proceed with the code.

### Strategy

1. **Identifying the Two Scenarios**:
   - Separate the elements at odd indices and even indices into two different arrays.
   - Reduce the problem to finding the maximum sum of `k` elements from the two potential subarrays where elements are non-consecutive.

2. **Using Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use dynamic programming to store the maximum sum attainable up to a particular point with the constraint that no two elements can be consecutive.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCost(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        vector<int> evenIndexed, oddIndexed;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) evenIndexed.push_back(nums[i]);
            else oddIndexed.push_back(nums[i]);
        }

        // Get the result for evenIndexed and oddIndexed separately.
        int resEven = getMaxSumWithNoConsecutives(evenIndexed, k);
        int resOdd = getMaxSumWithNoConsecutives(oddIndexed, k);

        // The answer would be the maximum of these two possible cases.
        return max(resEven, resOdd);
    }

private:
    int getMaxSumWithNoConsecutives(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (k == 0) return 0;
        if (n < 2 * k - 1) return 0;
        
        vector<int> dp(n, 0);

        dp[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = arr[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < i - 1; ++j) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + arr[i]);
            }
        }

        // Get the max sum out of the last `n - k` items.
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= n - k; --i) {
            maxSum = max(maxSum, dp[i]);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
};

// Helper function for testing
void testSolution() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int k = 2;
    cout << sol.maxCost(nums, k) << endl; // Expected output: maximum sum by choosing non-consecutive elements
}

int main() {
    testSolution();
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves dynamic programming over the length of `nums` for both even and odd indices, leading to a complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the `getMaxSumWithNoConsecutives` function. Since there are two such calls, the overall complexity would still be \(O(n^2)\).

- Although a further optimization might be possible to reduce the complexity, this is a starting point for a clear and understandable solution.
