[Leetcode 1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1889)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `packages` representing the sizes of packages you need to deliver, and a 2D array `boxes` where `boxes[i]` represents a set of box sizes available at the ith supplier, you need to determine the minimum total wasted space by choosing exactly one supplier and inserting all the packages into shipping boxes from that supplier. The wasted space is defined as the difference in size between the chosen box and the size of the package it contains.

- Each package can be placed into a box with a size greater than or equal to the package size.
- You cannot rotate the packages or box sizes.
- Return the minimum total wasted space or `-1` if it is not possible to choose a supplier such that all the packages can be placed.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- From the first supplier we choose the box sizes [4, 8], and the total wasted space is (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.
- From the second supplier we choose the box sizes [2, 8], but there is no valid way to fit the packages into these boxes.
Thus, the minimum wasted space is 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input sizes?**
   - `1 <= packages.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= boxes.length <= 100`
   - `1 <= boxes[i].length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= packages[i], boxes[i][j] <= 10^9`

2. **Can any package be larger than any available box size?**
   - Yes, and in such a case, we should return `-1`.

3. **Can there be duplicate package sizes or box sizes?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Packages and Box Sizes:** 
   Begin by sorting the `packages` array. Each supplierâ€™s `boxes[i]` should also be sorted to allow for efficient binary search for the smallest box that can fit a given package.

2. **Binary Search for Minimum Box:** 
   For each supplier, for each package, perform a binary search to find the smallest box that can fit the package.

3. **Calculate Wasted Space:**
   Sum the wastes for each package with the chosen supplier's boxes.

4. **Compare Wastage Across Suppliers:** 
   Track the minimal space wasted among all suppliers and return it.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

long long minWastedSpace(vector<int>& packages, vector<vector<int>>& boxes) {
    const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    sort(packages.begin(), packages.end());
    long long totalPackageSize = accumulate(packages.begin(), packages.end(), 0LL);
    long long minWaste = LLONG_MAX;

    for (auto& supplierBoxes : boxes) {
        sort(supplierBoxes.begin(), supplierBoxes.end());

        if (supplierBoxes.back() < packages.back())
            continue; // Supplier cannot pack the largest package

        long long currentWaste = 0;
        size_t j = 0; // Index for current box size
        
        for (int package : packages) {
            while (j < supplierBoxes.size() && supplierBoxes[j] < package) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j == supplierBoxes.size()) {
                currentWaste = LLONG_MAX;
                break;
            }
            currentWaste += supplierBoxes[j] - package;
            if (currentWaste > minWaste) 
                break;
        }
        
        minWaste = min(minWaste, currentWaste);
    }

    return minWaste == LLONG_MAX ? -1 : (minWaste % MOD);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> packages = {2, 3, 5};
    vector<vector<int>> boxes = \{\{4, 8}, {2, 8}};
    
    cout << minWastedSpace(packages, boxes) << endl;  // Output: 6
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Packages:** \(O(N \log N)\)
- **Sorting Each Supplier's Boxes:** \(O(K_i \log K_i)\) for each supplier `i`
- **Searching and Waste Calculation:** \(O(N \log K_i)\) for each supplier using binary search

Where:
- `N` is the number of packages.
- `K_i` is the number of boxes for supplier `i`.

**Overall Complexity:** Considering the worst case (to both sort and traverse):
- \(O(N \log N + M \cdot (K_{\text{max}} \log K_{\text{max}} + N \log K_{\text{max}}))\)

Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough for large inputs.
