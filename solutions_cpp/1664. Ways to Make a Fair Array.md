[Leetcode 1664. Ways to Make a Fair Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1664)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, you need to find the number of ways to make the array fair after removing exactly one element. An array is considered fair if the sum of the elements at even indexes is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indexes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Length**: What is the range of possible lengths for the array `nums`?
    - Typically, it's safe to assume bounds like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` unless specified otherwise.
    
2. **Element Values**: Are there any bounds or certain characteristics for the values within `nums`?
    - Usually, the bounds might be within `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Edge Case**: What if the array length is 1? How should this be handled?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Sums**: Calculate prefix sums for even and odd indices.
2. **Simulate Removal**: Loop through each element to simulate its removal, then determine if the resulting array would be fair.
3. **Update Sums Dynamically**: As we iterate and simulate the removal of each element, dynamically adjust and compare the sums to determine fairness.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToMakeFair(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> evenSum(n + 1, 0), oddSum(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Calculate prefix sums for even and odd indices
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            evenSum[i + 1] = evenSum[i] + (i % 2 == 0 ? nums[i] : 0);
            oddSum[i + 1] = oddSum[i] + (i % 2 != 0 ? nums[i] : 0);
        }
        
        int ways = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the array and simulate removal
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int evenLeft = evenSum[i];
            int oddLeft = oddSum[i];
            int evenRight = evenSum[n] - evenSum[i + 1];
            int oddRight = oddSum[n] - oddSum[i + 1];
            
            // After removing nums[i], adjust the sequences
            if (evenLeft + oddRight == oddLeft + evenRight) {
                ++ways;
            }
        }
        
        return ways;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Sums**: O(n)
    - Calculating the prefix sums requires a single pass through the array.
- **Simulate Removal**: O(n)
    - Iterate through the array while updating and comparing the sums.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n)
    - Both preprocessing and simulation are linear operations.

In conclusion, this algorithm efficiently determines the number of ways to make the array fair by leveraging prefix sums to facilitate quick recalculations during element removal simulation.
