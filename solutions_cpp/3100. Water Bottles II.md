[Leetcode 3100. Water Bottles II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3100)
## Problem Statement:
Given two integers `numBottles` and `numExchanges` representing the number of full water bottles you initially have and the number of empty water bottles required to get one new full water bottle, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

### Example:
- **Input**: numBottles = 9, numExchanges = 3
- **Output**: 13
- **Explanation**: You can initially drink 9 bottles. After drinking, you have 9 empty bottles. You can exchange 9 empty bottles for 3 full bottles (since 9/3=3). You drink 3 more bottles, making the total number of bottles drunk 9 + 3 = 12. You now have 3 empty bottles. You can exchange them for 1 new bottle and drink it, making the total 13.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `numBottles` be zero initially? 
2. Are `numExchanges` always greater than 1?
3. Is it required to use all the empty bottles during exchanges or can the leftovers be carried on to the next exchange?

## Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchanges) {
    int totalDrunk = numBottles;
    int emptyBottles = numBottles;
    
    while (emptyBottles >= numExchanges) {
        int newBottles = emptyBottles / numExchanges;
        totalDrunk += newBottles;
        emptyBottles = emptyBottles % numExchanges + newBottles;
    }
    
    return totalDrunk;
}

int main() {
    int numBottles = 9, numExchanges = 3;
    std::cout << "Maximum number of bottles you can drink: " << numWaterBottles(numBottles, numExchanges) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `totalDrunk` to the number of full bottles you start with. Set `emptyBottles` to the same value because you drink all of them initially.
2. **Loop until exchangeable**: Run a loop until the number of empty bottles is less than `numExchanges`:
   - Calculate the number of new full bottles you can get by dividing the number of empty bottles by `numExchanges`.
   - Add these new bottles to `totalDrunk`.
   - Update the number of empty bottles to be the remainder of empty bottles after exchange plus the new full bottles consumed.
3. **Return the total number of drunk bottles after exchanging as much as possible**.
   
## Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(log(N)) where N is the initial number of bottles since each iteration reduces the number of empty bottles significantly by dividing them. 

The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
