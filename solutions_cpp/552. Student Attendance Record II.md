[Leetcode 552. Student Attendance Record II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l552)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of days the student has attended class. The student attendance record is represented by a string containing only the characters:
- 'A' : Absent.
- 'L' : Late.
- 'P' : Present.

The student cannot have more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late). You need to return the number of possible attendance records of length `n` that will be rewarded. The result might be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the length of the attendance record (n) be extremely large, say up to 10000?
   - Yes, it can be large.
   
2. Since the result needs to be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`, should I always take modulo after each step to avoid overflow?
   - Yes, always take modulo after each operation to avoid overflow.

3. Do we need to consider strings that may have other characters besides 'A', 'L', or 'P'?
   - No, only 'A', 'L', and 'P' are valid characters for attendance records.

### Strategy

This problem resembles a Dynamic Programming problem. We need to consider different states:

1. **State Representation**: 
   - Let's use `dp[i][j][k]` where:
     - `i` is the length of the attendance record.
     - `j` is the number of 'A' (Absent) in the record.
     - `k` is the number of continuous 'L' (Late) days at the end.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Base cases for initial values (dp[0][0][0]).

3. **Transitions**:
   - If we add character 'P', the state transitions from `dp[i-1][j][0]` to `dp[i][j][0]`.
   - If we add character 'A', the state transitions from `dp[i-1][j-1][0]` to `dp[i][j][0]` (only if j > 0).
   - If we add character 'L', the state transitions from `dp[i-1][j][k-1]` to `dp[i][j][k]`, if `k < 2`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Sum all `dp[n][j][k]` for all valid j and k.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

constexpr int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int checkRecord(int n) {
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n + 1, vector<vector<int>>(2, vector<int>(3, 0)));
    
    // Initial state: one way to have an empty record
    dp[0][0][0] = 1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= 1; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k <= 2; ++k) {
                // Add 'P'
                dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i - 1][j][k]) % MOD;
                
                // Add 'A' - only if not already added
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i - 1][j - 1][k]) % MOD;
                }
                
                // Add 'L' - only if less than 2 continuous 'L'
                if (k > 0) {
                    dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i - 1][j][k - 1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    int total = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j <= 1; ++j) {
        for (int k = 0; k <= 2; ++k) {
            total = (total + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    
    return total;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << checkRecord(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\) because we iterate over the attendance record length `n` and for each day, we update states which are `O(1)` operations considering j and k have constant limits (0 or 1, and 0 to 2 respectively).

- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the 3D dynamic programming table where the length `n` is the primary factor.

This solution ensures efficient and correct computation even for larger values of `n`.
