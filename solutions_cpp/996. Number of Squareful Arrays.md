[Leetcode 996. Number of Squareful Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l996)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, you have to return the number of permutations of the array that are squareful. A permutation is considered squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, the sum of the elements is a perfect square.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements of the array include zero?**
   - Yes, the problem states that the array consists of non-negative integers.

2. **What is the maximum size of the array?**
   - Generally, for LeetCode problems, let's assume the maximum size could be around 1 <= A.length <= 12.

3. **Should permutations be unique (i.e., no duplicates)?**
   - Yes, only unique permutations are considered based on the value of elements in the array.

With these clarifications, we can move forward to solve this problem.

## Strategy

1. **Generate Permutations**:
   - Use backtracking to generate all unique permutations of the array.

2. **Check for Squareful Property**:
   - For each permutation, we need to check if every consecutive pair sums up to a perfect square.

3. **Optimization**:
   - Use a boolean array to mark visited nodes and avoid re-exploring the same nodes.
   - Cache the results of whether a sum is a perfect square to avoid recomputation.

The task can be solved efficiently using backtracking with the above strategies.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to check if a given number is a perfect square
bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
    int root = static_cast<int>(sqrt(num));
    return root * root == num;
}

void backtrack(vector<int>& A, vector<bool>& visited, int idx, int& count, vector<int>& current) {
    if (idx == A.size()) {
        count++;
        return;
    }

    unordered_set<int> used; // To avoid using same number in the same position
    for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
        if (visited[i] || (i > 0 && A[i] == A[i - 1] && !visited[i - 1])) {
            continue;
        }

        // For the first element, no need to check squareful condition
        if (idx > 0 && !isPerfectSquare(current[idx - 1] + A[i])) {
            continue;
        }

        visited[i] = true;
        current[idx] = A[i];
        backtrack(A, visited, idx + 1, count, current);
        visited[i] = false;
    }
}

int numSquarefulPerms(vector<int>& A) {
    sort(A.begin(), A.end());
    int count = 0;
    vector<bool> visited(A.size(), false);
    vector<int> current(A.size());
    backtrack(A, visited, 0, count, current);
    return count;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Helper Function**:
   - `isPerfectSquare(int num)`: Checks if the sum of two numbers is a perfect square.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - The `backtrack` function uses recursion to generate permutations with the conditions checked.
   - `unordered_set<int> used`: Ensures we do not pick the same number repeatedly at the same position in the permutation.
   - The `idx` tracks the current position in the permutation.
   - The `visited` array helps to avoid using the same element twice in a permutation.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `numSquarefulPerms` initializes necessary data structures and starts the backtracking process.
   - We sort the array to handle duplicates efficiently.

## Time Complexity

- **Backtracking**: The worst-case scenario is `O(N!)` due to the permutations generation. 
- **Perfect Square Check**: Each sum check is `O(1)`, and we perform this check at most `N` times for each permutation.

Hence, the overall time complexity of this solution is `O(N! * N)`, which is likely suitable given the constraints.
