[Leetcode 1388. Pizza With 3n Slices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1388)
### Problem Statement
You have a pizza with `3n` slices, and you want to share the pizza with `n` friends. You want to cut the pizza into exactly `3n` slices such that every person gets exactly `3` slices. Your goal is to maximize the sum of the sizes of the slices that you get.

Given an array `slices` of integers representing the sizes of the slices, return the maximum possible sum of the sizes of the slices that you can get.

#### Example:
1. Input: `slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
   Output: `10`
2. Input: `slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]`
   Output: `16`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are all elements in the `slices` array positive integers?
2. Is it guaranteed that the size of the `slices` array is always a multiple of 3?
3. Can we remove slices from the pizza, or is it mandatory to work with all slices provided?

### Strategy
This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Consider the problem as selecting the slices in such a way that no two neighboring slices (and wrap-around) are chosen simultaneously in order to maximize the sum of `n` slices.

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup:**
   - We'll use two DP arrays to solve this problem: one from the perspective of excluding the first element and one excluding the last element.
   - Define `dp1[i][j]` as the maximum sum we can get by taking `j` slices from the first `i` slices in slices[0...n-1].
   - Define `dp2[i][j]` as the maximum sum we can get by taking `j` slices from the first `i` slices in slices[1...n].

2. **Transition State:**
   - If we don't pick the current slice: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`
   - If we pick the current slice: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-2][j-1] + slices[i-1]` (skipping the adjacent slice)

3. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i` (if we need 0 slices, sum is 0)

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSizeSlices(vector<int>& slices) {
        int n = slices.size() / 3;
        return max(solveDP(slices, 0, slices.size()-2, n), solveDP(slices, 1, slices.size()-1, n));
    }

private:
    int solveDP(vector<int>& slices, int start, int end, int n) {
        int m = end - start + 1;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= min(n, i/2); ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], (i >= 2 ? dp[i-2][j-1] : 0) + slices[start + i - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the number of slices divided by 3.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where the double loop potentially processes around n^2 elements.

By using a dynamic programming approach ensuring non-adjacency constraints, we could determine the optimal sum of the sizes of the slices that can be obtained. This ensures we maximize the sum while adhering to the given constraints.
