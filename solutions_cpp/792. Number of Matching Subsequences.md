[Leetcode 792. Number of Matching Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l792)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of `s`.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

### Example:

- Input: `s = "abcde", words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: There are three words in `words` that are subsequences of `s`: `"a"`, `"acd"`, `"ace"`.

## Clarifying Questions

Here are some questions to clarify the problem before diving into the solution:

1. **Input Size:** Can the length of the string `s` and the words in the `words` array be very large?
2. **Case Sensitivity:** Is this problem case-sensitive? (Assume it is unless stated otherwise.)
3. **Characters:** Are the characters strictly lower-case alphabets?
4. **Constraints:** Are there any constraints or special cases to consider?

We will proceed assuming the issues are case-sensitive, all characters are lower-case, and within typical input size limits for a standard interview problem.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Verification:** Check if either `s` or `words` are empty and return 0 in such cases.
2. **Character Indexing:** Pre-process the string `s` to store the indices of each character in a hash map.
3. **Check Subsequences:** For each word in `words`, use the pre-processed indices to efficiently check if the word is a subsequence of `s`.
   - Use a pointer to check the validity of each character in the current word.
4. **Counting Subsequences:** Count how many words from the list are subsequences of `s`.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool isSubsequence(unordered_map<char, vector<int>>& char_indices, string& s, string& word) {
    int prev_index = -1;
    for (char c : word) {
        if (char_indices.find(c) == char_indices.end()) {
            return false;
        }
        auto &indices = char_indices[c];
        auto it = upper_bound(indices.begin(), indices.end(), prev_index);
        if (it == indices.end()) {
            return false;
        }
        prev_index = *it;
    }
    return true;
}

int numMatchingSubseq(string s, vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_map<char, vector<int>> char_indices;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        char_indices[s[i]].push_back(i);
    }

    int count = 0;
    for (string& word : words) {
        if (isSubsequence(char_indices, s, word)) {
            ++count;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcde";
    vector<string> words = {"a", "bb", "acd", "ace"};
    cout << numMatchingSubseq(s, words) << endl;  // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis of this solution:

1. **Pre-processing:** Building the `char_indices` map takes O(n), where n is the length of string `s`.
2. **Checking Subsequences:** For each word in `words`, checking if it is a subsequence involves binary search within the character indices. If `m` is the average length of the words and `k` is the number of words:
   - Each binary search on average takes O(log n).
   - Checking each word thus takes O(m * log n).
   - Doing this for `k` words gives O(k * m * log n).

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n + k * m * log n)**, which is efficient for typical input sizes in interview problems.
