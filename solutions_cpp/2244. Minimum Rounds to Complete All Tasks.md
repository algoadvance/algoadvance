[Leetcode 2244. Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2244)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array representing a list of tasks and their difficulties. Each task can have multiple occurrences. You need to find the minimum number of rounds required to complete all tasks, where each round can complete either two or three tasks of the same difficulty.

You need to return the minimum number of rounds needed to complete all the tasks or -1 if it is not possible to complete all tasks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - The size of the tasks list (n) can be large.
    - The difficulty of each task will be an integer.
    - The task difficulty values will not necessarily be sorted.

2. **Output:**
    - Return an integer representing the minimum number of rounds needed.
    - Return -1 if some tasks cannot be completed in the given constraints.

3. **Examples:**
    - Suppose tasks = [2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The output should be 4 because we can group the tasks as (2,2,2), (3,3), (4,4,4), and (4,4).

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Count Frequencies:** Count how many times each difficulty appears in the list.
2. **Determine Rounds:** For each unique task difficulty:
    - If the count of a task is exactly 1, it is not possible to complete the task because the minimum round is 2 tasks.
    - Use a combination of 2-tasks and 3-tasks rounds to minimize the total rounds.

The algorithm would look like this:
1. Use a hash map to store the frequency of each task.
2. Iterate over the frequency map:
    - If a frequency is 1, return -1.
    - Calculate the minimum number of rounds for each frequency:
        - Prefer using 3-task rounds as much as possible.
        - Use the formula to convert frequencies to rounds efficiently.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumRounds(std::vector<int>& tasks) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the frequency of each task difficulty
        for (int task : tasks) {
            freq[task]++;
        }
        
        int rounds = 0;
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the minimum rounds needed for each frequency
        for (const auto& entry : freq) {
            int count = entry.second;
           
            // If any task has a count of 1, it's not possible to complete it in rounds
            if (count == 1) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            // Calculate the number of rounds needed for the current count
            rounds += (count + 2) / 3;
        }
        
        return rounds;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies:** O(n), where n is the number of tasks.
- **Calculating Rounds:** O(m), where m is the number of unique task difficulties.

The overall time complexity is O(n + m), but since m <= n, it simplifies to O(n).

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Calculation:** Using an unordered map `freq` to store the count of each task.
2. **Determine Rounds:** For each unique task count:
   - If the count is 1, immediately return -1 since it's impossible to form a round.
   - Calculate the minimum rounds using integer arithmetic, specifically `(count + 2) / 3` which simplifies the count of rounds needed combining 2-task and 3-task rounds optimally.
   
This gives us a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum rounds required and handles edge cases effectively.
