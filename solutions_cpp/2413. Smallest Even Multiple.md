[Leetcode 2413. Smallest Even Multiple](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2413)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `n` and `2`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of `n`?
   - **A:** `n` is a positive integer, and for this problem, you can assume typical constraints such as `1 <= n <= 1000`.

2. **Q:** Can `n` be 1?
   - **A:** Yes, `n` can be 1.

3. **Q:** Should we handle large numbers or only typical input ranges?
   - **A:** Typical ranges suffices, typically up to 1000 or similar.

## Strategy

The task involves finding the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `n` and `2`. 
- Note that the smallest even multiple of a number is either the number itself if it is even, or twice the number if it is odd.
- Therefore, if `n` is already even, the smallest multiple is `n`. If `n` is odd, the smallest even multiple will be `2 * n`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0 ? n : 2 * n;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::cout << solution.smallestEvenMultiple(5) << std::endl;  // Outputs 10
    std::cout << solution.smallestEvenMultiple(6) << std::endl;  // Outputs 6
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because:
- The solution involves only a simple conditional check and a potential multiplication, both of which are constant time operations.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because:
- No extra space is used apart from the input and a few variables.
