[Leetcode 2440. Create Components With Same Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2440)
## Problem Statement

You are given a graph where each node has a value associated with it. Your task is to partition the graph into several connected components where each component has the same total value of their nodes. Return the maximum number of components you can create. Each node can only belong to one component. 

If it's not possible to partition the graph as required, return 1 as the output.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Representation**: How is the graph represented? Is it with adjacency lists or adjacency matrices?
2. **Node Values**: Are the node values given in an array, and does the array index correspond to the node number?
3. **Output**: Should the output be the maximum number of components or the components themselves?
4. **Graph Characteristics**: Can the graph have cycles, and can it be disconnected initially?
5. **Constraints**: What are the limits on the number of nodes and the range of values for the node values?

## Strategy

1. **Understand and Prepare the Graph**:
   - Parse the input to understand the structure of the graph (adjacency list) and the values associated with each node.
   
2. **Total Value Calculation**:
   - Calculate the sum of all node values. If this sum divided by the number of components doesn't yield an integer, it's impossible to partition as required.

3. **Finding Target Sum for Each Component**:
   - Given a valid partition, each component should sum up to `total_sum / k`, where `k` is the number of partitions.
   
4. **DFS/BFS for Component Building**:
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to explore nodes and form components that sum up to the target value.

5. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Iteratively check if it's possible to form an additional component with the remaining nodes.
   
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle disconnected graphs separately and ensure each component in a potentially disconnected graph follows the constraint.

## Implementation

Here is a C++ implementation based on the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int componentWithTargetSum(vector<int>& values, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& adjList, int target, unordered_set<int>& visited, int node) {
        visited.insert(node);
        int sum = values[node];
        for (auto neighbor : adjList[node]) {
            if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                int s = componentWithTargetSum(values, adjList, target, visited, neighbor);
                if (s == target) {
                    nodeComponentCount++;
                } else {
                    sum += s;
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    int componentValue(vector<int>& values, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = values.size();
        if (n == 1) return 1;

        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> adjList;
        for (auto &edge : edges) {
            adjList[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adjList[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }

        int totalSum = accumulate(values.begin(), values.end(), 0);
        for (int k = n; k >= 1; --k) {
            if (totalSum % k == 0) {
                int target = totalSum / k;
                unordered_set<int> visited;
                nodeComponentCount = 0;
                if (componentWithTargetSum(values, adjList, target, visited, 0) == target) {
                    if (visited.size() == n) return nodeComponentCount;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return 1;
    }
    
private:
    int nodeComponentCount = 0;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **DFS/BFS Traversal**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Total Sum Calculation**: O(V), summing node values.
- **Trying Different k Values**: We potentially check up to V partitions.
  
Overall, the time complexity for the implementation is O(V * (V + E)), which can be optimized further based on problem constraints and specific graph characteristics.
