[Leetcode 2945. Find Maximum Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2945)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, you need to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray. A non-decreasing subarray is a sequence in which each element is greater than or equal to the previous element.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty?** If so, what should be the output?
   - Normally, for an empty array, the length would be 0.
   
2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain any integer values, both positive and negative.
   
3. **What about the single-element array?**
   - If the array has only one element, the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray would be 1.

## Strategy

1. Use a single traversal approach to iterate through the array.
2. Maintain two variables:
   - `maxLength` to store the maximum length found so far.
   - `currentLength` to store the length of the current non-decreasing subarray.
3. Iterate through the array from the second element. For each element, compare it with the previous element:
   - If it is greater than or equal to the previous element, increment `currentLength`.
   - Otherwise, compare `currentLength` with `maxLength`, update `maxLength` if `currentLength` is greater, and reset `currentLength` to 1.
4. After exiting the loop, a final comparison of `currentLength` with `maxLength` is required in case the array ends with the longest non-decreasing sequence.
5. Return the `maxLength`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findMaxNonDecreasingLength(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    int maxLength = 1;
    int currentLength = 1;
    
    for (size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]) {
            ++currentLength;
        } else {
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }
    
    maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {10, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    std::cout << "The length of the longest non-decreasing subarray is: " << findMaxNonDecreasingLength(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in linear time:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array, because it involves a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since we're only using a finite number of additional variables and not any extra space that scales with the input size.

This approach ensures that we find the maximum length efficiently with minimal space overhead.
