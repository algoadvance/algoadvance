[Leetcode 2960. Count Tested Devices After Test Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2960)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, which represents the number of devices in a lab from `1 to n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `operations` where `operations[i] = [left, right, testId]` means that all devices in the inclusive range `[left, right]` are assigned to test with the test operation identifier `testId`. 

Find out how many devices were assigned at least one test operation from the list of operations provided.

**Example:**

```cpp
Input: n = 5, operations = [[1, 2, 1], [2, 4, 2], [3, 5, 3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The devices and their test assignments are:
Device 1 -> Test 1,
Device 2 -> Test 1, Test 2,
Device 3 -> Test 2, Test 3,
Device 4 -> Test 2, Test 3,
Device 5 -> Test 3
Out of the 5 devices, all devices are assigned at least one test operation.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the ranges in `operations` always valid and within the bounds of 1 to `n`?**
   - Yes, the ranges are guaranteed to be valid within the given bounds.
   
2. **Can there be overlapping ranges in the `operations` array?**
   - Yes, there can be overlapping ranges.

3. **Do we need to consider the unique test IDs for different devices, or is the number of devices assigned to any test sufficient?**
   - We only need to consider whether a device is assigned at least one test, irrespective of the test ID.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the devices assigned to any of the test operations. Here's a potential plan:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a boolean array `assigned` of size `n+1` (considering 1-based indexing) to track whether each device from 1 to n has been assigned any test. Initialize all values to `false`.

2. **Process Operations:**
   - Iterate over the `operations` array. For each operation `[left, right, testId]`, mark all devices in the range `[left, right]` as `true` in the `assigned` array.
   
3. **Count Assigned Devices:**
   - Count the number of `true` values in the `assigned` array (ignoring the zeroth index).

4. **Return the Count:**
   - Return the count of devices that have been assigned at least one test.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

int countTestedDevices(int n, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& operations) {
    // Step 1: Initialize the 'assigned' array to false for each device.
    std::vector<bool> assigned(n + 1, false);

    // Step 2: Process each operation
    for (const auto& op : operations) {
        int left = op[0];
        int right = op[1];
        for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
            assigned[i] = true;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Count the number of devices that have been assigned at least one test.
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (assigned[i]) {
            ++count;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** Initializing the `assigned` array takes O(n).
- **Processing Operations:** Each operation can potentially update up to `n` devices. In the worst case, this step takes O(m*n), where `m` is the number of operations.
- **Counting Assigned Devices:** This involves a simple loop over `n` elements, which is O(n).

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(m*n) in the worst case, because each operation might iterate through all `n` devices.

**Optimization Consideration:**

- If operations contain a large number of elements, we might consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm (e.g., sweep line algorithm or segment tree) to handle overlapping ranges more effectively.
