[Leetcode 2270. Number of Ways to Split Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2270)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to determine the number of ways to split the array into two non-empty parts such that the sum of the elements in the left part is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the right part.

Formally, suppose the array is split into two parts with indices `[0, i]` and `[i+1, n-1]`, where `0 <= i < n-1`. You need to find the number of valid `i`'s.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range for the input array `nums`?**
   - The size of the input array can vary. For this solution, we'll assume that `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?**
   - The elements of the array `nums` can be any integer within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

3. **Should we consider sum overflow?**
   - Given that the sum of elements can be large, handling potential overflow in sum computations should be considered. 


### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum**: First, compute the total sum of the array.
2. **Iterate and Compare Sums**: Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum (`leftSum`) of the first part. For each index `i`, calculate the sum of the elements of the right part as the total sum minus the current `leftSum`. Compare the `leftSum` with the sum of the right part to determine if the split is valid.
3. **Count Valid Splits**: Increment a counter for each valid split found.

This algorithm ensures that we only need to make a single pass through the array, which results in an efficient solution.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToSplitArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long totalSum = 0;
        for (const int& num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }

        long long leftSum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            leftSum += nums[i];
            long long rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;
            if (leftSum >= rightSum) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - Calculating the total sum takes `O(n)`.
  - Iterating through the array to compare sums also takes `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space for the sums and the counter.

This approach ensures we effectively solve the presented problem with optimal time complexity, making it suitable even for the upper constraint limits.
