[Leetcode 2585. Number of Ways to Earn Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2585)
Sure, let's start by understanding the problem statement.

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `points` which represents different points you can earn for completing corresponding tasks. You are also given an integer `target` which represents the total number of points you want to earn. The goal is to determine the number of different ways you can earn exactly `target` points by possibly repeating the tasks any number of times.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: points = [1, 2, 3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation: The different combinations to earn 4 points are:
- [1, 1, 1, 1]
- [1, 1, 2]
- [1, 2, 1]
- [1, 3]
- [2, 1, 1]
- [2, 2]
- [3, 1]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `points` array have duplicate values?
2. Are all elements in the `points` array guaranteed to be positive integers?
3. What are the constraints on the sizes of `points` and `target`?

### Strategy

This problem is a variation of the classic "Coin Change" problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming. Here's a breakdown of how we approach this:

1. **Define a DP array**: Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to earn `i` points.
2. **Initialization**: `dp[0]` should be initialized to 1 because there is exactly one way to earn 0 points - by not taking any tasks.
3. **Update the DP array**:
   - For each point value in `points`,
   - Update the `dp` array from that point value up to `target`.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToReachTarget(int target, vector<int>& points) {
        vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1; // There's one way to reach 0 points - do nothing.

        for (int point : points) {
            for (int j = point; j <= target; ++j) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - point];
            }
        }

        return dp[target];
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `vector<int> dp(target + 1, 0);` initializes a DP array of size `target + 1` to `0`.
   - `dp[0] = 1;` as explained, there's one way to earn 0 points.

2. **DP Update**:
   - We iterate over each point in the `points` array.
   - For each `point`, we iterate from that point value up to `target`.
   - The line `dp[j] += dp[j - point];` updates the DP array by adding the number of ways to earn `j - point` to the number of ways to earn `j`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(target * n)`, where `n` is the size of the `points` array. This is because we have a nested loop where the outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs `target` times.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(target)` for the `dp` array.

Feel free to ask any further questions or clarifications about the solution!
