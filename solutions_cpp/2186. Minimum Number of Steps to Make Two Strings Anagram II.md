[Leetcode 2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2186)
### Problem Statement

The task is to find the minimum number of steps required to make two strings, `s` and `t`, anagrams of each other. A string is an anagram of another if you can rearrange the characters to make the other string. In one step, you can remove one character from either string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the lengths and character constraints for the strings `s` and `t`?
   - Both strings contain only lowercase English letters (a-z).
   - The lengths of `s` and `t` are from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **Output:** The output should be a single integer representing the minimum number of steps required.
3. **Examples:**
   - Example 1:
     ```plaintext
     Input: s = "leetcode", t = "etco"
     Output: 4
     ```
   - Example 2:
     ```plaintext
     Input: s = "anagram", t = "manga"
     Output: 3
     ```

### Strategy

To make two strings anagrams of each other, the frequency of each character in both strings should be the same. The key idea is to count the frequency of each character in both strings and then calculate the difference.

Steps:
1. Use two arrays of size 26 to count the frequency of each character for both strings.
2. Calculate the absolute difference in frequencies for each character between the two strings.
3. Sum these differences to get the total number of steps required to make the strings anagrams.

### Time Complexity

- Counting frequencies of characters: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`.
- Summing the differences: O(1) (since we only have 26 characters to check).

Overall time complexity: O(n + m), which is efficient for the given problem constraint.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

int minStepsToMakeAnagram(std::string s, std::string t) {
    std::vector<int> freqS(26, 0);
    std::vector<int> freqT(26, 0);

    // Count the frequency of each character in string s
    for (char c : s) {
        freqS[c - 'a']++;
    }

    // Count the frequency of each character in string t
    for (char c : t) {
        freqT[c - 'a']++;
    }

    int minSteps = 0;

    // Calculate the minimum steps required
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        minSteps += std::abs(freqS[i] - freqT[i]);
    }

    return minSteps;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "leetcode";
    std::string t1 = "etco";
    std::cout << minStepsToMakeAnagram(s1, t1) << std::endl; // Output: 4

    std::string s2 = "anagram";
    std::string t2 = "manga";
    std::cout << minStepsToMakeAnagram(s2, t2) << std::endl; // Output: 3

    return 0;
}
```

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of steps by using character frequency counts, achieving the desired result within the constraints.
