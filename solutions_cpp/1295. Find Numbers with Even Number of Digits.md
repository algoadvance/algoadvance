[Leetcode 1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1295)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the range of possible sizes for the input array?
   - **Assumption**: The size of `nums` can range from 1 to 10,000.
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of possible values for the elements in `nums`?
   - **Assumption**: The elements in `nums` are positive integers.
3. **Output**: Should the result be printed or returned?
   - **Assumption**: The result should be returned as an integer.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Even Number of Digits**:
   - To check if a number has an even number of digits, we can convert the number to a string and check the length of the string.
   - Alternatively, we can use mathematical operations to count the digits without converting to a string.
2. **Counting the Valid Numbers**:
   - Iterate through each number in the array, check if it has an even number of digits, and maintain a count.
3. **Return the Count**:
   - Return the count after iterating through the array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath> // for log10

class Solution {
public:
    int findNumbers(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            // Counting the number of digits without converting to string
            int numDigits = std::floor(std::log10(num)) + 1;
            if (numDigits % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Loop through Each Number**:
   - We iterate through each number in the array `nums`.
2. **Count Digits**:
   - Use `std::log10(num)` to find the number of digits: `log10(num)` gives the number of digits minus one for a positive integer, so we add one to get the correct digit count.
3. **Check for Even Digits**:
   - If the number of digits is even (`numDigits % 2 == 0`), we increment our count.
4. **Return Result**:
   - Finally, return the count of numbers with an even number of digits.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We pass through the array exactly once, where `n` is the size of the array.
- **Auxiliary Space**: **O(1)**: We use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
