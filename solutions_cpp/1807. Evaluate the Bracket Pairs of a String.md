[Leetcode 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1807)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, and you are given a 2D list `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [key_i, value_i]` contains information that a bracket pair `key_i` should be replaced by `value_i`. Replace all bracket pairs in the string `s` with their corresponding values from `knowledge`.

If you encounter a bracket pair with no corresponding value in `knowledge`, replace it with a question mark `?`.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the keys in `knowledge` unique?**
   - Yes, each key in `knowledge` is unique.
2. **What characters are allowed inside the brackets in `s`?**
   - The brackets contain only alphanumeric characters.
3. **Can the string `s` be empty?**
   - Yes, `s` can be an empty string.

### Strategy:
1. **Data Structure for Lookup:**
   - Use a `unordered_map` to store the `knowledge` for efficient lookups.
   
2. **Traverse the String:**
   - Traverse the string character by character, and when encountering an opening bracket `(`, begin capturing the substring until a closing bracket `)` is found.
   
3. **Replace or Default:**
   - For each captured key inside brackets, look it up in the map and replace it with the corresponding value or `?` if the key is not found.

4. **Rebuild the String:**
   - Construct the resultant string while traversing by appending either characters directly or their replacement values appropriately.

### Code:
Here's an implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string evaluate(string s, vector<vector<string>>& knowledge) {
        unordered_map<string, string> knowledgeMap;
        for (const auto& pair : knowledge) {
            knowledgeMap[pair[0]] = pair[1];
        }

        string result;
        string key;
        bool capturingKey = false;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                capturingKey = true;
                key.clear();
            } else if (c == ')') {
                capturingKey = false;
                if (knowledgeMap.find(key) != knowledgeMap.end()) {
                    result += knowledgeMap[key];
                } else {
                    result += '?';
                }
            } else if (capturingKey) {
                key += c;
            } else {
                result += c;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Building the Map:**
   - This operation takes O(K) time, where K is the number of elements in the `knowledge` list.
   
2. **Traversal and Construction:**
   - The string `s` is traversed exactly once, resulting in an O(N) time complexity, where N is the length of the string `s`.

3. **Overall:**
   - The overall time complexity is O(N + K), which is optimal for this problem.
