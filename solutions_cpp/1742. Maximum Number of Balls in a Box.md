[Leetcode 1742. Maximum Number of Balls in a Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1742)
### Problem Statement

You are working in a ball factory where you have `n` balls numbered from `1` to `n`. Each ball is sent to a box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, ball number `321` will be sent to box `3 + 2 + 1 = 6` and ball number `10` will be sent to box `1 + 0 = 1`. Given two numbers `lowLimit` and `highLimit`, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `lowLimit` and `highLimit`?**
   - `1 <= lowLimit <= highLimit <= 10^5`
   
2. **What is the maximum value for the sum of digits of the ball numbers?**
   - Since the highest value for a ball is `10^5`, the highest sum of digits is `9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 45`.

3. **Are the lowLimit and highLimit inclusive?**
   - Yes, both `lowLimit` and `highLimit` are inclusive ranges.

### Strategy

1. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - For each ball number `i` in the range `[lowLimit, highLimit]`, calculate the sum of its digits.

2. **HashMap for Counting:**
   - We will use an unordered_map to count the number of balls in each possible box.

3. **Finding the Maximum:**
   - Iterate through the map to find the maximum count of balls in any box.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int getSumOfDigits(int num) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (num > 0) {
        sum += num % 10;
        num /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

int countBalls(int lowLimit, int highLimit) {
    unordered_map<int, int> boxCount;
    int maxBalls = 0;
    
    for (int i = lowLimit; i <= highLimit; ++i) {
        int boxNumber = getSumOfDigits(i);
        boxCount[boxNumber]++;
        maxBalls = max(maxBalls, boxCount[boxNumber]);
    }
    
    return maxBalls;
}

int main() {
    int lowLimit = 1, highLimit = 10;
    cout << countBalls(lowLimit, highLimit) << endl;  // Output should be 2
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sum of Digits Calculation:** For each number, the operation to calculate the sum of its digits is `O(log N)` where `N` is the number itself.
- **Iteration through Range:** We iterate from `lowLimit` to `highLimit` which is `O(n)`, where `n = highLimit - lowLimit + 1`.
- **Counting in HashMap:** Insertion and retrieval from an unordered_map are on average `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the iteration and sum of digits calculation, making it `O(n * log N)` where `n` is the range size and `log N` is the max digit sum calculation. 

In the given constraints, this approach will be efficient and work within acceptable limits.
