[Leetcode 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1822)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. Let `product` be the product of all values in the array `nums`.

Return `1` if `product` is positive, `-1` if `product` is negative, and `0` if `product` is zero.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The array length can be up to 1000.

2. **What are the constraints on the values within the array?**
   - Each element in the array is an integer between `-100` and `100`.

3. **Is it necessary to calculate the actual product of the elements?**
   - No, we only need to determine the sign of the product.

### Strategy
To determine the sign of the product of an array without actually computing the potentially large product, we can use the following approach:
1. **Check for Zeros:** If any element is zero, the product is zero, and we return `0`.
2. **Count Negative Numbers:** If the number of negative values is odd, the product will be negative, otherwise, it will be positive.

### Pseudocode
1. Initialize a counter for negative numbers.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If an element is zero, return `0`.
   - If an element is negative, increment the negative counter.
3. After the loop, if the count of negative numbers is odd, return `-1`; if even, return `1`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int arraySign(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int negativeCount = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                return 0;
            } else if (num < 0) {
                negativeCount++;
            }
        }

        if (negativeCount % 2 == 0) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating over the array exactly once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are only using a few integer variables for counting and not utilizing any additional data structures that scale with input size.
