[Leetcode 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1261)
### Problem Statement
You are given a contaminated binary tree, and the contamination spreads as follows:
1. The root value is -1.
2. Each left child of a node in the tree is assigned the value 2 * x + 1, where x is the parent node's value.
3. Each right child of a node in the tree is assigned the value 2 * x + 2, where x is the parent node's value.

Implement a class `FindElements` that:
1. Initializes the tree structure and recovers it.
2. Supports the function `bool find(int target)` that returns if a given integer target exists in the recovered tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How deep can the tree be?
   - Are all values in the tree guaranteed to be non-negative after the recovery?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the `find` function have a specific average or worst-case time complexity requirement?

### Strategy
1. **Tree Recovery Strategy:**
   - Start with the root node; set its value to 0 (recovered root).
   - Recursively set the left child (`2 * x + 1`) and right child (`2 * x + 2`) values based on the current node's value (x).

2. **Efficient Search:**
   - Use a hash set or unordered set to store the values of the recovered tree for efficient O(1) search operations in the `find` function.

### Code
Below is the C++ implementation to solve the problem as per the outlined strategy:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class FindElements {
private:
    TreeNode* root;
    unordered_set<int> recoveredValues;

    void recover(TreeNode* node, int value) {
        if (!node) return;
        node->val = value;
        recoveredValues.insert(value);
        recover(node->left, 2 * value + 1);
        recover(node->right, 2 * value + 2);
    }

public:
    FindElements(TreeNode* root) {
        this->root = root;
        recover(root, 0);
    }

    bool find(int target) {
        return recoveredValues.find(target) != recoveredValues.end();
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Recovery (Constructor):**
  - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
  - Space Complexity: O(n) for storing node values in the unordered_set.

- **Find Operation:**
  - Time Complexity: O(1) on average due to the unordered_set's average O(1) lookup time.
  - Space Complexity: O(1) if we only consider the find operation independently.

This approach ensures efficient recovery of the tree and quick lookup for any target value.
