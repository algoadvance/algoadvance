[Leetcode 2563. Count the Number of Fair Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2563)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **sorted** array of integers `nums`, and two integers `lower` and `upper`. We define a fair pair as a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that:

1. `i < j`
2. `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`

You need to find the number of fair pairs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - Yes, the size of the array can be up to \(10^5\).

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

3. **Are negative numbers allowed in the array?**
   - Yes, the array can include negative numbers.

4. **What is the range of values for `nums[i]`, `lower`, and `upper`?**
   - Elements of `nums`, `lower`, and `upper` can assume any value within 32-bit signed integers.

### Strategy

Given that the array `nums` is already sorted, the two-pointer technique can be effectively used to count the number of fair pairs.

1. Initialize `count` to zero, which will store the number of fair pairs.
2. Use a nested loop with two pointers `i` and `j`:
   - Iterate pointer `i` from the start of the array to the second last element.
   - For each `i`, find the appropriate range of `j` where `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper` using two inner loops:
     - Find the smallest value of `j` (let's call it `L`) such that `nums[i] + nums[j] >= lower`.
     - Find the largest value of `j` (let's call it `U`) such that `nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`.
   - The number of fair pairs for a fixed `i` is `U - L`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countFairPairs(vector<int>& nums, int lower, int upper) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            int left = lower_bound(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end(), lower - nums[i]) - nums.begin();
            int right = upper_bound(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end(), upper - nums[i]) - nums.begin() - 1;

            if (left <= right) {
                count += (right - left + 1);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:

- The outer loop runs `O(n)` times, where `n` is the size of the array.
- For each iteration of the outer loop:
  - The `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` functions run in `O(log n)` time.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for `n` up to \(10^5\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of fair pairs while leveraging the sorted property of the array.
