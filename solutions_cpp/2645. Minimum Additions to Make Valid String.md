[Leetcode 2645. Minimum Additions to Make Valid String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2645)
### Problem Statement
A valid string is defined by the following rules:
1. It only contains the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. The string must follow the pattern "abcabcabc..." endlessly.

Given an input string, you are to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be added to make the string a valid string. 

Example:
- Input: "aaabbcc"
- Output: 4
  - Explanation: We can add 1 'c' and 3 'a's to make "abcabcabc".

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there constraints on the length of the input string?
    - No specific constraints are given in the problem, but we should assume that the string could be very long.

2. Should the solution be optimized for both time and space complexity?
    - Yes, an efficient solution is preferable, keeping computational limits in mind.

3. Is the input guaranteed to be formed of only 'a', 'b', and 'c' or can there be other characters?
    - It is safe to assume that the input only contains 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

### Strategy
The problem can be tackled by examining the input string three characters at a time and ensuring each substring either follows the "abc" pattern or can be modified to follow the pattern with the minimum number of additions.

Steps:
1. Traverse the string in chunks of three characters.
2. For each chunk, determine how far it deviates from the "abc" pattern.
3. Calculate the number of additions needed to make each chunk into "abc".
4. Aggregate the total number of additions required for the entire string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minAdditionsToMakeValidString(const std::string& s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int additions = 0;
    
    // Traverse the string in chunks of 3
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 3) {
        int chunkAdditions = 0;

        // Checking each element in the chunk
        if (i < n && s[i] != 'a') {
            chunkAdditions++;
        }
        if (i + 1 < n && s[i + 1] != 'b') {
            chunkAdditions++;
        }
        if (i + 2 < n && s[i + 2] != 'c') {
            chunkAdditions++;
        }

        // If the current chunk is incomplete
        if (i + 1 >= n) {
            chunkAdditions += (2 - (n - i));
        } else if (i + 2 >= n) {
            chunkAdditions += (3 - (n - i));
        }

        additions += chunkAdditions;
    }

    return additions;
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "aaabbcc"; // Example input
    std::cout << "Minimum additions needed: " << minAdditionsToMakeValidString(input) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traverse the string in chunks, examining each character a constant number of times (specifically, 1-3 times). Therefore, the solution is linear with respect to the number of characters in the string, making it efficient and scalable.
