[Leetcode 420. Strong Password Checker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l420)
### Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem 420: Strong Password Checker**

A password is considered strong if the below conditions are all met:
1. It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
2. It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
3. It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa...", "...$$$...", etc.).

Given a string `password`, return the minimum number of steps required to make it a strong password. If the password is already strong, return `0`. 

In one step, you can:
- Insert one character to the password,
- Delete one character from the password,
- Replace one character with another character.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints and Assumptions:**
   - Are there any constraints on the type of characters that can be included in the password?
   - Is there a specific character set (e.g., ASCII)?
   - Should we consider only alphanumeric characters when validating the various conditions?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the input password is empty?
   - What if the input is already strong? Should we check for optimal performance in such cases?

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int strongPasswordChecker(string password) {
        int n = password.size();
        bool hasLower = false, hasUpper = false, hasDigit = false;
        
        // Check initial conditions
        for (char c : password) {
            if (islower(c)) hasLower = true;
            if (isupper(c)) hasUpper = true;
            if (isdigit(c)) hasDigit = true;
        }
        
        int categories = !hasLower + !hasUpper + !hasDigit;

        if (n < 6) { // Too short
            return max(categories, 6 - n);
        } else if (n <= 20) { // Proper length
            int replacements = 0;
            for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
                if (password[i] == password[i - 1] && password[i] == password[i - 2]) {
                    replacements++;
                    i++; // Skip the next character to break the sequence
                }
            }
            return max(categories, replacements);
        } else { // Too long
            int replacements = 0;
            int deletions = n - 20;
            vector<int> sequences;

            for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
                if (password[i] == password[i - 1] && password[i] == password[i - 2]) {
                    int streakLength = 2;
                    while (i < n && password[i] == password[i - 1]) {
                        streakLength++;
                        i++;
                    }
                    sequences.push_back(streakLength);
                }
            }

            for (int len : sequences) {
                if (deletions > 0 && len >= 3) {
                    if (len % 3 == 0) {
                        deletions--;
                        len--;
                    }
                }
                replacements += len / 3;
            }

            int remainingDeletions = max(0, deletions - (int)(sequences.size() - 1));
            return deletions + max(categories, replacements - remainingDeletions);
        }
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Condition Checks:**
   - Check the types of characters present to determine if there are missing categories (lowercase, uppercase, digit).
   - Categorize the password by its length: less than 6, between 6 and 20, and more than 20.

2. **Short Passwords (`n < 6`):**
   - Handle the case where the password is shorter than the minimum and must be extended. The operations needed will be the maximum of missing categories or the difference to reach length 6.

3. **Proper Length Passwords (`6 <= n <= 20`):**
   - Identify sequences of three or more repeating characters and track necessary replacements required.

4. **Long Passwords (`n > 20`):**
   - Calculate necessary deletions first. 
   - Reduce replacements by modifying repeating characters in groups optimally.
   - Account for any remaining necessary categories after deletions.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the password, as each step involves linear scans and operations based on the length of the password.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for tracking the sequences of repeating characters and other temporary storage.

This approach ensures that we handle passwords of varying lengths and configurations efficiently while meeting all the criteria to make the password strong.
