[Leetcode 2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2147)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 2147: Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor

A long corridor consists of an arrangement of seats and plants represented by a string `corridor` of length `n`. Each character in the string `corridor` is either 'S' (representing a seat) or 'P' (representing a plant). Plants cannot be moved or removed. You want to divide this corridor into non-overlapping sections such that each section contains exactly two seats. You need to find the number of ways to divide this corridor. Return this number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Constraints:**
- \( 1 \leq \text{corridor.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( \text{corridor} \) consists only of characters 'S' and 'P'.


### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the corridor start and end with 'S'?
   - Yes, the corridor can start and end with 'S'.
2. What should we return if it's impossible to divide the corridor as specified?
   - You should return `0` if it's impossible to divide the corridor as specified (e.g., the total number of seats is not even).

### Strategy
1. First, count the total number of seats 'S' in the corridor. If this count is odd, it is impossible to split the corridor into sections each containing exactly two seats. Thus, return 0 in such cases.
2. Track the positions of the seats and calculate how many ways you can create sections by counting the gap between every two pairs of successive 'S' after the first two seats. Multiply these gaps to get the total number of ways modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code
Here's the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfWays(std::string corridor) {
        constexpr int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        int n = corridor.size();
        int seatCount = 0;
        
        // First, count the total number of seats
        for (char c : corridor) {
            if (c == 'S') {
                seatCount++;
            }
        }
        
        // If the total seats count is odd, return 0
        if (seatCount % 2 != 0 || seatCount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Find the number of ways to split the corridor
        long long ways = 1;
        int currentSeatCount = 0;
        int prevSeatIndex = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (corridor[i] == 'S') {
                currentSeatCount++;
                if (currentSeatCount > 2 && currentSeatCount % 2 == 0) {
                    ways = (ways * (i - prevSeatIndex)) % MOD;
                }
                prevSeatIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        return ways;
    }
};
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Count Seats**: Traverse the given string `corridor` to count all 'S' characters.
2. **Check Feasibility**: If total seats are odd or zero, return 0 as it's impossible to have sections with two seats in such a configuration.
3. **Calculate Ways**: Use a loop to process each character in `corridor`. Every time you encounter a 'S' (seat), increment the seat counter. When you encounter the second seat in a current pair, calculate the distance from the previous seat and update the number of ways modularly.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the `corridor` string, because we are traversing the string a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
