[Leetcode 51. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l51)
### Problem Statement

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n√ón` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. 

Given an integer `n`, return all distinct solutions to the `n`-queens puzzle. Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

#### Example:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `n`:** What is the maximum value of `n` we need to consider for this problem?
2. **Unique Solutions:** Are rotations and reflections of the board considered distinct solutions?

### Strategy
We'll use a backtracking approach to solve the problem. Here are the key steps:
1. Use recursion to place queens row-by-row.
2. Track columns, and diagonals where queens are already placed to ensure no two queens can attack each other.
3. Use helper arrays to mark columns and diagonals.
4. For each row, try placing a queen in each column and move to the next row if the position is valid.
5. Backtrack if no valid positions are found for the current row.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath> // For abs()

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        vector<vector<string>> solutions;
        vector<string> board(n, string(n, '.'));
        vector<int> cols(n, 0); // Tracks if a column is occupied by a queen
        vector<int> diag1(2 * n - 1, 0); // Tracks if a diagonal '\' is occupied by a queen
        vector<int> diag2(2 * n - 1, 0); // Tracks if a diagonal '/' is occupied by a queen
        
        backtrack(solutions, board, cols, diag1, diag2, 0, n);
        return solutions;
    }
    
private:
    void backtrack(vector<vector<string>> &solutions, vector<string> &board, vector<int> &cols, vector<int> &diag1, vector<int> &diag2, int row, int n) {
        if (row == n) {
            solutions.push_back(board);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int col = 0; col < n; ++col) {
            if (cols[col] || diag1[row + col] || diag2[row - col + n - 1]) continue;
            
            // Place the queen
            board[row][col] = 'Q';
            cols[col] = diag1[row + col] = diag2[row - col + n - 1] = 1;
            
            // Move to the next row
            backtrack(solutions, board, cols, diag1, diag2, row + 1, n);
            
            // Remove the queen (backtrack)
            board[row][col] = '.';
            cols[col] = diag1[row + col] = diag2[row - col + n - 1] = 0;
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N!)\)
  - The backtracking algorithm tries to place a queen in each column of each row, creating a factorial number of combinations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N^2)\)
  - This is because we store the board configuration for each valid solution, and we're also using extra arrays to track columns and diagonals.

This solution should be efficient and clear for typical input ranges within reasonable \(N\) values expected in interview scenarios.
