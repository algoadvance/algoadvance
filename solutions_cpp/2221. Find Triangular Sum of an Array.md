[Leetcode 2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2221)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the `i-th` value in the array.

You must repeatedly perform the following operation until there is only one element in the array:

1. Create a new array, where each element is the sum of the adjacent elements of the current array. More formally, the new array is such that `newArray[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10`.
2. Replace the current array with the new array.

Return the triangular sum of the array.

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 8
Explanation:
The following steps are performed:
- nums = [1,2,3,4,5] ➞ [3,5,7,9] ➞ [8,2,6] ➞ [0,8] ➞ [8]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should the function handle cases where the input array is empty?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that the input array will have at least one element.
   
2. **Q:** Can the elements in the array be negative?
   **A:** No, the problem ensures all elements of the array are non-negative integers.
   
3. **Q:** What should be the return type of the function?
   **A:** The return type of the function should be an integer representing the final triangular sum.

## Strategy
1. Initialize the current array with `nums`.
2. Continue to generate new arrays as described, reducing the current array in length by one each time.
3. Use the modulo operation to ensure that elements are single-digit integers.
4. Terminate when the array is reduced to a single element, and return that element.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

int triangularSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // While the array length is more than 1
    while (nums.size() > 1) {
        std::vector<int> newArray(nums.size() - 1);
        for (size_t i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            newArray[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
        }
        nums = newArray;
    }
    // The only element left is the triangular sum
    return nums[0];
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. In each step, we reduce the length of the array by 1, and in total, this requires about n steps where each step involves O(n) operations.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) to store intermediate arrays during computation. The space used by the program grows with the size of the input array, but it does not grow beyond the initial size.
