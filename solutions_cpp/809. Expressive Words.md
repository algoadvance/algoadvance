[Leetcode 809. Expressive Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l809)
## Problem Statement

Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as "hello" -> "heeellooo". In these strings, we may have more than one group of repeated characters, for example "heeellooo" -> "heeellooo". Let's define the "stretch" of a group as the length of this contiguous substring. For example, the string "heeellooo" has stretches of "h" -> 1, "e" -> 3, "l" -> 2, "o" -> 3.

Consider the following informal example:
- Original string `S`: "heeellooo"
- Words list: ["hello", "hi", "helo"]

A word is *stretchy* if it can be made to match S by any number of insertions of characters into S. An expressive word must be such that any occurrences of a character can be extended to match `S`.

Formally, we can say a word is stretchy if:
1. For each group of characters in the word, the corresponding group in `S` has at least the same number of characters.
2. If the group in `S`'s length is greater than the group in the word by more than a small amount, then it is stretchable only if the length in `S` is 3 or more.

The task is to write a function that counts how many words from the given list are stretchy for a given string `S`.

**You are given:**
- A string `S`.
- A list of strings `words`.

**You need to return:**
- An integer corresponding to the number of stretchy words in the list.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will the input string `S` and the strings in the `words` list contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, all input strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

2. Is the words list guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, `words` will always contain at least one word.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

bool isStretchy(const string &S, const string &word) {
    int n = S.size();
    int m = word.size();
    int i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < n && j < m) {
        if (S[i] != word[j]) {
            return false;
        }

        int len1 = 0;
        while (i + len1 < n && S[i + len1] == S[i]) {
            len1++;
        }

        int len2 = 0;
        while (j + len2 < m && word[j + len2] == word[j]) {
            len2++;
        }

        if ((len2 > len1) || (len1 < 3 && len1 != len2)) {
            return false;
        }
        i += len1;
        j += len2;
    }

    return i == n && j == m;
}

int expressiveWords(string S, vector<string> &words) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const string &word : words) {
        if (isStretchy(S, word)) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Pointers:** Use two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `S` and the current word respectively.
2. **Check Character Matches:** If characters at `S[i]` and `word[j]` do not match, the word is not stretchy.
3. **Count Consecutive Characters:** Count the consecutive repeated characters in both the original string `S` and the current word.
4. **Stretchy Conditions Check:** 
   - The length of the sequence in `S` must be greater than or equal to the length in the word.
   - If the sequence in `S` is exactly 2 characters long, it can't be stretched unless it's already equal in length to the word's sequence.
   - If the sequence in `S` is 3 or more characters long, it can be stretched as required.
5. **Check End of Strings:** Both pointers should reach the end of their respective strings for the word to be stretchy.
6. **Count Matching Words:** For each word in the list, check if it is stretchy and maintain a count.

## Time Complexity

- **isStretchy Function:** The time complexity is O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `S` and `m` is the length of the word.
- **expressiveWords Function:** The overall time complexity is O(W * (n + m)), where `W` is the number of words, `n` is the length of `S`, and `m` is the average length of the words in the list.

This approach efficiently checks each word in the list and verifies if it's a stretchy version of `S`.
