[Leetcode 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1552)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` balls and an array `position` where `position[i]` represents the position of the i-th ball on a number line. You are tasked with placing all `n` balls into `position` such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximized.

The magnetic force between two balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Return the maximum minimum magnetic force possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `position` array?**
   - The number of balls, `n`, is an integer between `2` and `10^5`.
   - The `position` array can contain values between `1` and `10^9`, and it has a length of at least `n`.

2. **Can the positions array contain duplicates?**
   - No, the `position` array contains unique integer values.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Positions**: First, sort the positions array. This helps in simplifying the determination of the gaps between balls once they are placed optimally.

2. **Binary Search on the Distance**: Use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum magnetic force. The search range will start from `1` (minimum possible force) to the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `position` (maximum possible force).

3. **Check Feasibility**: For a given middle value in binary search, determine if it is possible to place all `n` balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least this middle value. This is achieved by iteratively placing balls at the earliest possible positions that satisfy the distance constraint.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceBalls(const vector<int>& position, int n, int minDist) {
        int count = 1; // Place the first ball in the first position
        int lastPosition = position[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); ++i) {
            if (position[i] - lastPosition >= minDist) {
                count++;
                lastPosition = position[i];
                // If we placed all balls, return true
                if (count == n) return true;
            }
        }
        
        return count >= n;
    }
    
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int n) {
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());
        
        int left = 1; // Minimum possible distance
        int right = position.back() - position.front(); // Maximum possible distance
        int result = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canPlaceBalls(position, n, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1; // Try for a larger minimum distance
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // Try for a smaller minimum distance
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(m * log(m))` where `m` is the size of the `position` array.
- **Binary Search**: The range of the search is from `1` to the difference between the maximum and minimum positions, which is `O(log(max-min))`.
- **Feasibility Check**: Each feasibility check involves a linear scan of `position`, thus `O(m)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(m * log(m) + m * log(max-min))`. Given that sorting dominates, the effective complexity is `O(m * log(m))`.
