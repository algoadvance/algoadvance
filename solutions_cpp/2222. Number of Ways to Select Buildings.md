[Leetcode 2222. Number of Ways to Select Buildings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2222)
### Problem Statement

The problem "2222. Number of Ways to Select Buildings" can be summarized as follows:

You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters '0' and '1'. The string `s` represents buildings where '0' is a residential building and '1' is a commercial building. You need to determine the number of ways to select three buildings such that the first is a residential building ('0'), the second is a commercial building ('1'), and the third is a residential building ('0') again. Similarly, you also need to count the number of ways to select three buildings such that the first is a commercial building ('1'), the second is a residential building ('0'), and the third is a commercial building ('1').

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of the string?
2. **Edge Cases**: Do we need to handle cases where the length of the string is less than 3?
3. **Output Format**: Should the output be a single integer summing both patterns, or two distinct counts?

Given these details, we can start constructing the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the string** to count the number of valid patterns "0-1-0" and "1-0-1".
2. For each '0', keep a count of how many '1's have been encountered so far (`cnt1`).
3. For each '1', keep a count of how many '0's have been encountered so far (`cnt0`).
4. Use these counts to figure out the number of valid subsequences ending at current position.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

long long countWays(const string &s) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (n < 3) return 0;

    long long cnt0 = 0, cnt1 = 0; // counters for '0' and '1' encountered so far
    long long cnt01 = 0, cnt10 = 0; // counters for subsequences '01' and '10'
    long long totalWays = 0; // total number of valid subsequences '010' and '101'

    // Traverse the string to find all valid subsequences '010' and '101'
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '0') {
            totalWays += cnt10; // count '010' subsequences
            cnt0++;
            cnt01 += cnt1; // add subsequences '01'
        } else if (c == '1') {
            totalWays += cnt01; // count '101' subsequences
            cnt1++;
            cnt10 += cnt0; // add subsequences '10'
        }
    }

    return totalWays;
}

int main() {
    string s = "001101";
    cout << "Number of ways to select buildings: " << countWays(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialize Counters**:
   - `cnt0` and `cnt1` to count how many '0's and '1's have been encountered so far.
   - `cnt01` and `cnt10` to count subsequences '01' and '10'.
   - `totalWays` to store the total number of valid "010" and "101" subsequences.

2. **Traverse the String**:
   - For each '0': 
     - Add `cnt10` (count of "10" subsequences) to `totalWays` (forming "010").
     - Increment `cnt0`.
     - Add `cnt1` (count of '1's encountered so far) to `cnt01` (forming new "01" subsequences).
   - For each '1': 
     - Add `cnt01` (count of "01" subsequences) to `totalWays` (forming "101").
     - Increment `cnt1`.
     - Add `cnt0` (count of '0's encountered so far) to `cnt10` (forming new "10" subsequences).

### Time Complexity

The algorithm processes the string in a single pass and maintains constant-time operations for each character. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Space complexity is also O(1) as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space to store counters.

This approach ensures both efficiency and clarity in counting the total number of valid subsequences in the string.
