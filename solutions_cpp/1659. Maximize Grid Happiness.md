[Leetcode 1659. Maximize Grid Happiness](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1659)
## Problem Statement

You have a rectangular grid, and there are three types of cells:

- `introverted` cells can decrease happiness.
- `extroverted` cells can increase happiness.
- `empty` cells do not affect happiness.

You need to maximize the happiness of the grid by placing a limited number of introverted and extroverted people into the grid cells.

Here are the rules governing the happiness changes:
- Each introverted person placed in the grid decreases happiness by an initial value.
- Each extroverted person placed in the grid increases happiness by an initial value.
- Happiness is also affected by adjacent cells:
  - Adjacent (up, down, left, right) introverted persons decrease additional happiness.
  - Adjacent (up, down, left, right) extroverted persons increase additional happiness.

Given the dimensions of the grid, the number of introverted and extroverted people to place, and the initial happiness changes, your task is to maximize the grid happiness.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the specific values for happiness changes for introverted and extroverted people?**
2. **Does the problem guarantee that the number of people (introverted + extroverted) will not exceed the number of cells in the grid?**
3. **Are there constraints on the size of the grid?**
4. **What are the initial values of happiness changes for placing introverted and extroverted people?**
5. **What are the happiness changes due to adjacent placements for both introverted and extroverted people?**

For this explanation, I will assume some values based on typical settings:
- Initial happiness change for placing an introverted person: `-30`
- Initial happiness change for placing an extroverted person: `+20`
- Happiness change for adjacent introverted cells: `-10`
- Happiness change for adjacent extroverted cells: `+5`

## Strategy

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. Given the combinatorial nature of placing people in the grid while maximizing happiness, we can use state compression techniques to efficiently explore all possibilities.

We can maintain a state that includes:
- The current position in the grid.
- The number of remaining introverted people.
- The number of remaining extroverted people.
- The current configuration of the grid (summarized in the last row or column to reduce state size).

### Steps:

1. **Use dynamic programming with state compression**: We will use a DP table where the state is defined by the remaining people to place and the configuration of the previous row or column.
2. **Recursion and memoization**: The function will recursively try to place either introverted, extroverted, or leave a cell empty, and move on to the next cell.
3. **Transitioning between states**: Calculate the resulting happiness change every time a new person is placed and use memoization to store and re-use results of previously computed states.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <tuple>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
    int R, C; // Dimensions of the grid
    int maxInters, maxExters; // Max introverts and extroverts
    unordered_map<tuple<int, int, int, int>, int> memo;

    int dp(int r, int c, int inters, int exters, int prevRow) {
        // base case: when we've placed all introverts and extroverts or filled the entire grid
        if (r == R) return 0;
        
        // Compute the next row and column index
        int nr = (c == C - 1) ? r + 1 : r;
        int nc = (c == C - 1) ? 0 : c + 1;

        // Memoization lookup
        auto state = make_tuple(r, c, inters, exters, prevRow);
        if (memo.count(state)) return memo[state];

        int result = -2e9;

        // Try placing an introverted person
        if (inters > 0) {
            int nextRow = ((prevRow >> c) & C) | (1 << c);
            int happiness = -30; // initial happiness for introverted
            if (r > 0 && ((prevRow >> (C * (r - 1) + c)) & 1)) happiness -= 10; // check top neighbor
            if (c > 0 && ((prevRow >> ((r * C) + (c - 1))) & 1)) happiness -= 10; // check left neighbor
            result = max(result, dp(nr, nc, inters - 1, exters, nextRow) + happiness);
        }

        // Try placing an extroverted person
        if (exters > 0) {
            int nextRow = ((prevRow >> c) & C) | (2 << c);
            int happiness = 20; // initial happiness for extroverted
            if (r > 0 && ((prevRow >> (C * (r - 1) + c)) & 2)) happiness += 5; // check top neighbor
            if (c > 0 && ((prevRow >> ((r * C) + (c - 1))) & 2)) happiness += 5; // check left neighbor
            result = max(result, dp(nr, nc, inters, exters - 1, nextRow) + happiness);
        }

        // Try leaving the cell empty
        result = max(result, dp(nr, nc, inters, exters, prevRow));
        
        // Store result in memo
        return memo[state] = result;
    }

public:
    int getMaxGridHappiness(int m, int n, int introvertsCount, int extrovertsCount) {
        R = m;
        C = n;
        maxInters = introvertsCount;
        maxExters = extrovertsCount;
        memo.clear();
        return dp(0, 0, maxInters, maxExters, 0);
    }
};

// Example Usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.getMaxGridHappiness(2, 3, 1, 2) << endl; // Some example grid and counts
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

Due to the complexity of the problem, let's analyze the time complexity:

- The number of states is combinatorial based on the position in the grid, and the remaining number of people to place.
- The state space includes each cell, each possible number of remaining introverts/extroverts, and the configuration of the last row/column, making it a highly exponential problem.
- Thus, the complexity can be approximated as `O(R * C * maxInters * maxExters * 2^C)` due to the states involved in the grid configuration.

However, due to the memoization, repeated calculations are avoided, making the implementation feasible for reasonably small grid sizes and counts of people.
