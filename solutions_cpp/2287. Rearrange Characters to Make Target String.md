[Leetcode 2287. Rearrange Characters to Make Target String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2287)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `target`. You want to rearrange the characters of `s` to form the string `target`. You can use each character in `s` at most once. Return the maximum number of times you can form `target` from `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input size?**
   - Typically, the length of `s` and `target` can vary up to 10^4 characters.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in `s` and `target`?**
   - Both `s` and `target` will only consist of lowercase English letters.

3. **Should we consider leading or trailing whitespace or casing in the strings?**
   - No, we should assume `s` and `target` consist only of lowercase English letters without any whitespace.

4. **What should be returned if it is not possible to form `target` even once?**
   - You should return `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Calculate the frequency of each character in both `s` and `target`.

2. **Determine the Maximum Formations:**
   - For each character in `target`, check how many times you can form `target` based on the character's frequency in `s`. The limiting factor will be the character that can be used the fewest number of times.

3. **Divide and Minimize:**
   - For every character in `target`, divide the frequency in `s` by the required frequency in `target` and find the minimum value among all these divisions.

### Code

Let's implement this approach in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int rearrangeCharacters(string s, string target) {
    // Create frequency maps for s and target
    unordered_map<char, int> freqS;
    unordered_map<char, int> freqTarget;
    
    // Fill the frequency maps
    for (char c : s) {
        freqS[c]++;
    }
    
    for (char c : target) {
        freqTarget[c]++;
    }
    
    // Initialize the minimum number of target we can form
    int minCount = INT_MAX;
    
    // Compute the maximum number of times we can form target
    for (auto& [charT, countT] : freqTarget) {
        // If s does not contain charT, we cannot form the target at all
        if (freqS.find(charT) == freqS.end()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Calculate the number of times we can use charT
        minCount = min(minCount, freqS[charT] / countT);
    }

    return minCount;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    string s = "ilovecodingonleetcode";
    string target = "code";
    
    int result = rearrangeCharacters(s, target);
    cout << "Maximum number of times we can form the target: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Calculation:** O(n + m)
  - Where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `target`.

- **Checking Max Formations:** O(m)
  - The check involves iterating over the unique characters in `target`.

- **Overall Complexity:** The dominant terms give us O(n + m), which ensures good performance even for larger input sizes up to 10^4 characters.

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum number of times you can form the target `target` from string `s`.
