[Leetcode 1331. Rank Transform of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1331)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank. The rank represents how small the element is. The rank should be a number starting from 1 and representing the relative size of the element compared to the other elements in the array. 

The rank should be calculated such that:
- The smallest element has rank 1.
- If two elements are equal, they should have the same rank.
- The rank should start from 1 and increase sequentially.

**Example:**

```
Input: arr = [40, 10, 20, 30]
Output: [4, 1, 2, 3]

Input: arr = [100, 100, 100]
Output: [1, 1, 1]

Input: arr = [37, 12, 28, 9, 100, 56, 80, 5, 12]
Output: [5, 3, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7, 1, 3]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The problem generally assumes that the array length is within a reasonable range for typical computation, like 1 to 10^5 elements.
   
2. **Are the elements within a specific range of values?**
   - For simplicity, it's safe to assume that the elements are within the bounds of typical 32-bit integers (e.g., -10^9 to 10^9).

3. **Do we need to handle empty arrays?**
   - Usually, yes. If the input array is empty, the output should also be an empty array.

### Strategy

To transform the array into ranks, the steps are:
1. **Copy the array**: Create a sorted version of the array.
2. **Create a rank map**: Assign ranks to each unique element in the sorted array.
3. **Replace elements with ranks**: Map each original element to its corresponding rank using the rank map.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> arrayRankTransform(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) {
        return {};
    }
    
    std::vector<int> sortedArr = arr;
    std::sort(sortedArr.begin(), sortedArr.end());
    
    std::unordered_map<int, int> rankMap;
    int rank = 1;
    
    for (const int& num : sortedArr) {
        if (rankMap.find(num) == rankMap.end()) {
            rankMap[num] = rank++;
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<int> result;
    result.reserve(arr.size());
    for (const int& num : arr) {
        result.push_back(rankMap[num]);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Copy and sort the array**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Creating the rank map**: `O(n)` since we iterate through the sorted array and create map entries.
- **Mapping original elements to ranks**: `O(n)` to iterate through the original array and construct the result.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
