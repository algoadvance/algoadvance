[Leetcode 2760. Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2760)
Sure, let's tackle the LeetCode problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `threshold`, return the length of the longest subarray where:
1. The subarray's elements alternate between even and odd.
2. All elements of the subarray are less than or equal to `threshold`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - From the problem statement, let's assume that the input array `nums` is non-empty.

2. **What should be returned if thereâ€™s no such subarray?**
   - If no valid subarray exists, we should return 0.

3. **Can we have negative numbers in the array?**
   - The problem statement doesn't explicitly restrict that, so we will assume that `nums` can contain negative integers as well.

4. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - Typically, LeetCode problems will have specific constraints on the size of the input (`n`), but we will assume `n` can be large, up to 10^5 or so, common in LeetCode problems.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set up variables to keep track of the current subarray length (`current_length`) and the maximum subarray length (`max_length`).

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - Traverse through the array while checking for alternating even and odd elements.
   - Ensure each element is less than or equal to the threshold.
   - If the current element continues the even-odd pattern and is within the threshold, increment the current length.
   - If it breaks the pattern or exceeds the threshold, reset `current_length`.

3. **Update maximum length:**
   - After each valid extension of the subarray, update `max_length` if `current_length` is greater than the current `max_length`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int longestEvenOddSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int max_length = 0;
        int current_length = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] <= threshold) {
                if (current_length == 0) {
                    current_length = 1;
                } else if ((nums[i - 1] % 2 != nums[i] % 2)) {
                    current_length++;
                } else {
                    current_length = 1;
                }
                max_length = std::max(max_length, current_length);
            } else {
                current_length = 0;
            }
        }
        return max_length;
    }
};

```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. We iterate through the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently finds the longest subarray with the described properties. The `if` conditions handle transitions between even and odd numbers and check for the threshold constraint appropriately.
