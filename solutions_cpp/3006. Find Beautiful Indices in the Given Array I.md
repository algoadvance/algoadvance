[Leetcode 3006. Find Beautiful Indices in the Given Array I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3006)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 1-indexed array of integers `nums`. A beautiful index `i` is defined as an index such that the elements in `nums` at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Return a list of all beautiful indices in the array.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]
Output: [2, 4]
Explanation:
- nums[1] = 3, nums[2] = 2, nums[3] = 4 form the sequence [3, 2, 4], which is not strictly increasing nor strictly decreasing, so 2 is not a beautiful index.
- nums[3] = 2, nums[4] = 4, nums[5] = 5 form the sequence [2, 4, 5], which is strictly increasing, so 4 is a beautiful index.
The beautiful indices are 2 and 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Values**: What is the range of values for `nums` and its length?
   - Assumed constraints: 1 <= `nums.length` <= 10^5 and -10^5 <= `nums[i]` <= 10^5.

2. **Edge Cases**: How should edge cases with very short arrays be handled?
   - Length checks will be added to handle arrays with fewer than 3 elements.

3. **Strictly Increasing/Decreasing Definition**: Should equal elements be considered as breaking the strictly increasing/decreasing rule?
   - Yes, strictly increasing means every subsequent number is greater, and strictly decreasing means every subsequent number is lesser.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through the array starting from the second element to the second last element (`i` from 1 to `n-2` in 0-based indexing).
2. For each element, check if:
   - `nums[i-1] < nums[i] < nums[i+1]` (strictly increasing)
   - `nums[i-1] > nums[i] > nums[i+1]` (strictly decreasing)
3. If either condition is satisfied, add `i+1` to the result (converting to 1-based index).
4. Return the list of beautiful indices.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> findBeautifulIndices(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::vector<int> beautifulIndices;
    
    if (nums.size() < 3) {
        return beautifulIndices; // No beautiful indices possible in arrays shorter than 3
    }
    
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
        if ((nums[i-1] < nums[i] && nums[i] < nums[i+1]) || 
            (nums[i-1] > nums[i] && nums[i] > nums[i+1])) {
            beautifulIndices.push_back(i + 1); // Converting to 1-based index
        }
    }
    
    return beautifulIndices;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we are iterating through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), ignoring the space required for the output, which depends on the input size.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and handles edge cases gracefully by checking the array's length before processing.
