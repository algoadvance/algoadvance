[Leetcode 335. Self Crossing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l335)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers representing the distance of each consecutive move the robot makes. The robot makes moves in the following order: north, west, south, east. The robot continues this sequence indefinitely.

Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, otherwise, return false.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What constitutes the path crossing itself?
   - **A**: The path crosses itself if at any point the robot moves to an intersection point it has previously occupied.

2. **Q**: What should be the output if the path doesn't cross itself?
   - **A**: The output should be false.

3. **Q**: What is the expected input size?
   - **A**: The problem input array can be reasonably large, usually up to a few thousand elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to check for a few specific patterns in the array that indicate the path crossing itself. These patterns have to be checked iteratively as they depend on the robot's previous moves.

The patterns can be summarized as follows:
1. **Fourth Line Crossing First**: 
    - When moving nearly rectangular and the fourth move crosses the path of the first move.
2. **Fifth Line Crossing First**: 
    - A situation similar to the above but involves an extra segment.
3. **Sixth Line Crossing First**: 
    - This involves three pairs of segments with the most complicated interaction.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSelfCrossing(vector<int>& distance) {
        int n = distance.size();
        if (n < 4) return false;

        for (int i = 3; i < n; ++i) {
            // Fourth line crosses first line
            if (distance[i] >= distance[i-2] && distance[i-1] <= distance[i-3]) {
                return true;
            }

            // Fifth line crosses first line
            if (i >= 4 && distance[i-1] == distance[i-3] && distance[i] + distance[i-4] >= distance[i-2]) {
                return true;
            }

            // Sixth line crosses first line
            if (i >= 5 && distance[i-2] >= distance[i-4] && distance[i] + distance[i-4] >= distance[i-2]
                && distance[i-1] <= distance[i-3] && distance[i-1] + distance[i-5] >= distance[i-3]) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the distance array. The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size. 

### Explanation

This approach iterates through the `distance` array once and checks for the three identified crossing patterns:
- The fourth move crossing the path of the first move.
- The fifth move crossing the path of the first move.
- The sixth move crossing the path of the first move.

Because these patterns summarize the constraints required for the path to cross itself, checking for them comprehensively covers all scenarios where the path can cross itself.
