[Leetcode 2997. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2997)
## Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`, you are to find the minimum number of operations required to make the bitwise XOR of the array `nums` equal to `k`. In one operation, you can change any element in the array `nums` to any integer you want.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Do we need to perform the XOR operation on the entire array or can we subset it?**
   - The XOR operation should be performed on the entire array.
2. **Can the elements of the array `nums` be negative?**
   - No, the elements of `nums` should be non-negative integers.
3. **What are the constraints on the size of the array and the value of `k`?**
   - Usually problems like these have the constraints, let’s assume `1 <= n <= 10^3` and `0 <= nums[i], k <= 10^9`.

## Strategy:
1. **Understand XOR Property:** 
   - XOR-ing a number with itself results in `0`.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
   - This means we can rearrange and group operations however we like for simplification.
   
2. **Identify XOR Requirement:**
   - Calculate the current XOR of the array, let's call it `currentXOR`.
   - We need to change the array so that the final XOR result is `k`.
   - Thus, our target XOR for the entire array could be:
     ```
     targetXOR = currentXOR XOR k
     ```
   
3. **Analyze Example:**
   - If `currentXOR` = 5 and `k` = 2, then `targetXOR` = 5 XOR 2 = 7.

4. **Implement Solution:**
   - We know that to toggle bits to get our targetXOR, we can change elements in the array. We need to decide the number of elements to change to achieve `targetXOR`.

5. **Optimization:**
   - The easiest way to ensure the target XOR is achieved might be to change all elements. However, usually, changing a few ideally should be less costly in terms of operations.

6. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - It might always be possible to achieve the `targetXOR` with at most one operation each because we know XOR of the identical number results in 0:
   - Replacing one of the elements with another specifically calculated number.

After these considerations, let’s write the C++ code to implement this logic.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minOperationsToXorEqualK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int currentXOR = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        currentXOR ^= num;
    }

    int targetXOR = currentXOR ^ k;

    // The number of operations needed is the count of bits set in targetXOR
    // Since to fix each bit, it would require flipping all the corresponding elements 
    int operations = 0;
    while (targetXOR > 0) {
        targetXOR = targetXOR & (targetXOR - 1);
        operations++;
    }
    
    return operations;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    int k = 6;
    
    cout << "Minimum Operations: " << minOperationsToXorEqualK(nums, k) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for finding the `currentXOR` is **O(n)**.
- The process of computing the number of set bits in `targetXOR` is **O(log(targetXOR))**, which in the worst case, is **O(log(maxVAL))**, where `maxVAL` is the maximum integer value, typically a constant in competitive environments, thus approximately **O(1)**.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
