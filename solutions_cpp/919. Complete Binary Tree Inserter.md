[Leetcode 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l919)
## Problem Statement

Implement a data structure `CBTInserter` that is initialized with a complete binary tree and supports the following operations:
1. `CBTInserter(TreeNode* root)` Initializes the data structure with the root of a complete binary tree.
2. `int insert(int v)` Inserts a `TreeNode` into the tree with value `v` so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted `TreeNode`.
3. `TreeNode* get_root()` Returns the root of the tree.

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Binary Tree Structure**: Can we assume the existence of a `TreeNode` structure in the initial code base?
   - Yes, we will use the standard `TreeNode` structure provided in LeetCode problems.
   
2. **Initial Tree**: Is the initial binary tree guaranteed to be complete?
   - Yes, the initial binary tree provided in `CBTInserter(TreeNode* root)` is guaranteed to be complete.

3. **Insert Operation**: Should the tree remain complete after every insertion?
   - Yes, the tree must remain complete after each insertion.

## Strategy

To maintain the structure of the complete binary tree during insertion efficiently:
1. **Use a queue**: We can leverage a queue to keep track of the current state of the tree and ensure that the tree remains complete after each insertion.
2. **Track nodes**: Using the queue, we can keep track of which nodes need children. These are the nodes that do not have two children yet.
3. **Insertion Logic**: For each insertion, we will:
   - Take the node from the front of the queue (the parent node).
   - Insert the new node as its left or right child.
   - If both children are now present, remove the node from the queue.
   - Add the new node to the queue as it might need children in the future.

## Code

```cpp
#include <queue>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class CBTInserter {
public:
    CBTInserter(TreeNode* root) {
        this->root = root;
        std::queue<TreeNode*> tempQueue;
        tempQueue.push(root);
        
        // Initially populate the queue with nodes that need children.
        while(!tempQueue.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = tempQueue.front();
            tempQueue.pop();
            
            if (!node->left || !node->right) {
                nodes.push(node);
            }
            
            // Add children to tempQueue for further processing.
            if (node->left) {
                tempQueue.push(node->left);
            }
            if (node->right) {
                tempQueue.push(node->right);
            }
        }
    }
    
    int insert(int v) {
        TreeNode* parentNode = nodes.front();
        TreeNode* newNode = new TreeNode(v);
        
        if (!parentNode->left) {
            parentNode->left = newNode;
        } else {
            parentNode->right = newNode;
            nodes.pop();  // This node now has both children.
        }
        
        nodes.push(newNode); // New node might need children in future.
        return parentNode->val;
    }
    
    TreeNode* get_root() {
        return root;
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* root;
    std::queue<TreeNode*> nodes;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`CBTInserter` constructor)**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. The constructor processes each node to populate the initial queue.
- **Insertion (`insert` method)**: O(1), as inserting a node involves only a constant amount of work: adjusting pointers and possibly updating the queue.
- **Getting root (`get_root` method)**: O(1), as it just returns a pointer/reference to the root node.

This design ensures that each operation is efficient, making the `CBTInserter` class suitable for real-time applications where insertion operations are frequent but the tree structure must remain complete.
