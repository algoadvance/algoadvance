[Leetcode 1305. All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1305)
### Problem Statement

Given two binary search trees, return a list containing all the integers from both trees sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the BSTs contain duplicate values?**
   - No, typically BSTs do not contain duplicate values.

2. **What is the range of values for the integers in the BSTs?**
   - The integers will be within the range that a typical `int` in C++ can handle.

3. **What should the function return?**
   - The function should return a `vector<int>` containing all the elements from both trees sorted in ascending order.

4. **How large can the BSTs be?**
   - The size of the BSTs can range from very small (possibly zero) to quite large (tens of thousands of nodes).

### Strategy

We can break the problem into three main steps:

1. **Traverse each BST:** Perform an inorder traversal of each BST to get the elements in sorted order.
2. **Merge the two sorted lists:** Use the two-pointer technique to merge these two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
3. **Return the merged list:** The resulting list will contain all elements from both BSTs in ascending order.

### Code

Let's implement the solution step-by-step in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to get all elements from two BSTs
    std::vector<int> getAllElements(TreeNode* root1, TreeNode* root2) {
        std::vector<int> elements1 = inorderTraversal(root1);
        std::vector<int> elements2 = inorderTraversal(root2);
        return mergeSortedLists(elements1, elements2);
    }
    
private:
    // Helper function to perform iterative inorder traversal of a BST
    std::vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        std::vector<int> elements;
        std::stack<TreeNode*> stack;
        TreeNode* current = root;
        
        while (current != nullptr || !stack.empty()) {
            while (current != nullptr) {
                stack.push(current);
                current = current->left;
            }
            current = stack.top();
            stack.pop();
            elements.push_back(current->val);
            current = current->right;
        }
        
        return elements;
    }
    
    // Helper function to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list
    std::vector<int> mergeSortedLists(const std::vector<int>& list1, const std::vector<int>& list2) {
        std::vector<int> mergedList;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < list1.size() && j < list2.size()) {
            if (list1[i] < list2[j]) {
                mergedList.push_back(list1[i]);
                i++;
            } else {
                mergedList.push_back(list2[j]);
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        // Append remaining elements
        while (i < list1.size()) {
            mergedList.push_back(list1[i]);
            i++;
        }
        
        while (j < list2.size()) {
            mergedList.push_back(list2[j]);
            j++;
        }
        
        return mergedList;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    // Construct first BST
    TreeNode* root1 = new TreeNode(2);
    root1->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root1->right = new TreeNode(4);
    
    // Construct second BST
    TreeNode* root2 = new TreeNode(1);
    root2->left = new TreeNode(0);
    root2->right = new TreeNode(3);
    
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> result = sol.getAllElements(root1, root2);
    
    // Print result
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    // Clean up dynamic memory (not necessary in interviews but good practice)
    delete root1->left;
    delete root1->right;
    delete root1;
    delete root2->left;
    delete root2->right;
    delete root2;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Inorder Traversal:** The inorder traversal of each tree takes O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Merging Sorted Lists:** Merging two sorted lists takes O(n + m) where n and m are the sizes of the two lists.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m), which is efficient for this problem as it handles all elements linearly.
