[Leetcode 917. Reverse Only Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l917)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, reverse the string according to the following rules:
1. All the characters that are not English letters remain in their original positions.
2. All the English letters (lowercase or uppercase) should be reversed.

Return `s` after reversing it.

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** s = "ab-cd"
- **Output:** "dc-ba"

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
- **Output:** "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
- **Output:** "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the string `s` be empty?  
   **A:** Yes, an empty string is a valid input and should be handled.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the string?  
   **A:** The string length will be between 1 and 100.

3. **Q:** Are the non-letter characters limited to specific ones like `-`, `=`, etc.?
   **A:** No, any character that is not a letter should remain in its position.

### Strategy
1. Use a two-pointer approach to traverse the string from both ends:
   - Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the string.
   - Move these pointers towards each other.
2. While `left` pointer is less than `right` pointer:
   - If the character at `left` is not a letter, move the `left` pointer to the right.
   - If the character at `right` is not a letter, move the `right` pointer to the left.
   - If both characters are letters, swap them and then move both pointers.
3. Continue until the two pointers meet or cross.
4. Return the modified string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>

std::string reverseOnlyLetters(std::string s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = s.length() - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        // Move left pointer to the right if not a letter
        if (!std::isalpha(s[left])) {
            left++;
        }
        // Move right pointer to the left if not a letter
        else if (!std::isalpha(s[right])) {
            right--;
        }
        // Both are letters, so we swap them
        else {
            std::swap(s[left], s[right]);
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return s;
}

// Test cases
int main() {
    std::string s1 = "ab-cd";
    std::string s2 = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj";
    std::string s3 = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!";
    
    std::cout << reverseOnlyLetters(s1) << std::endl; // Output: "dc-ba"
    std::cout << reverseOnlyLetters(s2) << std::endl; // Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
    std::cout << reverseOnlyLetters(s3) << std::endl; // Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the string. We traverse each character at most once using the two-pointer approach.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are modifying the string in place and not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

This approach optimally handles the problem by using a clear and efficient strategy, making it suitable for the given constraints.
