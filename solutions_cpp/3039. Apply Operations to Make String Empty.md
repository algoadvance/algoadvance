[Leetcode 3039. Apply Operations to Make String Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3039)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You must perform operations to make the string empty. In one operation, you can remove a contiguous substring that is a palindrome. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Could the input string be empty initially?**
   - No, the input string `s` will have at least one character.
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - Let's assume the string length is reasonably bounded, e.g., `1 <= s.length <= 1000`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, you can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to make the substring `s[i..j]` empty.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialize DP Table:**
   - If `i == j`, i.e., single character substrings, the minimal operation is removing the single character: `dp[i][j] = 1`.
   
2. **Filling the table for larger substrings:**
   - For substrings of increasing length, check if the whole substring is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, try removing different palindromic substrings and combine the operations.

3. **Merge Operations Efficiently:**
   - If the left and right characters of the substring are the same (`s[i] == s[j]`), check for merging optimal solutions of the inner substring with the ends together.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperationsToEmptyString(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

        // Fill dp for substrings of length 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }

        // Fill dp for substrings of length 2 to n
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; ++length) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; ++i) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = INT_MAX;
                    for (int k = i; k < j; ++k) {
                        dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n-1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^3)**:
- It takes **O(n^2)** to fill the DP table.
- For each cell population, we may need to check all possible partitions, taking **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(n^2)** due to the DP table that stores the results for each substring of the given string `s`.
