[Leetcode 686. Repeated String Match](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l686)
### Problem Statement

**686. Repeated String Match**

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string `a` so that string `b` is a substring of the repeated string. If it is impossible for `b` to be a substring of the repeated `a`, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We need to repeat "abcd" three times to get "abcdabcdabcd", which contains "cdabcdab".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2
Explanation: We need to repeat "a" two times to get "aa", which contains "aa".
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= a.length <= 10^4
- 1 <= b.length <= 10^4
- `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are the strings guaranteed to consist of only lowercase English letters?**
   - A: Yes.

2. **Q: Can `a` and `b` be of equal length?**
   - A: Yes, and they can also be different.

3. **Q: Does the repetition of `a` need to be contiguous to form `b`?**
   - A: Yes, the repetition of `a` should ensure that `b` is a contiguous substring within the repeated string formed by `a`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Repeat Count:** 
   - Start by calculating the minimum number of repetitions of `a` that would cover the length of `b`. This would be `ceil(len(b) / len(a))`.

2. **Checking Substring Presence:**
   - We consider repeating string `a` an extra time (or two), because there may be overlap where `b` starts at the end of one repetition of `a` and continues into the beginning of the next.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Repeat `a` at most `ceil(len(b) / len(a)) + 2` times and check if `b` is a substring within these repetitions.
   - If found, return the number of repetitions.
   - If not found after the maximum number of practical repetitions, return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedStringMatch(std::string a, std::string b) {
        int repeatedCount = std::ceil((double)b.size() / a.size());
        std::string repeatedA = a;
        
        // Initial repeated string to cover length of b
        for (int i = 1; i < repeatedCount; ++i) {
            repeatedA += a;
        }

        // Check if b is a substring of current repeatedA
        if (repeatedA.find(b) != std::string::npos) return repeatedCount;
        
        // Add one more repetition of a to check
        repeatedA += a;
        if (repeatedA.find(b) != std::string::npos) return repeatedCount + 1;
        
        // Add two repetitions of a to consider edge overlaps
        repeatedA += a;
        if (repeatedA.find(b) != std::string::npos) return repeatedCount + 2;
        
        // If still not found
        return -1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::string a = "abcd";
    std::string b = "cdabcdab";
    std::cout << sol.repeatedStringMatch(a, b); // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the repeated `a` up to the length \( O(n \times m) \) where `n` is the length of `a` and `m` is the number of repetitions (at most \( \lceil \frac{m}{n} \rceil + 2 \)).
- Checking for the substring takes \( O(n \times m) \) in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n \times m) \).
