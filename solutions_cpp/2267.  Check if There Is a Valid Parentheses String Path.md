[Leetcode 2267.  Check if There Is a Valid Parentheses String Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2267)
### Problem Statement

Given a `grid` of `size m x n`, consisting of `'('` and `')'` characters only, you can start from any cell in the first row (top to bottom) and move to any cell in the last column (left to right), progressing cell by cell. You can move either down or to the right at any step.

Your goal is to determine if there exists a valid parentheses string path from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last column. A valid parentheses string path follows the regular parentheses matching rules (i.e., every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket that comes after it).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the grid will always contain at least one row and one column?**
   - Yes, the given constraints ensure that `m` and `n` are both at least 1.
   
2. **Are the steps restricted to moving right or down only?**
   - Yes, you can only move down or to the right.

3. **Do we need to verify multiple starting points in the first row?**
   - Yes, you must consider any cell in the first row as a potential starting point.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 3D dynamic programming table `dp[i][j][k]` where:
     - `i` and `j` are coordinates in the grid.
     - `k` represents the balance of parentheses at cell `(i, j)`, i.e., the difference between the number of '(' and ')'.
   - Base Case:
     - If starting from `dp[0][j][1]`, then initialize accordingly based on the '(' or ')' at `(0, j)`.
   - Transition:
     - Update the state `dp[i][j][k]` considering the moves from the left and above.
     - Ensure `k >= 0` at all times (the parentheses balance should not become negative).
   - Result:
     - Check if a valid path exists when reaching any cell in the last column with a balance of 0 (i.e., `dp[i][n-1][0]` is true).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasValidPath(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        if ((m + n - 1) % 2 != 0) {
            return false; // A valid parentheses string must have an even length.
        }

        vector<vector<vector<bool>>> dp(m, vector<vector<bool>>(n, vector<bool>((m + n) / 2 + 1, false)));

        // Initialize the DP table for the starting points
        if (grid[0][0] == '(') {
            // Only valid if it starts with '('
            dp[0][0][1] = true;
        }
        
        // Fill DP table
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                for (int k = 0; k <= (m + n) / 2; ++k) {
                    if (!dp[i][j][k]) continue;
                    if (i + 1 < m) {
                        int new_k = k + (grid[i + 1][j] == '(' ? 1 : -1);
                        if (new_k >= 0 && new_k <= (m + n) / 2) {
                            dp[i + 1][j][new_k] = true;
                        }
                    }
                    if (j + 1 < n) {
                        int new_k = k + (grid[i][j + 1] == '(' ? 1 : -1);
                        if (new_k >= 0 && new_k <= (m + n) / 2) {
                            dp[i][j + 1][new_k] = true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if any path reached the bottom-right corner with a balance of zero
        return dp[m-1][n-1][0];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n * (m + n) / 2)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The 3D DP table uses dimensions `m` x `n` x `(m + n) / 2`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n * (m + n) / 2)` to store the DP state.

This solution ensures that all possible valid paths are considered efficiently using dynamic programming.
