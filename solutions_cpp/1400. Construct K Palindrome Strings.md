[Leetcode 1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1400)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, determine if you can construct `k` palindrome strings using all the characters in `s`. Each character from `s` must be used exactly once and each palindrome string must contain at least one character.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the input?**
   - The input consists of a string `s` and an integer `k`.

2. **Are all characters in the string lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, assume that `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - The output should be a boolean (`true` or `false`), indicating whether it's possible to construct `k` palindromic strings using all characters of `s`.

4. **Can `k` be greater than the length of `s`?**
   - No, if `k` is greater than the length of `s`, it is immediately impossible to construct `k` palindrome strings.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>

bool canConstruct(std::string s, int k) {
    if (s.length() < k) return false;
    
    std::unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        charCount[c]++;
    }
    
    int oddCount = 0;
    for (auto &entry : charCount) {
        if (entry.second % 2 != 0) {
            oddCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return oddCount <= k;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "annabelle";
    int k = 2;
    bool result = canConstruct(s, k);
    std::cout << (result ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Check Length Condition**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than `k`, it's impossible to create `k` palindrome strings. Hence, return `false`.

2. **Character Frequency Counting**:
   - Create an unordered map to count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

3. **Count Odd Frequencies**:
   - Iterate through the frequency map and count how many characters have an odd frequency.

4. **Determine Possibility**:
   - A palindrome string can have at most one character with an odd frequency in its center. Therefore, we need to check if the number of characters with odd frequencies is less than or equal to `k`. If it is, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - Counting the characters takes O(n) time.
  - Iterating through the character count map takes O(26) time, which is essentially constant and can be approximated to O(1) for general complexity considerations.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The unordered map will store at most 26 entries (one for each lowercase English letter), which is also considered constant.
