[Leetcode 2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2385)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree and a target node `start` in the tree. The binary tree is infected by a virus at the `start` node at time 0. The infection spreads from an infected node to its neighboring nodes (i.e., parent, left child, and right child) in one unit of time. The task is to determine the amount of time it will take for the entire tree to be infected.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Definition of neighboring nodes**: Neighboring nodes include the parent and both children of the node.
2. **Tree structure**: Are nodes guaranteed to have a unique value?
3. **Node values**: Can we assume node values are integers and unique within the tree?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we perform a BFS (Breadth-First Search) from the `start` node where the infection begins. This is analogous to finding the maximum depth distance from the starting node using BFS.

Steps:
1. **Build an adjacency list** to represent the binary tree connections.
2. **Find the start node**.
3. **Perform BFS** starting from the start node to compute the time required to infect every node in the tree.
4. **Compute the maximum time** it takes to visit every node, which represents the time to infect the entire tree.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int amountOfTime(TreeNode* root, int start) {
        // Step 1: Build adjacency list
        std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> adjList;
        buildGraph(root, nullptr, adjList);
        
        // Step 2: BFS from the start node
        int maxTime = 0;
        std::unordered_set<int> visited;
        std::queue<int> q;
        
        q.push(start);
        visited.insert(start);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                int node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for (int neighbor : adjList[node]) {
                    if (visited.find(neighbor) == visited.end()) {
                        q.push(neighbor);
                        visited.insert(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
            if (!q.empty()) maxTime++;
        }
        
        return maxTime;
    }
    
private:
    void buildGraph(TreeNode* node, TreeNode* parent, std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>>& adjList) {
        if (!node)
            return;
        if (parent) {
            adjList[node->val].push_back(parent->val);
            adjList[parent->val].push_back(node->val);
        }
        if (node->left)
            buildGraph(node->left, node, adjList);
        if (node->right)
            buildGraph(node->right, node, adjList);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, since we process each node exactly once.
- **BFS**: O(N), since we visit each node once during the BFS traversal.

Overall, the time complexity is O(N).
