[Leetcode 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1761)
## Problem Statement
You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which represents the number of nodes in the graph and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [u, v]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.

A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.

The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges in the graph that are connected to any of the three nodes, but not part of the trio.

Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trio.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on `n` and the size of the edges array?
   - The number of nodes `n` will be between `2` and `400`.
   - The size of the edges array will be between `0` and `min(20000, n*(n-1)/2)`.

2. **Input Format**: Are the nodes labeled from `1` to `n`?
   - Yes, nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**: What should be the output if there are no connected trios in the graph?
   - The output should be `-1`.

With these considerations, we can now move to the solution strategy.

## Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. This will help in quickly checking the existence of an edge between any two nodes.
   - Use an array to store the degree of each node.

2. **Identify Connected Trios**:
   - Use three nested loops to check every possible combination of three nodes `(i, j, k)` to see if they form a connected trio. This can be efficiently checked using the adjacency matrix.

3. **Calculate Degree of Connected Trio**:
   - For each connected trio found, calculate the degree of the trio as described in the problem. This involves counting the number of edges connected to any of the three nodes but excluding the edges within the trio.

4. **Keep Track of Minimum Degree**:
   - Keep a running minimum of these computed degrees to determine the answer.

5. **Output**:
   - If no connected trio is found, return `-1`. Otherwise, return the minimum degree found.

## Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    // Initialize adjacency matrix and degree array
    vector<vector<bool>> adj(n + 1, vector<bool>(n + 1, false));
    vector<int> degree(n + 1, 0);
    
    // Build the graph
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];
        adj[u][v] = true;
        adj[v][u] = true;
        degree[u]++;
        degree[v]++;
    }
    
    int minDegree = INT_MAX;
    
    // Check every possible trio (i, j, k)
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (adj[i][j]) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k <= n; ++k) {
                    if (adj[i][k] && adj[j][k]) {
                        // Connected Trio found
                        int currentDegree = degree[i] + degree[j] + degree[k] - 6; // Subtract 6 for the 3 internal edges
                        minDegree = min(minDegree, currentDegree);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return (minDegree == INT_MAX) ? -1 : minDegree;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **Trio Checking**: Checking each trio involves three nested loops resulting in `O(n^3)` checks.
- **Overall**: The total time complexity of the solution is `O(n^3)`, which is feasible given the constraints.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum degree of a connected trio or identify if no such trio exists.
