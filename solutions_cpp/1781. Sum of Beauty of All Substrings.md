[Leetcode 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1781)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. The **beauty** of a substring is the difference in frequencies between the most and least frequent characters in that substring. Return the sum of the beauty of all substrings of the given string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the string `s` be empty?
   - **A:** No, the string will have at least one character.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of string `s`?
   - **A:** Yes, the length of the string will be between 1 and 500.

3. **Q:** How should we handle substrings with the same character (e.g., `aaa`)?
   - **A:** The beauty of such substrings is 0 since the most and least frequent characters are the same.

4. **Q:** How should we count the frequency of characters for substrings?
   - **A:** For each substring, count the frequency of each character and compute the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies.

### Strategy

To solve the problem:

1. Iterate over every possible starting index `i` of substrings.
2. For each starting index, iterate over every possible ending index `j` greater than or equal to `i`.
3. For each substring starting at `i` and ending at `j`, compute the frequency of each character.
4. Calculate the maximum and minimum frequency for the current substring and update the sum.

This approach ensures that we check every possible substring, which fits into the problem's constraints. The time complexity might be high, but given the constraint (with a maximum string length of 500), this approach is feasible.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int beautySum(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    int totalBeauty = 0;
    
    // Iterate over every possible starting index of substrings
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        // Iterate over every possible ending index of substrings
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            freq[s[j] - 'a']++;
            
            int maxFreq = 0, minFreq = n;
            // Calculate max and min frequency
            for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                if (freq[k] > 0) {
                    maxFreq = max(maxFreq, freq[k]);
                    minFreq = min(minFreq, freq[k]);
                }
            }
            totalBeauty += (maxFreq - minFreq);
        }
    }
    
    return totalBeauty;
}

int main() {
    string s = "aabcb";
    cout << "The sum of beauty of all substrings is: " << beautySum(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(n^3)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is derived from:
- The outer loop iterating \(n\) times.
- The inner loop iterating \(n\) times for each iteration of the outer loop.
- Inside the inner loop, calculating the max and min frequency involves iterating over a fixed size array (26 characters), which is a constant \(O(1)\).

Given the maximum constraint (500 characters), this solution should perform adequately.
