[Leetcode 937. Reorder Data in Log Files](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l937)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words. For each log, the first word is an identifier. 

There are two types of logs:
1. **Letter-logs**: All words (except the identifier) contain lowercase English letters.
2. **Digit-logs**: All words (except the identifier) contain digits.

Reorder the logs such that:
1. The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
2. The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then by their identifiers.
3. The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** How are "logs" represented in the input?
   - **A:** Logs are represented as strings in a vector.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of a log?
   - **A:** Logs can be very large, so we need an efficient sorting strategy.

3. **Q:** Will there always be at least one log in the input array?
   - **A:** Yes, the input will always contain at least one log.

### Strategy

1. **Categorization**: Separate the logs into letter-logs and digit-logs.
2. **Ordering**:
   - For letter-logs:
     - They should be ordered first by their contents lexicographically.
     - If contents are equal, then order by their identifiers.
   - For digit-logs:
     - They maintain their relative order from the input.
3. **Concatenation**: Combine the sorted letter-logs followed by the original order of digit-logs.
4. **Implementation**:
   - Use `std::stable_sort` for maintaining relative order in letter-logs.
   - Split the log into identifier and content for comparisons.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<string> reorderLogFiles(vector<string>& logs) {
    // Lambda function to determine if the log is a digit-log
    auto isDigitLog = [](const string& log) {
        auto pos = log.find(' ');
        return isdigit(log[pos + 1]);
    };
    
    // Separate letter-logs and digit-logs
    vector<string> letterLogs;
    vector<string> digitLogs;
    
    for (const string& log : logs) {
        if (isDigitLog(log)) {
            digitLogs.push_back(log);
        } else {
            letterLogs.push_back(log);
        }
    }
    
    // Custom comparator for sorting letter-logs
    auto compareLetterLogs = [](const string& log1, const string& log2) {
        auto pos1 = log1.find(' ');
        auto pos2 = log2.find(' ');

        string identifier1 = log1.substr(0, pos1);
        string content1 = log1.substr(pos1 + 1);

        string identifier2 = log2.substr(0, pos2);
        string content2 = log2.substr(pos2 + 1);

        if (content1 != content2) {
            return content1 < content2;
        }
        return identifier1 < identifier2;
    };
    
    // Sort the letter-logs with the custom comparator
    sort(letterLogs.begin(), letterLogs.end(), compareLetterLogs);
    
    // Concatenate letter-logs followed by digit-logs
    vector<string> result = letterLogs;
    result.insert(result.end(), digitLogs.begin(), digitLogs.end());
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Separation of Logs**: O(N), where N is the total number of logs.
2. **Sorting Letter-Logs**: O(L log L), where L is the number of letter-logs.
3. **Concatenation**: O(N).

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(N log L), since the log separation and concatenation are linear operations, and the dominant factor is the sorting of letter-logs.
