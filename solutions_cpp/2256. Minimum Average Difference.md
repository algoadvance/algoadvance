[Leetcode 2256. Minimum Average Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2256)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The average difference of the index `i` is the absolute difference between the average of the first `i + 1` elements of `nums` and the average of the last `n - i - 1` elements of `nums`. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,3,9,5,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- The average difference at index 3 is 1. (calculated as above)
- The average difference at index 4 is 1. (calculated as above)
- The average difference at index 5 is 4. (calculated as above)
The minimum average difference is at index 3 & 4. Since 3 is smaller return 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.

2. **What is the expected range of values for `n`?**
   - The value of `n` typically ranges from 1 to \(10^5\).

3. **Do we need to differentiate between the integer division and floating-point division while calculating averages?**
   - Yes, round down both averages to the nearest integer using integer division.

### Strategy

1. **Precompute Prefix Sum Arrays:**
    - Compute a prefix sum array `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums`.
    - We can also compute `total_sum` which is the sum of the entire array.

2. **Iterate Over Possible Indices:**
    - For each index `i`, use the prefix sum to compute the sum of the first `i+1` elements and the sum of the last `n-i-1` elements.
    - Calculate the average for both segments. Ensure to handle the cases where the length of either segment is zero.
    - Compute the absolute difference between the two averages.

3. **Track the Index with Minimum Difference:**
    - Use a variable to keep track of the minimum average difference and update it whenever a smaller difference is found.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int minimumAverageDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<long long> prefix_sum(n, 0);
    
    // Calculate the prefix sums
    prefix_sum[0] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }
    
    // Calculate the total sum
    long long total_sum = prefix_sum[n - 1];
    
    // Variables to track the minimum average difference and its index
    int min_avg_diff = INT_MAX;
    int min_index = -1;
    
    // Iterate over each index to find the minimum average difference
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        long long first_part_sum = prefix_sum[i];
        long long second_part_sum = total_sum - first_part_sum;
        
        // Calculate the average of first part
        int first_part_avg = first_part_sum / (i + 1);
        
        // Calculate the average of second part
        int second_part_avg = (i == n - 1) ? 0 : (second_part_sum / (n - i - 1));
        
        // Calculate the absolute difference
        int avg_diff = abs(first_part_avg - second_part_avg);
        
        // Update minimum average difference and index
        if (avg_diff < min_avg_diff) {
            min_avg_diff = avg_diff;
            min_index = i;
        }
    }
    
    return min_index;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 5, 3, 9, 5, 3};
    int result = minimumAverageDifference(nums);
    cout << "Result: " << result << endl; // Output should be 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array `nums` because we compute the prefix sums in \(O(n)\) and then iterate over the array in \(O(n)\) to compute the average differences.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the storage of the prefix sum array.
