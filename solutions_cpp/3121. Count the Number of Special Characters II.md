[Leetcode 3121. Count the Number of Special Characters II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3121)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, count the number of special characters in it. A special character is defined as any character that is not an alphanumeric character (i.e., not a letter or digit).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected range of the input string length?**
   - The typical length of the input string will be in the reasonable range for typical LeetCode problems, i.e., up to \(10^4\) characters.

2. **What is the nature of the inputs?**
   - The input is a standard ASCII string containing uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and possibly special characters.

3. **Are whitespaces considered special characters?**
   - This problem usually treats whitespaces as special characters unless specified otherwise.

4. **Is the function supposed to be case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, case sensitivity is irrelevant here because we're distinguishing based on the type of character (alphanumeric or not).

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each character in the string:**
   - Check if it's an alphanumeric character using the `isalnum` function provided by C++'s standard library.
   - If it's not an alphanumeric character, count it as a special character.

2. **Return the count of special characters.**

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through each character of the string exactly once.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cctype>  // for isalnum function

int countSpecialCharacters(const std::string &s) {
    int specialCharCount = 0;
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (!std::isalnum(ch)) {
            specialCharCount++;
        }
    }
    return specialCharCount;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    std::string testString = "Hello, World! 123";
    std::cout << "Number of special characters: " << countSpecialCharacters(testString) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Include Headers:**
   - `<iostream>` for input-output operations.
   - `<string>` for using the `std::string` class.
   - `<cctype>` for the `isalnum` function which checks if a character is alphanumeric.

2. **Function `countSpecialCharacters`:**
   - Takes a `const std::string &` as input to avoid unnecessary copying and to ensure the string isn't modified.
   - Initializes a counter `specialCharCount` to zero.
   - Iterates over each character in the string using a range-based for loop.
   - Uses the `isalnum` function to check whether a character is alphanumeric. If not, increments the special character count.

3. **Main Function:**
   - An example usage of `countSpecialCharacters` to test the function.

By following this approach, the function efficiently counts the number of special characters in a given string.
