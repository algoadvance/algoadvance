[Leetcode 2746. Decremental String Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2746)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array `words` containing `n` strings.

Let's define a function `join(x, y)` that returns the smallest string that is a concatenation of `x$ and `y`, where `x$ and `y` are strings.

For example, `join("ab", "bc")` can return "abc" because the smallest string that contains "ab" and "bc" is "abc".

Your goal is to construct the smallest string `s` that contains all the words in the original order by concatenating words one by one using the `join` function starting from the first word.

Return the length of the resulting string.

Example:
```
words = ["ab", "bca", "cab"]
Result: 5
Join "ab" and "bca" to form "abca", then join this with "cab" to form "abcab". The length of "abcab" is 5.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are words case-sensitive?
2. Do we need to handle the case where the resulting concatenation string may not be unique due to multiple smallest strings?

## Code Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int joinLength(string x, string y) {
        // Check the prefix suffix overlap
        for (int i = 1; i <= min(x.size(), y.size()); ++i) {
            if (x.substr(x.size() - i) == y.substr(0, i)) {
                return x.size() + y.size() - i;
            }
        }
        return x.size() + y.size();
    }

    int minLength(string a, vector<string>& words) {
        string result = words[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < words.size(); ++i) {
            result = join(result, words[i]);
        }
        return result.length();
    }
    
    string join(string x, string y) {
        for (int i = min(x.size(), y.size()); i > 0; --i) {
            if (x.substr(x.size() - i) == y.substr(0, i)) {
                return x + y.substr(i);
            }
        }
        return x + y;
    }
};

```

## Strategy

1. **Overlap Calculation**: For each pair of strings `x` and `y`, calculate the maximum possible overlap where the suffix of `x` is the prefix of `y`.
2. **Joining Mechanism**: Create a `join` function where we concatenate the two strings minimizing the length based on the calculated overlap length.
3. **Iterative Join**: Iterate over the array of words and keep joining the current result with the next word.

## Time Complexity

- **joinLength**:
  - Worst-case time complexity of `O(min(x.size(), y.size()))` for calculating overlaps.
  - **join**:
  - Same complexity as above, `O(min(x.size(), y.size()))` for finding prefix and suffix overlaps.
- **Overall**:
  - Assuming `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words: 
    - Outer loop runs `n-1` times
    - Each join operation takes `O(m)`
  - Overall complexity is `O(n * m)`
