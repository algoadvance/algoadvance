[Leetcode 3132. Find the Integer Added to Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3132)
### Problem Statement

You are given a sorted array of distinct integers called `nums` and another integer `target`. The array `nums` originally had an extra integer `x` inserted into it at a random position (even the start or end of the array), followed by elements being right-shifted to keep the array sorted. The target value is the integer that was added to the array. Your job is to identify and return the original integer `x`.

**Constraints:**
- The length of `nums` will be at least 2.
- `nums` contains strictly distinct integers.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order initially.
  
### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the integers in `nums`?**
    - There is no specific range constraint given, but we can assume the values are within the typical `int` range in C++.

2. **Can `nums` have negative values?**
    - Yes, there is no restriction in the problem statement against negative integers.

3. **Is `target` guaranteed to be an integer that was added to `nums`?**
    - Yes, `target` is guaranteed to be the integer that was added to the sorted sequence.

4. **Can the added integer `target` be any of the bounds (the start or the end of the array)?**
    - Yes, the integer `target` can be added at any position including the start or end of the array.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Potential Position for Insertion:**
    - Since the array `nums` was originally sorted, the inserted `target` value will create exactly one "anomaly" where the ordered relationship is broken.
   
2. **Determine the Position of the Anomaly:**
    - The position where `nums[i-1] > nums[i]` will indicate the location of the insertion of `target`.

3. **Handle Edge Cases:**
    - If no such anomaly is found during iteration, the inserted integer could be either the smallest or largest value:
        - **Smallest Value:** If `nums[0] > target`, then `target` was inserted at the beginning.
        - **Largest Value:** If `nums[n-1] < target`, then `target` was inserted at the end.

4. **Check Conditions:**
    - If the anomaly position is found, the `target` will be `nums[i]`.
    - Otherwise, based on comparison with the bounds of the array, determine the value of `target`.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** Where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we might need to iterate through the entire array once to find the anomaly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int findInsertedInteger(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();

    // Check for the anomaly in the array
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i-1] > nums[i]) {
            return nums[i];
        }
    }

    // If no anomaly found, check if target is the smallest or largest value
    if (nums[0] > nums[1]) {
        return nums[0];
    }
    if (nums[n-1] < nums[n-2]) {
        return nums[n-1];
    }

    return -1; // This should never be reached given the constraints
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9};
    int target = findInsertedInteger(nums);
    std::cout << "Inserted integer: " << target << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We iterate through the array `nums` to find the point where the order is disrupted, which indicates the position of the inserted element.
- If we don't find such a point, we check if the disruption might be at the beginning or end of the array.
- Finally, we return the identified target value.
