[Leetcode 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1493)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, the input array is guaranteed to have at least one element.
   
2. **Are the elements of the array guaranteed to be either 0 or 1?**
   - Yes, the array contains only 0s and 1s.
   
3. **What is the expected time complexity?**
   - A solution with linear time complexity, i.e., O(n), is expected.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: 
   - We'll use a sliding window to effectively find the longest subarray of 1's where one 0 has been deleted.
   
2. **Window Management**:
   - Maintain a window with at most one 0.
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the window.
   - Use a counter to keep track of the number of zeros within the current window.
   - When the number of zeros exceeds one, shrink the window from the left until there's at most one zero.
   
3. **Track the Maximum Length**:
   - Track the length of the longest subarray encountered during the process.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int zeroCount = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        while (right < nums.size()) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
            
            while (zeroCount > 1) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, right - left);
            right++;
        }
        
        // In the end if the window contains the entire array and has no zero, we need to delete one element
        return (maxLength == nums.size() - 1) ? maxLength : maxLength - 1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We are visiting each element at most twice (once with `right` and at most once with `left`), leading to linear time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We are using a few extra variables, but the space required does not scale with input size. Therefore, it is constant space complexity.
