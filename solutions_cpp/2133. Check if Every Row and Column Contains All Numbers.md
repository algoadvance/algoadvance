[Leetcode 2133. Check if Every Row and Column Contains All Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2133)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `matrix`. Return `true` if every row and every column contains all the integers from `1` to `n` (inclusive), otherwise return `false`.

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[3,1,2],[2,3,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: In this case, n is 3, and every row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, which meets the requirement.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,2,3],[1,2,3]]
Output: false
Explanation: In this case, n is 3, but the first row contains three 1s instead of the numbers 1, 2, and 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions

To ensure full understanding of the problem, let's clarify any possible confusion:

1. Are all the numbers within the range from `1` to `n` in each row and column, or do we need to check for any kind of invalid values?
   - We only need to check for values between `1` and `n` in each row and column.

2. Can `n` be 1, and if so, will a `1x1` matrix with value `1` be considered valid?
   - Yes, `n` can be 1, and a `1x1` matrix with value `1` should be considered valid.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Iterate through each row and check if it contains all integers from `1` to `n`.
2. Iterate through each column and check if it contains all integers from `1` to `n`.

We can utilize sets to check for the presence of each number efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Create a set of numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. For each row, convert the row to a set and compare it with our number set.
3. For each column, do the same by creating a set of values in the column and compare it with our number set.

### Code

Here is the C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

bool checkValid(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& matrix) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    std::unordered_set<int> expectedValues;
    
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        expectedValues.insert(i);
    }
    
    // Check rows
    for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        std::unordered_set<int> rowValues(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
        if(rowValues != expectedValues) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Check columns
    for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        std::unordered_set<int> colValues;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            colValues.insert(matrix[i][j]);
        }
        if(colValues != expectedValues) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is determined by the need to create sets for each row and each column, resulting in `O(n^2)`:

- Creating `expectedValues` set is `O(n)`.
- Checking each row takes `O(n)` per row, so `O(n^2)` for all rows.
- Checking each column takes `O(n)` per column, so `O(n^2)` for all columns.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.
