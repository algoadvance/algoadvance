## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 389: **Find the Difference**

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by randomly shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

### Example:
- Input: `s = "abcd"`, `t = "abcde"`
- Output: `e`

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `s` be an empty string?**
   - Yes, `s` can be an empty string, and in that case, `t` will have one letter.
   
2. **Do we need to worry about non-alphabet characters?**
   - No, the problem states that `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **What if the strings are very large?**
   - The problem constraints ensure that `s.length` is at most 1000. Performance should be considered within these constraints.

## Strategy

### Approach:
We can solve this problem efficiently using the following methods:

1. **Counting Characters Approach**:
   - Use an array to count occurrences of each character in `s` and `t`.
   - The extra character in `t` will have a count difference due to being added.

2. **Bit Manipulation (XOR) Approach**:
   - Use the XOR operation to find the different character.
   - XORing all characters in both strings will cancel out the characters that appear twice (i.e., those in `s` and `t`), and only the extra character will remain.

### Implementation:

We'll use the bit manipulation approach for its simplicity and efficiency.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

char findTheDifference(std::string s, std::string t) {
    char res = 0;
    for(char c : s) {
        res ^= c;
    }
    for(char c : t) {
        res ^= c;
    }
    return res;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abcd";
    std::string t = "abcde";
    std::cout << "The added letter is: " << findTheDifference(s, t) << std::endl; // Output: e
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of string `s` (and by extension, `t` is `n+1`). This is because we are iterating through all characters in both strings exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures an efficient and clear solution to the problem.
