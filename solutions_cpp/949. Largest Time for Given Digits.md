[Leetcode 949. Largest Time for Given Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l949)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr` of 4 digits. Your task is to return the largest 24-hour time that can be made using each digit exactly once. If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:** 
   - Is the input array always valid with exactly 4 digits?
   
   Yes, the input array is always valid with exactly 4 digits.

2. **Output Format:** 
   - Should the time be in "HH:MM" format as a string?
   
   Yes, the time should be in "HH:MM" format as a string.

3. **Constraints:**
   - Are all the inputs integers in the range 0 to 9?
   
   Yes, all the inputs are integers in the range 0 to 9.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if it's impossible to form a valid time?
   
   In that case, we should return an empty string.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. Generate all permutations of the 4 digits.
2. For each permutation, check if it can form a valid 24-hour time.
3. The valid time should be in the format "HH:MM" where:
   - `HH` is between 00 and 23.
   - `MM` is between 00 and 59.
4. Track the maximum valid time found during the process.
5. Return the maximum valid time in the required format.

### Time Complexity
- Generating all permutations of 4 digits will result in `4!` (24) possibilities.
- Checking each permutation for validity is done in constant time.
- Thus, the total complexity is O(1) as 24 permutations is a constant factor.

Here's how you could implement this in C++:

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

std::string largestTimeFromDigits(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());  // Sort the digits
    std::string max_time = "";
    
    do {
        // Construct hours and minutes from the permutation
        int hours = arr[0] * 10 + arr[1];
        int minutes = arr[2] * 10 + arr[3];
        
        // Check if the time is valid
        if (hours < 24 && minutes < 60) {
            // Format the time as HH:MM
            std::string time = (hours < 10 ? "0" : "") + std::to_string(hours) + ":" +
                               (minutes < 10 ? "0" : "") + std::to_string(minutes);
            if (time > max_time) {
                max_time = time;  // Update the maximum valid time
            }
        }
    } while (std::next_permutation(arr.begin(), arr.end()));
    
    return max_time;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> digits = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    std::string result = largestTimeFromDigits(digits);
    std::cout << "The largest time is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code:
1. Sorts the digits initially.
2. Uses `std::next_permutation` to generate all possible permutations of the digits.
3. Constructs potential hour and minute values from each permutation.
4. Checks if the constructed time is valid and keeps track of the maximum valid time.
5. Returns the largest valid time found, or an empty string if no valid time exists.
