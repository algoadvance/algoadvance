[Leetcode 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1123)
### Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of its deepest leaves.

The Lowest Common Ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, we can return `nullptr`.
   
2. **Do all leaves have the same depth in this problem?**
   - No, leaves can be at different depths.

3. **What is the definition of a leaf in this context?**
   - A leaf is a node with no children.

### Strategy:
1. **Find the Depth of the Deepest Leaves:**
   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to determine the depth of the deepest leaves.

2. **Finding the LCA of the Deepest Leaves:**
   - Use DFS to keep track of the depth while traversing.
   - Whenever the deepest depth is encountered, return the node.
   - If both children return non-null values at the deepest level, the current node is the LCA.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root).second;
    }
    
private:
    std::pair<int, TreeNode*> dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return {0, nullptr};
        
        auto left = dfs(node->left);
        auto right = dfs(node->right);
        
        int leftDepth = left.first;
        int rightDepth = right.first;
        
        if (leftDepth == rightDepth) {
            return {leftDepth + 1, node};
        } else if (leftDepth > rightDepth) {
            return {leftDepth + 1, left.second};
        } else {
            return {rightDepth + 1, right.second};
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- The solution is based on performing DFS on the given binary tree, resulting in a time complexity of \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space utilized by the recursive stack. 

This solution first calculates the maximum depth and then uses it to find the lowest common ancestor by keeping track of the node depth during DFS traversal.
