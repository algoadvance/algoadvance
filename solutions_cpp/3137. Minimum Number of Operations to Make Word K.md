[Leetcode 3137. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3137)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You are interested in making `s` k-periodic, meaning every `k`-th character should be the same. You can achieve this by changing some characters in `s`. Your task is to find the minimum number of changes required to make `s` k-periodic.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the length constraints on the string `s`? 
   - What are the range constraints for integer `k`?

2. **Character Constraints:**
   - Does the string only contain lowercase English letters?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should we return if `k` is greater than the length of the string, or if `s` is empty?

Assuming the following based on typical constraints:
- `1 <= k <= |s|`
- `1 <= |s| <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Grouping Characters by Modulo Class:**
   - We will group characters in positions `(i + j*k)` together for each `j`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`.
   
2. **Counting Frequency:**
   - For each group `(i + j*k)`, identify the most frequent character in the group.
   
3. **Calculate Minimum Changes:**
   - We count how many changes are necessary to make all characters in each group the same as the most frequent character.

### Detailed Steps
1. Initialize an array of vectors to hold character counts for each of the `k` groups.
2. Loop through the string and populate the counts for each group based on their modulo class.
3. For each group, calculate how many characters need to be changed to match the most frequent character in the group.
4. Sum up the changes needed for all groups to get the final result.

### Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

int minChangesToKPeriodic(const std::string& s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    std::vector<std::unordered_map<char, int>> freq(k);

    // Populate the frequency maps for each of the k groups.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        freq[i % k][s[i]]++;
    }

    int result = 0;

    // Compute the number of changes needed for each group.
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int total = 0;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (const auto& pair : freq[i]) {
            total += pair.second;
            if (pair.second > maxFreq) {
                maxFreq = pair.second;
            }
        }
        // The number of changes required for this group
        result += (total - maxFreq);
    }

    return result;
}

// Test example
int main() {
    std::string s = "aabcaabc";
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << "Minimum changes to make the string k-periodic: " << minChangesToKPeriodic(s, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Frequency Computation:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Change Calculation:** O(k) for the maximum frequency calculation and total frequency summation.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n + k)**, which is efficient given typical constraints (`k <= n`).

### Space Complexity
- **Frequency Storage:** O(k*|Σ|) where |Σ| is the size of the character set (26 for lowercase English).
- This is effectively O(k) since |Σ| is constant.

The strategy efficiently calculates the minimum number of changes by leveraging frequency counting and grouping by modulo class, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.
