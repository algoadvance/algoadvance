[Leetcode 2911. Minimum Changes to Make K Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2911)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the task is to split the string `s` into `k` contiguous substrings so that each substring becomes a palindrome. However, since direct splitting might not make all the substrings palindromes, you are allowed to change some characters in the substrings. The objective is to minimize the total number of changes required to achieve this.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000)?
   - What is the range of `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ length of `s`)?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return the minimum number of changes required as an integer?

3. **Examples**:
   - Could you provide a few examples with edge cases (e.g., smallest and largest values for k)?

4. **Changes**:
   - Does changing a single character at a time count as one change?

## Strategy

The problem can be solved by employing a dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Palindrome Cost Calculation**: 
   - First, create a helper function to calculate the minimum changes needed to convert any substring `s[i..j]` into a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - Use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum changes needed to split the substring `s[0..i]` into `j+1` palindromic substrings.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - Iterate through the string and update the `dp` table using:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[m][j-1] + cost to convert s[m+1..i] to a palindrome)
     ```
   - Where `m` ranges from `j-1` to `i-1`.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The result will be in `dp[n-1][k-1]` where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of required palindromic substrings.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k` equals the length of `s`, each character is a palindrome.
   - When `k` equals 1, the whole string needs to be converted to a palindrome.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to calculate the cost to convert s[i..j] into a palindrome
int min_changes_to_palindrome(const string& s, int i, int j) {
    int changes = 0;
    while (i < j) {
        if (s[i] != s[j]) {
            ++changes;
        }
        ++i;
        --j;
    }
    return changes;
}

int minChangesToMakeKSemiPalindromes(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();

    // Base case when k == length of the string
    if (k == n) return 0;

    // Create the cost matrix
    vector<vector<int>> cost(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            cost[i][j] = min_changes_to_palindrome(s, i, j);
        }
    }

    // Initialize the dp table
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(k, INT_MAX));
    
    // Fill the dp table
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = cost[0][i]; // single partition case
        for (int j = 1; j < k; ++j) {
            for (int m = i; m >= j; --m) {
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[m-1][j-1] + cost[m][i]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n-1][k-1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Palindrome Cost Calculation**:
   - O(n^2) to fill out the cost matrix.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - O(n^2 * k) to iteratively update the dp table.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n^2 * k), making it feasible for the constraint where n ≤ 1000. This will handle up to one million operations efficiently within competitive programming limits.
