[Leetcode 206. Reverse Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l206)
### Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What type of data does the linked list store?** - The linked list stores integers.
2. **Is the input list guaranteed to be non-null?** - No, the list can be empty (i.e., the head can be `nullptr`).
3. **Should we modify the original list or create a new reversed list?** - We should reverse the list in place.
4. **Are there any constraints on the length of the linked list?** - No explicit constraints, but typical constraints from the problem's environment apply, e.g., memory and stack size.

### Strategy
To reverse the linked list iteratively:
1. Initialize three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`.
2. Traverse through the linked list. For each node, adjust its `next` pointer to point to the previous node (`prev`).
3. Move the pointers one step forward repeatedly until all the nodes have been reversed.
4. Finally, return the new head of the reversed list, which is the last non-null node encountered.

### Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            // Store the next node
            ListNode* nextTemp = curr->next;
            // Reverse the current node's pointer
            curr->next = prev;
            // Move pointers one step forward
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse each node exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant number of extra pointers.
