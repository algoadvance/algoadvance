[Leetcode 3114. Latest Time You Can Obtain After Replacing Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3114)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `time` in the format of "hh:mm", where some of the digits in the string may be replaced by `?` (question mark). The valid times are in the range of "00:00" to "23:59". Return the latest valid time you can obtain by replacing the `?` with digits.

Example:
- Input: time = "2?:?0"
- Output: "23:50"

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input guaranteed to follow the "hh:mm" format?
   - Should we consider just cases within the range "00:00" to "23:59"?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What is the behavior if `time` contains no `?`?
   - Should we handle multiple `?` in any particular sequence?

## Strategy

1. **Identify the Positions:**
   - `time[0]`: First digit of the hour.
   - `time[1]`: Second digit of the hour.
   - `time[3]`: First digit of the minute.
   - `time[4]`: Second digit of the minute.

2. **Replace Characters from Left to Right for Maximum Value:**
   - For `time[0]`: 
     - Can be '2' if `time[1]` is either '?' or in the range '0'-'3'.
     - Otherwise, '1'.
   - For `time[1]`:
     - If `time[0]` is '2', `time[1]` can be in the range '0'-'3'.
     - Otherwise, it can be '9'.
   - For `time[3]`: Regardless of the hour, it can be '5'.
   - For `time[4]`: Regardless of other digits, it can be '9'.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string maximumTime(string time) {
    // Handle the hours part
    if (time[0] == '?') {
        time[0] = (time[1] == '?' || time[1] <= '3') ? '2' : '1';
    }
    if (time[1] == '?') {
        time[1] = (time[0] == '2') ? '3' : '9';
    }

    // Handle the minutes part
    if (time[3] == '?') {
        time[3] = '5';
    }
    if (time[4] == '?') {
        time[4] = '9';
    }

    return time;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    string time = "2?:?0";
    cout << "Latest time: " << maximumTime(time) << endl; // Output: "23:50"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)**, which means it runs in constant time regardless of the input. This efficiency is due to the fixed number of operations we perform since `time` will always have a fixed length of 5 characters.
