[Leetcode 2845. Count of Interesting Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2845)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers, and two integers `k` and `mod`. A subarray of `nums` is referred to as "interesting" if the number of elements in the subarray that are divisible by `k` is divisible by `mod`. You need to find and return the count of such interesting subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs**:
   - What are the constraints on the array length? 
   - What are the possible values for elements in the array, `k`, and `mod`?

2. **Examples for Better Understanding**:
   - Could you provide a few examples of the input and expected output to ensure a clear understanding of the problem statement?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be the output when the array is empty?
   - What should be the output when no subarrays are interesting?

Assuming you provided some more details but since I canâ€™t converse with you directly, let's assume:
- The length of `nums` will be between 1 and 100,000.
- The elements of `nums` can be any integer.
- `k` and `mod` are both positive integers and `1 <= k, mod <= 100,000`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage a prefix sum approach combined with hashing:

1. **Identify Divisibility**: First, convert each element in `nums` into a binary-like array where each element is `1` if it's divisible by `k`, and `0` otherwise.

2. **Prefix Sum and Modulo Operation**: Compute a prefix sum over this binary array and take each prefix sum modulo `mod`.

3. **Hashmap for Frequency Counting**: Utilize a hashmap to count occurrences of each modulo result observed in the prefix sums. The idea is to check for subarrays whose sums (mod `mod`) equal these observed values.

Here's a more detailed step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a HashMap to count frequencies of prefix sums modulo `mod`.
2. Traverse through the binary-like array, compute the running prefix sum, and update the hashmap.
3. Count subarrays that meet the criteria by checking the hashmap for appropriate prefix sums.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countInterestingSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k, int mod) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> binary(nums.size(), 0);
        
        // Convert to binary-like array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            binary[i] = (nums[i] % k == 0) ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumCount;
        prefixSumCount[0] = 1; // Base case for subarrays starting from index 0
        int prefixSum = 0;
        int interestingCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum += binary[i];
            int modulo = prefixSum % mod;
            
            if (prefixSumCount.find(modulo) != prefixSumCount.end()) {
                interestingCount += prefixSumCount[modulo];
            }
            
            prefixSumCount[modulo]++;
        }
        
        return interestingCount;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we are making a single pass through the array to compute the prefix sums and simultaneously updating/checking the hashmap.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(mod)`, for storing the hashmap entries. Since `mod` can be a large number, in the worst case, it could contribute significantly to space usage but typically, it stays manageable within constraints.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the count of interesting subarrays even for large input sizes.
