[Leetcode 575. Distribute Candies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l575)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 575: **Distribute Candies**

Alice has `n` candies, where the candies are represented by an integer array `candyType` of length `n`. Each candy is of a different type, indicated by different integers. Alice wants to eat `n / 2` candies, but she also wants to eat as many different types of candies as possible. Return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats `n / 2` candies.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is it guaranteed that the length of the array `n` is always even?
    - Are there any constraints on the range of values for `candyType`?

2. **Output**:
    - Can Alice eat fewer than `n / 2` candies if it allows her to eat more types?

### Example

Let's assume:
- Input: `candyType = [1,1,2,2,3,3]`
- Output: `3`

Explanation:
- Alice can eat up to `n / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3` candies. 
- The most types she can eat are 3 types (since there are exactly 3 different types).

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Different Strategy**:
    - First, count the number of unique candy types.
    - Alice can eat `n / 2` candies but she also wants to maximize the number of different types.
    - The result will be the minimum between the unique candy types and `n / 2` because she can't eat more types than candies allowed.

2. **Algorithm**:
    - Calculate `n / 2` where `n` is the length of `candyType`.
    - Use a set to find the unique types of candies.
    - Compare the size of the set with `n / 2` and return the smaller number.

3. **Efficient Implementation**:
    - Using a set provides average O(1) time complexity for insertions and lookups, which will help us quickly count unique types.
    - Space complexity is O(k) where k is the number of unique types.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity will be O(n) due to the single pass over the list to insert in the set.
- Space complexity will be O(k), where k is the number of unique candy types.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int distributeCandies(vector<int>& candyType) {
        unordered_set<int> uniqueCandies(candyType.begin(), candyType.end());
        int maxCandiesAliceCanEat = candyType.size() / 2;
        
        // The maximum number of different types Alice can eat
        return min(maxCandiesAliceCanEat, (int)uniqueCandies.size());
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Calculate `n / 2` which represents the maximum number of candies Alice can eat.

2. **Use of Unordered Set**:
    - By inserting the elements of `candyType` into an unordered set, we automatically filter out duplicates and get the count of unique candy types.

3. **Return the Result**:
    - The answer is the minimum value between the number of unique candy types and `n / 2`.

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of different types of candies Alice can eat while adhering to the constraint of eating no more than `n / 2` candies.
