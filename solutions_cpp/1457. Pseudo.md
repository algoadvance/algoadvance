[Leetcode 1457. Pseudo](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1457)
### Problem Statement
You are given the `root` of a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at most one digit has an odd frequency during that path. Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a leaf node?**
   - A leaf node is a node with no children.

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - The problem statement does not explicitly say, but typically for binary tree problems, if the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `nullptr`), the answer should be 0.

3. **What is the maximum height of the tree?**
   - Assuming a maximum height typical for binary trees in such problems, let's consider a height reasonably large (e.g., 10^4 nodes, considering the node values are between 1 and 9).

4. **Is there any specific constraint on the values of the nodes?**
   - Yes, nodes contain values strictly between 1 and 9.

### Strategy
1. **Traversal Method:** We'll use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all paths from the root to leaf nodes.
2. **Frequency Counter:** Maintain a counter to track occurrences of each digit (1 through 9) in the current path.
3. **Check Pseudo-Palindromic Path:** Before finalizing each path, we will check if the path is pseudo-palindromic by ensuring at most one digit has an odd count.

### Code Implementation
Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, std::vector<int>& count) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        // Increment the count for this node's value
        count[node->val]++;

        int pathCount = 0;
        
        // If this is a leaf node, check if the path is pseudo-palindromic
        if (!node->left && !node->right) {
            int oddCount = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
                if (count[i] % 2 != 0) {
                    oddCount++;
                }
                if (oddCount > 1) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (oddCount <= 1) {
                pathCount = 1;
            }
        } else {
            // Continue the DFS on child nodes
            pathCount += dfs(node->left, count);
            pathCount += dfs(node->right, count);
        }

        // Decrement the count as we return back
        count[node->val]--;

        return pathCount;
    }

public:
    int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode* root) {
        std::vector<int> count(10, 0); // To store the counts of digits 1-9
        return dfs(root, count);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This space is used for the recursion stack and the `count` vector.

This approach ensures that each node is processed efficiently with constant-time operations for counting and checking the digit frequencies.
