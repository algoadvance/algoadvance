[Leetcode 2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2224)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two 24-hour times in the format "HH:MM." The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to convert `current` to `correct`. You can only perform the following operations:

1. Add 1 minute.
2. Add 5 minutes.
3. Add 15 minutes.
4. Add 60 minutes.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to transform `current` into `correct`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is it guaranteed that `current` and `correct` will be valid 24-hour format times?
   - Can `current` and `correct` be the same initial times?

2. **Output Range:**
   - What is the range of operation counts we should expect to handle?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Are there any edge cases such as transitioning from one day to the next (i.e., from 23:59 to 00:00)?

## Strategy

1. **Convert Time to Minutes:**
   - Convert both `current` and `correct` times into the total number of minutes past midnight for easier comparison and manipulation.

2. **Calculate Difference:**
   - Determine the difference in minutes between the `current` and `correct` times.

3. **Minimize Operations:**
   - Use a greedy approach to minimize the number of operations. Start with the largest allowable operation (60 minutes), then 15 minutes, then 5 minutes, and finally 1 minute. This will reduce the difference in the fewest number of steps.

## Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>

int convertTime(const std::string& current, const std::string& correct) {
    // Helper function to convert "HH:MM" time format to minutes past midnight.
    auto toMinutes = [](const std::string& time) {
        int hours = std::stoi(time.substr(0, 2));
        int minutes = std::stoi(time.substr(3, 2));
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };

    int currentMinutes = toMinutes(current);
    int correctMinutes = toMinutes(correct);

    int difference = std::abs(correctMinutes - currentMinutes);  // Ensure non-negative difference

    int operations = 0;
    int increments[] = {60, 15, 5, 1};  // Available increments

    // Apply the maximum possible increment each time
    for (int inc : increments) {
        operations += difference / inc;
        difference %= inc;
    }

    return operations;
}

// For test purposes
int main() {
    std::string current = "02:30";
    std::string correct = "04:35";
    std::cout << "Minimum operations: " << convertTime(current, correct) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the number of operations is bounded by a constant (4 different increments) regardless of the input size. The main work — converting times and calculating operations — involves simple arithmetic and remains constant time.

By following this strategy, we ensure an optimal, efficient solution to convert the given time in the fewest number of operations.
