[Leetcode 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l154)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order and then possibly rotated. Find the minimum element in this array. The array may contain duplicates.

For example:
- Input: `nums = [2,2,2,0,1]`
- Output: `0`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the length of the input array `nums`?
   **A:** The length can vary, but typically it is reasonable to expect up to a few thousand elements in an interview setting.
   
2. **Q:** Can there be negative numbers in `nums`?
   **A:** Yes, the integers in `nums` can be negative.

3. **Q:** Is it appropriate to use additional space for solving this problem?
   **A:** The solution should aim to be in constant space, i.e., O(1) extra space.

4. **Q:** Do we need to handle edge cases like an empty array?
   **A:** Yes, though for the sake of this problem, we can assume the array is non-empty.

### Strategy

The key to solving this problem efficiently is to use a modified version of binary search. We handle duplicates by carefully adjusting our search bounds. The general strategy is as follows:

1. Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. While `left` is less than `right`, calculate the mid-point.
3. Depending on the value of `nums[mid]`:
    - If `nums[mid]` is less than `nums[right]`, the minimum is in the left half.
    - If `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[right]`, the minimum is in the right half.
    - If `nums[mid]` is equal to `nums[right]`, decrement `right` because duplicates could make the minimum be either on the left side or could be at the middle.
4. Once `left` equals `right`, the minimum element is at `nums[left]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int findMin(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = nums.size() - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // To prevent overflow

        if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
            // Min is in the left half
            right = mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
            // Min is in the right half
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            // nums[mid] == nums[right] case, decrease right
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return nums[left];
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 2, 2, 0, 1};
    std::cout << "The minimum is: " << findMin(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this binary search approach is O(log n) in the average case due to the binary search mechanism. However, in the worst case (e.g., when all elements are the same), the complexity can degrade to O(n) because of the need to linearly check through some elements due to duplicates.

We have provided detailed comments in the code to help understand each step, and the solution adheres to O(1) extra space complexity.
