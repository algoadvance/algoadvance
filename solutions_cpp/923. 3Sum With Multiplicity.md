[Leetcode 923. 3Sum With Multiplicity](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l923)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr`, and an integer `target`. You want to find the number of tuples `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target`.

Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements of the array be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements of the array can be negative, positive, or zero.

2. **What is the range of the integers in the array?**
   - The values are within the standard integer range, which means they can go from `INT_MIN` to `INT_MAX`.

3. **Is it allowed to have duplicate values in the array?**
   - Yes, duplicate values are allowed in the array.

4. **What is the length range of the array?**
   - The length of the array `arr` will be between `3` and `3000`.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:** Sort the array to make it easier to handle combinations and avoid re-processing the same value combinations.
  
2. **Using Three Pointers:** Use a three-pointer technique where:
   - Fixed the first number (`i`).
   - Use two pointers (`j` for the second number and `k` for the third number) to find valid triplets.
   
3. **Counting Duplicates:** We need to count the number of valid triplets `(i, j, k)` by considering the frequency of each number in the array. Use combinations for counting possible tuples when elements are the same.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumMulti(std::vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        long long count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int T = target - arr[i];
            int j = i + 1, k = n - 1;
            
            while (j < k) {
                if (arr[j] + arr[k] < T) {
                    ++j;
                } else if (arr[j] + arr[k] > T) {
                    --k;
                } else {  // arr[j] + arr[k] == T
                    if (arr[j] != arr[k]) {
                        int left = 1, right = 1;
                        while (j + 1 < k && arr[j] == arr[j + 1]) {
                            ++left;
                            ++j;
                        }
                        while (k - 1 > j && arr[k] == arr[k - 1]) {
                            ++right;
                            --k;
                        }
                        count += left * right;
                        count %= MOD;
                        ++j;
                        --k;
                    } else {
                        count += (k - j + 1) * (k - j) / 2 % MOD;
                        count %= MOD;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return static_cast<int>(count);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** The time complexity for sorting the array is \( O(n \log n) \).

2. **Three-pointer search:** The nested loops and the search operation combined will run in \( O(n^2) \) time, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \). Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough.

### Conclusion

This solution uses a sorted array and a three-pointer technique to efficiently count the number of valid triplets that sum to the given target. The approach ensures that the result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large outputs.
