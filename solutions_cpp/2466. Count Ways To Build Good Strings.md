[Leetcode 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2466)
### Problem Statement:

You are given two integers `low` and `high`, and two integers `zero` and `one`. You need to count how many strings of length between `low` and `high` (inclusive) can be constructed by appending either `zero` number of `0`s or `one` number of `1`s at each step, starting with an empty string.

Return the number of valid strings you can build. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What exactly do the parameters `zero` and `one` represent?**
   - `zero` represents the number of '0's that can be appended in one step.
   - `one` represents the number of '1's that can be appended in one step.

2. **How do we define a valid string?**
   - A string is considered valid if it falls within the length range `[low, high]`.

3. **What is the significance of the order of characters in the strings?**
   - Strings are constructed by appending characters; hence, the order of characters is determined by the sequence of appends.

### Strategy:

This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP). We define a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to build a string of length `i`.

#### Steps to Solve:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Define `dp[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `high`, where `dp[0] = 1` (an empty string) and the rest are initialized to 0.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - For each length `i` from `1` to `high`, update `dp[i]` by adding the ways to reach `i` from `i - zero` and `i - one`.

3. **Sum Results:**
   - Sum up all `dp[i]` for `i` in the range `[low, high]`, as these are the lengths that form valid strings.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the answer can be very large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep the results within the required limit.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        std::vector<int> dp(high + 1, 0);
        
        // Base case: An empty string
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= high; ++i) {
            if (i >= zero) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % MOD;
            }
            if (i >= one) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        // Sum up the valid counts in range [low, high]
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = low; i <= high; ++i) {
            count = (count + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is `high`, because we iterate from `1` to `high` to fill the DP array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the storage used for the DP array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid strings within the given constraints.
