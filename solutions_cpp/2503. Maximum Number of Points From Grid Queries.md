[Leetcode 2503. Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2503)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D grid of integers representing points and a list of queries. For each query, you should return the maximum number of points that can be collected from the grid. Starting from the top-left corner of the grid, you can move right, down, left, or up, but you can only collect points if you have not collected them before. Each query has a limitation that you can only collect points that have a value less than or equal to the query value.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the grid size?**
   - The grid size could be from \( 1 \times 1 \) to possibly \( 10^2 \times 10^2 \).

2. **What is the range of the values in the grid and queries?**
   - The values in the grid and the queries can both be from \( 0 \) to \( 10^4 \).

3. **How many queries can there be?**
   - There can be up to \( 10^4 \) queries.

4. **Can we revisit a cell in the grid during the same query?**
   - Yes, but you cannot collect points from it again.

5. **How should we return the result?**
   - Return a list where each element corresponds to the result of the respective query.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to perform multiple queries efficiently on the grid. For each query, we have to find all possible paths from the top-left corner and collect the maximum points satisfying the constraint.

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We can perform a BFS from the top-left corner to explore all reachable cells with values less than or equal to the query value. 
   - For each query, we maintain a visited array to keep track of cells that are already considered.

2. **Query Preprocessing:**
   - Precompute the maximum reachable points for all possible values up to the maximum value present in the queries, then use these precomputed values to answer each query in constant time.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation of the strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>

// Helper function to perform BFS and count points
int bfs(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, int max_val) {
    int rows = grid.size();
    int cols = grid[0].size();
    std::vector<std::vector<bool>> visited(rows, std::vector<bool>(cols, false));
    std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> q;
    int points = 0;
    
    // Directions for up, down, left, right movements
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    q.push({0, 0});
    visited[0][0] = true;
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [x, y] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        if (grid[x][y] <= max_val) {
            points += grid[x][y];
            for (const auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir.first;
                int ny = y + dir.second;
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] <= max_val) {
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return points;
}

std::vector<int> maxNumberOfPointsFromGridQueries(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, std::vector<int>& queries) {
    // Find the max value in grid to limit our BFS search space
    int max_grid_val = 0;
    for (const auto& row : grid) {
        for (int val : row) {
            max_grid_val = std::max(max_grid_val, val);
        }
    }
    
    // Precompute points within all values from 0 to max_grid_val
    std::vector<int> max_points(max_grid_val + 1, 0);
    for (int val = 0; val <= max_grid_val; ++val) {
        max_points[val] = bfs(grid, val);
    }
    
    // Answer each query using precomputed results
    std::vector<int> result;
    for (int query : queries) {
        if (query > max_grid_val) {
            result.push_back(max_points[max_grid_val]);
        } else {
            result.push_back(max_points[query]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **BFS Precomputation:** 
   - This involves exploring the grid for all values up to `max_grid_val`, which is \(O(max\_grid\_val \times (rows \times columns))\).

2. **Query Resolution:**
   - Each query is answered in \(O(1)\) time using the precomputed results.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(max\_grid\_val \times rows \times columns + num\_queries)\), where `max_grid_val` is the maximum value in the grid, `rows` and `columns` are the dimensions of the grid, and `num_queries` is the number of queries.
