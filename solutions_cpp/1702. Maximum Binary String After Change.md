[Leetcode 1702. Maximum Binary String After Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1702)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `binary` consisting of only '0's and '1's. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose two different indices `i` and `j` (0 <= i, j < binary.length) where `i < j` and `binary[i] == '0'` and `binary[j] == '1'`.
- Swap `binary[i]` with `binary[j]`.

Your task is to return the maximum binary string you can get after any number of operations. The maximum binary string is the one which is lexicographically largest.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length constraint for the input binary string `binary`?
   - The length of the binary string can be up to 10^5.

2. Is it guaranteed that the string will only contain '0's and '1's?
   - Yes, the string consists only of '0's and '1's.

## Strategy

To achieve the lexicographically largest binary string:
1. Count the number of '0's and '1's in the input string.
2. The optimal transformation involves pushing all '0's to the rightmost positions of the array except one (to allow for the lexicographically largest formation):
   - The number of '1's will remain in their original positions but all '0's will be shifted right.
3. The maximum binary string will have:
   - All '1's followed by a single '0', then followed by any remaining '1's.

To describe this precisely:
- Count the number of leading '1's before the first '0'.
- Count the total number of '0's.
- Place all the '1's in the front (except the trailing '1's after the first '0').
  
## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string maximumBinaryString(std::string binary) {
        int n = binary.length();
        int countZeroes = 0;
        int firstZeroIndex = -1;
        
        // Count the number of leading '1's and find the first '0'.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (binary[i] == '0') {
                countZeroes++;
                if (firstZeroIndex == -1) {
                    firstZeroIndex = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If there are no '0's or only one '0', return the original string or all '1's.
        if (countZeroes <= 1) {
            return binary;
        }
        
        // Result string with maximum binary.
        std::string resultBinary(n, '1');
        
        if (firstZeroIndex != -1) {
            resultBinary[firstZeroIndex + countZeroes - 1] = '0';
        }
        
        return resultBinary;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the binary string. The space complexity is O(1) beyond the input and output storage as we are manipulating indices and counts without additional data structure needs.

This solution ensures that the binary string is modified to become the lexicographically largest string in linear time efficiently.
