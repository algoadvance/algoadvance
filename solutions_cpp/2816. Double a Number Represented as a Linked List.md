[Leetcode 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2816)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a non-negative integer represented as a singly linked list of digits. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Your task is to write a function that doubles this number and returns the result as a linked list also in reverse order.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, let's clarify some points:
1. **Range of Digits**: Are the digits guaranteed to be between 0-9?
   - Yes, each node contains a single digit from 0 to 9.
2. **Non-negative Integer**: Can we assume that there will be no negative numbers in the list?
   - Yes, the number is guaranteed to be non-negative.
3. **Empty List**: What should we return if the input list is empty?
   - If the input list is empty, we return an empty list.
4. **Overflow**: How should we handle cases where the result leads to an overflow in the list size?
   - As long as we follow the standard logic for handling carry, we can assume the result list will adjust its size accordingly.

### Strategy

1. **Reversed List**: Since the digits are stored in reverse order, we can process them sequentially starting from the head.
2. **Doubling Each Digit**: Traverse the list and double each digit while keeping track of the carry (if any).
3. **Carry Management**: If the doubled value plus carry exceeds 9, the new digit will be `(doubled_digit + carry) % 10` and we propagate the carry to the next digit.
4. **End of List**: If there is a carry left after processing all nodes, we need to add a new node with this carry value.

Let's write the code implementing the strategy.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* doubleList(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == nullptr) return nullptr;
        
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* current = head;
        ListNode* tail = dummy;
        
        int carry = 0;
        
        while (current != nullptr) {
            int sum = current->val * 2 + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;
            sum = sum % 10;
            
            tail->next = new ListNode(sum);
            tail = tail->next;
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        if (carry > 0) {
            tail->next = new ListNode(carry);
        }
        
        return dummy->next;
    }
};

// Helper function to print linked list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head != nullptr) {
        std::cout << head->val << " ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    
    // Creating a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(3);
    
    ListNode* result = solution.doubleList(head);  // Expected 2 -> 4 -> 6
    
    printList(result);  // Should print 2 4 6

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list, because we traverse each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) as well, which is needed for the new result list.

This solves the problem efficiently by maintaining the list's reversed structure and handling carries accurately.
