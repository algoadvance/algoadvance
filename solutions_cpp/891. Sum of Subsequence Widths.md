[Leetcode 891. Sum of Subsequence Widths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l891)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `A`, a **subsequence** of `A` is a set of integers that can be derived from `A` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6]`, `[3,6,7]`, and `[3,7]` are subsequences of `[3,6,7]`.

The **width** of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subsequence.

Your task is to find the sum of the widths of all subsequences of `A`. As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:

```
Input: A = [2,1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: Subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
The widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2.
The sum of these widths is 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array length `A`?**
   - `1 <= A.length <= 20000`
   
2. **What are the constraints on the elements of the array `A`?**
   - `1 <= A[i] <= 10^9`

3. **Is there a required time complexity to achieve?**
   - Given the constraints, an optimal solution would ideally be O(n log n) due to sorting, and O(n) for subsequent operations.

4. **Is there any need to handle special integer overflow scenarios?**
   - Yes, calculations should be done modulo `10^9 + 7` to avoid overflow.

## Strategy

1. **Sort** the Array: This helps in easily computing the minimum and maximum elements for any subsequence.
2. **Precompute Powers of 2**: As subsequences essentially involve choosing elements which are powers of 2, precompute powers of 2 up to the length of the array.
3. **Contribution Calculation**: For each element in the sorted array, calculate its contribution as both a maximum and a minimum in various subsequences. Sum up these contributions:
   - If `x` is the maximum in a subsequence, every element less than `x` will have contributed as `2^index - 1` times.
   - If `x` is the minimum in a subsequence, every element greater than `x` will have contributed as `2^(n-1-index) - 1` times.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int sumSubseqWidths(vector<int>& A) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = A.size();
        
        // Sort the array
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        
        // Precompute powers of 2 up to n
        vector<long> pow2(n);
        pow2[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD;
        }
        
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            long add_contrib = (pow2[i] - 1) * A[i] % MOD;
            long subt_contrib = (pow2[n-1-i] - 1) * A[i] % MOD;
            result = (result + add_contrib - subt_contrib + MOD) % MOD;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> A = {2, 1, 3};
    cout << sol.sumSubseqWidths(A) << endl; // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Precompute powers**: `O(n)`
- **Calculation loop**: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
