[Leetcode 97. Interleaving String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l97)
## Problem Statement

Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, check whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

An interleaving of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where `s` and `t` are divided into n and m subsequences respectively, such that:
- `s = s1 + s2 + ... + s_n`
- `t = t1 + t2 + ... + t_m`
- `|n - m| â‰¤ 1`

The interleaved string would have all these subsequences in order but bother `s` and `t` are not reordered.

### Example:
- `Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac"`
- `Output: true`

- `Input: s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbbaccc"`
- `Output: false`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider the case sensitivity of the strings?
   - Yes, strings are case-sensitive.
2. What are the constraints on the lengths of the strings?
   - Typically, the lengths of each string will not exceed 100.

## Strategy
1. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `s3` is not equal to the sum of the lengths of `s1` and `s2`, return false right away.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` means if `s3` up to `i+j` can be formed by interleaving `s1` up to `i` and `s2` up to `j`.
   - The initial value `dp[0][0] = true` because an empty string can be formed from two empty strings.
   - For each `i`, `j`:
     - If `dp[i-1][j]` is true and `s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]`, then set `dp[i][j]` to true.
     - If `dp[i][j-1]` is true and `s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1]`, then set `dp[i][j]` to true.
3. Return the value of `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]` which tells if the full `s3` can be formed by interleaving the entire `s1` and `s2`.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool isInterleave(std::string s1, std::string s2, std::string s3) {
    int len1 = s1.length(), len2 = s2.length(), len3 = s3.length();
    
    // Edge case check
    if (len1 + len2 != len3) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Initialize the DP table
    std::vector<std::vector<bool>> dp(len1 + 1, std::vector<bool>(len2 + 1, false));
    dp[0][0] = true;
    
    // Fill the DP table
    for (int i = 0; i <= len1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= len2; ++j) {
            if (i > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || (dp[i-1][j] && s1[i-1] == s3[i+j-1]);
            }
            if (j > 0) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || (dp[i][j-1] && s2[j-1] == s3[i+j-1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[len1][len2];
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "aabcc", s2 = "dbbca", s3 = "aadbbcbcac";
    std::cout << (isInterleave(s1, s2, s3) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl; // should return true

    s1 = "aabcc"; s2 = "dbbca"; s3 = "aadbbbaccc";
    std::cout << (isInterleave(s1, s2, s3) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl; // should return false

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \times m)\) where \(n\) is the length of `s1` and \(m\) is the length of `s2`.
- The space complexity is also \(O(n \times m)\) due to the DP table.

By following the above plan, the problem can be solved efficiently.
