[Leetcode 312. Burst Balloons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l312)
## Problem Statement

Given \( n \) balloons, indexed from 0 to \( n-1 \). Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array \( nums \). You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst the \( i \)-th balloon, you will get \( nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] \) coins. Here, \( left \) and \( right \) are the adjacent indices of \( i \). After the burst, the \( left \) and \( right \) then become adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Note: 
- You may assume \( nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1 \). They are not real therefore you can't burst them.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation: 
nums = [3,1,5,8] -> burst 1 -> [3,5,8] -> burst 5 -> [3,8] -> burst 3 -> [8] -> burst 8
coins: 3*1*5 + 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 1*8*1 = 167
```

**Constraints:**
- \( n == nums.length \)
- 1 <= n <= 500
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the given `nums` array contain zeroes?
2. Will the input always be non-empty and valid?

With these assumptions answered directly or inferred from the problem, let's move on to the strategy.

## Strategy
This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). Here's the strategy:

1. **Create an extended array**: Add virtual balloons with value `1` at the start and end of the `nums` array.
2. **Use DP to store maximum coins**: Define a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by bursting balloons from index `i` to `j`.
3. **Recurrence relation**: 
   - For every possible subarray `nums[i:j+1]`, choose a balloon `k` to burst last within this range to maximize the coins.
   - Update the DP table using the relation:
     \( dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k-1] + nums[i-1]*nums[k]*nums[j+1] + dp[k+1][j]) \)
4. **Iteratively update the DP table** for all lengths of arrays from `1` to `n`, ensuring every sub-problem is solved before it's used.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<int> extendedNums(n + 2, 1);
        
        // Copy nums into extendedNums with padding 1s at index 0 and n+1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            extendedNums[i + 1] = nums[i];
        }
        
        // DP array
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(n + 2, std::vector<int>(n + 2, 0));
        
        // Fill the DP array
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; ++len) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n - len + 1; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                for (int k = i; k <= j; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j] = std::max(dp[i][j], 
                        dp[i][k - 1] + extendedNums[i - 1] * extendedNums[k] * extendedNums[j + 1] + dp[k + 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Result is in dp[1][n] since we are considering the range from 1 to n
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n^3) \) because:
- We fill out a \( (n+2) \times (n+2) \) DP array.
- For every subarray interval \([i..j]\), we perform an \( O(n) \) scan to compute the maximum coins by considering every possible balloon to burst last in that range.

This leads to an overall complexity of \( O(n^3) \), which is efficient enough given the constraints \( n \leq 500 \).
