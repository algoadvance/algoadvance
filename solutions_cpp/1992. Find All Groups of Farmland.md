[Leetcode 1992. Find All Groups of Farmland](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1992)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array of integers `land` where `land[i][j] == 0` represents a piece of land that is not farmland and `land[i][j] == 1` represents a piece of farmland. Connected pieces of farmland (vertically and horizontally) form one farmland group. Find all the groups of farmland. A group of farmland is represented as a 4-length array `[r1, c1, r2, c2]` where:
- `(r1, c1)` are the coordinates of the top-left cell of the land group
- `(r2, c2)` are the coordinates of the bottom-right cell of the land group
  
You need to return a 2D array with all farmland groups in any order.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input:
land = [
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,1]
]
Output:
[
  [0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,2,2]
]
```

### Constraints:
- m == land.length
- n == land[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- land consists of only 0's and 1's.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can farmland groups overlap?**
   - No, groups of farmland are contiguous and non-overlapping.
  
2. **What do we return for an empty grid?**
   - An empty list, since there would be no farmland groups.

## Strategy
1. **Iterate through the grid:** Start iterating through the grid to find cells with value `1`.
2. **Identify the farmland group:** Once you encounter a `1`, perform breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to mark all connected `1`s and record their boundaries (top-left and bottom-right).
3. **Mark visited cells:** To avoid reprocessing, mark cells as visited (e.g., by setting them to `0` or using a visited array).
4. **Store the results:** Store the farmland group coordinates once identified.
5. **Output:** Return all identified groups.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findFarmland(vector<vector<int>>& land) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        int rows = land.size();
        int cols = land[0].size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (land[i][j] == 1) {
                    int r1 = i, c1 = j;
                    int r2 = i, c2 = j;

                    // Expand downwards
                    while (r2 + 1 < rows && land[r2 + 1][c1] == 1) {
                        r2++;
                    }

                    // Expand rightwards
                    while (c2 + 1 < cols && land[r1][c2 + 1] == 1) {
                        c2++;
                    }

                    // Mark the visited farmland
                    for (int x = r1; x <= r2; ++x) {
                        for (int y = c1; y <= c2; ++y) {
                            land[x][y] = 0;
                        }
                    }

                    result.push_back({r1, c1, r2, c2});
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We traverse each cell at most twice (once for detection and once for marking as visited).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space, not considering the output space, since we only use a few variables, and marking is done in-place.

This approach is efficient and should work within the constraints provided (grid size up to 300x300).
