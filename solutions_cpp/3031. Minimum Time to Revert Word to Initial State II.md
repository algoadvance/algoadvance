[Leetcode 3031. Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3031)
## Problem Statement

Given an initial string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, you can perform a special operation any number of times. In one operation, you can choose any non-negligible prefix of the string and reverse it.

The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the string equal to its initial state after any number of operations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a "non-negligible prefix"?**
   - A non-negligible prefix is any prefix of the string that has a length of at least one character.
  
2. **Can we assume the string s will change from the initial state before we start our operations?**
   - Yes, we must aim to make the string back to its initial state through one or more reversal operations.

3. **Is the input limited to lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the input consists solely of lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

To revert the string to its initial state, observe the effect of the reversal operations:

1. Reversing the entire string makes the last character the first.
2. Reversing part of the string can adjust the first few characters.

The key insight is that by choosing the non-negligible prefix in a strategic manner, we can restore part of the string step by step. Specifically:

- Every full reversal makes the string evolve in a controlled manner back towards the initial state.

To solve the problem:

1. Record the initial position of each character.
2. Perform reversals to incrementally revert the string towards the original configuration.
3. Deduce the minimal number of these steps by observing the difference in positions required.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minOperations(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    // Check if the string itself is already in the initial configuration
    if (equal(s.begin(), s.end(), s.rbegin())) return 0;
    
    // In the worst case, it would require n operations (each one reversing up to one more character correctly)
    int ops = n;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (equal(s.begin(), s.begin() + i, s.rbegin() + (n - i))) {
            // We found a partial matching point, so reduce the number of operations we need
            ops = min(ops, 2*i - 1);
        }
    }
    
    return ops;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cout << "Enter the string: ";
    cin >> s;
    int result = minOperations(s);
    cout << "Minimum number of operations required: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This accounts for the nested checks:
- The outer loop runs `n-1` times.
- The inner comparison (`equal`) runs in `O(n)` in the worst case.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n^2)` to identify the minimum operations required.
