[Leetcode 2944. Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2944)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [position_i, amount_i]` denotes:
- `position_i` is the position of the `i-th` fruit tree on a number line.
- `amount_i` is the amount of coins you can get from the `i-th` fruit tree.

You initially start at position 0 on the number line. You can collect coins from fruit trees by moving to their positions. However, you can only collect coins from each tree once. Your task is to determine the minimum number of coins you need to collect such that you can still return to the original starting point (position 0).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the order in which I collect the fruits important?**
   - Yes, because you must return to the starting position, which implies strategizing the path to minimize the number of moves.

2. **Are there constraints on the values of `position_i` and `amount_i`?**
   - Typically, constraints would be specified, but for the sake of the problem, let's assume typical integer constraints (e.g., positions could be large, and amounts could vary).

3. **Can I visit a position more than once?**
   - Yes, but you can only collect the coins from a fruit tree once.

### Strategy

Clearly, we need to find a way to prioritize collecting fruits such that the cost of moving back to the starting position is minimized. Hence, we have to consider combinations of paths and their respective profits. A key idea here would be to simulate the possible paths and use a dynamic programming approach to ensure minimal moves.

### Code

We'll use a dynamic approach where:
- We keep an array `dp` to store minimum coins required to collect fruits.
- We'll iterate through each fruit's position and calculate the cost-benefit of collecting coins and returning to the starting point.

Here's a C++ solution to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Fruit {
    int position;
    int amount;
};

int minCoinsForFruits(vector<vector<int>>& fruits) {
    int n = fruits.size();
    vector<Fruit> fruitList;

    // Convert input to a structured format
    for (auto& f : fruits) {
        fruitList.push_back({f[0], f[1]});
    }
    
    // Sort fruits based on their positions
    sort(fruitList.begin(), fruitList.end(), [](const Fruit& a, const Fruit& b) {
        return a.position < b.position;
    });
    
    // Dynamic Programming to find the minimum coins
    vector<int> dp(n, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = fruitList[0].amount;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        // Collects minimum amount of coins and returns to position 0
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], fruitList[i].amount + abs(fruitList[i].position) * 2);
        // Collect coins and move to the next fruit
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + fruitList[i].amount + abs(fruitList[i].position - fruitList[j].position));
        }
    }
    
    int min_coins = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        min_coins = min(min_coins, dp[i]);
    }

    return min_coins;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sort operation on the fruit positions.
- **DP Array Calculation**: O(n^2), since it involves nested iteration over the elements.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which is feasible for reasonably large inputs. The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the `dp` array.
