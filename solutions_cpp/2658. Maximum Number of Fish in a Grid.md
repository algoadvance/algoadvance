[Leetcode 2658. Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2658)
## Problem Statement

You are given an m x n grid where each cell contains some non-negative number of fish. Imagine you are a fisherman and you start your day at cell (0, 0). You can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. However, you can only move if you collect at least one fish from the current cell. You must maximize the total number of fish you can collect. Return the maximum number of fish you can collect if you can visit a cell multiple times.

**Example:**
```
Input: grid = [[0, 1, 4], [3, 2, 1], [4, 3, 2]]
Output: 16
Explanation: 
Starting at (0, 0), the best route is to move to (0, 2), collecting 4 fish, 
then move to (1, 2), collecting 1 fish, then move to (1, 1), collecting 2 fish,
then move to (2, 1), collecting 3 fish, then move to (2, 0), collecting 4 fish,
for a total of 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 16 fish.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume that the input grid will always be valid and not empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the grid is valid and not empty.
   
2. **Can a cell be visited multiple times?**
   - Yes, you can visit a cell multiple times.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the grid?**
   - There can be, but generally, let's assume a reasonable size range for typical problems, such as m, n ≤ 100.
   
4. **Is diagonal movement allowed?**
   - No, only up, down, left, and right movements are allowed.

## Strategy

We'll utilize Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths and keep track of the maximum fish collected. 

1. **DFS Approach**:
   - We'll recursively traverse the grid.
   - At each cell, we'll collect the fish and mark it as visited.
   - We’ll recursively move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
   - If a cell has already been visited or has 0 fish, we backtrack.
   - For each path, keep a running sum of the fish collected and update the maximum sum whenever a new path yields a higher total fish collected.

2. **Backtracking**:
   - After exploring all possible paths from a cell, we'll backtrack, i.e., unmark the cell as visited, so we can consider different paths to maximize fish collection.

By employing DFS with backtracking, we ensure that each possible path is evaluated to find the path that yields the maximum number of fish.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFish = 0;

    // Direction vectors for up, down, left, right movements
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> directions{{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};

    void dfs(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, std::vector<std::vector<bool>>& visited, int i, int j, int currentFish) {
        // Update the maximum fish collected so far
        maxFish = std::max(maxFish, currentFish);

        // Try all four possible directions
        for (auto& direction : directions) {
            int ni = i + direction.first;
            int nj = j + direction.second;

            if (ni >= 0 && ni < grid.size() && nj >= 0 && nj < grid[0].size() && grid[ni][nj] > 0 && !visited[ni][nj]) {
                // Mark the new cell as visited and add its fish to the current total
                visited[ni][nj] = true;
                dfs(grid, visited, ni, nj, currentFish + grid[ni][nj]);
                // Backtrack: unmark the cell as visited
                visited[ni][nj] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    int findMaxFish(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        std::vector<std::vector<bool>> visited(m, std::vector<bool>(n, false));
        
        // Start DFS from the top-left corner (0, 0)
        if (grid[0][0] > 0) {
            visited[0][0] = true;
            dfs(grid, visited, 0, 0, grid[0][0]);
        }
        
        return maxFish;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> grid{
        {0, 1, 4},
        {3, 2, 1},
        {4, 3, 2}
    };
    std::cout << sol.findMaxFish(grid) << std::endl;  // Output: 16
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Since we visit each cell and explore all possible paths from it, the time complexity of this approach will be O((m * n) * 4^(m * n)), which is typically infeasible for large grids.
- However, for smaller grids (like the constraints provided), this exhaustive DFS approach can still be practical.
