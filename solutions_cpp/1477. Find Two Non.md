[Leetcode 1477. Find Two Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1477)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, find the minimum sum of the lengths of two non-overlapping sub-arrays such that each sub-array has a sum equal to target. If there is no such sub-array, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in `arr` only positive integers?**
   - No, `arr` can have any integers (positive, negative, zero).

2. **What should be the output if no two non-overlapping sub-arrays with the sum equal to `target` are found?**
   - The output should be `-1`.

3. **Can the two sub-arrays overlap?**
   - No, they must be non-overlapping.

4. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array?**
   - Generally, you should handle common constraints like large arrays efficiently, but let's assume constraints like maximum size `10^4` or similar.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We can use a sliding window to find all sub-arrays that sum to the target.
2. **Record Sub-array Lengths**: Use two additional arrays to store the minimum lengths of sub-arrays ending at each position and the minimum lengths of sub-arrays starting at each position.
3. **Combine Results**: Iterate through the array combining non-overlapping sub-arrays by checking these arrays.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Find all sub-arrays with sum = target and store their lengths.**
2. **Use two arrays to store cumulative results:**
   - `leftMin[i]` contains the minimum length of a sub-array that ends at or before index `i`.
   - `rightMin[i]` contains the minimum length of a sub-array that starts at or after index `i`.
3. **Calculate these arrays to quickly find the minimum lengths.**
4. **Traverse the array to find the minimal sum of combined lengths of two non-overlapping sub-arrays.**

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSumOfLengths(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int n = arr.size();
    vector<int> leftMin(n, INT_MAX);
    vector<int> rightMin(n, INT_MAX);

    // Sliding window to calculate the minimum lengths for leftMin array
    unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumIndex;
    prefixSumIndex[0] = -1;
    int currentSum = 0;
    int minLength = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        currentSum += arr[i];
        
        if (prefixSumIndex.find(currentSum - target) != prefixSumIndex.end()) {
            minLength = min(minLength, i - prefixSumIndex[currentSum - target]);
        }
        
        leftMin[i] = minLength;
        prefixSumIndex[currentSum] = i;
    }

    // Reset for the rightMin calculation
    prefixSumIndex.clear();
    prefixSumIndex[0] = n;
    currentSum = 0;
    minLength = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        currentSum += arr[i];
        
        if (prefixSumIndex.find(currentSum - target) != prefixSumIndex.end()) {
            minLength = min(minLength, prefixSumIndex[currentSum - target] - i);
        }
        
        rightMin[i] = minLength;
        prefixSumIndex[currentSum] = i;
    }

    // Calculate the minimum sum length of two non-overlapping subarrays
    int result = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (leftMin[i] < INT_MAX && rightMin[i + 1] < INT_MAX) {
            result = min(result, leftMin[i] + rightMin[i + 1]);
        }
    }

    return result == INT_MAX ? -1 : result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sliding window analysis**: O(n) for calculating sub-array sums.
- **Combining results**: O(n) to find the two non-overlapping sub-arrays.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**, making this approach efficient and suitable for larger constraints.
