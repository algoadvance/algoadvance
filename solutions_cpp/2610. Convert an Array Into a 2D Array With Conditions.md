[Leetcode 2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2610)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to convert the array into a 2D array such that:

1. Each element in `nums` must be in exactly one subarray.
2. All elements in a subarray must be unique.

Return the 2D array with the necessary conditions met as specified. If there are multiple answers, return any one of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of the input array `nums`?
    - Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums`?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Is the format for the output a vector of vectors? Specifically, should the inner vectors (subarrays) contain unique elements?
    - If there are multiple valid outputs, is it acceptable to return any of them?

Letâ€™s assume typical constraints as follows:
- `nums.length` does not exceed 1000.
- Values in `nums` are within the range of -1000 to 1000.
- Any valid configuration can be returned if multiple solutions exist.

### Strategy

1. **Approach**:
    - Use a hash map (unordered_map) to keep track of the counts of elements in `nums`.
    - Iterate over the counts and create subarrays meeting the condition where each subarray has unique elements.
    - Continue creating new subarrays as needed when duplicates are encountered.

2. **Steps**:
    1. Count the frequency of each element in `nums`.
    2. Iterate over the frequency map and distribute elements into subarrays.
    3. Ensure each subarray contains unique elements. If an element count is more than one, distribute the duplicates into different subarrays as needed.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> findMatrix(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
    for (int num : nums) {
        freqMap[num]++;
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    bool added = true;
    
    while (added) {
        added = false;
        vector<int> subArray;
        for (auto it = freqMap.begin(); it != freqMap.end(); ) {
            if (it->second > 0) {
                subArray.push_back(it->first);
                it->second--;
                added = true;
                if (it->second == 0) {
                    it = freqMap.erase(it);
                } else {
                    ++it;
                }
            } else {
                ++it;
            }
        }
        if (!subArray.empty()) {
            result.push_back(subArray);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Frequency Map**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Creating Subarrays**: Each element in `nums` is processed a constant number of times into subarrays. This results in a total of O(n) operations to build the subarrays.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Explanation

1. Build a frequency map to count occurrences of each element in `nums`.
2. Iterate and create subarrays:
    - Extract unique elements for each subarray until no elements are left in the frequency map.
    - Adjust element counts in the map and erase entries with zero counts.
3. Combine the subarrays into the result vector.

This strategy ensures that each element appears only once per subarray and fulfills the problem's requirements.
