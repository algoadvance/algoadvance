[Leetcode 2981. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2981)
Certainly! Let's break down the problem and approach it methodically.

### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the longest special substring that occurs at least three times in the string. A special substring is defined as a non-empty substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no such substring exists?**
   - Return an empty string if no such substring occurs thrice.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - There could be constraints like `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.

3. **Are there any limitations on the types of characters present in the string?**
   - Usually, the string consists of lowercase English letters, but we should clarify if other characters are present.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll employ a combination of binary search and a hashing method to efficiently find the longest special substring that occurs at least three times. The idea is as follows:

1. **Binary Search on Lengths:** We'll use binary search to determine the maximum length of a substring that appears at least thrice in the string.
2. **Rabin-Karp Hashing:** For a given length, we'll use the Rabin-Karp algorithm to hash the substrings and identify if any substring of that length appears three times.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:**
   - Start with `low = 1` and `high = s.length`.
   - Use binary search to find the possible length of the longest substring.

2. **Hashing and Checking Substrings:**
   - For a given length `mid`, generate all substrings of that length.
   - Hash these substrings and store their frequencies.
   - If any substring appears at least three times, it means the current length `mid` is feasible. Otherwise, reduce the search length.

3. **Find and Return the Longest Substring:**
   - Use the result from the binary search to return the longest valid substring.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to perform hashing and check the frequency of substrings
bool hasSubstringWithKOccurrences(const string &s, int length, int k) {
    if (length == 0) return false;
    
    unordered_map<string, int> hashMap;
    for (int i = 0; i <= s.size() - length; ++i) {
        string substring = s.substr(i, length);
        hashMap[substring]++;
        if (hashMap[substring] >= k) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

string findLongestSpecialSubstring(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int low = 1, high = n;
    string result = "";

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

        if (hasSubstringWithKOccurrences(s, mid, 3)) {
            // Check if this mid length substring occurs at least thrice
            low = mid + 1;  // Try to find a longer valid substring
            result = s.substr(0, mid);  // Temporarily store the current result
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;  // Try smaller lengths
        }
    }

    // We need to verify if result really occurs thrice
    unordered_map<string, int> finalMap;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n - result.length(); ++i) {
        string substring = s.substr(i, result.length());
        finalMap[substring]++;
        if (finalMap[substring] >= 3) {
            return substring;  // Return only if it occurs at least thrice
        }
    }
    
    return "";
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    cout << findLongestSpecialSubstring(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The binary search will take `O(log n)` iterations since it divides the length search space by half each time.
- **Substring Hashing:** For each midpoint in the binary search, we generate all substrings of that length, which takes `O(n)` time for each substring of fixed length.
- Therefore, the overall complexity is approximately `O(n log n)` due to the combination of binary search and substring hashing.

This should provide a robust solution to find the longest special substring appearing at least three times.
