[Leetcode 892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l892)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` grid where you have placed some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes. Each value `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cubes stacked at position `(i, j)`.

You need to return the total surface area of the resulting shapes.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What is the size range for `n` and the values within the grid?
   - **Answer**: Typically, `1 <= n <= 50` and `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`.
   
2. **Surface area considerations**: Do we count the overlapping internal faces between stacked cubes?
   - **Answer**: Yes, we need to subtract the overlapping faces.

### Strategy
- Calculate the surface area for each individual stack of cubes.
- The surface area of each stack can be drafted as follow:
  - Top and Bottom faces always contribute 2 units if there are cubes present.
  - Side faces: Calculate each face (left, right, front, back) individually by comparing the current cell with its neighbors and counting only the visible faces.
- Sum the surface areas of each stack to get the total surface area.
- Decrease overlapping areas between adjacent stacks.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int surfaceArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int totalSurfaceArea = 0;
        
        // Directions array for side face coverage
        // Up, Down, Left, Right
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        
        // Traverse each cell in the grid
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if(grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    // Top and bottom faces
                    totalSurfaceArea += 2; 
                    
                    // Side faces
                    for(const auto& dir : directions) {
                        int ni = i + dir.first;
                        int nj = j + dir.second;
                        int neighborHeight = 0;
                        
                        if(ni >= 0 && ni < n && nj >= 0 && nj < n) {
                            neighborHeight = grid[ni][nj];
                        }
                        
                        // Add visible faces
                        totalSurfaceArea += max(grid[i][j] - neighborHeight, 0);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return totalSurfaceArea;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {{1,2},{3,4}};
    cout << solution.surfaceArea(grid) << endl;  // Output should be 34
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the size of the grid. This is because each cell in the `n x n` grid is visited exactly once, and for each cell, we perform a constant amount of work to calculate the surface area.
