[Leetcode 2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2579)
### Problem Statement
The problem "Count Total Number of Colored Cells" requires us to determine the total number of colored cells in a grid after performing a given set of operations. The operations are defined as follows:
- We start with a grid where only one cell is initially colored.
- Each day, we color all cells that share at least one edge with a previously colored cell.

Given an integer `n` representing the number of days, our task is to return the total number of colored cells present on day `n`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the grid considered to be infinite?
   - Yes, for the purpose of this problem, you can assume the grid is infinite and `n` can be any integer.
   
2. Can the initial cell be assumed to be at position (0,0)?
   - Yes.

3. Are diagonally adjacent cells considered for coloring?
   - No, only cells that share at least one edge are considered adjacent.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to observe the pattern of how cells are colored over the days. 

Starting with day 0 (initially):
- Day 0: 1 cell

On each subsequent day:
- Day 1: 5 cells (1 original + 4 new cells around it)
- Day 2: 13 cells (5 previous cells + 8 new cells around the perimeter)
- Day 3: 25 cells (13 previous cells + 12 new cells around the perimeter)

We can notice that:
```
   Day 0: 1 cell
   Day 1: 1 + 4 * 1 = 5 cells
   Day 2: 5 + 4 * 2 = 13 cells
   Day 3: 13 + 4 * 3 = 25 cells
```

Based on this pattern, the number of colored cells `T(n)` on day `n` can be given by the formula:
\[ T(n) = 1 + 4 \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i\right) \]
Where the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). So:
\[ T(n) = 1 + 2n(n+1) \]

### Code
Here is the implementation of the above logic in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int coloredCells(int n) {
        // Use the derived formula T(n) = 1 + 2 * n * (n + 1)
        return 1 + 2 * n * (n + 1);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n;
    
    // Let's take an example input
    std::cout << "Enter the number of days: ";
    std::cin >> n;
    
    int result = sol.coloredCells(n);
    std::cout << "Total number of colored cells after " << n << " days: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \( O(1) \) because it relies on a direct mathematical formula to compute the number of colored cells for any given `n`. There are no loops or recursive calls involved.

### Summary
- Given the problem, we determined the number of colored cells using a pattern recognition approach.
- A formula was derived to directly calculate the number of colored cells based on the day.
- The solution offers a constant-time \( O(1) \) complexity, making it highly efficient.
