[Leetcode 1558. Minimum Numbers of Function Calls to Make Target Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1558)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` of size n, you need to perform a set of operations to transform the array to a target array. You can perform the following two kinds of operations on the array elements in each step:

1. **Multiple Elements Add Operation**: Select any subarray from the array and increment each element in that subarray by 1.
2. **Double Element Operation**: Select any subarray from the array and multiply each element in that subarray by 2.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform an initial array of zeros of the same size as `nums` to the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Clarify the allowed operations:** Can we select a subarray with a single element to perform the operations on?
   - Yes, you can select a subarray with any length, including a single element, to perform the operations.

2. **Initial state:** The initial state of the array is always an array of zeros, correct?
   - Yes, the initial state of the array is `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` with the same length as `nums`.

3. **Values within `nums`:** Are there any constraints on the values within the `nums` array (e.g., non-negative integers)?
   - `nums[i]` is a non-negative integer where `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

### Strategy:

To derive the minimum number of operations needed, consider the nature of the two operations:

1. **Increment Operation (Add 1)**: This corresponds to setting each bit of a binary number from `0` to `1`. Each `1` bit in the binary representation of a number corresponds to an increment operation.
2. **Doubling Operation (Multiply by 2)**: This corresponds to shifts to the left in binary representation. For each number, the maximum number of shifts needed is determined by the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the number.

The necessary operations can be derived by examining each number in its binary form:
- Count the total number of '1's across all binary representations of all numbers (representing the minimum number of Increment operations).
- Identify the maximum number of shifts required amongst all numbers.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int addOps = 0; // Total add operations needed
        int maxDoublingOps = 0; // Maximum count of doubling operations needed on any element

        for (int num : nums) {
            int doublingOps = 0;
            while (num > 0) {
                if (num % 2 == 1) {
                    addOps++;
                    num -= 1;
                }
                if (num > 0) {
                    doublingOps++;
                    num /= 2;
                }
            }
            maxDoublingOps = std::max(maxDoublingOps, doublingOps);
        }

        return addOps + maxDoublingOps;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variables:**
   - `addOps`: Tracks the total count of increment operations needed across all elements.
   - `maxDoublingOps`: Tracks the maximum count of doubling operations needed by any single element.

2. **Logic:**
   - For each integer in `nums`:
     - Count the number of increment operations needed (`addOps`) by checking each bit.
     - Count the number of doubling operations needed by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 (`doublingOps`).
     - Track the maximum number of doubling operations required (`maxDoublingOps`).

3. **Return the Sum:**
   - Combining the total increment operations and the maximum doubling operations gives the minimum operations required to form the target array.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log m)\)
  - `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
  - `m` is the maximum value in `nums`.
  - Each number is processed in \(O(\log m)\) time because each number is divided by 2 in the worst case, a logarithmic time operation.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - Only a constant amount of extra space is used beyond the input data.
