[Leetcode 741. Cherry Pickup](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l741)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers:
- `0` means the cell is empty, so you can pass through,
- `1` means the cell contains a cherry that you can pick up and pass through, or
- `-1` means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

Your task is to return the maximum number of cherries you can collect by following these rules:
1. Starting from the position `(0, 0)` and reaching the position `(n-1, n-1)` through valid cells (cells with `0` or `1`).
2. After reaching `(n-1, n-1)`, you must return to `(0, 0)` by following similar valid moves.
3. When passing through a cell, you can only pick up the cherries at the cell once; that is, if both passes (forward and backward) pass through the same cell, you can only pick up the cherries once.

Both players move only right (→) or down (↓) through valid cells during their journey. You need to find out the maximum number of cherries that can be collected.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the grid sizes always square-shaped?
2. Can we assume that the starting and ending cells are always valid (not containing thorns)?
3. Is diagonal movement (↘) allowed, or only right (→) and down (↓)?
4. Are there any special constraints on the grid size `n`?

## Strategy

Since we need to optimize the collection of cherries while making two trips (one to the end and one back), we can solve this using dynamic programming.

We can use a 3-dimensional DP array `dp[r1][c1][c2]` where:
- `r1`, `c1` are the coordinates of person 1,
- `c2` is the coordinate of person 2 (since `r2` can be derived from `r1 + c1 - c2`)

The state transition involves considering all valid movements for both persons. We cannot move leftwards or upwards because the problem definition restricts movements to right and down. We collect cherries when present (avoid double counting).

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n, INT_MIN)));
        dp[0][0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        for (int r1 = 0; r1 < n; r1++) {
            for (int c1 = 0; c1 < n; c1++) {
                for (int c2 = 0; c2 < n; c2++) {
                    int r2 = r1 + c1 - c2;
                    if (r2 < 0 || r2 >= n || grid[r1][c1] == -1 || grid[r2][c2] == -1) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    int cherries = grid[r1][c1];
                    if (c1 != c2) {
                        cherries += grid[r2][c2];
                    }
                    
                    int maxCherries = dp[r1][c1][c2];
                    if (r1 > 0 && c2 > 0) {
                        maxCherries = max(maxCherries, dp[r1-1][c1][c2-1]);
                    }
                    if (r1 > 0 && r2 > 0) {
                        maxCherries = max(maxCherries, dp[r1-1][c1][c2]);
                    }
                    if (c1 > 0 && r2 > 0) {
                        maxCherries = max(maxCherries, dp[r1][c1-1][c2]);
                    }
                    if (c1 > 0 && c2 > 0) {
                        maxCherries = max(maxCherries, dp[r1][c1-1][c2-1]);
                    }
                    
                    dp[r1][c1][c2] = maxCherries + cherries;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max(0, dp[n-1][n-1][n-1]);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

Given the 3D DP array, the size is `O(n^3)`, and each state computes in constant time:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^3)`
