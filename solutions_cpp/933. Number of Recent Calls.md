[Leetcode 933. Number of Recent Calls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l933)
### Problem Statement
You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:
- `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with no requests.
- `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t` (in milliseconds), where `t` represents some time in the past. Returns the number of requests that have been made from `t - 3000` to `t` (inclusive).

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that `t` is a non-negative integer?  
   - Yes, `t` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer and always strictly increasing with each call to `ping`.
   
2. Is there a maximum value for `t`? 
   - The value of `t` can go up to `10^9`, but each call to `ping` will have a strictly increasing value of `t`.

### Strategy
The solution revolves around maintaining a list of request times and efficiently counting how many of them fall within the last 3000 milliseconds of a given request time. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. Use a queue to store the timestamps of the requests.
2. For each new `ping(t)`, add `t` to the queue.
3. Remove any timestamps from the queue that are older than `t - 3000`.
4. The size of the queue at this point will give the number of requests within the last 3000 milliseconds.

The use of a queue ensures that we can efficiently add new request times and remove old ones, keeping the operations approximately O(1) for each call of `ping`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <queue>

class RecentCounter {
public:
    RecentCounter() {
        
    }
    
    int ping(int t) {
        // Add the new request timestamp `t`
        q.push(t);
        
        // Remove all requests that are older than `t - 3000`
        while (!q.empty() && q.front() < t - 3000) {
            q.pop();
        }
        
        // The size of the queue is the number of recent requests
        return q.size();
    }
    
private:
    std::queue<int> q; // Queue to store the timestamps of the requests
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`RecentCounter` constructor)**: O(1)
- **ping(int t)**: Each request is added to the queue and outdated requests are removed. Both enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1) amortized. Hence, the complexity of each `ping` operation is `O(1)` on average.

This approach ensures efficient management of the list of requests and handles the problem constraints effectively.
