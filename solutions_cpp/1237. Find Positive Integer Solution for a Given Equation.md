[Leetcode 1237. Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1237)
## Problem Statement

You are given a function `f(x, y)` that returns the result of a mysterious formula `f(x, y)` and the only things you know about this function are:
* `f(x, y) == f(y, x)` for all positive integers `x` and `y`.
* `f(x, y)` > `f(x-1, y)` > `f(x-2, y)` > ... for all `x > 1` and `y`.
* The function `f(x, y)` is strictly increasing with respect to both `x` and `y`.

Your goal is to find all positive integer pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the equation `f(x, y) == z`.

Implement a function `findSolution(customFunction: CustomFunction, z: int) -> List[List[int]]` where:
* `customFunction` is an object provided by the API that has a method `int f(x, y)` that returns `f(x, y)`.
* `z` is an integer that is the target value for the function `f(x, y)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Nature of the function `f(x, y)`**: Are there any known characteristics such as it being polynomial, exponential, or logarithmic?
2. **Boundaries for `x` and `y`**: What are the likely constraints on the possible values that `x` and `y` can take?
3. **Expected output**: Should the result list contain pairs sorted in a specific order or is any order acceptable?

We will assume the function is strictly increasing as stated and work with iterating through possible `x` and `y` values up to a reasonable limit.

## Code

Here is the code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Mocking the customFunction class for illustration
class CustomFunction {
public:
    // Just a placeholder. In practice, this will be provided.
    int f(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;  // Replace with the actual function implementation
    }
};

vector<vector<int>> findSolution(CustomFunction& customFunction, int z) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int x = 1, y = 1000;  // Start with arbitrary bounds
    
    while (x <= 1000 && y >= 1) {
        int value = customFunction.f(x, y);
        if (value == z) {
            result.push_back({x, y});
            x++;
        } else if (value < z) {
            x++;
        } else {
            y--;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with `x = 1` and `y = 1000`, where `1000` is chosen arbitrarily as an upper bound for search space.
2. **Iterative Search**:
    - For each pair `(x, y)`, evaluate `f(x, y)`.
    - If `f(x, y) == z`, store the pair and increment `x` to find potential other pairs.
    - If `f(x, y) < z`, increment `x` to increase the function value because the function is strictly increasing with respect to `x`.
    - If `f(x, y) > z`, decrement `y` to decrease the function value because the function is strictly increasing with respect to `y`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is 1000 (the assumed upper bound of x and y). This provides a reasonable time limit given that we might typically assume reasonable bounds for x and y based on problem constraints.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) excluding the space required for the result.

By this approach, we efficiently traverse the possible values of `x` and `y` and utilize the properties of the function to find the solution.
