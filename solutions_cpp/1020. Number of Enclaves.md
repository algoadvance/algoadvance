[Leetcode 1020. Number of Enclaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1020)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix grid, where `0` represents a sea cell and `1` represents a land cell. A move is a traversal from one land cell to another adjacent land cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west).

Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input grid be empty? 
    - No, the input grid will have at least one cell.
   
2. What are the dimensions of the grid?
    - The dimensions of the grid can vary, but it will be represented by `m x n` where `1 <= m, n <= 500`.

3. Should the code handle cases where all cells are sea or all cells are land?
    - Yes, the code should handle all edge cases.

## Strategy

1. Traverse from the perimeter of the grid and perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to mark all reachable land cells (`1`s) as visited (`-1`).

2. After marking all the boundary-reachable land cells, count all the land cells (`1`s) still unmarked in the grid. These remaining land cells will be our enclaves.

3. The DFS will be used to ensure that all cells that can reach the boundary are excluded from the enclave count.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

void dfs(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    // Check for out of boundaries and sea
    if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] != 1) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Mark the cell as visited
    grid[x][y] = -1;
    
    // Move to all four adjacent cells
    dfs(grid, x + 1, y);
    dfs(grid, x - 1, y);
    dfs(grid, x, y + 1);
    dfs(grid, x, y - 1);
}

int numEnclaves(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    // Start DFS from all boundary cells that are lands
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        if (grid[i][0] == 1) dfs(grid, i, 0);       // Left boundary
        if (grid[i][n-1] == 1) dfs(grid, i, n-1);   // Right boundary
    }
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        if (grid[0][j] == 1) dfs(grid, 0, j);       // Top boundary
        if (grid[m-1][j] == 1) dfs(grid, m-1, j);   // Bottom boundary
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    
    // Count all remaining land cells that are enclaves
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal:** Each cell is visited once during DFS, so the overall time complexity of DFS traversal from the boundary cells is \(O(m \times n)\).
- **Counting Enclaves:** A single pass through the grid to count enclaves takes \(O(m \times n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\).

## Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity of DFS:** The space complexity in the worst case of DFS traversal (recursion stack) can be \(O(m \times n)\).

Hence, the space complexity of the solution is \(O(m \times n)\).
