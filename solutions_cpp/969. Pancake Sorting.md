[Leetcode 969. Pancake Sorting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l969)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, consisting of `n` integers where each integer is in the range from `1` to `n`, sort the array using a series of pancake flips. 

In one pancake flip, you can choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length` and flip the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (0-indexed). Specifically, you reverse the order of the first `k` elements of the array.

Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort the array. Any valid sequence of pancake flips that sorts the array is correct.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Elements**: Are the elements guaranteed to be within the range from `1` to `n`?
   - Yes, the elements are permutations of the numbers from `1` to `n`.

2. **Duplicates**: Are there any duplicates in the array?
   - No, the array has unique elements within the range `1` to `n`.

3. **Desired Output**: Should the output be the sequence of flips or the sorted array?
   - The output should be the sequence of flips (values of `k`) used to sort the array.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Largest Element**: Identify the largest unsorted element and its position.
2. **Bring to Front**: If the largest unsorted element is not already at the front, flip it to the front using a pancake flip.
3. **Move to Sorted Position**: Flip it to its correct position in the sorted part of the array.
4. **Continue**: Repeat the process for the next largest element not yet in its sorted position.
5. **End Condition**: When the array is sorted.

### Code

Here is the C++ code that implements the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> pancakeSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    int n = arr.size();

    // We sort n, n-1, ... 2
    for (int size = n; size > 1; --size) {
        // Find the index of the largest element in arr[0...size-1]
        int maxIndex = std::max_element(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + size) - arr.begin();

        // If the largest element is already in place, continue
        if (maxIndex == size - 1) {
            continue;
        }

        // If the largest element is not at the front, flip it to the front
        if (maxIndex > 0) {
            result.push_back(maxIndex + 1);
            std::reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + maxIndex + 1);
        }

        // Then flip it to its correct position
        result.push_back(size);
        std::reverse(arr.begin(), arr.begin() + size);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the Maximum Element**: Each time we need to find the maximum element in the subarray, which takes O(n) in the worst case.
- **Reversing the Subarray**: The reversing operation takes O(n) in the worst case.

Since we are iterating through the array and performing these operations for each element that needs to be sorted, the overall time complexity will be O(n^2). This is acceptable for the problem constraints and ensures the array gets sorted using the pancake flip method.
