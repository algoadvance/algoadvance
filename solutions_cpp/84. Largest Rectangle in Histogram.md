[Leetcode 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l84)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the elements in the `heights` array?
   - What is the maximum possible number of elements in the `heights` array?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output always be a non-negative integer?
   
3. **Special Cases:**
   - How should we handle an empty `heights` array?

Assuming the `heights` array can have up to `10^5` elements, each with a potential height up to `10^4`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack-based approach. The idea is to use a stack to keep track of the indices of the histogram bars and calculate the area for each bar considering it as the shortest bar in the rectangle.

1. Iterate through each bar in the histogram.
2. Maintain a stack to store the indices of the histogram bars.
3. If the current bar is higher than the bar at the index on top of the stack, push the current index to the stack.
4. If the current bar is lower, compute the area for all bars that are higher than the current bar by popping from the stack until you find a bar that is lower than or equal to the current bar.
5. After iterating through all bars, ensure to compute the area for the remaining bars in the stack.
6. Return the maximum area obtained.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm> 

class Solution {
public:
    int largestRectangleArea(std::vector<int>& heights) {
        std::stack<int> stk;
        int max_area = 0;
        int n = heights.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            while (!stk.empty() && heights[stk.top()] > heights[i]) {
                int h = heights[stk.top()];
                stk.pop();
                int width = stk.empty() ? i : i - stk.top() - 1;
                max_area = std::max(max_area, h * width);
            }
            stk.push(i);
        }
        
        while (!stk.empty()) {
            int h = heights[stk.top()];
            stk.pop();
            int width = stk.empty() ? n : n - stk.top() - 1;
            max_area = std::max(max_area, h * width);
        }
        
        return max_area;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram. Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the stack that stores the indices of the bars.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the largest rectangle in the histogram with linear time complexity.
