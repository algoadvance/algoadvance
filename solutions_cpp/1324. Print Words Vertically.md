[Leetcode 1324. Print Words Vertically](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1324)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. Return the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in the string. Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. 

Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "CONTEST IS COMING"
Output: ["CIC","OSO","N M","T I","E N","S G","T"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?**
   - This helps in understanding constraints for performance and memory usage.
   
2. **Can there be multiple spaces between words in the string `s`?**
   - Clarifying this helps determine how to split the string into words.

3. **What should be done with empty spaces beyond the end of shorter words in the vertical columns?**
   - This helps in determining if we need to pad the output strings with spaces.

Assuming the input is cleaning of distinct words separated by a single space, and we need to pad shorter columns with spaces.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

vector<string> printVertically(string s) {
    // Split the words using a stringstream
    stringstream ss(s);
    string word;
    vector<string> words;
    while (ss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }
    
    // Determine the maximum length of the words
    size_t maxLength = 0;
    for (const string& w : words) {
        maxLength = max(maxLength, w.size());
    }
    
    // Collect the vertical words with padding
    vector<string> result(maxLength, string(words.size(), ' '));
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < words[i].size(); ++j) {
            result[j][i] = words[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    // Trim trailing spaces
    for (string& line : result) {
        while (!line.empty() && line.back() == ' ') {
            line.pop_back();
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "CONTEST IS COMING";
    vector<string> result = printVertically(s);

    for (const string& line : result) {
        cout << '"' << line << '"' << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Split Words:**
   - Use a `stringstream` to split the input string `s` into individual words.
   - Store these words in a `vector<string>`.

2. **Calculate Maximum Length:**
   - Find the length of the longest word. This determines the number of rows.

3. **Construct Vertical Words:**
   - Initialize a `vector<string>` where each string starts as a series of spaces.
   - Fill in characters from the original words into their vertical positions.
   - Ensure each column (string in the result vector) is padded correctly with spaces.

4. **Trim Trailing Spaces:**
   - Iterate through each string in the result vector and remove trailing spaces to meet the output format.

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting Words:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is due to the single linear scan necessary to split the words.
- **Finding Maximum Length:** O(m), where m is the number of words, scanning each to check its length.
- **Constructing Vertical Words:** O(m * maxLength), where maxLength is the length of the longest word in the vector.
- **Trimming Trailing Spaces:** O(maxLength * m), a secondary scan to trim excess spaces.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n + m * maxLength).
