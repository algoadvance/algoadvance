[Leetcode 3027. Find the Number of Ways to Place People II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3027)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` as the number of seats and each seat can either be occupied by a person or left empty. You need to determine the number of ways you can place people in these seats such that no two people sit next to each other.

Return the number of ways to place these people. The answer can be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Minimum and Maximum value of n**:
   - What is the range of `n`? For example, `1 <= n <= 10^9`.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if `n` is 0? 
   - Should the answer be calculated modulo `10^9 + 7`?

Assuming:
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`.
- The result should be given modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**:
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to place people in `i` seats.
   - If the first seat is left empty, then the number of ways to place people in `i` seats is the same as `dp[i-1]`.
   - If the first seat is occupied, then the second seat must be empty, and the number of ways to place people in `i` seats is the same as placing in `i-2` seats, which means ‘dp[i-2]’.
   - Therefore, the recurrence relation is: `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There's one way to place zero people.
   - `dp[1] = 2`: There are two ways to place in one seat (empty or occupied).

3. **Space Optimization**:
   - Instead of using an array to store all values, use only two variables to represent `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` to save space.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int countWaysToPlacePeople(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    if (n == 1) return 2;

    long long prev1 = 2; // dp[1]
    long long prev2 = 1; // dp[0]
    long long curr = 0;

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        curr = (prev1 + prev2) % MOD;
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = curr;
    }

    return curr;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    cout << countWaysToPlacePeople(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: 
  - **O(n)** because we iterate from 2 to `n` once.
  
- **Space complexity**: 
  - **O(1)** as we are using only a few variables to keep track of the last two states.

This provides a highly efficient solution in terms of both time and space to the problem given the constraints.
