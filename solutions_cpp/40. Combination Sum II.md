[Leetcode 40. Combination Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l40)
## Problem Statement
Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

Each number in `candidates` may only be used once in the combination.

**Note**: The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Example:
```
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
[
  [1,1,6],
  [1,2,5],
  [1,7],
  [2,6]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the candidate numbers always positive?**
   - Yes, the problem states that the numbers are always positive integers.
   
2. **Can the candidates contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, candidates can contain duplicates, but each combination reported in the output should be unique.
   
3. **Is the order of numbers in the combination important?**
   - No, the order of numbers in a combination is not important. `[1,7]` is the same as `[7,1]`.

4. **Can the solution set contain the same combinations in a different order?**
   - No, the solution set must contain unique combinations only.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Candidates**: First, sort the candidate array to help easily skip duplicates.
  
2. **Backtracking**: Use a backtracking approach to explore all potential combinations.
  
3. **Skip Duplicates**: As we generate combinations, skip candidates that are the same as the previous candidates if they are at the same level of recursion to avoid duplicates.

4. **Base Conditions**: 
   - If the target becomes zero, store the current combination.
   - If the remaining target becomes negative, stop exploring that path.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    void backtrack(std::vector<int>& candidates, int target, int start, std::vector<int>& current_combination, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& result) {
        if (target == 0) {
            result.push_back(current_combination);
            return;
        }

        for (int i = start; i < candidates.size() && candidates[i] <= target; ++i) {
            // Skip duplicates
            if (i > start && candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]) continue;
            
            current_combination.push_back(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(candidates, target - candidates[i], i + 1, current_combination, result);
            current_combination.pop_back();
        }
    }
    
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> combinationSum2(std::vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> result;
        std::vector<int> current_combination;
        
        // Sort the candidates to handle duplicates and to make it easier to stop when the sum exceeds the target.
        std::sort(candidates.begin(), candidates.end());
        
        backtrack(candidates, target, 0, current_combination, result);
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of candidates.
- **Backtracking**: In the worst case, the backtracking process could explore all subsets of candidates which is \(O(2^n)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + 2^n)\) since the expensive part is the backtracking exploration of all subsets.

This completes the problem-solving process for Combination Sum II. If there are any more questions or adjustments needed, feel free to ask!
