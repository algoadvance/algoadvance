[Leetcode 1439. Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1439)
## Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` matrix, where each row is sorted in ascending order, find the `k`-th smallest sum of the matrix. The sum is defined as the sum of elements, where you take exactly one element from each row.

### Example:
- **Input**: `mat = [[1,3,11], [2,4,6]], k = 5`
- **Output**: 17
- **Explanation**: Sorted sums are `[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]`. The 5th smallest sum is 17.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are the values in the matrix always positive integers?
   - **A**: Yes.
2. **Q**: Can `k` be larger than the number of possible sums?
   - **A**: No, it is guaranteed that `k` is within a possible range.
3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix `m` or `n`?
   - **A**: Usually, constraints will be reasonable for typical computational capacity in competitive programming scenarios; still, we will assume `m, n <= 40` to guide our approach.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Use a min-heap to efficiently get the smallest sums.
2. **Heap Elements**: Each element in the heap will be a tuple containing the current sum and the indices from which it was formed.
3. **Combinations**: Start with the smallest possible sum using the first element of each row.
4. **Expand and Push**: For each smallest sum popped from the heap, push new sums formed by replacing one element with the next element in its row.
5. **Deduplication**: Use a set to avoid pushing the same combination more than once.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
        int m = mat.size(), n = mat[0].size();
        
        // Min-heap for storing (current_sum, list of indices)
        priority_queue<tuple<int, vector<int>>, vector<tuple<int, vector<int>>>, greater<>> minHeap;
        
        // Initialize heap with the smallest possible sum (using all first elements in each row)
        int initialSum = 0;
        vector<int> initialIndices(m, 0); 
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
            initialSum += mat[i][0];
        
        minHeap.push({initialSum, initialIndices});
        
        // Set to track visited configurations
        set<vector<int>> visited;
        visited.insert(initialIndices);
        
        // Extract `k` times from the heap
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            auto [currentSum, indices] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            // If this is the k-th valid sum
            if (i == k - 1)
                return currentSum;
            
            // Generate next possible sums by incrementing the index in each row
            for (int row = 0; row < m; ++row) {
                if (indices[row] + 1 < n) {
                    vector<int> newIndices = indices;
                    newIndices[row]++;
                    int newSum = currentSum - mat[row][indices[row]] + mat[row][newIndices[row]];
                    
                    if (visited.find(newIndices) == visited.end()) {
                        minHeap.push({newSum, newIndices});
                        visited.insert(newIndices);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // This line should never be reached
    }
};

// Example usage
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     vector<vector<int>> mat = \{\{1, 3, 11}, {2, 4, 6}};
//     int k = 5;
//     int result = sol.kthSmallest(mat, k);
//     std::cout << "The 5th smallest sum is: " << result << std::endl; // Output: 17
// }
```

## Time Complexity
- Initialization: `O(m)`, calculating the initial sum.
- Push/Pop operations in the heap: Up to `k` times `log(k)` operations.
- Generating new configurations: Roughly `k * m * log(k)`.
- **Overall**: `O(m + k * m * log(k))`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently explore the smallest sums first, avoiding combinatorial explosion with the use of a min-heap and a set for deduplication.
