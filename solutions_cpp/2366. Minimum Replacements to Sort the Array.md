[Leetcode 2366. Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2366)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace any element of the array with any two elements that sum to it.

- For example, consider `nums = [5,6,7]`. In one operation, you can replace `nums[1]` with `2` and `4`. One operation will transform the array to `[5,2,4,7]`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array non-decreasing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array elements?**
   - The array elements are integers.
   - The array length is up to \(10^5\).
   - Each element in the array is up to \(10^9\).

2. **Is it guaranteed to have at least one valid operation for sorting the array?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees there is a solution.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each element in the array is less than or equal to the next element. The trick here is to minimize the replacements required.

We should iterate from the end of the array to the beginning, ensuring each element is non-decreasing with respect to its next element. If we find an element that is greater than the next, we need to replace it in a way that reduces its value such that it becomes less than or equal to the next element.

The optimal solution can be obtained by repeatedly splitting larger elements into two smaller elements such that the array becomes non-decreasing.

### Code

Here's the C++ code to implement the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumReplacement(vector<int>& nums) {
        long long replacements = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        int curr_min = nums[n - 1];

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (nums[i] > curr_min) {
                // We need to split nums[i] into x parts such that each part <= curr_min
                int parts = (nums[i] + curr_min - 1) / curr_min; // ceil division
                curr_min = nums[i] / parts; // new current minimum should be at least the value of each part
                replacements += parts - 1; // We need parts - 1 splits to get parts pieces
            } else {
                curr_min = nums[i]; // No split needed, just update the curr_min
            }
        }

        return replacements;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize `replacements` to zero to count the number of operations.
   - `curr_min` is initialized to the last element because there's nothing to compare it with.

2. **Iterate from the end to the beginning**:
   - For each element, check if it's greater than `curr_min`.
   - If greater, determine the number of parts needed to break it down so that every part is `<= curr_min`.
   - Calculate the necessary replacements (`parts - 1`) and update `curr_min` accordingly.
   - If the current element is already <= `curr_min`, just update `curr_min`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array since we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
