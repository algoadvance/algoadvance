[Leetcode 3128. Right Triangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3128)
Sure, let's tackle this problem methodically. Here’s a step-by-step approach to solving a problem called "Right Triangles-out" on LeetCode:

### Problem Statement

Given a list of points in a 2D plane, your task is to count the number of right triangles that can be formed such that the right angle is not at the origin point (0,0).

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the points guaranteed to be unique?
2. Can points lie on the axes or only in the first quadrant?
3. Do the points include the origin (0,0) itself?
4. What is the maximum possible number of points provided?

These clarifications help us handle edge cases correctly. For now, I will assume:
1. Points are unique.
2. Points can lie anywhere in the 2D plane.
3. The input may or may not include the origin.
4. The number of points is reasonably large, but within typical competitive programming constraints.

### Strategy to Solve the Problem

To form a right triangle, we need to identify potential candidates where:
1. One of the points forms the right angle.
2. The other two points can be aligned such that one is horizontally aligned with the right-angle point, and the other is vertically aligned, without involving the origin.

We will iterate through each point and count how many horizontal and vertical pairs can be formed:

1. Use a map to count occurrences of x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
2. Iterate through each point again, and for each point `(xi, yi)`, calculate the potential pairs using the counts of `xi` and `yi` excluding the point itself if at origin.
3. Multiply the counts to get the total number of right triangles centered at each point.

### Code

Here’s how you can implement it in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int countRightTrianglesOut(vector<pair<int, int>>& points) {
    unordered_map<int, int> xCount;
    unordered_map<int, int> yCount;
    int totalTriangles = 0;

    // Count the occurrences of each x and y coordinate.
    for (const auto& point : points) {
        xCount[point.first]++;
        yCount[point.second]++;
    }

    // For each point, use the counts to determine potential triangles
    for (const auto& point : points) {
        int xi = point.first;
        int yi = point.second;

        // Exclude the current point itself
        int vertPairs = yCount[yi] - 1;
        int horizPairs = xCount[xi] - 1;

        // Update the total number of triangles
        totalTriangles += vertPairs * horizPairs;
    }

    return totalTriangles;
}

int main() {
    vector<pair<int, int>> points = \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}};
    cout << "Number of right triangles: " << countRightTrianglesOut(points) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the operations of traversing through the list of points:

- Counting the occurrences of x and y coordinates takes O(N) time.
- Iterating through the list to calculate potential right triangles also takes O(N) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of points.

This solution efficiently counts the number of valid right triangles, ensuring that the right angle is not at the origin by design, as it does not include calculations using the origin.
