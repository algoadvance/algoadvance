[Leetcode 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1290)
### Problem Statement
1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Given the head of a singly linked list where each node contains a single binary digit (0 or 1), return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

#### Example:
- **Input**: `head = [1,0,1]`
- **Output**: `5`
- **Explanation**: The linked list represents the binary number (101) in decimal is 5.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the linked list be empty?
   **A**: No, the problem guarantees at least one node in the linked list.
2. **Q**: Are there limits on the length of the linked list?
   **A**: The length of the linked list is between 1 and 30.
3. **Q**: Can the linked list contain values other than 0 and 1?
   **A**: No, each node will only contain 0 or 1 as per the problem description.

### Strategy
1. Traverse the linked list.
2. Convert the binary number represented by the linked list to a decimal number:
   - Initialize a variable to store the result as 0.
   - For each node, shift the result to the left by 1 (equivalent to multiplying by 2) and add the current node's value.
3. Return the resultant decimal value.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int result = 0;
        ListNode* current = head;
        
        while (current != nullptr) {
            result = (result << 1) | current->val;  // Shift left and add current node's value
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    Solution solution;
    
    // Creating the linked list [1,0,1]
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
    head->next = new ListNode(0);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(1);
    
    // Output should be 5
    std::cout << "Decimal Value: " << solution.getDecimalValue(head) << std::endl;

    // Freeing the linked list
    while (head != nullptr) {
        ListNode* temp = head;
        head = head->next;
        delete temp;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is **O(n)** where **n** is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we need to traverse the entire linked list once to compute the decimal value.
