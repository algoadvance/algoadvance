[Leetcode 458. Poor Pigs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l458)
## Problem Statement

You have 1000 buckets, one of which contains poison. To figure out which one is poisoned, you can feed some number of pigs the liquid from the buckets. Each pig can drink and then live (not poisoned), or die (poisoned) after a certain amount of time. You can run tests in intervals equal to the time it takes for a pig to die from poison, and you know that it takes `minutesToDie` minutes for a pig to die after drinking poison, and you can only use up to `minutesToTest` minutes to test all the buckets.

You need to figure out the minimum number of pigs required to identify the poisoned bucket within the given time constraints.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the pigs allowed to drink from multiple buckets?**
   - Yes, we can use each pig to drink from different buckets over multiple intervals.
   
2. **Is `minutesToDie` constant for all pigs?**
   - Yes, the time it takes for a pig to die after consuming poison is constant for every pig.

3. **What happens if a pig drinks from multiple buckets and one is poisoned?**
   - If any bucket contains poison, the pig will die. If none do, the pig will live.

## Strategy

Here's how to approach the problem:
1. **Interval Calculation:** Calculate the number of intervals we have. This is `minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1`. The `+1` accounts for the initial state (before the first test).
2. **Dimensional Representation:** Think of each pig as a dimension in which buckets can be represented. Each dimension allows us to represent additional buckets by encoding more information with the state (dead/alive) of each pig over multiple intervals.
3. **Combinations Calculation:** Calculate the minimum number of pigs required such that with the given intervals, all bucket states can be represented. This can be expressed as `pigs >= log(buckets) / log(intervals)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        // Calculate the number of intervals we have
        int intervals = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1;
        
        // Use logarithm to calculate the minimum number of pigs required
        int pigs = std::ceil(std::log(buckets) / std::log(intervals));
        
        return pigs;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int buckets = 1000;
    int minutesToDie = 15;
    int minutesToTest = 60;
    
    std::cout << "Minimum number of pigs required: " << sol.poorPigs(buckets, minutesToDie, minutesToTest) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Intervals Calculation:** The variable `intervals` determines how many distinct tests you can conduct during the allowed time.
2. **Logarithm Calculation:** The formula `log(buckets) / log(intervals)` leverages logarithmic properties to determine the minimum number of pigs required. This is because each pig adds an exponential increase in the number of buckets we can test.
3. **Ceil:** We use the `std::ceil` function to ensure that any fractional number of pigs rounds up to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a pig.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(1)` because the calculations involved (logarithms and ceiling) are constant time operations. The problem primarily focuses on mathematical calculations rather than iterating through the buckets, making it very efficient.
