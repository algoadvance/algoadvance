[Leetcode 547. Number of Provinces](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l547)
### Problem Statement

The problem "Number of Provinces" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

> There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.
>
> A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
>
> You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.
>
> Return the total number of provinces.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints?**
   - `1 <= n <= 200`
   - `isConnected[i][i] = 1` for all `i` meaning each city is connected to itself.
   - `isConnected[i][j] = isConnected[j][i]` indicating the undirected nature of the graph.

2. **Output Specification?**
   - An integer representing the number of provinces.

### Strategy

We need to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph represented by the `isConnected` matrix. Here's a straightforward approach:

1. **Graph Representation:** Use the `isConnected` matrix as an adjacency matrix to represent the graph.
2. **Traversal:** Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find all connected components.
3. **Visited Tracking:** Use an array to keep track of visited cities to ensure each city is processed exactly once.
4. **Count Components:** Every time we start a new DFS/BFS from an unvisited node, it indicates we've found a new province.

### Code

Here is the C++ code for the solution using DFS:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(int city, vector<vector<int>>& isConnected, vector<bool>& visited) {
        visited[city] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < isConnected.size(); ++i) {
            if (isConnected[city][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, isConnected, visited);
            }
        }
    }

    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        int n = isConnected.size();
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        int numberOfProvinces = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, isConnected, visited);
                numberOfProvinces++;
            }
        }

        return numberOfProvinces;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) where n is the number of cities. This is because we traverse the entire adjacency matrix.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the `visited` array and recursive call stack in the worst case.

This solution ensures we efficiently determine the number of provinces in the given graph representation.
