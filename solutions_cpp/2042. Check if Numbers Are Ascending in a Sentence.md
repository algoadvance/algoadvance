[Leetcode 2042. Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2042)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` representing a sentence containing words and numbers. Your task is to determine if the numbers in the sentence are strictly ascending.

A sentence is a list of tokens separated by a single space. Tokens can be either words or numbers. A word consists of only lowercase English letters, while a number consists of only digits.

Return `true` if the numbers in `s` are strictly ascending, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The string `s` will only contain lowercase English letters, digits, and spaces.
   - There is at least one token in the string.

2. **Output**:
   - Return `true` if all numbers in the sentence are in strictly ascending order.
   - Return `false` otherwise.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Sentences without any numbers.
   - Sentences with one number.
   - Mixed sequences of words and numbers.

### Strategy

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Split the string `s` by spaces to isolate individual tokens.
   
2. **Identifying Numbers**:
   - Check each token to determine if it is a number or a word.
   - If it is a number (all characters are digits), compare it with the previous number to ensure the numbers are in ascending order.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Maintain a variable to track the last seen number.
   - Ensure each new number is greater than the last seen number.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <climits>
#include <iostream>

bool areNumbersAscending(std::string s) {
    std::istringstream stream(s);
    std::string token;
    int prevNumber = INT_MIN;

    while (stream >> token) {
        // Check if the token is a number
        bool isNumber = true;
        for (char c : token) {
            if (!isdigit(c)) {
                isNumber = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isNumber) {
            int number = std::stoi(token);
            if (number <= prevNumber) {
                return false;
            }
            prevNumber = number;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

// Sample Usage
int main() {
    std::string s1 = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 7 green and 8 yellow marbles";
    std::string s2 = "5 hello 2 world";
    std::string s3 = "this is a test 1 2 3";

    std::cout << std::boolalpha << areNumbersAscending(s1) << std::endl; // True
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << areNumbersAscending(s2) << std::endl; // False
    std::cout << std::boolalpha << areNumbersAscending(s3) << std::endl; // True

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Tokenization and Checking**: Each token is processed exactly once.
  - Splitting the string and iterating through tokens is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the string.
  - Checking if a token is a number is O(m), where m is the length of the token.
  - Overall complexity is O(n) as we iterate through all characters once.

In total, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the problem constraints.
