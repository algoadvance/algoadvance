[Leetcode 2453. Destroy Sequential Targets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2453)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `space`, return the number of distinct integers that can be destroyed by bombs placed at each integer in `nums` under the following conditions:
- A bomb destroys all integers counted up to `space` steps from itself (both forwards and backwards) inclusively. 

The function signature is:
```cpp
int destroyTargets(vector<int>& nums, int space);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` array? (e.g., \(1 \leq \text{size of nums} \leq 10^5\))
   - What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and `space`? (e.g., \(1 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^9\), \(1 \leq \text{space} \leq 10^9\))

2. **Behavior:**
   - If the `nums` array has duplicate values, should they be counted as separate targets, or are we interested only in distinct values?
   - How do we handle negative values in `nums`, if their support is within bounds?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Bomb Effect:**
   - By placing a bomb at an index `i` (represented by `nums[i]`), it can destroy all elements from `nums[i] - space` to `nums[i] + space`. 

2. **Utilize HashMap for Counting:**
   - We can use a hash map to keep track of all numbers that can be destroyed when a bomb is placed at a specific index in the `nums` array.

3. **Steps:**
   - Iterate through `nums`, and for each number, calculate the range of numbers (`[num - space, num + space]`) that can be destroyed.
   - Use a set to keep track of the unique destroyed targets within the acceptable range.
   - Return the size of the set, as it represents the count of unique destroyed targets.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int destroyTargets(vector<int>& nums, int space) {
    unordered_set<int> destroyedTargets;
    for(int num : nums) {
        for (int i = num - space; i <= num + space; ++i) {
            destroyedTargets.insert(i);
        }
    }
    return destroyedTargets.size();
}
```

### Time Complexity

- In the worst case, for each number in `nums` (let's say the size of `nums` is `n`), we are iterating over a range of `2 * space + 1` values.
- Thus, the time complexity is `O(n * (2 * space + 1))`.
- This is efficient given reasonable values for `space`, but it could be problematic if `space` is extremely large.
