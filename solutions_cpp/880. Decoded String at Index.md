[Leetcode 880. Decoded String at Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l880)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 880: **Decoded String at Index**

An encoded string `S` is given. To find and write the decoded string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

- If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
- If the character read is a digit (say `d`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d-1` more times in total.

Given an encoded string `S` and an index `K`, find and return the `K`-th letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum possible length of string `S`?**
   - This information would help in understanding constraints and edge cases.
2. **Can `K` be larger than the possible length of the decoded string?**
   - If `K` is always valid, it simplifies the problem as we don't need to handle out-of-bounds cases.
3. **What kind of characters does `S` contain?**
   - Let's confirm if `S` contains only lowercase letters and digits.

Assuming typical constraints:
- The length of an encoded string `S` can be up to 100 characters.
- `K` is always valid and within the bounds of the decoded string length.
- `S` contains only lowercase letters and digits.

## Strategy

1. **Simulate Decoding Process**:
   - Iterate through the encoded string while tracking the length of the decoded string without actually constructing it.
2. **Work Backwards to Find K-th Character**:
   - Using the accumulated length, track back through the encoded string to determine the K-th character.
3. **Efficiency**:
   - Ensure that the solution works efficiently given the possibly large size of the decoded string.

### Approach

1. **Calculate Length**: Traverse through the string to determine the length of the final decoded string.
2. **Reverse Approach**: Once the size is determined, work backwards from the end of `S` to find the position of the K-th character.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string decodeAtIndex(string S, int K) {
        long long size = 0;  // Long long to handle large sizes
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the size of the final decoded string.
        for (char c : S) {
            if (isdigit(c)) {
                size *= (c - '0');
            } else {
                size++;
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Work backwards to find the K-th character.
        for (int i = S.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            K %= size;
            
            if (K == 0 && isalpha(S[i])) {
                return string(1, S[i]);
            }
            
            if (isdigit(S[i])) {
                size /= (S[i] - '0');
            } else {
                size--;
            }
        }
        
        return "";  // Should not be reached
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity**: O(N)
- Iterating through the encoded string twice: once to calculate length and once to backtrack.

**Space Complexity**: O(1)
- Using constant extra space for calculations.

This approach efficiently determines the K-th character in the decoded string without explicitly constructing the entire decoded string, making it suitable for large values of `K` and large decoded strings.
