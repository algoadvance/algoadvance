[Leetcode 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1092)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: "cabac" is the shortest common supersequence.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the strings `str1` and `str2`?**
   - For the scope of general use, letâ€™s assume the length is up to 1000.

2. **Can `str1` and `str2` be empty?**
   - Yes, either or both can be empty strings.

3. **What characters can appear in the strings?**
   - The strings contain lowercase English letters only.

4. **Should the output string maintain the relative order of characters from both input strings?**
   - Yes, the order should be maintained as the result must be a supersequence of both `str1` and `str2`.

## Strategy

1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**
   - First, find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of `str1` and `str2`. This is because the LCS helps in minimizing the length of the common supersequence.
   
2. **Construct Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS):**
   - Use the LCS to build the shortest common supersequence by merging `str1` and `str2` around the LCS while maintaining their relative order.

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the LCS using Dynamic Programming:**
   - Build a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of `str1[0..i-1]` and `str2[0..j-1]`.
   
2. **Backtrack to Find the LCS String:**
   - Construct the LCS by backtracking through the DP table.

3. **Construct the SCS:**
   - Use the LCS to weave `str1` and `str2` together ensuring the relative order is maintained.

## Code

Here is how we can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string shortestCommonSupersequence(string str1, string str2) {
        int m = str1.size(), n = str2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

        // Populate the DP table for LCS
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
                if (str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Backtrack to find the LCS
        string lcs;
        int i = m, j = n;
        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
            if (str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]) {
                lcs.push_back(str1[i - 1]);
                i--; j--;
            } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
                i--;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
        }
        reverse(lcs.begin(), lcs.end());

        // Construct SCS
        string scs;
        i = 0; j = 0;
        for (char c : lcs) {
            while (str1[i] != c) {
                scs.push_back(str1[i++]);
            }
            while (str2[j] != c) {
                scs.push_back(str2[j++]);
            }
            scs.push_back(c);
            i++; j++;
        }
        scs += str1.substr(i) + str2.substr(j);

        return scs;
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab";
    cout << sol.shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be broken down into two parts:
1. **Building the LCS DP Table:** This takes \(O(m \times n)\) time where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively.
2. **Constructing the SCS from LCS:** This process also takes \(O(m + n)\) time as we traverse both strings.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\).

## Conclusion
This approach first determines the LCS of the two strings, which is used to guide the construction of the Shortest Common Supersequence. The method ensures minimal length of the resultant supersequence while maintaining the order of characters from both input strings.
