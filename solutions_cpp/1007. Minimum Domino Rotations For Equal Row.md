[Leetcode 1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1007)
### Problem Statement:

You have two rows of dominoes, `tops` and `bottoms`.

A domino is a pair of numbers `tops[i]` and `bottoms[i]` which represents the top and bottom numbers of the i-th domino. Flip the `i-th` domino such that "tops" and "bottoms" remain in alternating order.

Find the minimum number of flips to make all the values in `tops` the same, or all the values in `bottoms` the same. If it cannot be done, return -1.

**Example:**
```
Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first domino can be flipped to make tops = [2,2,2,4,2,2]
or bottom[0], bottom[3], bottom[4] can keep the value of 2 as top like tops = [2,1,2,2,2,2]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the lengths of `tops` and `bottoms` guaranteed to be the same?**
   - Yes, both arrays are of equal length.
2. **What values do the elements of `tops` and `bottoms` contain?**
   - These arrays contain integers typically in the range 1 through 6 (like the faces of a standard domino).

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to check for each unique number in the arrays `tops` and `bottoms` if we can make all values in `tops` or `bottoms` uniform to that number with the minimum flips. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Identify Candidate Numbers**: The numbers at `tops[0]` and `bottoms[0]` are potential candidates for making all top or bottom values uniform (denoted as `x` and `y` respectively).
2. **Count Flips**: For each candidate number, count the necessary flips to make all elements in `tops` or `bottoms` equal.
3. **Check Feasibility**: If for any candidate number we fail to make all values uniform in either row, discard that candidate.
4. **Minimize Rotations**: Return the minimum number of flips among all candidates. If no candidate can make the row uniform, return -1.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minDominoRotations(std::vector<int>& tops, std::vector<int>& bottoms) {
    int n = tops.size();
    int candidate1 = tops[0];
    int candidate2 = bottoms[0];
    
    auto countFlips = [&](int x) -> int {
        int topFlips = 0, bottomFlips = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (tops[i] != x && bottoms[i] != x) return -1;
            if (tops[i] != x) ++topFlips;
            if (bottoms[i] != x) ++bottomFlips;
        }
        return std::min(topFlips, bottomFlips);
    };
    
    int rotations1 = countFlips(candidate1);
    int rotations2 = (candidate1 == candidate2) ? rotations1 : countFlips(candidate2);
    
    if (rotations1 == -1 && rotations2 == -1) return -1;
    if (rotations1 == -1) return rotations2;
    if (rotations2 == -1) return rotations1;
    
    return std::min(rotations1, rotations2);
}

```

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**: The function `countFlips` iterates over the input arrays once for each candidate number (both at most 2 candidates).

The overall time complexity is linear relative to the size of the inputs, making it efficient for the problem's constraints.
