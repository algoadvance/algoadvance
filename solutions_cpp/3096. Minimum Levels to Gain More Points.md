[Leetcode 3096. Minimum Levels to Gain More Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3096)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a game and need to level up by gaining points in various levels. Each level `i` gives `points[i]` points. Additionally, there is a condition that you must gain at least `min_gain` points in total for each level `i`.

The objective is to find out the minimum number of levels you must play to achieve at least the given minimum points required.

**Example:**
```
points = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
min_gain = 11
```
Output: 3 (You can achieve this by playing levels with points 3, 4 and 5)

If the minimum points can't be achieved, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the points in the levels always positive integers?
2. Can we assume the input values will always be valid integers?
3. Is it guaranteed that there is at least a combination of levels that achieves the minimum points required?

Let's proceed to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the levels by points in descending order:** This will help us get the maximum points by using the least number of levels.
2. **Initialize a total points counter:**
3. **Iterate through the sorted list, accumulating points:** As soon as the accumulated total points meet or exceed `min_gain`, return the number of levels used.
4. **If the iteration completes and the `min_gain` is not met, return `-1`:**

This strategy ensures that we find the minimum number of levels needed to achieve the required points by prioritizing higher point levels first.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minLevelsToGainPoints(std::vector<int>& points, int min_gain) {
    // Sort points in descending order
    std::sort(points.begin(), points.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    int total_points = 0;
    int levels_count = 0;
    
    // Accumulate points until we reach or exceed min_gain
    for (int point : points) {
        total_points += point;
        levels_count++;
        if (total_points >= min_gain) {
            return levels_count;
        }
    }
    
    // If we finish the loop and haven't reached min_gain, return -1
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> points = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int min_gain = 11;
    
    int result = minLevelsToGainPoints(points, min_gain);
    
    if (result != -1) {
        std::cout << "Minimum levels needed: " << result << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "It's not possible to achieve the minimum gain." << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of levels.
- **Iteration:** The iteration through the points array has a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).
