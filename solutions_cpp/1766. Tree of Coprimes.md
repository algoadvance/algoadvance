[Leetcode 1766. Tree of Coprimes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1766)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and each node has a value. You are also given an array `nums` where `nums[i]` is the value assigned to the `i-th` node.

A pair of nodes `(u, v)` is coprime if `gcd(nums[u], nums[v]) == 1` (where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`).

For each node, find the closest ancestor node such that their values are coprime. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the size of the tree (`n`)? 
      - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
    - What range do the values in `nums` lie within?
      - `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`

2. **Output Format:**
    - An array `result` of length `n` where `result[i]` is the closest ancestor of `i` for which the values of `nums[i]` and `nums[ancestor]` are coprime, or `-1` if no such ancestor exists.

3. **Additional Details:**
    - Given the constraints, it is important to handle the solution efficiently both in terms of time and space.

### Strategy

Given that we need to find coprime ancestor nodes efficiently, a Depth First Search (DFS) approach could be useful. Here's a step-by-step strategy for solving the problem:

1. **Graph Representation:**
    - Use adjacency list to represent the tree.
   
2. **DFS Traversal:**
    - Use DFS to traverse the tree from the root.
    - Store the nodes and their depth using a stack or recursion.

3. **Track Ancestors Efficiently:**
    - Maintain an array (or hashmap) to keep track of the latest occurrence of each number (from `1` to `50` in `nums`) at different depths.
    - While at a node, for each potential ancestor value (from `1` to `50`), check if it is coprime with the current nodeâ€™s value. If so, update the result for the current node.
    
4. **Update and Restore State:**
    - Use a backtracking approach to restore the state after DFS explores all children of a node.

### Code Implementation

Here is the C++ implementation for the given problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getCoprimes(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<vector<int>> tree(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            tree[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            tree[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        vector<int> result(n, -1);
        unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> lastSeen; // value -> (depth, node)
        
        function<void(int, int, int)> dfs = [&](int node, int parent, int depth) {
            int maxDepth = -1;
            int ancestor = -1;
            for (int v = 1; v <= 50; ++v) {
                if (lastSeen.count(v) && gcd(nums[node], v) == 1) {
                    if (lastSeen[v].first > maxDepth) {
                        maxDepth = lastSeen[v].first;
                        ancestor = lastSeen[v].second;
                    }
                }
            }
            result[node] = ancestor;
            // Save the current state
            bool restored = lastSeen.count(nums[node]);
            pair<int, int> old = lastSeen[nums[node]];
            lastSeen[nums[node]] = {depth, node};
            
            for (int neighbor : tree[node]) {
                if (neighbor != parent) {
                    dfs(neighbor, node, depth + 1);
                }
            }
            // Restore the previous state
            if (restored) {
                lastSeen[nums[node]] = old;
            } else {
                lastSeen.erase(nums[node]);
            }
        };

        dfs(0, -1, 0);
        return result;
    }
    
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {2,3,6,2,1,5,4};
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0,1},{1,2},{1,3},{3,4},{4,5},{5,6}};
    vector<int> result = sol.getCoprimes(nums, edges);
    
    for (int i : result) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the upper limit for values in `nums` (50 in this case). Given the constraints, this should be efficient and acceptable.

- **DFS Traversal:** `O(n)` since each node is visited exactly once.
- **Checking coprime ancestors:** `O(1)` operations for each value in the range [1, 50] at each node.

The overall complexity is `O(n * 50)` which simplifies to `O(n)`. This ensures the solution is efficient even for the upper limits of the constraints.
