[Leetcode 1478. Allocate Mailboxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1478)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of houses represented as coordinates on a 1-dimensional line, we need to allocate mailboxes such that the total distance from each house to its nearest mailbox is minimized. We are allowed to place exactly `k` mailboxes on the line.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What is the range of the number of houses `n`?
   - What is the range of the number of mailboxes `k`?
 
2. **Output Details:**
   - Should the output be the minimum total distance? 
   - Is the input always valid such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`?

3. **House Coordinates:**
   - Are the house coordinates guaranteed to be unique?
   - Are the house coordinates sorted?

Assuming input constraints and details are typical for LeetCode problems and are as follows:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ k ≤ n`
- Coordinates are unique and provided in a sorted manner.

### Strategy

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp[i][j]` to represent the minimum total distance for the first `i` houses with `j` mailboxes.
   - Create a helper 2D array `cost[i][j]` that stores the cost of placing a single mailbox for houses from `i` to `j`. The cost is the sum of distances to the median house in the range `[i, j]`.

2. **Filling the Cost Array:**
   - For each range of houses, calculate the cost placing a mailbox by finding the median house and summing the absolute distances from all houses in the range to the median.

3. **Transition Equation:**
   - Update the `dp` array using the formula:
     ```cpp
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[m-1][j-1] + cost[m][i]) for all valid `m`
     ```

4. **Result:**
   - The final result will be stored in `dp[n][k]`.

### Time Complexity

- Precomputing the `cost` array takes `O(n^2)`.
- Filling the `dp` array involves iterating through all pairs of `i` and `j` and checking all split points `m`, leading to a total time complexity of `O(n^3)`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(vector<int>& houses, int k) {
        int n = houses.size();
        vector<vector<int>> cost(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
        
        // Precompute the cost of placing one mailbox between houses[i] to houses[j]
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                int median = (i + j) / 2;
                for (int m = i; m <= j; ++m) {
                    cost[i][j] += abs(houses[m] - houses[median]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // dp[i][j]: the minimum distance to allocate j mailboxes among first i houses
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, INT_MAX));
        
        // Base case: no houses cost 0 irrespective of number of mailboxes
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                for (int m = 1; m <= i; ++m) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[m-1][j-1] + cost[m-1][i-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```

In this code, we precompute the costs of placing single mailboxes and then use dynamic programming to determine the minimum total distance for different configurations of houses and mailboxes.
