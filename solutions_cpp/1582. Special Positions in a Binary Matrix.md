[Leetcode 1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1582)
## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return the number of special positions in the matrix.

A position `(i,j)` is called special if `mat[i][j] == 1` and all the other elements in row `i` and column `j` are `0`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [1,0,0]]
Output: 1
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the values in `mat`?**
    - The values in `mat` are binary, i.e., either `0` or `1`.
 
2. **What should be returned if there are no special positions?**
    - If there are no special positions, return `0`.

3. **Can `mat` be an empty matrix?**
    - No, the problem guarantees that `mat` will have at least one row and one column.

4. **What are the constraints on `m` and `n`?**
    - Constraints typically range between `1 <= m, n <= 100`. This makes an `O(m * n)` solution feasible as it would result in a maximum of `10,000` operations.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. **Iterate through the matrix to identify positions where `mat[i][j] == 1`**.
2. **For each such position, verify that all other elements in row `i` and column `j` are 0**.
3. **Count such special positions**.

Matrices with values strictly within a limited range allow us to use nested loops to check rows and columns for verification.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(m * n)** because:
1. We iterate through each element in the matrix once.
2. For every `1` found, we verify its row and column, making another pass of at most `m + n` elements.

This results in an overall complexity of `O(m * n) + k * O(m + n)`, where `k` is the number of `1`s, but given constraints, it simplifies to `O(m * n)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int numSpecial(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat) {
        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    bool isSpecial = true;
                    
                    // Check the entire row
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                        if (k != j && mat[i][k] == 1) {
                            isSpecial = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    // Check the entire column
                    if (isSpecial) {
                        for (int k = 0; k < m; ++k) {
                            if (k != i && mat[k][j] == 1) {
                                isSpecial = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    
                    if (isSpecial) ++count;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

This approach iterates through each element and checks its row and column conditions to determine if it's a special position or not.
