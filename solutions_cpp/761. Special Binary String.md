[Leetcode 761. Special Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l761)
### Problem Statement

A special binary string is defined as:
- It is a non-empty binary string, starting with '1' and ending with '0'.
- The number of 1's is equal to the number of 0's.

Given a special binary string `S`, you can transform it into larger lexicographical order by repeatedly inserting its "balanced" substrings appropriately. Return the lexicographically largest special binary string obtained after any number of these transformations.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed with solving the problem, letâ€™s clarify a few things:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The length of the string \( S \) will be even and will not exceed a reasonable limit (e.g., \( 10^3 \)).
2. **Examples**:
   - For a direct example:
     - Input: `"11011000"`, Output: `"11100100"`
3. **Assumptions**:
   - The input string is always valid and meets the special binary string criteria.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - The idea is to recursively break the problem into smaller parts.
   - We will start by locating all the balanced substrings.
   - The recursion will reorder these substrings to form the lexicographically largest string.
   
2. **Steps**:
   - For the given string, find the special substrings.
   - Recursively process each substring to ensure it forms the largest lexicographical order.
   - Sort all processed special substrings in reverse lexicographic order.
   - Concatenate them to form the final result.
   
3. **Recursion Base Case**:
   - If the string is empty or consists of a single special binary substring, return it directly.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string makeLargestSpecial(string S) {
        // Base case: If the string is empty or contains only one special substring
        if (S.empty()) return S;

        vector<string> substrings;
        int count = 0, start = 0;

        // Divide the string into special substrings
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); ++i) {
            if (S[i] == '1') {
                ++count;
            } else {
                --count;
            }

            if (count == 0) {
                // Recursively process the inner substring and add '1' at start and '0' at the end
                substrings.push_back("1" + makeLargestSpecial(S.substr(start + 1, i - start - 1)) + "0");
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }

        // Sort the substrings in reverse order to get the largest lexicographical order
        sort(substrings.rbegin(), substrings.rend());

        // Join all substrings to form the final result
        string result;
        for (const string& s : substrings) {
            result += s;
        }
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string input = "11011000";
    string result = solution.makeLargestSpecial(input);
    cout << "Output: " << result << endl;  // Should output: "11100100"
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Identification of Substrings**: Linear-time operation to iterate through the string once, making the time complexity \( O(n) \).
- **Recursive Processing and Sorting**: Each recursive level handles substrings and sorts them. Sorting, in the worst case, can take \( O(n \log n) \).
- **Combining Results**: Linear-time operation, \( O(n) \).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution can be approximated to \( O(n \log n) \), primarily due to the sorting step at each recursion level.
