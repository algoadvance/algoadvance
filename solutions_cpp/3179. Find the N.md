[Leetcode 3179. Find the N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3179)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and two integers `N` and `K`, return the N-th element of the array after removing K seconds-out. If the array has less than N elements remaining, return -1.

**Clarifications:**
1. "Removing K seconds-out" means for each number in `arr`, we sequentially remove every K-th item until there are fewer than K items, at which point the function should stop removing elements and we check if the N-th element exists.
2. The array elements and `N` are 1-indexed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Example Inputs:** Can you provide an example to validate our understanding?
2. **K Value Range:** What is the range of the integer `K`?
3. **Constraints:** What is the range of the possible number of elements in the array?

### Example:

Consider `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `N = 2`, `K = 2`.

- Initially: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- Removing every 2nd element: [1, 3, 5]
- Array length is now less than K, thus stop and check the N-th element.

Output would be `3` (2nd element in [1, 3, 5]).

### Strategy

1. Iterate through the array and sequentially remove every K-th element.
2. Keep track of the current index to remove properly.
3. After each round of removals, check the length of the array.
4. If the array length is fewer than K at any point, stop further removals.
5. Check if the N-th element exists in the remaining array and return it. If not, return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int getNthElementAfterRemovals(std::vector<int>& arr, int N, int K) {
	if(N - 1 >= arr.size()) return -1; // array has less elements than N

    int currentIdx = 0;
    while (!arr.empty() && arr.size() >= K) {
        std::vector<int> temp;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
            if ((i + 1) % K != 0) {
                temp.push_back(arr[i]);
            }
        }
        arr = temp;
    }

    return (N - 1 < arr.size()) ? arr[N - 1] : -1;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int N = 2;
    int K = 2;
    int result = getNthElementAfterRemovals(arr, N, K);
    // Output should be 3
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: Runs while the array size is greater than or equal to `K`. Let's assume this executes `m` times.
- **Inner Loop**: Traverses the array which involves every `i-th` removal. The time complexity for each inner loop run is `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the array at that point.

Given that the size of the array decreases significantly with each removal:

- The worst-case time complexity is approximately `O(n^2)` due to nested traversal approximating the sum of series.

This ensures a practical approach for considerably sized arrays. For very large elements, optimizing further would involve more advanced data structures capable of reducing elements more efficiently (such as linked lists for dynamic removals).
