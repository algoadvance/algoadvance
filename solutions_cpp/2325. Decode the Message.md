[Leetcode 2325. Decode the Message](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2325)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `string key` and a `string message` which has been encoded using a substitution cipher based on the key. Find the original decoded message.

To decode the message:
- First, create a mapping of each letter in the `key` (ignoring duplicates and non-letter characters) to the 26 lowercase English letters in order. For example, if the key is "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the mapping would be: `{'t': 'a', 'h': 'b', 'e': 'c', 'q': 'd', 'u': 'e', 'i': 'f', ...}`. 
- Then use this mapping to decode the `message` by replacing each letter in `message` with its corresponding letter in the mapping. Any character in the `message` that is not a letter should remain unchanged.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should I do with characters in `message` that aren't present in `key`?
    - All characters in the `message` that are not letters should remain unchanged in the output.

2. Are both `key` and `message` guaranteed to be in lowercase?
    - Yes, both `key` and `message` are given in lowercase.

3. What if `key` is shorter than the English alphabet or doesn't contain all 26 letters?
    - It is assumed that `key` will contain at least all the letters required to decode the message properly.

### Strategy

1. **Create a mapping from the key**: Iterate through each character in the `key` and build a mapping to the 26 lowercase English letters in order. Ensure that duplicates are ignored.
2. **Decode the message**: Using the mapping from the previous step, replace each character in the `message` with its corresponding mapped character, leaving non-letter characters unchanged.
3. **Return the decoded message**: After processing the entire `message`, return the decoded version.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

std::string decodeMessage(const std::string& key, const std::string& message) {
    std::unordered_map<char, char> mapping;
    std::unordered_set<char> seen;
    char currentChar = 'a';

    // Create the mapping from the key
    for (char c : key) {
        if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
            if (seen.find(c) == seen.end()) {
                mapping[c] = currentChar;
                currentChar++;
                seen.insert(c);
            }
        }
    }

    // Decode the message
    std::string decodedMessage;
    decodedMessage.reserve(message.size());

    for (char c : message) {
        if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z') {
            decodedMessage += mapping[c];
        } else {
            decodedMessage += c;
        }
    }

    return decodedMessage;
}

int main() {
    std::string key = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    std::string message = "vkbs bs t suepuv";
    std::string decodedMessage = decodeMessage(key, message);
    std::cout << "Decoded Message: " << decodedMessage << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Mapping Creation**: O(N), where N is the length of the `key`. This is because we traverse the key once.
- **Message Decoding**: O(M), where M is the length of the `message`. This is because we traverse the message once.

Overall, the time complexity is O(N + M), which is efficient for this problem.
