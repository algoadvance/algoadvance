[Leetcode 1575. Count All Possible Routes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1575)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where locations[i] represents the position of city i along a line. You are also given integers start, finish, and fuel representing:

- start: the starting city
- finish: the destination city
- fuel: the initial amount of fuel

At each step, you can move from city i to city j (i â‰  j) based on the amount of fuel needed, which is |locations[i] - locations[j]|. You need to count all possible routes from start to finish with the given fuel.

Since the answer can be very large, you need to return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the positions of the cities guaranteed to be in ascending order?**
   - No, the positions are given in arbitrary order.
2. **Can we revisit cities multiple times?**
   - Yes, you can revisit cities as long as you have enough fuel.
3. **Is the input size large?**
   - The number of cities could be up to 100, which is manageable with dynamic programming.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We'll use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach city `i` with `j` units of fuel remaining.
2. **Initialization**: The base case is `dp[start][fuel] = 1` because we start at the `start` city with the given amount of fuel.
3. **Transitions**: For each city `i` and each possible fuel amount, we can try to move to another city `j`, updating the DP table accordingly.
4. **Final Count**: Sum up all ways to reach the `finish` city with any amount of remaining fuel.

### Code
Here's the C++ implementation using the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countRoutes(vector<int>& locations, int start, int finish, int fuel) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = locations.size();
        
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(n, vector<long long>(fuel + 1, 0));
        dp[start][fuel] = 1;
        
        for (int f = fuel; f >= 0; --f) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                if (dp[i][f] == 0) continue;
                for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                    if (i != j) {
                        int cost = abs(locations[i] - locations[j]);
                        if (f >= cost) {
                            dp[j][f - cost] = (dp[j][f - cost] + dp[i][f]) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        long long result = 0;
        for (int f = 0; f <= fuel; ++f) {
            result = (result + dp[finish][f]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2 \times \text{fuel})\)
  - We iterate over each city and each fuel state, and for each state, we try to move to every other city.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times \text{fuel})\)
  - The DP table `dp` stores the number of routes for each city and each amount of remaining fuel.

The algorithm ensures that all possible routes considering the given constraints are counted efficiently.
