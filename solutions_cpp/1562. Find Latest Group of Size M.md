[Leetcode 1562. Find Latest Group of Size M](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1562)
## Problem Statement

We are given a binary array `arr` where `arr[i]` represents the position of a flip that changes a `0` to a `1` in a sequential manner. Imagine we have an initially empty array of zeros. Each flip changes the state of a single element from `0` to `1`.

Our task is to find the latest step at which there exists a contiguous group of exactly `m` ones.

**Example:**

Given `arr = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]` and `m = 1`:
- Step 1: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]  => 1 group of size 1 -> index 3 
- Step 2: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]  => No groups of size 1 
- Step 3: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  => 2 groups of size 1 -> index 1, 3, 5
- Step 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]  => No groups of size 1 
- Step 5: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  => No groups of size 1 

Given the provided input, the correct output would be `5`, since after completing all steps, there is atleast 1 group of 1's.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length of the input array `arr`? 
   - Typically, we can assume it fits within the constraints of competitive programming (length up to 10^5).
2. Are boundaries considered inclusive? 
   - Yes, the boundaries are inclusive.
3. Should we consider 0-indexed or 1-indexed positions for the array?
   - The problem is typically addressed with 1-indexed positions.
4. Should the function return `-1` if no group of exactly `m` length is ever formed?
   - Yes, it should return `-1`.

## Strategy

1. **Use of Arrays**: We will use an array `lengths` where `lengths[i]` will capture the length of the group ending at index `i`.
2. **Boundary Indexes**: Keep track of which indices are the start and end of the contiguous groups of ones.
3. **Union-Find**: When a new `1` is added to the array, check and merge groups to modify boundaries. Update `lengths` to correctly capture the new group sizes.
4. **Count Groups**: After every insertion, check the sizes of groups and count if any group exactly matches `m`. Track the step number if such a group is found.

## Code

Let's implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findLatestStep(vector<int>& arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (m == n) return n;

        vector<int> length(n + 2, 0);
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int res = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int pos = arr[i];
            int left = length[pos - 1];
            int right = length[pos + 1];
            int newLength = left + right + 1;

            if (left > 0) count[left]--;
            if (right > 0) count[right]--;
            count[newLength]++;

            length[pos - left] = newLength;
            length[pos + right] = newLength;

            if (count[m] > 0) {
                res = i + 1;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

This solution operates in O(n) time, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. We perform constant-time operations for each flip in the input array. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the auxiliary arrays used and the map for counting group sizes.

Thus, the main complexity arises from iterating through the input and updating group lengths which are optimally handled within linear time bounds.
