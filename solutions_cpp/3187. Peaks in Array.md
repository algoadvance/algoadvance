[Leetcode 3187. Peaks in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3187)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given the array, return the indices of all the peak elements.

A peak element is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighboring elements to the left and right, with some exceptions for boundary elements:
- For the first element, it is a peak if it is greater than the second element.
- For the last element, it is a peak if it is greater than the second to last element.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array have multiple peaks?**
   - Yes, we need to return the indices of all the peak elements.

2. **What should be the output format?**
   - Return the indices of the peak elements in a vector.

3. **Are we guaranteed that `nums` has at least one element?**
   - Yes, assume `nums` will always have at least one element.

4. **Are the elements of `nums` unique?**
   - No, elements are not necessarily unique.

5. **What is the range of values we can expect for array size and elements?**
   - The constraints are not provided explicitly, assume the size of `nums` fits within typical limits for a competitive programming problem.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array** and check each element to see if it is a peak.
2. **First element**: It is a peak if it is greater than the second element.
3. **Last element**: It is a peak if it is greater than the second to last element.
4. **Middle elements**: An element is a peak if it is greater than both its neighbors.
5. Store the indices of the peak elements in a result vector and return it.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findPeakElements(vector<int>& nums) {
    vector<int> peaks;
    int n = nums.size();
    
    if (n == 0) return peaks;
    
    // Check first element
    if (n == 1 || nums[0] > nums[1]) {
        peaks.push_back(0);
    }
    
    // Check middle elements
    for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
            peaks.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    // Check last element
    if (n > 1 && nums[n - 1] > nums[n - 2]) {
        peaks.push_back(n - 1);
    }
    
    return peaks;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse the array once, resulting in a linear time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We are using only a few extra variables, and the space used by the output vector is not considered extra space.

This code efficiently finds all the peak elements in the array and returns their indices.
