[Leetcode 952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l952)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `A`, where each element of `A` represents a unique value. You need to find the size of the largest connected component in a graph where each integer in `A` is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers is greater than 1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range and Size**: What is the range of the numbers in the array `A` and the maximum size of the array?
   - Typically, we assume array size can go up to 100,000 and values up to 100,000 for complexity analysis unless otherwise specified.
   
2. **Output**: Should the output be the size of the largest connected component?
   - Yes, the output is the size of the largest component.

## Strategy
- **Graph Construction Using Union-Find**: We can represent the problem as a graph problem where each node is an element, and there's an edge between two nodes if their GCD is greater than 1.
- **Prime Factorization Optimization**: Instead of creating edges for every possible pair, we can factorize each number and connect it to its prime factors. 
- **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to efficiently manage the connected components.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int size) : parent(size), size(size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
            parent[i] = i;
    }
    
    int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x])
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x), rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
        }
    }
    
private:
    vector<int> parent;
};

class Solution {
public:
    int largestComponentSize(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size(), maxValue = *max_element(A.begin(), A.end());
        UnionFind uf(maxValue + 1);
        
        for (int num : A) {
            for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= num; ++factor) {
                if (num % factor == 0) {
                    uf.unite(num, factor);
                    uf.unite(num, num / factor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int largestComponentSize = 0;
        
        for (int num : A) {
            int root = uf.find(num);
            count[root]++;
            largestComponentSize = max(largestComponentSize, count[root]);
        }
        
        return largestComponentSize;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Union-Find Operations**: Each union and find operation is nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank, specifically O(α(N)), where α is the Inverse Ackermann function.
- **Factorization**: Factoring each number is about O(√N), where N is the maximum value in the input array.
- **Overall**: If the array length is `n` and the maximum number in `A` is `m`, the overall complexity can be approximated as O(n log n) because union-find operations tend to be very efficient, but in the worst case, it might seem O(n sqrt(m) log m) due to factoring and union-find operations. However, it is typically very efficient in practice.
