[Leetcode 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2807)
### Problem Statement

Given a Linked List, you are required to insert nodes with values of the greatest common divisor (GCD) between every pair of consecutive nodes in the list.

**Example:**

For a Linked List: 18 -> 24 -> 12

After inserting GCD nodes, the list should be:
18 -> 6 -> 24 -> 12 -> 12

Here, GCD(18, 24) = 6 and GCD(24, 12) = 12.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Node properties:** Is each node in the linked list an integer?
   - Yes, the data of each node is an integer.

2. **Modifications to the list:** Are we allowed to modify the list in place, or should we create a new linked list?
   - You should modify the list in place.

3. **Edge Cases:** What should be the behavior when the list has fewer than two elements?
   - If the list has fewer than two elements, no changes are needed.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the List:** Iterate through the linked list node by node.
2. **Compute GCD:** For each pair of consecutive nodes, compute the GCD of their values.
3. **Insert Node:** Create a new node with the GCD value and insert it between the pair of nodes.
4. **Continue Traversal:** Move to the next pair of nodes and repeat the process until the end of the list is reached.

### Code

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class ListNode {
public:
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* insertGreatestCommonDivisors(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) return head;
        
        ListNode* current = head;
        
        while (current && current->next) {
            int gcdValue = gcd(current->val, current->next->val);
            
            ListNode* gcdNode = new ListNode(gcdValue);
            
            // Insert gcdNode between current and current->next
            gcdNode->next = current->next;
            current->next = gcdNode;
            
            // Move current to the next original node
            current = gcdNode->next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
    
private:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
};

// Helper function to print the list
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head != NULL) {
        cout << head->val << " -> ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    cout << "NULL" << endl;
}

// Main function to test the solution
int main() {
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(18);
    head->next = new ListNode(24);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(12);
    
    cout << "Original list: ";
    printList(head);
    
    Solution sol;
    head = sol.insertGreatestCommonDivisors(head);
    
    cout << "Modified list: ";
    printList(head);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal of the list:** Each node is visited once, which makes this O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the original list.
- **GCD Calculation:** The time complexity for computing the GCD of two numbers is O(log(min(a,b))) using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Node Insertion:** Insertion takes O(1) time as we're just updating pointers.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n * log(min(a,b)))**, where n is the number of nodes and a, b are the values of consecutive nodes.

This solution effectively combines traversal, GCD calculation, and insertion in a straightforward manner, fitting well within the constraints of typical Linked List operations.
