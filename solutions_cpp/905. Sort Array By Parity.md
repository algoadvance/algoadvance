[Leetcode 905. Sort Array By Parity](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l905)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers. Return any array that satisfies this condition.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we dive into the solution, let's clarify the following questions:
1. Is the order of even and odd numbers required to be preserved among themselves?
   - No, the problem doesn't specify that. Any order within even and odd groups is acceptable.
2. Can we assume that the input array `nums` will always contain integers?
   - Yes, we can assume the input is a valid array of integers.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem efficiently using a two-pointer approach:
1. Initialize two pointers: one (`start`) at the beginning of the array and another (`end`) at the end of the array.
2. Traverse the array starting from both ends.
   - Increment the `start` pointer if the current element is even.
   - Decrement the `end` pointer if the current element is odd.
   - If `start` points to an odd number and `end` points to an even number, swap the elements.
3. Continue until the `start` pointer is greater than or equal to the `end` pointer.

This approach ensures that all even numbers are moved to the front and odd numbers to the back with minimal swaps.

### Code
Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> sortArrayByParity(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int start = 0;
    int end = nums.size() - 1;
    
    while (start < end) {
        if (nums[start] % 2 == 0) {
            ++start;
        } else if (nums[end] % 2 == 1) {
            --end;
        } else {
            std::swap(nums[start], nums[end]);
            ++start;
            --end;
        }
    }
    
    return nums;
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: We start with two pointers, `start` at the beginning (`0`) and `end` at the last element (`nums.size()-1`).
- **Traversal**:
  - If `nums[start]` is even (`nums[start] % 2 == 0`), move the `start` pointer to the right.
  - If `nums[end]` is odd (`nums[end] % 2 == 1`), move the `end` pointer to the left.
  - If `nums[start]` is odd and `nums[end]` is even, swap the two values and adjust both pointers (`start` right, `end` left).
- **Termination**: The loop stops when `start` is no longer less than `end`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. We traverse each element at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). The sorting is done in place, requiring no additional storage.

This method is optimal in terms of both time and space, making it a suitable solution for the problem.
