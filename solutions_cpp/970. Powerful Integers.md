[Leetcode 970. Powerful Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l970)
## Problem Statement

Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

A powerful integer is an integer that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` for some integers `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique.

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
Explanation:
2 = 2^0 + 3^0
3 = 2^1 + 3^0
4 = 2^0 + 3^1
5 = 2^1 + 3^1
7 = 2^2 + 3^1
9 = 2^3 + 3^0
10 = 2^1 + 3^2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15
Output: [2,4,6,8,10,14]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Intervals for Iteration:** Since x and y are non-negative integers, do we assume x and y can only range from 1 to some practical integer values?
    - Yes, considering large values might go beyond bounds quickly.
2. **Upper bounds:** Do we consider that i, j will stop increasing when it makes the term x^i or y^j exceed the bound?
    - Yes, we should stop once powers exceed `bound`.

## Strategy

1. **Iteration Limits:** Since `x^i` and `y^j` should not exceed the bound, find limits for `i` and `j` in the loops.
2. **Iteration:** Iterate over possible values for `i` and `j` to compute values of `x^i + y^j`.
3. **Set for Uniqueness:** Use a set to store results to maintain uniqueness.
4. **Conversion to List:** Convert the set to list for the final output.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation for the problem.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

vector<int> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
    unordered_set<int> resultSet;
    
    // Handle edge case when bound is lower than the minimum possible powerful integer
    if (bound < 2) return {};

    for (int i = 0; pow(x, i) <= bound && i < 20; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; pow(y, j) <= bound && j < 20; ++j) {
            int value = pow(x, i) + pow(y, j);
            if (value <= bound) {
                resultSet.insert(value);
            }
            if (y == 1) break;  // Since y^j will not change further
        }
        if (x == 1) break;  // Since x^i will not change further
    }
    
    return vector<int>(resultSet.begin(), resultSet.end());
}

int main() {
    // Example test cases
    int x1 = 2, y1 = 3, bound1 = 10;
    vector<int> result1 = powerfulIntegers(x1, y1, bound1);
    for (int num : result1) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    int x2 = 3, y2 = 5, bound2 = 15;
    vector<int> result2 = powerfulIntegers(x2, y2, bound2);
    for (int num : result2) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Loop Limits:** The loops for `i` and `j` iterate theoretically up to `log(bound)/log(x)` and `log(bound)/log(y)` respectively.
- **Complexity:** If the bases `x` and `y` are both greater than 1, each term would be logarithmic in the bound, approximately leading to O((log(bound)/log(x)) * (log(bound)/log(y))). However, practical implementations should cap with sensible iteration limits to avoid excessive number of calculations.
