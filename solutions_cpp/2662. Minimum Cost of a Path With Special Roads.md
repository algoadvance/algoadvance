[Leetcode 2662. Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2662)
### Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular grid of dimensions `m x n`. Each cell in the grid has a cost associated with traversing it. You start from the top-left corner of the grid, and you want to reach the bottom-right corner. You are allowed to move either right or down at each step.

Additionally, there are special roads that allow you to travel between any two specified cells with a given cost. The goal is to find the minimum cost to travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Size and Values**: What are the constraints on the dimensions `m` and `n` of the grid and the cost values within the grid?
2. **Special Roads**: How many special roads can there be and what are their constraints?
3. **Costs**: Are all given costs non-negative integers?

### Code

Let's implement a solution using a graph traversal approach, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to handle both the grid movements and special roads:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int x, y, cost;
    bool operator>(const Node& other) const {
        return cost > other.cost;
    }
};

int minCostWithSpecialRoads(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<tuple<int, int, int, int, int>>& specialRoads) {
    // Direction vectors for moving right and down
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = { {0, 1}, {1, 0} };
    
    // Priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm
    priority_queue<Node, vector<Node>, greater<Node>> pq;
    pq.push({0, 0, grid[0][0]});
    
    // Distance table to store minimum cost to each cell
    vector<vector<int>> dist(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    dist[0][0] = grid[0][0];
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        Node current = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if (current.x == m - 1 && current.y == n - 1) {
            return current.cost;
        }
        
        for (auto& direction : directions) {
            int newX = current.x + direction.first;
            int newY = current.y + direction.second;
            if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n) {
                int newCost = current.cost + grid[newX][newY];
                if (newCost < dist[newX][newY]) {
                    dist[newX][newY] = newCost;
                    pq.push({newX, newY, newCost});
                }
            }
        }

        for (auto& road : specialRoads) {
            int x1, y1, x2, y2, specialCost;
            tie(x1, y1, x2, y2, specialCost) = road;
            if (current.x == x1 && current.y == y1) {
                int newCost = current.cost + specialCost;
                if (newCost < dist[x2][y2]) {
                    dist[x2][y2] = newCost;
                    pq.push({x2, y2, newCost});
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dist[m-1][n-1];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {
        {1, 3, 1},
        {1, 5, 1},
        {4, 2, 1}
    };
    vector<tuple<int, int, int, int, int>> specialRoads = {
        {0, 0, 2, 2, 5}
    };
    
    cout << minCostWithSpecialRoads(3, 3, grid, specialRoads) << endl; // Output should be the minimum cost to reach (2, 2)
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize**: Use a priority queue to implement the Dijkstra's algorithm. Initialize the queue with the starting cell `(0, 0)` and its cost.
2. **Distance Table**: Maintain a 2D vector `dist` to store the minimum cost to reach each cell.
3. **Process Queue**: Dequeue the node with the smallest cost, if it's the target cell `(m-1, n-1)`, return the cost.
4. **Movement in the Grid**: For each cell, consider moving right or down and update the cost if it's smaller.
5. **Special Roads**: For each special road, if the current cell is the starting cell of the special road, calculate the new cost to the destination cell and update if smaller.
6. **Result**: The minimum cost to reach `(m-1, n-1)` will be in `dist[m-1][n-1]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(m*n), to set up the `dist` table.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: O((m*n + s) * log(m*n)), where `s` is the number of special roads. Each cell and special road are processed, and each insertion in the priority queue takes logarithmic time relative to its size.

This approach ensures efficient handling of the problem within the given constraints.
