[Leetcode 1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1269)
## Problem Statement

You have a pointer at index `0` in an array of size `arrLen`. At each step, you can move:

- `1` step to the right,
- `1` step to the left, or
- stay in the same place.

You are tasked to find out the number of ways you can stay at index `0` after taking exactly `steps` number of steps. Return the number of ways `(modulo 10^9 + 7)`.

### Example:
- Input: `steps = 3, arrLen = 2`
- Output: `4`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= steps <= 500`
- `1 <= arrLen <= 10^6`

The pointer should always stay in the bound of the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the pointer always start at index 0?
   - Yes, it starts at index `0`.
2. Can steps be more than `arrLen`?
   - Yes, the steps can be larger than `arrLen`.

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to reach each index with a precise number of steps. 

#### Definition:
- Let `dp[s][i]` be the number of ways to stay at index `i` after taking `s` steps.

#### Transition:
- From `dp[s][i]`, you can:
  1. Stay at `i` and use one step: `dp[s + 1][i] += dp[s][i]`.
  2. Move to `i - 1` (if within bounds) and use one step: `dp[s + 1][i - 1] += dp[s][i]`.
  3. Move to `i + 1` (if within bounds) and use one step: `dp[s + 1][i + 1] += dp[s][i]`.

#### Initial State:
- `dp[0][0] = 1` since we start at index 0 with 0 steps.

#### Result:
- We need to return `dp[steps][0]` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Optimization:
Clearly, we only need to keep track of the current step and the next step for calculation, which allows reducing the space complexity.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int numWays(int steps, int arrLen) {
        // Modulo constant
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        // Maximum effective length we need to consider (cannot exceed steps/2 + 1)
        int maxLen = std::min(arrLen, steps / 2 + 1);

        // Initialize a 2D DP array
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(steps + 1, std::vector<int>(maxLen, 0));
        dp[0][0] = 1; // Starting point
        
        for (int s = 1; s <= steps; ++s) {
            for (int i = 0; i < maxLen; ++i) {
                dp[s][i] = dp[s-1][i]; // Stay in place
                if (i > 0) {
                    dp[s][i] = (dp[s][i] + dp[s-1][i-1]) % MOD; // Move left
                }
                if (i < maxLen - 1) {
                    dp[s][i] = (dp[s][i] + dp[s-1][i+1]) % MOD; // Move right
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[steps][0];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(steps * min(arrLen, steps // 2 + 1))`. Each of the `steps` iterations processes up to `min(arrLen, steps/2 + 1)` elements.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(steps * min(arrLen, steps // 2 + 1))` due to the DP table.

By using this approach, we can ensure that the problem is solved efficiently within the given constraints.
