[Leetcode 1603. Design Parking System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1603)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1603 - Design Parking System

You are required to design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has different slots for different sizes of cars:

- `big`: cars that take `big` slots.
- `medium`: cars that take `medium` slots.
- `small`: cars that take `small` slots.

At the start, the parking lot contains a certain number of slots for each size. You need to provide functionality to add a car of different sizes into the parking lot. If there is still a place in the slot for the car size, it is parked successfully and `true` is returned. Otherwise, `false` is returned.

Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:
- `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` - initializes the object with `big`, `medium`, and `small` slots.
- `bool addCar(int carType)` - checks whether there is some space available for the car type `carType`. `carType` can be one of three types:
  * `1`: represents a big car
  * `2`: represents a medium car
  * `3`: represents a small car

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Initial Slots**: Can the initial number of slots for each type be zero?
2. **Concurrent Access**: Can we assume there is no concurrent access (single-threaded execution)?
3. **Valid Input**: Can we assume the input is always valid, meaning `carType` will always be in the set {1, 2, 3}?

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class ParkingSystem {
private:
    int big;
    int medium;
    int small;

public:
    ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) : big(big), medium(medium), small(small) {}

    bool addCar(int carType) {
        if (carType == 1) {
            if (big > 0) {
                big--;
                return true;
            }
        } else if (carType == 2) {
            if (medium > 0) {
                medium--;
                return true;
            }
        } else if (carType == 3) {
            if (small > 0) {
                small--;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};

// Example of usage
int main() {
    ParkingSystem* parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
    std::cout << parkingSystem->addCar(1) << std::endl; // returns true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
    std::cout << parkingSystem->addCar(2) << std::endl; // returns true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
    std::cout << parkingSystem->addCar(3) << std::endl; // returns false because there is no available slot for a small car
    std::cout << parkingSystem->addCar(1) << std::endl; // returns false because there is no available slot for a big car, it is already occupied
    delete parkingSystem;
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy
- Initialize the parking slots for `big`, `medium`, and `small` cars as member variables.
- In the `addCar` function, check the `carType`:
  - If `carType` is `1`, decrement the `big` slot count if it's greater than `0` and return `true`.
  - If `carType` is `2`, decrement the `medium` slot count if it's greater than `0` and return `true`.
  - If `carType` is `3`, decrement the `small` slot count if it's greater than `0` and return `true`.
  - If no slot is available for the specified type, return `false`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the `addCar` function is **O(1)**, as it involves a few constant-time checks and comparisons.
- The space complexity of the `ParkingSystem` class is **O(1)**, as it uses a fixed amount of space to store the slot counts for each car type.

The solution provided is efficient and meets the problem requirements effectively.
