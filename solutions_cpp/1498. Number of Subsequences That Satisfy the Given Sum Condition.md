## Problem Statement
1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the number of non-empty subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Example
**Input:** nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** The subsequences are [3], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7]

**Input:** nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10  
**Output:** 6  
**Explanation:** The subsequences are [3], [3], [3, 3], [3, 6], [3, 6], [3, 3, 6]  

### Constraints:
- \(1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^6\)
- \(1 \leq target \leq 10^6\)

## Clarifying Questions
Before we start coding, we need to clarify a few things:
1. Can the elements in `nums` be negative?
2. Is the array `nums` always unsorted?
3. Should we return the result as \( \text{result} \mod (10^9 + 7) \) in the problem?
4. Can there be duplicate elements in `nums`?

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the `nums` array to facilitate utilizing the two-pointer approach.
2. Use two pointers (`left` pointing to the start and `right` pointing to the end of the sorted array).
3. For each pair of elements pointed to by these pointers:
   - If the sum of the minimum element (`nums[left]`) and the maximum element (`nums[right]`) is greater than `target`, move the `right` pointer to the left to reduce the sum.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `target`, calculate the number of subsequences between `nums[left]` and `nums[right]`. This can be done using the formula \(2^{(\text{right} - \text{left})} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right and keep adding up all valid subsequences.
4. Return the answer modulo "\(10^9 + 7\)".

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int numSubseq(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;
        
        std::vector<int> pow2(nums.size(), 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            pow2[i] = pow2[i - 1] * 2 % MOD;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (nums[left] + nums[right] > target) {
                right--;
            } else {
                result = (result + pow2[right - left]) % MOD;
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
- The two-pointer technique runs in \(O(n)\) time.
- Constructing the power of 2 array takes \(O(n)\) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). 

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because of the space taken by the power of 2 array.
