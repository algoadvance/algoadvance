[Leetcode 2851. String Transformation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2851)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of words. Write a function to determine if you can transform the first word into the last word by changing only one letter at a time, such that each intermediate word exists in the list. Each transformation must change exactly one letter from the previous word.

#### Example
**Input:**
```cpp
vector<string> words = {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"};
```
**Output:**
```cpp
true // as you can transform "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all words of the same length?**
   - Yes, all words provided in the input list have the same length.
2. **Is the list guaranteed to have at least two words, i.e., a start and an end word?**
   - Yes, assume there are at least two words.
3. **Is the word list guaranteed to contain only lowercase alphabets?**
   - Yes, all words are in lowercase English letters.
4. **What if no transformation path exists?**
   - Return `false` if the transformation is not possible.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:** Consider each word as a node in a graph.
2. **Edges:** An edge exists between two words if they differ by exactly one letter.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Utilizes BFS to explore the shortest path from the start word to the end word due to its nature of exploring nearest neighbors first.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool isOneLetterDifferent(const string& word1, const string& word2) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < word1.size(); ++i) {
        if (word1[i] != word2[i]) {
            ++count;
            if (count > 1) return false;
        }
    }
    return count == 1;
}

bool canTransform(vector<string>& words) {
    if (words.empty()) return false;

    string start = words[0];
    string end = words[words.size() - 1];
    unordered_set<string> wordList(words.begin(), words.end());

    if (wordList.find(end) == wordList.end()) return false;
    
    queue<string> toVisit;
    toVisit.push(start);

    while (!toVisit.empty()) {
        string current = toVisit.front();
        toVisit.pop();

        vector<string> neighbors;
        for (const string& word : wordList) {
            if (isOneLetterDifferent(current, word)) {
                neighbors.push_back(word);
            }
        }

        for (const string& neighbor : neighbors) {
            if (neighbor == end) return true;
            toVisit.push(neighbor);
            wordList.erase(neighbor);
        }
    }

    return false;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "cog"};
    cout << (canTransform(words) ? "true" : "false") << endl;

    vector<string> words2 = {"hit", "hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"};
    cout << (canTransform(words2) ? "true" : "false") << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Pre-processing (Creating Neighbors List):** \(O(N \times K^2)\) where \(N\) is the number of words and \(K\) is the length of each word.
  - For each word, we check each of its \(N\) neighbors, which takes \(K\) comparisons each (assuming constant time checking).
- **BFS Traversal:** \(O(N \times K)\) where we might visit each word in the worst case.
- **Total:** \(O(N \times K^2)\).

### Space Complexity
- **Queue:** \(O(N)\) for BFS queue.
- **Word List Set:** \(O(N \times K)\) due to having \(O(N)\) words each of length \(K\).
- **Total:** \(O(N \times K)\).

This strategy ensures an efficient search for the transformation path while maintaining clarity and correctness in implementation.
