[Leetcode 3241. Time Taken to Mark All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3241)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from 0 to `n-1` and exactly `n-1` edges.

Each node has a value associated with it as given in the array `vals` of length `n`. A node `i` is considered "marked" if node `i` is visited at least once on the path(s) from node `0` to all the other nodes `j` (`0 <= j < n`). 

You need to find the time taken to mark all nodes of the tree. The time taken to move from one node to its adjacent node is given in the array `times` of length `n-1` where `times[i]` represents the time to move through the i-th edge.

Your task is to return the sum of time taken to mark all nodes.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure I understand the problem correctly, I have a few questions:

1. Is the array `times` directly associated with the sequence of edges provided, or do we have additional information that explicitly maps each edge to a time?
2. Can node values or times be negative, or are they guaranteed to be non-negative?
3. Should the marking process consider returning to nodes or can we assume a one-way traversal?

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to simulate the path from the root (node 0) to all other nodes, calculating the cumulative time taken to visit all nodes.
3. **Sum Time Calculation**: The time to reach all nodes must be accumulated considering every edge's traversal time.
4. **Return the Sum**: The result will be the total accumulated time for marking all the nodes starting from node 0.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int dfs(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj) {
    int total_time = 0;
    for (const auto& [neighbor, time] : adj[node]) {
        if (neighbor != parent) {
            total_time += time + dfs(neighbor, node, adj);
        }
    }
    return total_time;
}

int timeTakenToMarkAllNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& times) {
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);

    // Construct the adjacency list representation of the tree
    for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
        int u = edges[i][0], v = edges[i][1], t = times[i];
        adj[u].emplace_back(v, t);
        adj[v].emplace_back(u, t);
    }
    
    return dfs(0, -1, adj);
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}};
    vector<int> times = {3, 2, 4, 1};
    
    cout << "Time taken to mark all nodes: " << timeTakenToMarkAllNodes(n, edges, times) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Construction of Adjacency List**: \(O(n)\) since there are `n-1` edges.
- **DFS Traversal**: \(O(n)\) because it visits each node exactly once.
- **Overall**: \(O(n)\)

The solution efficiently uses DFS to traverse all nodes and accumulates the total traversal time, which ensures that all nodes are considered marked as specified in the problem statement.
