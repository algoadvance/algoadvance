[Leetcode 2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2840)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. In one operation, you can select any two indices `i` and `j` (1 <= i, j <= n) and swap the characters at `s1[i]` and `s1[j]`. Return `true` if you can make `s1` equal to `s2`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `s1` and `s2` always of the same length?**
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that `s1` and `s2` are of equal length.
2. **Can the strings contain special characters or spaces?**
   - The problem does not specify any restrictions, so we should assume they can contain any characters.
3. **Is there a limit on the length of the strings?**
   - The problem statement does not provide any constraints on the length, but it is typically safe to assume they are within reasonable sizes for algorithmic efficiency (e.g., lengths up to 10^5).

### Strategy
To determine if the string `s1` can be transformed into `s2` through any number of swaps:
1. **Character Frequency:** First, for each string, count the frequency of each character. If the frequency distributions do not match, it is impossible to transform `s1` into `s2`.
2. **Permutation Comparison:** If the frequencies match, it implies that the multisets of characters in `s1` and `s2` are identical, and `s1` can be permuted to become `s2`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>

bool canBeEqualWithOperations(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
    
    std::unordered_map<char, int> freq1, freq2;
    
    for (char ch : s1) {
        freq1[ch]++;
    }
    
    for (char ch : s2) {
        freq2[ch]++;
    }
    
    // If both frequency maps are the same, return true
    return freq1 == freq2;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "abcde";
    std::string s2 = "edcba";
    
    bool result = canBeEqualWithOperations(s1, s2);
    std::cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - We calculate the frequency of each character in both `s1` and `s2`.
   - We use two hash maps (`freq1` and `freq2`) to store the frequencies.
2. **Comparison:**
   - We compare the two frequency maps. If they are identical, it means `s1` can be permuted to `s2` using swaps.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the strings. We traverse each string once to build the frequency maps and the comparison of the two maps takes O(n) in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) to O(n) depending on the number of unique characters. For standard ASCII, this is O(1) as the size is fixed at 128.
