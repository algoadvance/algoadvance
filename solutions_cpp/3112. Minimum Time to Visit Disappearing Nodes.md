[Leetcode 3112. Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3112)
## Problem Statement

We are given a connected undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled `0` to `n - 1` and `m` edges. Each node will disappear exactly `a[u]` units of time after you reach it for the first time. Before a node disappears, you can leave it and go to another node (if there's an edge). If you reach the node after it has already disappeared for the first time, you can no longer visit it.

Given an integer `start` representing the starting node and an integer `limit` representing the time limit after which a node will disappear, write a function `minimumTimeToVisitAllNodes` that returns the minimum time required to visit all nodes before they disappear, starting from the `start` node.

Example:
- Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3]], start = 0, limit = 3
- Output: 6

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can nodes be revisited within the limit before they disappear?**
   - Yes, nodes can be revisited within their individual disappearing timeframe.

2. **Are the given times `a[u]` for each node the same or different?**
   - In this problem, we only have one `limit` time applying to all nodes. 

3. **Is there always a way to visit all nodes?**
   - It is guaranteed that the graph is connected, so there is always a path between any pair of nodes.

4. **What are the constraints on the number of nodes and edges?**
   - Typical constraints are: \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\), \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\), and each nodeâ€™s disappear time limit applies to all nodes equally.

5. **What should the function return if it's impossible to visit all nodes before they disappear?**
   - If it's impossible to visit all nodes, the function should return `-1`.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We'll use BFS to traverse the graph layer by layer.
   - Track the time taken at each step.

2. **Time Management:**
   - Keep track of the cumulative time spent to ensure it is within the given limit for each visit.

3. **Visited Nodes:**
   - Use a set or boolean array to track the visited nodes.

4. **Edge Costs:**
   - Since all edges have uniform cost (time assumed to be 1 unit for simplicity unless specified otherwise), BFS works well within uniform edge constraint.

## Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int minimumTimeToVisitAllNodes(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int start, int limit) {
    vector<vector<int>> adj(n);  // adjacency list
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
    }

    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;  // pair<node, time_taken>
    q.push({start, 0});
    visited[start] = true;
    int totalTime = 0;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [current, time] = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Visit all neighboring nodes
        for (const int& neighbor : adj[current]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                int nextTime = time + 1;
                if (nextTime > limit) {
                    return -1;  // Cannot visit this node before it disappears
                }
                q.push({neighbor, nextTime});
                visited[neighbor] = true;
                totalTime = max(totalTime, nextTime);
            }
        }
    }

    // Verify if all nodes were visited
    for (bool status : visited) {
        if (!status) return -1;  // If any node was not visited
    }

    return totalTime;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - BFS typically runs in \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices (nodes) and \(E\) is the number of edges.
   
2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is \(O(V + E)\) due to the storage of the adjacency list and the BFS queue.

This achieves an efficient approach to traverse and check the graph's nodes within the given time constraints.
