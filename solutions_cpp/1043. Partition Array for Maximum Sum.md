[Leetcode 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1043)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: How large can the array `arr` be? (10^3)
2. **Element Range**: What range of values can the elements in `arr` take? (0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9)
3. **Partition Constraint**: Is the length `k` always within a valid range? (1 <= k <= len(arr))

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum we can obtain by partitioning the subarray `arr[0:i+1]`.
2. **Update Rule**: For each `i`, check the contribution of each possible partition ending at `i`. Specifically, consider all subarrays ending at `i` and of length at most `k`.
3. **Optimization Insight**: For a given subarray ending at `i` and of length `j` (from 1 to k), compute the max element within this subarray and add its contribution to the DP value at the corresponding starting point of this subarray.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumAfterPartitioning(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int max_element = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= k && i - j + 1 >= 0; ++j) {
                max_element = max(max_element, arr[i - j + 1]);
                int current_sum = max_element * j;
                if (i - j >= 0) {
                    current_sum += dp[i - j];
                }
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], current_sum);
            }
        }
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **DP Table Size**: The DP table has `n` entries.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each position `i` in the array, the inner loop runs `k` times in the worst case. Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times k)\).

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: A DP array `dp` of size `n` is initialized to zero.
- **Outer Loop (i)**: We iterate through each element in `arr` from `0` to `n-1`.
- **Inner Loop (j)**: For each `i`, we explore potential partition sizes from `1` to `k`.
  - **Max Element Update**: Track the maximum element in the subarray ending at `i` and of length `j`.
  - **Current Sum Calculation**: Calculate the potential sum of this configuration.
  - **DP Update**: Update the DP entry `dp[i]` to reflect the best possible sum up to this point based on the current partition configuration.

By the end of the loops, `dp[n-1]` contains the maximum sum of the array after partitioning.
