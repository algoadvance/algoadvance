[Leetcode 3068. Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3068)
Sure, let's break down the problem-solving process for the given problem step by step.

### Problem Statement:

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Your task is to find the maximum sum of values from any path in the tree. A path in the binary tree is a non-empty sequence of nodes such that each consecutive pair of nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them, and you may start and end at any node in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Tree Definition:** Confirm the structure of the binary tree (i.e., if it's guaranteed to be a standard binary tree where each node has at most two children).
2. **Node Values:** What are the possible values of the node? Can they be negative?
3. **Path Definition:** Can the path be any sequence of nodes in the tree (not necessarily root-to-leaf or leaf-to-root)?
4. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the number of nodes?

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) approach along with Dynamic Programming (DP) to track the maximum path sum found so far. 

We'll implement a helper function that:
- Traverses each node and computes the maximum path sum that ends at that node.
- Keeps updating the global maximum path sum encountered.

The essential part is to handle the path sums involving the current node's left and right children recursively and make decisions considering how to maximize the path sums.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int max_sum = INT_MIN;
        maxPathSumHelper(root, max_sum);
        return max_sum;
    }
    
private:
    int maxPathSumHelper(TreeNode* node, int& max_sum) {
        if (node == nullptr) return 0;
        
        // Recursively get the max sum of left and right subtrees, and ignore negative sums
        int left_sum = std::max(maxPathSumHelper(node->left, max_sum), 0);
        int right_sum = std::max(maxPathSumHelper(node->right, max_sum), 0);
        
        // Calculate the sum including the current node
        int current_sum = node->val + left_sum + right_sum;
        
        // Update the global maximum sum
        max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_sum);
        
        // Return the maximum path sum that includes the current node and one of its subtrees
        return node->val + std::max(left_sum, right_sum);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Structure:** Defined a standard TreeNode structure for a binary tree.
2. **Solution Class:** The main class handling the sum calculations.
   - **maxPathSum():** This function initializes the `max_sum` variable and calls the helper function.
   - **maxPathSumHelper():** A recursive function that:
     - Traverses left and right sub-trees.
     - Computes the path sum for the current node including its left and right children.
     - Updates the global `max_sum` variable if the current path sum is greater.
     - Returns the maximum path sum including the current node and one of its subtrees to ensure the path remains valid.

### Time Complexity:

- The algorithm runs in `O(N)` time complexity, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- The space complexity is `O(H)` for the recursion stack where `H` is the height of the tree, which can be `O(N)` in the worst case if the tree is unbalanced.
