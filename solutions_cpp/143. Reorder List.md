[Leetcode 143. Reorder List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l143)
### Problem Statement:

Given a singly linked list `L`, reorder it to: `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example:**
```
Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
```
```
Given 1->2 ->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is the input list always of non-zero length, or do we have to handle an empty list?
    - What about lists with only one element? Do we need to perform any reordering?

2. **Output Format:**
    - Should the reordered list be returned or modified in place?

3. **Time Complexity Constraints:**
    - Are there any specific time or space complexity requirements?

Based on typical requirements for such problems:
- We can assume the linked list may have zero or more nodes.
- The list needs to be re-ordered in place.
- Aim for O(1) additional space complexity (apart from the recursion stack or call stack usage).
- Time complexity should ideally be linear, O(n).

### Strategy:

To reorder the list as requested, we can break the problem into the following steps:

1. **Find the Middle of the Linked List:**
    - We can use the slow and fast pointer technique to locate the middle of the list.

2. **Reverse the Second Half of the List:**
    - Once the middle is found, split the list into two halves and reverse the second half of the list.

3. **Merge the Two Halves:**
    - Alternate nodes from the first half and the reversed second half until one of the halves is exhausted.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    void reorderList(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head || !head->next) return;

        // Step 1: Find the middle of the list using slow and fast pointers
        ListNode* slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (fast->next && fast->next->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = slow->next;
        while (curr) {
            ListNode* next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        // Step 3: Merge the two halves
        slow->next = nullptr;
        ListNode* first = head;
        ListNode* second = prev; // 'prev' is now the head of the reversed second half
        while (second) {
            ListNode* temp1 = first->next;
            ListNode* temp2 = second->next;

            first->next = second;
            second->next = temp1;

            first = temp1;
            second = temp2;
        }
    }
};

// Helper function to print the list (for testing purposes)
void printList(ListNode* head) {
    while (head) {
        std::cout << head->val << " -> ";
        head = head->next;
    }
    std::cout << "NULL" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    Solution solution;

    // Example usage:
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(1);
    head->next = new ListNode(2);
    head->next->next = new ListNode(3);
    head->next->next->next = new ListNode(4);
    head->next->next->next->next = new ListNode(5);

    std::cout << "Original list: ";
    printList(head);

    solution.reorderList(head);

    std::cout << "Reordered list: ";
    printList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Finding the middle:** O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Reversing the second half:** O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n).
- **Merging the two halves:** O(n).

The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n).

### Space Complexity:

- The algorithm operates in-place, so the additional space complexity is O(1), not considering the recursive stack or call stack used in practice.

This solution meets the criteria for modifying the list in-place with linear time complexity and constant extra space.
