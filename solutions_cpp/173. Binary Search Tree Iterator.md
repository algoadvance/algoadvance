[Leetcode 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l173)
## Problem Statement

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Implement the `BSTIterator` class:

- `BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
- `boolean hasNext()` returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
- `int next()` moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

You may assume that `next()` calls will always be valid. i.e., there will be a next number in the BST when `next()` is called.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the `TreeNode` class?**
    - The `TreeNode` class is typically defined as:
      ```cpp
      struct TreeNode {
          int val;
          TreeNode *left;
          TreeNode *right;
          TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
          TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
          TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
      };
      ```

2. **What type of traversal should be used for the iterator?**
    - The iterator should perform an in-order traversal to retrieve the elements in ascending order.

3. **Is the BST mutable during the iteration process?**
    - For the scope of this problem, we'll assume the BST is not modified during iteration.

## Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal using Stack:**
    - Since we need the smallest element each time `next()` is called and BST properties ensure that the leftmost element is the smallest, we can use a stack to keep track of the nodes.
    - We will push all the left nodes to the stack initially. Whenever `next()` is called, the top of the stack will have the next smallest element.

2. **Initialization:**
    - During initialization, push all the left children of the root to the stack.
    
3. **hasNext() and next():**
    - `hasNext()` checks if the stack is not empty.
    - `next()` pops the top of the stack and processes the right subtree of the popped node.

## Code

```cpp
class BSTIterator {
public:
    BSTIterator(TreeNode* root) {
        pushAllLeft(root);
    }
    
    int next() {
        TreeNode* topNode = st.top();
        st.pop();
        pushAllLeft(topNode->right);
        return topNode->val;
    }
    
    bool hasNext() {
        return !st.empty();
    }

private:
    stack<TreeNode*> st;
    
    void pushAllLeft(TreeNode* node) {
        while (node != nullptr) {
            st.push(node);
            node = node->left;
        }
    }
};

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`BSTIterator` constructor):**
  - The time complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree, as we traverse from the root down to the leftmost node.

- **`next()` method:**
  - Each call to `next()` has an average time complexity of `O(1)`. Although, in the worst case (when the node has a non-null right child), it can be `O(h)`.

- **`hasNext()` method:**
  - The time complexity is `O(1)` as it simply checks if the stack is empty or not.

In summary, the `BSTIterator` class efficiently traverses the BST in in-order fashion, maintaining `O(h)` space complexity for the stack and average `O(1)` complexity for operations.
