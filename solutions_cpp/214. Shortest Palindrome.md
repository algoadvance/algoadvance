[Leetcode 214. Shortest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l214)
Sure, let's dive into the problem statement and solve it step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you need to find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by adding characters in front of it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
2. **Characters:** Can `s` contain spaces or special characters, or is it confined to lowercase and uppercase letters?
3. **Case Sensitivity:** Should the solution be case-sensitive? i.e., is 'A' different from 'a'?

Let's assume the string length can be up to \(10^5\) and the string contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters, and the solution should be case-sensitive.

### Strategy

To form the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front, we can use the following approach:

1. **Find the Longest Palindromic Prefix:**
    - The idea is to find the longest palindromic prefix in the input string `s`. Let this prefix be `P`.
    - If `P` is the entire string `s`, then `s` is already a palindrome, and we don't need to add any characters.

2. **Utilize String Reversal:**
    - If `P` is not the entire string, then find the remaining suffix `S` of the string after `P`.
    - Reverse the suffix `S` and prepend it to the original string `s`.

3. **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm Approach:**
    - We can use an advanced technique involving the KMP failure function to efficiently compute the longest prefix of `s` which is also a suffix of some prefix of the reverse of `s`. This helps in identifying the longest palindromic prefix.

### Code

Here's the C++ solution implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string shortestPalindrome(string s) {
        // Create a new string which is s + '#' + reverse(s)
        string rev_s = s;
        reverse(rev_s.begin(), rev_s.end());
        string new_s = s + '#' + rev_s;
        
        // Build KMP table for new_s
        vector<int> kmp_table(new_s.size(), 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < new_s.size(); i++) {
            int j = kmp_table[i - 1];
            while (j > 0 && new_s[i] != new_s[j]) {
                j = kmp_table[j - 1];
            }
            if (new_s[i] == new_s[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            kmp_table[i] = j;
        }
        
        // The length of the longest palindromic prefix
        int longest_palindromic_prefix_len = kmp_table.back();
        
        // Characters to be added in front of s
        string add_on = s.substr(longest_palindromic_prefix_len);
        reverse(add_on.begin(), add_on.end());
        
        return add_on + s;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string input = "aacecaaa"; // example input
    cout << "Shortest Palindrome: " << sol.shortestPalindrome(input) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The main operations are reversing the string and building the KMP table.
  - Reversing the string takes \(O(n)\) time.
  - Building the KMP table also takes \(O(n)\) time.
  Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string `s`.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional space required for storing the reversed string and the KMP table.

This solution is efficient and suitable for strings with lengths up to \(10^5\).
