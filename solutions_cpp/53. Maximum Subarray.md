[Leetcode 53. Maximum Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l53)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain both positive and negative integers?
   - Yes, as seen in the example.
2. Should subarrays be contiguous?
   - Yes, subarrays should be contiguous.
3. Can the array be as small as one element?
   - Yes, the problem states the minimal length can be 1.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using **Kadane's Algorithm** which is designed to solve the maximum subarray sum problem efficiently. Here is the approach:

1. Initialize two variables:
   - `current_sum`: This tracks the sum of the current subarray we are considering.
   - `max_sum`: This keeps track of the maximum sum encountered so far.
   
2. Iterate through the array:
   - Update `current_sum` to be either the current element itself or the sum of the current element and the previous `current_sum`, whichever is greater. This decision reconnects to the idea of starting a new subarray at the current element if the previous subarray sum is negative.
   - Update `max_sum` to be the maximum value between the current `max_sum` and `current_sum`.

3. Return `max_sum` as the result, which should be the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we only make a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the strategy detailed above:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int max_sum = nums[0];
        int current_sum = nums[0];
        
        for(size_t i = 1; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            current_sum = std::max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i]);
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_sum);
        }
        
        return max_sum;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. Initialize `max_sum` and `current_sum` to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate from the second element to the end of the array:
   - Update `current_sum` to the maximum of the current element or the sum of `current_sum` + current element.
   - Update `max_sum` to be the maximum of `max_sum` and `current_sum`.
3. Return `max_sum`, which holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

This approach efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray with a single pass through the input array.
