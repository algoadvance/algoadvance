[Leetcode 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1717)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations:

1. Remove the substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points.
2. Remove the substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points.

Your task is to return the maximum score you can get after performing any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the string contain characters other than 'a' and 'b'?**
   - A: Yes, it may contain other characters.

2. **Q: Can the same indices in the string be used again after removing a substring?**
   - A: No, once characters are removed, they cannot be reused.

3. **Q: Do `x` and `y` have to be positive integers?**
   - A: Yes, it is generally assumed that `x` and `y` are positive.

4. **Q: Can the string be empty?**
   - A: Yes, the string can be empty, in which case the maximum score is `0`.

### Strategy

The strategy to solve the problem for maximum score is to focus on the substring that gives the higher score first. This is because removing the most valuable substrings first maximizes the accumulated score early and prevents sub-optimal choices.

1. **Determine the priorities based on values of `x` and `y`.**
   - If `x` >= `y`, remove "ab" substrings first.
   - If `y` > `x`, remove "ba" substrings first.

2. **Use a stack to help perform the removals efficiently:**
   - Traverse the string, push characters to a stack.
   - Whenever the top of the stack and the current character form either "ab" or "ba", pop from the stack and add the corresponding points.

### Time Complexity

The solution involves a single traversal of the string and stack operations which are O(1) in time complexity for each character. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int maximumGain(string s, int x, int y) {
    if (x < y) {
        swap(x, y);
        // Update string making reverse
        for (char& ch : s) {
            if (ch == 'a') ch = 'b';
            else if (ch == 'b') ch = 'a';
        }
    }

    int maxScore = 0;
    stack<char> st;

    // Remove "ab" and gain x points.
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (!st.empty() && st.top() == 'a' && ch == 'b') {
            st.pop();
            maxScore += x;
        } else {
            st.push(ch);
        }
    }

    // Extract remaining chars from stack to process "ba"
    string remainingChars;
    while (!st.empty()) {
        remainingChars += st.top();
        st.pop();
    }
    reverse(remainingChars.begin(), remainingChars.end());

    // Clear stack for second pass
    for (char ch : remainingChars) {
        if (!st.empty() && st.top() == 'b' && ch == 'a') {
            st.pop();
            maxScore += y;
        } else {
            st.push(ch);
        }
    }

    return maxScore;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    string s = "abbaabba";
    int x = 5, y = 3;
    cout << "Maximum Score: " << maximumGain(s, x, y) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code initializes by processing the substring with higher score and then moves on to the second more frequent substring encounter. By using a stack, it ensures efficient removal operations within a single pass and a reversed pass which maintains an overall linear time complexity, O(n).
