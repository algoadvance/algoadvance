[Leetcode 2685. Count the Number of Complete Components](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2685)
## Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph, count the number of complete components in the graph. A complete component is a maximal subgraph such that every pair of distinct vertices in the subgraph is connected by a unique edge.

You need to write a function that takes the number of vertices `n` and the list of edges, and returns the count of complete components in the graph.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n` (number of vertices)?
     - Typically, for graph problems, `n` is between 1 and \(10^5\).
   - How is the edge list given? Is it a list of pairs?
     - Yes, the edge list is provided as a list of pairs, where each pair represents an undirected edge between two vertices.

2. **Graph Details:**
   - Can the graph be disconnected?
     - Yes, the graph can be disconnected.
   
3. **Completeness of Subgraph:**
   - By "complete component", we assume it means that every node must be reachable from every other node within that component with a direct edge.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation to count the number of complete components in an undirected graph.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countCompleteComponents(int n, vector<pair<int, int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adjList(n); // to store graph connections
        
        // Building the adjacency list
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adjList[edge.first].push_back(edge.second);
            adjList[edge.second].push_back(edge.first);
        }
        
        vector<bool> visited(n, false);
        
        auto isCompleteComponent = [&](const vector<int>& component) -> bool {
            int size = component.size();
            for (int vertex : component) {
                if (adjList[vertex].size() != size - 1)
                    return false;
            }
            return true;
        };
        
        function<void(int, vector<int>&)> dfs = [&](int node, vector<int>& component) {
            visited[node] = true;
            component.push_back(node);
            for (int neighbor : adjList[node]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    dfs(neighbor, component);
                }
            }
        };
        
        int completeCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                vector<int> component;
                dfs(i, component);
                if (isCompleteComponent(component)) {
                    completeCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return completeCount;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** 
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **DFS for Components:** 
   - Implement a DFS to find all components in the graph.
   - For each component, store its nodes.

3. **Check for Complete Component:**
   - For a component to be complete, each node must be directly connected to every other node in the component.
   - This means each node should have exactly `size - 1` edges where `size` is the number of nodes in the component.

4. **Counting Complete Components:**
   - For each discovered component via DFS, check if itâ€™s complete and increase the counter for complete components if so.

## Time Complexity

- **Building the adjacency list:** \(O(E)\) where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **DFS traversal of the graph:** \(O(V + E)\) where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Checking if component is complete:** For each component, it takes \(O(N)\) time in the worst case where `N` is the largest component size.

Overall time complexity: \(O(V + E)\).
