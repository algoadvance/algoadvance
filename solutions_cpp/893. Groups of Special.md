[Leetcode 893. Groups of Special](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l893)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `A` of strings. Two strings `S` and `T` are considered special-equivalent if after any number of moves, `S` can become `T`.

A move consists of choosing two indices `i` and `j` with the same parity (both even or both odd) and swapping `S[i]` with `S[j]`.

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from `A`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - How large can the strings in the array `A` be?
    - Are all characters lowercase English letters?

2. **Output:**
    - Do we need to return the count of unique special-equivalent groups or the actual groups?

For the sake of this problem, we assume:
- Each string can have a length of up to 100.
- All characters in the strings are lowercase English letters.
- We need to return the count of unique special-equivalent groups.

### Strategy

1. **Character Grouping by Parity**:
   - Each string can be divided into two substrings: one containing characters at even indices and another containing characters at odd indices.
   
2. **Normalization**:
   - For any given string, sort the characters at even indices and characters at odd indices separately.
   - Concatenate these sorted substrings to form a normalized representation of the string.
   
3. **Using a Set for Uniqueness**:
   - Use a set to store these normalized forms because sets inherently avoid duplicates.
   - The size of the set at the end gives the number of unique groups.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

int numSpecialEquivGroups(std::vector<std::string>& A) {
    std::unordered_set<std::string> unique_groups;

    for (const auto &s : A) {
        std::string even, odd;

        // Separate characters by even and odd indices
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0)
                even += s[i];
            else
                odd += s[i];
        }

        // Sort both parts
        std::sort(even.begin(), even.end());
        std::sort(odd.begin(), odd.end());

        // Concatenate sorted parts and add to the set
        unique_groups.insert(even + odd);
    }

    return unique_groups.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> A = {"abc","acb","bac","bca","cab","cba"};
    std::cout << "Number of groups: " << numSpecialEquivGroups(A) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting Strings**: O(N * M) where N is the number of strings and M is the maximum length of a string (iterating through each character of each string).
- **Sorting**: O(N * M log M) for sorting the even-index and odd-index substrings of each string.
- **Total Complexity**: O(N * M log M) due to the sorting step.

This approach ensures we effectively group all special-equivalent strings and then determine the count of such groups.
