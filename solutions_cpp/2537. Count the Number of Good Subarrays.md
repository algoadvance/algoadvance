[Leetcode 2537. Count the Number of Good Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2537)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is called good if there are at least `k` different integers in it. Return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?**
    - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate elements.
2. **What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and `k`?**
    - The length of `nums` (`n`) will be at most `10^4`.
    - The values in `nums` are integers, where each integer's value is between -10^9 and 10^9.
    - `k` is a positive integer, and `k â‰¤ n`.

### Strategy
To count the number of good subarrays for the given conditions, we can use the sliding window technique with a hash map to keep track of each number's frequency within the current window.

Steps:
1. Use a sliding window to traverse through the array.
2. Maintain a hash map (unordered_map) to store the frequency of each integer within the window.
3. Expand the window by including more elements from the right until the subarray contains at least `k` different integers.
4. Remember that when you have a valid window (good subarray), all subarrays formed by fixing the left boundary and extending to the right boundary and beyond until the end of the array will also be good subarrays. Count these subarrays accordingly.
5. Adjust the left boundary of the window and repeat the process to ensure all good subarrays are counted.

### Code
Here's a potential implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int countGoodSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    unordered_map<int, int> freq; // to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window
    int left = 0; // left boundary of the window
    int goodSubarrays = 0; // to count the number of good subarrays

    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        freq[nums[right]]++;
        
        while (freq.size() >= k) {
            // Count all subarrays from current left to right
            goodSubarrays += (n - right);
            
            // Now, we try to move the left pointer
            freq[nums[left]]--;
            if (freq[nums[left]] == 0) {
                freq.erase(nums[left]);
            }
            ++left;
        }
    }

    return goodSubarrays;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3};
    int k = 3;
    
    int result = countGoodSubarrays(nums, k);
    cout << "Number of good subarrays: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Each element in the array is added and removed from the hash map at most once. The while loop ensures that the left pointer only moves when necessary, keeping the overall complexity linear.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k) - The hash map will at most store `k` different elements at any time, which simplifies to O(k) because `k` is the maximum number of distinct elements we need to track.
