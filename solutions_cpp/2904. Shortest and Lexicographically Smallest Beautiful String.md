[Leetcode 2904. Shortest and Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2904)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase English letters. Your task is to modify the string so that it becomes a "beautiful string." A string is considered beautiful if:
1. It contains no two consecutive identical characters.
2. It contains no three consecutive characters that are the same.

You need to return the lexicographically smallest beautiful string that is greater than `s`. If no such string exists, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

- **Q:** What constitutes a lexicographically greater string?
  - **A:** A string `a` is lexicographically greater than string `b` if it comes after `b` in dictionary order.

- **Q:** Are there any guarantees regarding the length of the string `s`?
  - **A:** Length constraints such as `1 <= n <= 1000` typically apply but should be confirmed.

- **Q:** Should we consider only lowercase letters?
  - **A:** Yes, only lowercase English letters are involved.

## Strategy

1. **Increment Character from End:** Start from the end of the string and try to find the first character that can be incremented (i.e., won't overflow to 'aa').
2. **Build Lexicographically Smallest Suffix:** From this point, rebuild the suffix of the string to ensure it's the lexicographically smallest possible while adhering to the "beautiful" constraints.
3. **Backtrack if Necessary:** If incrementing causes a violation of the "beautiful" properties, backtrack and increment the next possible character.

### Detailed Steps

1. Traverse the string from the end to find where we can make a valid increment.
2. Once we increment, rebuild the rest of the string from this point forward, ensuring "beauty."
3. Use a helper function to ensure no two consecutive identical characters and no three consecutive characters are identical.

## Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool is_beautiful(const string& s) {
    int n = s.length();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i > 0 && s[i] == s[i-1]) return false;
        if (i > 1 && s[i] == s[i-1] && s[i-1] == s[i-2]) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

bool increment(string& s, int pos) {
    if (pos < 0) return false;
    s[pos]++;
    if (s[pos] > 'z') {
        s[pos] = 'a';
        return increment(s, pos - 1);
    }
    return true;
}

string next_lexicographical_str(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (increment(s, i)) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                    s[j] = c;
                    if (is_beautiful(s.substr(max(0, j-2), 3))) break;
                }
            }
            return s;
        }
    }
    return "";
}

string shortestLexicographicallySmallestBeautifulString(string s) {
    string next_string = next_lexicographical_str(s);
    while (!next_string.empty() && !is_beautiful(next_string)) {
        next_string = next_lexicographical_str(next_string);
    }
    return next_string;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    cout << shortestLexicographicallySmallestBeautifulString(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity 

- **Increment:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Beautiful Check:** O(n), but typically checked during the loop for incremental steps.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^2) due to the nested loop involved in creating and checking subsequences.

This approach ensures we modify the string minimally and always check each step for the beautiful condition, ensuring the smallest lexicographical result.
