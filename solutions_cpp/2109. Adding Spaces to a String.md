[Leetcode 2109. Adding Spaces to a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2109)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a **0-indexed** integer array `spaces` that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted before the character at the given index in the `spaces` array.

For example, given `s = "EnjoyYourLife"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`, we insert spaces before `s[5]` and `s[9]`, which gives `"Enjoy Your Life"`.

Return the modified string after the spaces have been added.

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "EnjoyYourLife"
spaces = [5, 9]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
"Enjoy Your Life"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the indices in `spaces` always in ascending order?**  
   Yes, they are always sorted in strictly increasing order.
   
2. **Can there be any edge case where the `spaces` array is empty?**  
   Yes, `spaces` can be empty, implying no spaces need to be added.

3. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**  
   The length of the string `s` will range from `1` up to `10^5`.

4. **What is the length range of the `spaces` array?**  
   The length of the `spaces` array will also range from `0` to `10^5`.

5. **What characters does the string `s` contain?**  
   The string `s` contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate and Build**: 
   - Use a two-pointer technique: one pointer to traverse the string `s` and the other to traverse the `spaces` array.
   - While traversing the string `s`, check if the current index matches any element in `spaces`. If it does, append a space to a result string and then continue appending the current character of `s`.
   - Maintain an index to track the position in the `spaces` array.
   
2. **Result Construction**: 
   - Initialize an empty string `result`.
   - Append characters from `s` to `result` with checks for space positions as dictated by `spaces`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle empty `spaces` array.
   - Handle single-character strings appropriately by returning them directly when there are no spaces to insert.

## Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string addSpaces(string s, vector<int>& spaces) {
    string result;
    int spaceIndex = 0, n = spaces.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        // If the current index matches the space position, append a space
        if (spaceIndex < n && i == spaces[spaceIndex]) {
            result += ' ';
            spaceIndex++;
        }
        result += s[i];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The overall time complexity for this algorithm is **O(N + M)**, where `N` is the length of the string `s` and `M` is the length of the `spaces` array. This is because we traverse the string `s` once and check space positions possibly up to `M` times.

1. **Iterating the string `s`**: O(N)
2. **Checking positions against `spaces`**: O(M)
