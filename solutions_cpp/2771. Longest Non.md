[Leetcode 2771. Longest Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2771)
## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `A` and `B` of length `n`, return the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray that can be constructed such that each element is taken from exactly one of `A` and `B`. A non-decreasing subarray is defined as a contiguous subarray where for every `i`, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the arrays `A` and `B` guaranteed to be of equal length?
   - **A:** Yes, both arrays are of length `n`.

2. **Q:** Are the arrays `A` and `B` allowed to contain duplicates?
   - **A:** Yes, duplicates are allowed in both arrays.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the elements of the arrays?
   - **A:** Elements in the arrays are integers. The values and length constraints (like `-10^9 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^9` and `1 <= n <= 10^5`) should be assumed but typically would not be much more restrictive than these ranges.

4. **Q:** Can subarrays span elements from both arrays interchangeably?
   - **A:** Yes, you can switch between elements from `A` and `B` to maintain the non-decreasing property.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define two tables, `dpA` and `dpB` where `dpA[i]` stores the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray ending at `i` and taking its last element from `A[i]`, and `dpB[i]` stores the same ending at `i` and taking its last element from `B[i]`.
   - Initialize `dpA[0] = 1` and `dpB[0] = 1`.
   - Iterate through the arrays starting from index 1 to `n-1`:
     - Update `dpA[i]`:
       - If `A[i] >= A[i-1]`, `dpA[i] = dpA[i-1] + 1`.
       - If `A[i] >= B[i-1]`, `dpA[i] = max(dpA[i], dpB[i-1] + 1)`.
     - Update `dpB[i]`:
       - If `B[i] >= B[i-1]`, `dpB[i] = dpB[i-1] + 1`.
       - If `B[i] >= A[i-1]`, `dpB[i] = max(dpB[i], dpA[i-1] + 1)`.
   - The answer will be the maximum value in `dpA` and `dpB` arrays.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int longestNonDecreasingSubarray(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
    int n = A.size();
    // Edge case: when there's only one element
    if (n == 1) return 1;

    vector<int> dpA(n, 1);
    vector<int> dpB(n, 1);

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (A[i] >= A[i - 1])
            dpA[i] = max(dpA[i], dpA[i - 1] + 1);
        if (A[i] >= B[i - 1])
            dpA[i] = max(dpA[i], dpB[i - 1] + 1);

        if (B[i] >= B[i - 1])
            dpB[i] = max(dpB[i], dpB[i - 1] + 1);
        if (B[i] >= A[i - 1])
            dpB[i] = max(dpB[i], dpA[i - 1] + 1);
    }

    return max(*max_element(dpA.begin(), dpA.end()), *max_element(dpB.begin(), dpB.end()));
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` because we iterate through the arrays once.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` as we maintain two arrays `dpA` and `dpB` of size `n`. However, this can be optimized to `O(1)` by using two variables instead of arrays if required.
