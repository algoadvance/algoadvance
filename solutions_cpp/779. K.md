[Leetcode 779. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l779)
## Problem Statement

The problem is from LeetCode and states:

We build a table of `n` rows (1-indexed). We start by writing `0` in the `1`st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence of `0` with `10`. Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the `k`-th indexed symbol in the `n`-th row. (The value of k is 1-indexed.)

### Example

1. Input: `n = 1`, `k = 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: First row is "0".
2. Input: `n = 2`, `k = 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Second row is "01".
3. Input: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Second row is "01".

### Constraints:
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 30 \)
- \( 1 \leq k \leq 2^{(n-1)} \)

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Output Format**: Should the result always be either a 0 or 1?
   - Yes, since the only possible values are 0 or 1.
2. **Recursive Nature**: Is there a simpler recursive approach to derive the value rather than constructing the entire rows?
   - Yes, this problem can be tackled using a recursive approach by leveraging the properties of the previous rows to the current row.

## Strategy

1. **Recursive Insight**: The problem can be efficiently solved using recursive logic.
   - Each time we encounter a new row, the symbols are determined based on the previous row.
   - If a symbol in the previous row is `0`, it turns into `01` in the next row.
   - If a symbol in the previous row is `1`, it turns into `10` in the next row.
2. **Binary Properties**:
   - If `k` is odd, look at the left (first half of the row).
   - If `k` is even, look at the right (second half of the row).

By analyzing further, we can come to the conclusion:
- `k` in the `n`-th row is determined by `ceil(k/2)` in the `(n-1)`-th row.
- The transformation depends on whether `k` is odd or even.

## Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthGrammar(int n, int k) {
        // Base case
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        // Determine the length of the previous row
        int length_of_prev_row = 1 << (n - 2); // 2^(n-2)
        
        if (k <= length_of_prev_row) {
            // The first half of the row
            return kthGrammar(n - 1, k);
        } else {
            // The second half of the row
            return !kthGrammar(n - 1, k - length_of_prev_row);
        }
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this recursive approach:
- We divide the problem size by 2 with each recursive call.
- This leads to a time complexity of \(O(\log k)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\) because \(k\) can be as large as \(2^{(n-1)}\).

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the recursion stack.
