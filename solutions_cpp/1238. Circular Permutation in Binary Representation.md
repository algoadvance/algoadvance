[Leetcode 1238. Circular Permutation in Binary Representation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1238)
## Problem Statement

Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is as follows:

1. Generate a list of all 2^n integers where each integer is in the range [0, 2^n - 1] and has a binary representation of length n.
2. Order the generated list such that successive integers differ by exactly one bit in binary representation.
3. Start from the integer `start`.

Your goal is to return the list as described above.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of n and `start`?**
   - Typically, `n` could range from 1 to 16 to ensure the problem remains computationally feasible. The `start` value will be in the range [0, 2^n - 1].

2. **Is it mandatory for the integers to be in a circular permutation?**
   - Yes, the problem explicitly states the need for a circular permutation where adjacent numbers differ by exactly one bit.

3. **What output is expected if the `start` value does not appear in the resulting permutation?**
   - The `start` value will always appear in the permutation as it is derived from the list of integers ranging from 0 to 2^n-1.

## Strategy

1. **Generate Gray Code Sequence**:
   - Gray code for a given n generates a sequence where each step varies by only one bit.
   - Construct the sequence using the known mathematical formula for generating Gray codes: `i ^ (i >> 1)` for all integers `i` from 0 to 2^n - 1.

2. **Adjust Starting Point**:
   - Once the Gray code sequence is generated, identify the position of `start` in this sequence and rotate the array such that it begins with `start`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        // Total number of elements in the gray code sequence
        int numElements = 1 << n; // 2^n
        
        // Generate the gray code sequence
        vector<int> grayCodeSequence;
        for (int i = 0; i < numElements; ++i) {
            int grayCode = i ^ (i >> 1);
            grayCodeSequence.push_back(grayCode);
        }
        
        // Find the start position and rotate the sequence
        auto startIter = find(grayCodeSequence.begin(), grayCodeSequence.end(), start);
        rotate(grayCodeSequence.begin(), startIter, grayCodeSequence.end());
        
        return grayCodeSequence;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Generating the Gray code sequence**: This involves a single loop running from 0 to 2^n - 1, so it is O(2^n).
2. **Finding the `start` value**: This involves a linear search over the sequence, making it O(2^n).
3. **Rotating the sequence**: This can be considered linear in the size of the array, so also O(2^n).

Thus, the overall time complexity for this approach is **O(2^n)**.
