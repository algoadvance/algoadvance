[Leetcode 3151. Special Array I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3151)
### Problem Statement
You are given a non-negative integer array `numList`. A special integer `num` is defined as the number of `i` (where `0 <= i < numList.length`) such that `numList[i] % num == 0` and `numList[i] / num` is not an integer. You are to return `num`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `numList` have repeated numbers?
    - Yes, there can be repeated numbers.
2. What should be the return value if there is no such `num` that satisfies the conditions described?
    - If no such `num` exists, we can return `-1`.

### Strategy
We need to find a special integer `num` such that:
1. For all `i` in the range `[0, numList.length)`, `numList[i] % num == 0`.
2. For the same `i`, `numList[i] / num` is not an integer.

Steps:
1. Iterate through the possible values of `num` from `1` to the largest number present in `numList`.
2. For each candidate, check the two conditions.
3. If a candidate satisfies the conditions, return it.
4. If no candidates satisfy the conditions, return `-1`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int findSpecialInteger(const std::vector<int>& numList) {
    int maxElement = *std::max_element(numList.begin(), numList.end());
    
    for (int num = 1; num <= maxElement; ++num) {
        bool isSpecial = true;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numList.size(); ++i) {
            if (numList[i] % num != 0 || numList[i] / num == 0 || numList[i] / num == 1) {
                isSpecial = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (isSpecial) {
            return num;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numList = {8, 12, 10, 20};
    int result = findSpecialInteger(numList);
    std::cout << "Special integer: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding the Maximum Element:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of `numList`.
- **Checking Each Candidate `num`:**
  - We iterate through each candidate from `1` to the maximum element which is \(O(\max(numList))\).
  - For each candidate, we check all elements of `numList`, which is \(O(n)\).
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times \max(numList))\).

This solution may not be the most efficient for very large values of `numList`, but it should work within reasonable constraints of typical interview problems. For more optimizations, additional mathematical insights or constraints need to be evaluated.
