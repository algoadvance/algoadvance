[Leetcode 2499. Minimum Total Cost to Make Arrays Unequal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2499)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, of equal length `n`.

In one operation, you can swap the values of any two elements that belong to *different* arrays (i.e., one element is from `nums1` and the other is from `nums2`).

- The cost of the swap is `i + j` where `i` is the index of the element in `nums1` and `j` is the index of the element in `nums2`.

Return the *minimum total cost* to make the two arrays **unequal**. 

Arrays are considered unequal if there exists an index `i` such that `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

If it is impossible to make the arrays unequal, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values of the arrays?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but for general problems, it can be assumed that the arrays can contain any integer values.

2. **What are the length constraints of the arrays?**
   - The arrays are of equal length `n`.

3. **Can the length `n` be equal to 1?**
   - If the length of the arrays is 1, they cannot be made unequal by any swaps.

4. **Are there any constraints on the ranges of the indices for the arrays?**
   - The indices will range from 0 to `n-1` where `n` is the length of the arrays.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: Check if the arrays are already unequal. If they are, the cost is 0.
2. **Basic Check for Length 1**: If `n` is 1 and the arrays are equal, return -1.
3. **Swapping Mechanism**:
   - Iterate over all pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i` is from `nums1` and `j` is from `nums2`.
   - For each possible pair, swap the elements and check if the arrays become unequal.
   - Track the minimum cost during these swaps.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity will involve iterating through all pairs of indices `(i, j)`, resulting in O(n^2) complexity because we are considering every possible pair for swapping.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

int minimumTotalCost(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
    int n = nums1.size();
    
    // Check if arrays are already unequal
    bool unequal = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums1[i] != nums2[i]) {
            unequal = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (unequal) return 0;
    
    // If arrays are equal and length is 1, it's impossible to make them unequal
    if (n == 1) return -1;
    
    // Initialize the minimum cost to maximum possible value
    int min_cost = numeric_limits<int>::max();
    
    // Find the minimum cost by iterating over all possible swaps
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (nums1[i] != nums2[j]) {
                // Calculate the potential swap cost
                int swap_cost = i + j;
                
                // Perform the swap
                swap(nums1[i], nums2[j]);
                
                // Check if the arrays are unequal after the swap
                bool found_unequal = false;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    if (nums1[k] != nums2[k]) {
                        found_unequal = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                
                // If unequal, update the minimum cost
                if (found_unequal) {
                    min_cost = min(min_cost, swap_cost);
                }
                
                // Swap back to revert to the original arrays
                swap(nums1[i], nums2[j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return min_cost == numeric_limits<int>::max() ? -1 : min_cost;
}
```

The above code attempts to find the minimum possible cost to make the two arrays unequal by exploring all possible swaps, calculating their costs, and tracking the minimum cost found. If no valid swap is found, it returns -1.
