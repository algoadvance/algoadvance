[Leetcode 514. Freedom Trail](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l514)
### Problem Statement

The problem "Freedom Trail" (LeetCode 514) can be described as follows:

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Freedom Trail" requires players to spell a specific keyword by rotating a circular dial. The dial consists of multiple characters arranged in a circle, and you can rotate the dial clockwise or counterclockwise to align the desired letter.

Given:

1. A string `ring` representing the characters on the dial.
2. A string `key` representing the keyword you need to spell.

Your task is to return the minimum number of steps required to spell the `key` by rotating the `ring`.

You can rotate the `ring` clockwise or counterclockwise by one step to align any character at the 12:00 position. Once a character is aligned at 12:00, you can press the center button to select it, which also counts as a step.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of `ring` and `key`? 
   - The length of `ring` and `key` is up to 100.

2. **Character Constraints**: Can `ring` and `key` contain any characters?
   - Both `ring` and `key` consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Starting Position**: Where does the index of `ring` start, and is it always at position 0 initially?
   - Yes, the `ring` starts at index 0 initially.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum steps required to spell each prefix of `key`.
2. **State Representation**: Use a 2D dp array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum steps to align `key[0..i]` with `ring[j]` at the 12:00 position.
3. **Transition**:
   - For each character `k` in `key`, and for each current position `curPos` in `ring`, calculate the minimum steps for each next character position `nextPos` in `ring`.
   - The minimum steps involve both rotating the dial from `curPos` to `nextPos` and then pressing the center button.

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {
        int n = ring.size();
        int m = key.size();
        unordered_map<char, vector<int>> charToIndices;
        
        // Fill the map with characters and their positions in the ring
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            charToIndices[ring[i]].push_back(i);
        }
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
        // Base case: 0 steps needed to spell the 0-length prefix of `key`
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            dp[0][j] = 0;
        }
        
        // Fill the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
            char c = key[i - 1];
            for (int curPos : charToIndices[ring[(i == 1) ? 0 : i - 2]]) {
                for (int nextPos : charToIndices[c]) {
                    int diff = abs(curPos - nextPos);
                    int step = min(diff, n - diff);
                    dp[i][nextPos] = min(dp[i][nextPos], dp[i - 1][curPos] + step + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The answer is the minimum number of steps to spell `key` from any position in the ring
        int result = INT_MAX;
        for (int pos : charToIndices[key[m - 1]]) {
            result = min(result, dp[m][pos]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string ring = "godding";
    string key = "gd";
    int result = sol.findRotateSteps(ring, key);
    cout << "Minimum steps: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: O(n) to create the `charToIndices` map.
- **DP Table Calculation**:
  - Outer loop: O(m) for the characters in `key`.
  - Inner loops: O(k^2) where `k` is the average count of characters in `ring`.
  - Transition steps: Each takes O(1), but we have nested loops based on character positions.

Overall, the time complexity is O(m * k^2), which should be efficient given the constraints that n, m â‰¤ 100.

This solution ensures that we find the optimal number of steps to spell the `key` using dynamic programming and careful calculation of rotation steps.
