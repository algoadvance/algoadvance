[Leetcode 2551. Put Marbles in Bags](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2551)
## Problem Statement

You have `k` bags, each bag can hold any number of marbles. You are given `n` marbles and an array `weights` of size `n` which indicates the weight of each marble. Your task is to distribute all marbles into `k` bags such that the maximum weight among all bags is minimized.

Return the minimized maximum weight among all bags.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on marbles and weights:**
    - What is the range of values for `n` and `k`?
    - What range of weights can a single marble have?

2. **Valid combinations:**
    - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, will each bag have at most one marble?

3. **Bag constraint:**
    - Is there any constraint on the number of marbles a single bag can contain?

In this problem, we assume:
- `1 <= n, k <= 10^5`
- `1 <= weights[i] <= 10^9`

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Result:**
    - To find the minimized maximum weight, use binary search between the heaviest single marble and the total weight of all marbles.
    - The goal is to repeatedly divide the search interval until the minimized maximum weight is determined.

2. **Feasibility Check:**
    - For a given maximum weight (mid), check if it is possible to distribute marbles into `k` bags such that no bag exceeds this weight.
    - Use a greedy approach to fill the bags: iterate over marbles, trying to add them to the current bag until adding another marble causes the weight to exceed `mid`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int putMarblesInBags(std::vector<int>& weights, int k) {
        int n = weights.size();
        int maxWeight = *std::max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        long long totalWeight = std::accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0LL);
        
        if (k >= n) return maxWeight;
        
        long long left = maxWeight;
        long long right = totalWeight;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canDistribute(weights, k, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
private:
    bool canDistribute(const std::vector<int>& weights, int k, long long maxWeight) {
        int currentBagCount = 1;
        long long currentBagWeight = 0;
        
        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (currentBagWeight + weight <= maxWeight) {
                currentBagWeight += weight;
            } else {
                currentBagCount++;
                currentBagWeight = weight;
                if (currentBagCount > k) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> weights = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 2;
    std::cout << sol.putMarblesInBags(weights, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Operation:** O(log(totalWeight - maxWeight))
- **Feasibility Check:** O(n) per check

Since we need to perform the feasibility check in each step of binary search, the total time complexity will be:
**O(n * log(totalWeight - maxWeight))**

where `n` is the number of marbles and `totalWeight` is the sum of weights of all marbles.
