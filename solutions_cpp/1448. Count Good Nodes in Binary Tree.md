[Leetcode 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1448)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named `good` if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
    3
   / \
  1   4
 /   / \
3   1   5
```
### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for node values?**
   - Node values are between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

2. **Can nodes have negative values?**
   - Yes.

3. **Is the tree guaranteed to have at least one node?**
   - Yes, as per the constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Traversal Approach:**
   - We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the binary tree.
   
2. **Maintaining Maximum Value:**
   - Maintain a variable `max_val` which keeps track of the maximum value encountered from the root to the current node.

3. **Counting Good Nodes:**
   - At each node, if the node's value is greater than or equal to `max_val`, it is considered a good node.
   - Update the count if it's a good node.

4. **Recursive DFS Function:**
   - Write a helper function to perform DFS traversal.
   - Check at each node if it is a good node.
   - Update the `max_val` accordingly and continue to the left and right children.

5. **Edge Case:**
   - A tree with only one node is always good.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int goodNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, INT_MIN);
    }
    
private:
    int dfs(TreeNode* node, int max_val) {
        if (!node) return 0;

        int good = 0;
        if (node->val >= max_val) {
            good = 1;
            max_val = node->val;
        }

        good += dfs(node->left, max_val);
        good += dfs(node->right, max_val);

        return good;
    }
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Function `goodNodes(TreeNode* root)`:**
   - This is the entry point function which calls the helper function `dfs` with the root node and `INT_MIN` as the initial maximum value.

2. **Function `dfs(TreeNode* node, int max_val)`:**
   - Performs a DFS traversal.
   - Checks if the current node's value is greater than or equal to `max_val`.
   - If it is, it increments the count of good nodes and updates `max_val`.
   - Recursively calls itself for left and right children.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
  - In the worst-case scenario (skewed tree), the recursion stack will go as deep as the height of the tree. For a balanced tree, it's O(log n).
