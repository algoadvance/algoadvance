[Leetcode 655. Print Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l655)
## Problem Statement

(Directly from Leetcode)

You need to print the binary tree in a 2-D array in reverse order. Here are the steps to do that:

1. The row number `r` should be equal to the height of the tree.
2. The number of columns `c` should be equal to `2^h - 1` - where `h` is the height of the tree.
3. Assign the root of the tree at the center of the top row (index `0`).
4. For each node `nd` at position `(r, c)`, you should assign its left child to the position `(r+1, c - 2^(h-r-1))` and the right child to `(r+1, c + 2^(h-r-1))`.
5. A null node should be represented by an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the output array be filled with empty strings where there are no nodes?
   - Yes, the output 2-D array should have empty strings `""` for null nodes.
2. Can the tree have duplicate values?
   - Yes, the tree can have duplicate values.
3. Should the input tree always be non-empty?
   - Yes, it's guaranteed that the tree is non-empty.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Tree Height**:
   - Use a recursive helper function to determine the height of the tree.
2. **Initialize Result Array**:
   - Create a 2-D array filled with empty strings (`""`), having the specified dimensions.
3. **Recursive Placement**:
   - Use a helper function to recursively place each node at the correct position in the 2-D array.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Calculate the height** of the binary tree.
2. **Initialize** a 2-D array `result` of dimensions `h x (2^h - 1)` filled with empty strings.
3. **Recursively place** the nodes in their respective positions in the array, adjusting column indices based on the tree depth.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int getHeight(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        return 1 + std::max(getHeight(root->left), getHeight(root->right));
    }
    
    void fill(TreeNode* root, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>& res, int r, int c, int height) {
        if (!root) return;
        res[r][c] = std::to_string(root->val);
        // Calculate midpoint offset for the next level
        int offset = std::pow(2, height - r - 1);
        if (root->left) fill(root->left, res, r + 1, c - offset, height);
        if (root->right) fill(root->right, res, r + 1, c + offset, height);
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> printTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int height = getHeight(root);
        int width = std::pow(2, height) - 1;
        std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> res(height, std::vector<std::string>(width, ""));
        fill(root, res, 0, (width - 1) / 2, height);
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Height Calculation**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree (in the worst case, we visit each node once).
- **Filling the 2-D Array**: `O(N)`, as we also visit each node exactly once to place it in the correct position.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N)`.

### Space Complexity

- The 2-D array has dimensions of `h x (2^h - 1)`, where `h` is the height of the tree.
- The recursion depth will be `h`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(h * 2^h)`, which simplifies to `O(N)` in terms of tree nodes if we consider a complete binary tree structure.
