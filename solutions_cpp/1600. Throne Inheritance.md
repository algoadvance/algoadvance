[Leetcode 1600. Throne Inheritance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1600)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode Problem 1600: Throne Inheritance**

A kingdom is represented as a family tree rooted at the king, with child nodes being the children of the king (or other family members). The purpose of the class `ThroneInheritance` is to manage the birth and death of family members while maintaining the correct order of succession.

- The constructor `ThroneInheritance(string kingName)` initializes an object of the `ThroneInheritance` class with the name of the king.
- The method `void birth(string parentName, string childName)` is called to record the birth of `childName` as a child of `parentName`.
- The method `void death(string name)` is called to record the death of `name`.
- The method `vector<string> getInheritanceOrder()` returns a list of names representing the current order of inheritance excluding the deceased.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question**: Are there any constraints on the number of births and deaths?
   - **Answer**: You can assume that each birth and death call is valid; i.e., `parentName` always exists for a birth call and `name` always exists for a death call.
   
2. **Question**: Is there any specific order to consider for the inheritance?
   - **Answer**: The inheritance order is determined by a depth-first search (DFS) of the family tree, starting from the king. Children are considered in the order of their birth.

### Strategy

- **Data Structures**:
  - Use an unordered_map to maintain the family relationships.
  - Use a set to track deaths.

- **Approach**:
  - Initialize with the king's name in both the family tree (as root) and the current order.
  - For each birth, add the child to the parent's list of children.
  - For each death, add the name to the death set.
  - For getting the inheritance order, perform a DFS starting from the king, ignoring those in the death set.

### Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class ThroneInheritance {
private:
    string kingName;
    unordered_map<string, vector<string>> family;
    unordered_set<string> dead;

public:
    ThroneInheritance(string kingName) {
        this->kingName = kingName;
        family[kingName] = vector<string>();
    }

    void birth(string parentName, string childName) {
        family[parentName].push_back(childName);
        family[childName] = vector<string>();
    }

    void death(string name) {
        dead.insert(name);
    }

    void dfs(string name, vector<string>& result) {
        if (dead.find(name) == dead.end()) {
            result.push_back(name);
        }
        for (string& child : family[name]) {
            dfs(child, result);
        }
    }

    vector<string> getInheritanceOrder() {
        vector<string> result;
        dfs(kingName, result);
        return result;
    }
};

// Example of usage
int main() {
    ThroneInheritance ti("king");
    ti.birth("king", "andy");
    ti.birth("king", "bob");
    ti.birth("andy", "matthew");
    ti.birth("bob", "alex");
    ti.birth("bob", "asha");

    ti.death("bob");

    vector<string> order = ti.getInheritanceOrder();
    for (const string& name : order) {
        cout << name << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Birth Operation**: O(1), since inserting into the family map and initializing the child's list takes constant time.
- **Death Operation**: O(1), since inserting into an unordered set takes constant time.
- **Get Inheritance Order**: O(N), where N is the number of family members. This is because a DFS traversal of the entire family tree (excluding those who are deceased) requires visiting each node.

This approach ensures efficient management of births, deaths, and retrieving the inheritance order in a dynamic and evolving family tree.
