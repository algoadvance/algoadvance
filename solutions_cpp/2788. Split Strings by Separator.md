[Leetcode 2788. Split Strings by Separator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2788)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` and a character `separator`, split each string in `words` by `separator` and return all the strings "after splitting" in the same order they appear in. You may return the strings in any order.

### Example:

```cpp
Input: words = ["one.two.three", "four.five", "six"], separator = '.'
Output: ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are we allowed to use built-in string splitting functions?
   **A:** For this problem, you can assume that you need to implement your own function to split the strings.

2. **Q:** Can the separator character be any character?
   **A:** Yes, it can be any character.

3. **Q:** How should empty segments be treated?
   **A:** The behavior for empty segments isn't clearly stated, but typically we should return such segments unless otherwise specified.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Result Vector:** Create a vector `result` to store the substrings after splitting.
2. **Iterate Over Input Words:** For each string in `words`:
   - Use a loop to find the delimiter.
   - Extract substrings based on the positions of the delimiter.
   - Add these substrings to the `result` vector.
3. **Return Result:** Return the `result` vector.

### Code

Here's one way to implement this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

vector<string> splitStringsBySeparator(vector<string>& words, char separator) {
    vector<string> result;

    // Iterate over each word in the list
    for (const string& word : words) {
        size_t begin = 0;
        size_t end = word.find(separator);

        // Loop to find all separators in the word
        while (end != string::npos) {
            result.push_back(word.substr(begin, end - begin));
            begin = end + 1;
            end = word.find(separator, begin);
        }
        
        // Add the last or the only segment
        result.push_back(word.substr(begin));
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"one.two.three", "four.five", "six"};
    char separator = '.';

    vector<string> result = splitStringsBySeparator(words, separator);
    
    cout << "Result: ";
    for (const string& str : result) {
        cout << str << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(N + M)** where \( N \) is the total length of all the strings in `words` and \( M \) is the number of separators.
  - **Iterating over each string**: O(N) where \( N \) is the total number of characters in all strings combined.
  - **Finding and Substring operations**: Each find operation and substring operation is O(1) on average since they are linear in the size of the string segment being operated on.

The overall efficiency is effectively linear in terms of the total input size combined with the number of separators. This approach should be optimal for most realistic input sizes.
