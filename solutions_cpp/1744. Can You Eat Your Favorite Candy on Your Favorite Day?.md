[Leetcode 1744. Can You Eat Your Favorite Candy on Your Favorite Day?](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1744)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array `candiesCount` of the size `n` where `candiesCount[i]` represents the number of candies of the `i-th` type you have. You are also given a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [favoriteType_i, favoriteDay_i, dailyCap_i]`.

You must answer whether you can eat your favorite candy on your favorite day without exceeding the daily limit `dailyCap_i` for each query.

Each query represents the following constraints:

- You start eating the candies from day 0.
- You must eat at least one candy per day and can eat up to `dailyCap_i` candies per day.
- You can only eat the candies of type `favoriteType_i` on day `favoriteDay_i`.

Return an array of booleans `result` where `result[i]` is true if you can eat the candy of type `queries[i][0]` on day `queries[i][1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of the elements in `candiesCount` and `queries`:**
   - What are the maximum possible values for the sizes of `candiesCount` and `queries`?
   - What are the ranges of values for elements in `candiesCount` and `queries`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if `candiesCount` is empty?
   - Can `favoriteDay_i` be greater than or equal to the range of possible days one can take?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::partial_sum

using namespace std;

vector<bool> canEat(vector<int>& candiesCount, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    int n = candiesCount.size();
    
    // prefix sums to find cumulative candies up to the current type
    vector<long long> prefixSum(n);
    
    partial_sum(candiesCount.begin(), candiesCount.end(), prefixSum.begin());
    
    vector<bool> result;
    
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int favoriteType = query[0];
        int favoriteDay = query[1];
        int dailyCap = query[2];
        
        long long minCandiesNeeded = favoriteDay + 1;
        long long maxCandiesAllowed = static_cast<long long>(favoriteDay + 1) * dailyCap;
        
        long long candiesBeforeFavType = favoriteType > 0 ? prefixSum[favoriteType - 1] : 0;
        long long candiesUpToFavType = prefixSum[favoriteType];
        
        bool canEatOnFavoriteDay = (minCandiesNeeded <= candiesUpToFavType) && (maxCandiesAllowed > candiesBeforeFavType);
        
        result.push_back(canEatOnFavoriteDay);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sums Calculation:**
   - Use the `partial_sum` function from the Standard Library to compute the cumulative sums of candies up to each type.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, determine:
     - The minimum number of candies needed to reach the `favoriteDay`: `minCandiesNeeded = favoriteDay + 1`.
     - The maximum number of candies allowed by `favoriteDay` considering the daily cap: `maxCandiesAllowed = (favoriteDay + 1) * dailyCap`.
   - Check if the candies up to the previous type of `favoriteType` are less than the maximum allowed (`maxCandiesAllowed > candiesBeforeFavType`).
   - Ensure there are enough total candies of `favoriteType` (`minCandiesNeeded <= candiesUpToFavType`).

3. **Wrapping Up the Results:**
   - Evaluate the feasibility for each query and append the result (`true` or `false`) based on the conditions derived.

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Computation:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `candiesCount`.
- **Query Processing:** Each query is processed in constant time `O(1)`.
- Overall time complexity for the function: `O(n + q)` where `q` is the number of queries.

This solution ensures efficient calculation and query processing, making it suitable for large input sizes.
