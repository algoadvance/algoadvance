[Leetcode 1961. Check If String Is a Prefix of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1961)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, determine if `s` is a prefix string of `words`. A string `s` is a prefix string of `words` if `s` can be formed by concatenating the first `k` strings in `words` for some positive `k` no larger than `words.length`.

If `s` is a prefix string of `words`, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["i","love","leetcode","apples"]
Output: true
Explanation:
s can be formed by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode".
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "iloveleetcode", words = ["apples","i","love","leetcode"]
Output: false
Explanation:
It is impossible to form "iloveleetcode" by concatenating some of the first `k` strings in `words`.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
    - What is the maximum number of strings in the `words` array?
    - What is the maximum and minimum length of each string in the `words` array?
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
    - What should be returned for an empty string `s` or an empty `words` array?
    - Should we consider cases where the concatenation of the initial `k` strings in `words` exceeds the length of `s`?

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem can be described as follows:

1. Initialize an empty string that will store the concatenation of strings from `words`.
2. Iterate over the `words` array and keep appending each element to the concatenated string.
3. After each concatenation, check if the resultant concatenated string equals `s`.
4. If at any point the concatenated string becomes equal to `s`, return `true`.
5. If the concatenated string becomes longer than `s`, break out of the loop since it is no longer possible to match `s`.
6. If the loop completes without matching `s`, return `false`.

This strategy ensures that we are efficiently checking the prefix condition without unnecessary computations.

## Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of the approach is `O(n * m)`, where:
- `n` is the number of strings in the `words` array.
- `m` is the maximum length of the strings in `words`.
This accounts for the concatenation process and the comparison at each step.

We now present the implementation in C++:

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool isPrefixString(std::string s, std::vector<std::string>& words) {
    std::string concatenated;
    for (const auto& word : words) {
        concatenated += word;
        if (concatenated == s) {
            return true;
        }
        if (concatenated.size() > s.size()) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

This implementation follows our outlined strategy:
1. We maintain a `concatenated` string.
2. Iterate through each `word` in `words`, and append it to `concatenated`.
3. Check if `concatenated` matches `s` or exceeds its length.

By following this method, we efficiently determine if `s` is a prefix of the `words` array.
