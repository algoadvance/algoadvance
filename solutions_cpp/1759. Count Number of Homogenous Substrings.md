[Leetcode 1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1759)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of homogenous substrings of `s`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A string is homogenous if all the characters of the string are the same.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of `s`?**
   - The length of `s` will typically be around `10^5`.

2. **What characters can `s` contain?**
   - The string `s` will only contain lowercase English letters.

3. **What should be done if `s` is empty?**
   - If `s` is empty, the output should be `0` because there are no homogenous substrings.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - We need a variable `count` to keep track of the number of homogenous substrings found.
   - A variable `mod` to store `10^9 + 7` for the modulo operation.
   - Variables `current_char` to keep track of the current character being considered and `current_length` to keep track of the length of the current homogenous substring.

2. **Iterate Through String**:
   - Traverse the string while keeping track of the length of consecutive characters (`current_length`).
   - For each character, if it matches the previous character, increment the current length.
   - If it doesn't match, calculate the number of homogenous substrings in the previous segment and add it to `count`. Reset `current_char` and `current_length` for the new character segment.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, perform a final calculation for the last segment of the string.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Return `count` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countHomogenous(string s) {
        long count = 0;
        const int mod = 1000000007;
        int current_length = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (i == 0 || s[i] == s[i - 1]) {
                current_length++;
            } else {
                count += (long)current_length * (current_length + 1) / 2;
                count %= mod;
                current_length = 1;
            }
        }

        // Handle the last segment
        count += (long)current_length * (current_length + 1) / 2;
        count %= mod;

        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    string s = "aaabbbccc";
    cout << solution.countHomogenous(s) << endl; // Example usage
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are only traversing the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

We iterate through the string once, keeping a constant amount of additional state information, and update our count in constant time operations.
