[Leetcode 399. Evaluate Division](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l399)
### Problem Statement

You are given equations in the form of `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

Example:
```
Input: equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
       values = [2.0, 3.0],
       queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]
Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all values guaranteed to be positive or can they be negative/zero?**
   - All values are guaranteed to be positive since it's a division and the input is valid.

2. **Can variable names have special characters, or are they strictly alphabetic strings?**
   - The problem constraints don't specify this detail, but we can assume that variable names are valid strings without special constraints.

3. **What is the maximum size of the equations and queries?**
   - This is not specified in the problem statement. We will implement a solution that is efficient for typical constraints, but it may need further optimization for extremely large inputs.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will treat it as a graph traversal problem where variables are nodes and equations provide edges with weights:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each node will have connections to other nodes with corresponding weights (quotients).
  
2. **Build the Graph**:
   - For each equation `A/B = k`, add edges A -> B with weight `k` and B -> A with weight `1/k`.

3. **Graph Traversal for Queries**:
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to evaluate each query. Start from the queried variable and attempt to reach the target variable, accumulating the product of weights along the path.
   - If the target is reachable, the traversal will result in the correct answer. If not, return `-1.0`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<string, unordered_map<string, double>> graph;

    void addEdge(string from, string to, double value) {
        graph[from][to] = value;
        graph[to][from] = 1.0 / value;
    }

    bool dfs(const string &cur, const string &target, unordered_set<string> &visited, double &value) {
        // If we have found the target
        if (graph[cur].find(target) != graph[cur].end()) {
            value *= graph[cur][target];
            return true;
        }
        
        // Mark current node as visited
        visited.insert(cur);

        for (const auto &neighbor : graph[cur]) {
            if (visited.find(neighbor.first) == visited.end()) {
                double temp = value * neighbor.second;
                
                if (dfs(neighbor.first, target, visited, temp)) {
                    // If target found during DFS, propagate the result upward
                    value = temp;
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Target was not reachable from this path
        return false;
    }

    vector<double> calcEquation(vector<vector<string>>& equations, vector<double>& values, vector<vector<string>>& queries) {
        // Build the graph
        for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); ++i) {
            addEdge(equations[i][0], equations[i][1], values[i]);
        }

        vector<double> results;

        // Process each query
        for (const auto &query : queries) {
            string from = query[0];
            string to = query[1];

            // If either node doesnâ€™t exist in the graph
            if (graph.find(from) == graph.end() || graph.find(to) == graph.end()) {
                results.push_back(-1.0);
            } else {
                unordered_set<string> visited;
                double value = 1.0;
                results.push_back(dfs(from, to, visited, value) ? value : -1.0);
            }
        }

        return results;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Build Time**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of equations.
- **DFS for Queries**: Each query could potentially visit all nodes, leading to a complexity of `O(V)` per query. Hence, for `Q` queries, it is `O(Q * V)`.
- Overall, the complexity is `O(E + Q * V)` where `E` is the number of edges (equations), `Q` is the number of queries, and `V` is the number of nodes (variables).
