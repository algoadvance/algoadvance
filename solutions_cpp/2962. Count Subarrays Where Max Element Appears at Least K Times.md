[Leetcode 2962. Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least K Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2962)
## Problem Statement

You need to solve the problem of counting subarrays where the maximum element appears at least k times. Given an array **nums** and an integer **k**, count the number of subarrays where the maximum element within that subarray appears at least **k** times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input size?**
   - The length of the array **nums** can be up to 10^5.
   - Elements in the array can range from 1 to 10^5.

2. **Are the elements in the array guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes.

3. **What should be returned if no such subarrays exist?**
   - Return 0.

## Strategy

1. **Observation**: For each subarray, the maximum element should appear at least **k** times. This means we need to identify windows in the array where the maximum element has a frequency of at least **k**.

2. **Two-Pointer / Sliding Window**: We can use a sliding window approach with two pointers to keep track of subarrays. As we slide the window, we need to frequently update the frequency count of the elements within the current window.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - Initialize a frequency map to maintain the count of each element in the current window.
   - Use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the window.
   - Expand the `end` pointer to include new elements in the window. For every expansion, update the frequency map.
   - Check the frequency of the maximum element in the current window. If it meets the requirement of appearing at least **k** times, update the count of valid subarrays.
   - If the frequency condition is not met, move the `start` pointer to shrink the window until the condition is met again.
   - Continue until all possible subarrays are considered.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If **k** is greater than the length of **nums**, it's impossible to have any valid subarray.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy described:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int countSubarrays(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;
        int start = 0;
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < n; ++end) {
            freq[nums[end]]++;
            
            while (freq[nums[end]] >= k) {
                count += (n - end);
                freq[nums[start]]--;
                start++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n), where **n** is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and once by the `start` pointer).
  
- **Space complexity**: O(n), due to the use of an unordered_map to keep track of the frequency of elements within the current window.

This solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays following the given constraints using a sliding window approach.
