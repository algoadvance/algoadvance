[Leetcode 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1431)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `candies` where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the `i-th` kid has. For each kid, check if they can have the greatest number of candies among all kids if they are given `extraCandies` more. 

Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the `i-th` kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, else `false`.

**Example:**
```
Input: candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true, true, true, false, true]
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= candies.length <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Does the "greatest number of candies among all kids" mean strictly greater, or can it include being equal to the current maximum?
   - It includes being equal to the current maximum.

### Strategy

1. Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has.
2. Iterate over each kidâ€™s candies count, add the `extraCandies`, and check if it is greater than or equal to the current maximum number of candies.
3. Construct the resultant boolean array based on the above condition.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>  // For std::max_element

std::vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(std::vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
    // Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has
    int maxCandies = *std::max_element(candies.begin(), candies.end());

    // Resultant boolean vector to store the result for each kid
    std::vector<bool> result(candies.size(), false);

    // Check for each kid
    for (int i = 0; i < candies.size(); ++i) {
        // If current kid's candies plus extraCandies is greater than or equal to maxCandies
        if (candies[i] + extraCandies >= maxCandies) {
            result[i] = true; // This kid can have the greatest number of candies
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Finding the maximum number of candies any kid currently has takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `candies`.
- Iterating through the `candies` array to check each kid's condition takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
