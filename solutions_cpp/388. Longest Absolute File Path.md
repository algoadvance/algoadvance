[Leetcode 388. Longest Absolute File Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l388)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string representation of a file system in which different levels of directories and files are separated by newline (`\n`) characters and where each level is indicated by a number of tab (`\t`) characters.

For example, a string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents a file system such that:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

Here, the longest absolute path to a file is `"dir/subdir2/file.ext"`, and its length is 20 (note that the forward slashes are not counted as separators between directories and files). 

Write a program that finds the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the given string representation of the file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a file vs. a directory?**
   - A filename will contain a period (`.`) character which implies it is a file; otherwise, it is a directory.

2. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - The input string length will not exceed 10^4.
   - The input string can contain any printable ASCII characters.

3. **Can the directories and files have the same name?**
   - Yes, it's possible for directories and files to have the same name as per the problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Input:**
   - Use the newline character (`\n`) to split the string into different components representing files and directories.
   
2. **Depth Handling:**
   - Use the tab character (`\t`) to determine the depth level of each component. The number of `\t` characters directly relates to the depth of the file or directory.

3. **Track Paths:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of the current path length at each directory level. 

4. **Update Longest Path:**
   - When encountering a file, update the longest path length if the current file path length is greater than the previous maximum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>

int lengthLongestPath(const std::string &input) {
    std::istringstream ss(input);
    std::string line;
    std::stack<int> pathStack;
    int maxLength = 0;
    
    while (std::getline(ss, line)) {
        size_t numTabs = line.find_first_not_of("\t");
        int level = numTabs;
        std::string name = line.substr(numTabs);
        
        while (pathStack.size() > level) {
            pathStack.pop();
        }

        int currLength = name.size() + (pathStack.empty() ? 0 : pathStack.top() + 1); // +1 for '/' between dirs/files
        if (name.find('.') != std::string::npos) {
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currLength);
        } else {
            pathStack.push(currLength);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    std::string input = "dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext";
    std::cout << "The longest path length is: " << lengthLongestPath(input) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string. 
  - We process each character of the string exactly once.
  - All operations such as finding string parts, pushing/popping from the stack, and updating lengths are bounded by the size of the string.
