[Leetcode 934. Shortest Bridge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l934)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix grid where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s not connected to any other `1`s through land. The grid contains exactly two islands.

You must determine the smallest number of `0`s that must be flipped to `1`s to connect the two islands.

**Example:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the grid?**
   - Each side of the grid is at most 100 elements long (i.e., \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)).

2. **Will the matrix always contain exactly two islands?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed to contain exactly two separate islands.

3. **Do we need to handle any edge cases such as all `0`s or all `1`s?**
   - No, the input constraints assure the presence of exactly two islands separated by at least one `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the two islands**: Use DFS or BFS to find and mark all cells of the first island.
   
2. **Mark the first island**: Once the first island is found and marked, use this information to perform a BFS from the border of this island to find the shortest path to the second island.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Utilize BFS from the perimeter of the first island to explore the shortest path (or bridge) to any cell of the second island. The BFS ensures that we find the shortest distance by level-order traversal.

### Code

Here's a complete C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestBridge(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        bool found = false;
        std::queue<std::pair<int, int>> q;
        std::vector<std::vector<bool>> visited(n, std::vector<bool>(n, false));
        std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> directions = {{1,0}, {-1,0}, {0,1}, {0,-1}};
        
        // DFS to mark all cells of the first island
        std::function<void(int, int)> dfs = [&](int x, int y) {
            if(x < 0 || x >= n || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] != 1 || visited[x][y]) return;
            visited[x][y] = true;
            grid[x][y] = 2; // Mark as part of the first island
            q.push({x, y}); // Add to queue for BFS later
            for(auto& d : directions) {
                dfs(x + d.first, y + d.second);
            }
        };
        
        // Find and mark the first island
        for(int i = 0; i < n && !found; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n && !found; ++j) {
                if(grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    dfs(i, j);
                    found = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // BFS to find the shortest bridge distance to the second island
        int steps = 0;
        while(!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            while(size--) {
                auto [x, y] = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for(auto& d : directions) {
                    int nx = x + d.first;
                    int ny = y + d.second;
                    if(nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                        if(grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                            return steps;
                        }
                        if(grid[nx][ny] == 0 && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                            visited[nx][ny] = true;
                            q.push({nx, ny});
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            ++steps;
        }
        return -1; // This should never be hit due to problem constraints.
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because:
1. **Finding and marking the first island with DFS**: \(O(n^2)\), as we might need to visit all cells.
2. **BFS for the shortest path**: Again \(O(n^2)\), since we are potentially exploring all cells starting from the border.

Thus, the combined time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the dimension of the grid.
