[Leetcode 997. Find the Town Judge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l997)
### Problem Statement

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:
1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a, b]` represents that the person labeled `a` trusts the person labeled `b`.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` otherwise.

### Strategy

1. **Representation and Counting:**
   - Use two arrays, `inDegree` and `outDegree` to count the number of trusts each person receives and gives respectively.
   - Iterate over the `trust` array and for each `trust[i] = [a, b]`, increment `outDegree[a]` and `inDegree[b]`.

2. **Identifying the Judge:**
   - After populating the `inDegree` and `outDegree`, check if there's a person `j` such that:
     - `inDegree[j] == n - 1` (everyone trusts this person, except themselves).
     - `outDegree[j] == 0` (this person trusts no one).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If n is 1 and there are no trust relationships, the single person is the town judge.
   - Handle cases where no such person exists by returning `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + t), where `n` is the number of people and `t` is the length of the trust array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to using the in-degree and out-degree arrays.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;  // If there's only one person, they are trivially the judge.
        }
        
        vector<int> inDegree(n + 1, 0);
        vector<int> outDegree(n + 1, 0);
        
        // Populate in and out degrees
        for (const auto& t : trust) {
            int a = t[0];
            int b = t[1];
            outDegree[a]++;
            inDegree[b]++;
        }
        
        // Find the judge
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (inDegree[i] == n - 1 && outDegree[i] == 0) {
                return i;  // This person satisfies the conditions of the judge
            }
        }
        
        // No judge found
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Clarifying Questions

- **Q:** Can we assume that the number of people `n` is always at least 1?
  - **A:** Yes, the problem guarantees that `n` is at least 1.

- **Q:** Can there be multiple trust relationships for the same person in the input trust array?
  - **A:** Yes, a person can trust multiple different people, and this should be handled correctly by the implementation.

- **Q:** Will the input array `trust` always be within the bounds mentioned?
  - **A:** Yes, assume the input format and bounds are valid as per the problem statement.

With these considerations and strategy, the provided solution efficiently identifies the town judge if they exist.
