[Leetcode 2094. Finding 3](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2094)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `digits`, where each element is a digit (0 - 9). The task is to return a sorted list of all unique 3-digit even numbers that can be formed using the digits in the array. Each digit from the array can only be used at most once in each 3-digit number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - What is the maximum length of the array? 
    - Will there always be at least three digits in the array?

   *Constraints according to the problem:*
    - The array length is between 3 and 100.
    - Each digit is between 0 and 9.
    - There might be duplicate digits.

2. **Output Constraints**: 
   - Should the output list be sorted in ascending order?
   - Do we need to return the list of digits in a specific format?

   *Output according to the problem:*
    - The output should be a list of integers, sorted in ascending order.

3. **Additional Clarification**:
   - Can the 3-digit number start with zero?
     - No, it should be a valid 3-digit number so it cannot start with zero.

## Strategy

1. **Combinations**: 
   - Generate all possible 3-digit numbers using a nested loop to pick one digit for the hundreds place, one for the tens place, and one for the units place.

2. **Validation**:
   - The hundreds place digit should not be zero.
   - The units place digit should be even.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - Store the valid combinations in a `set` to handle uniqueness.

4. **Sorting**:
   - Convert the set to a list and sort it in ascending order.

## Time Complexity

- **Combination Generation**: Since we are using three nested loops, the complexity is O(n^3), where n is the number of digits in the array.
- **Storage and Sorting**: Constructing and sorting unique valid numbers will involve a logarithmic factor due to sorting, which is overshadowed by the combination generation.

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient and feasible.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> findEvenNumbers(std::vector<int>& digits) {
    std::set<int> unique_even_numbers;
    int n = digits.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (digits[i] == 0) continue;  // Skip zero for the hundreds place
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (j == i) continue;  // Same index as the hundreds place
            for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                if (k == i || k == j) continue;  // Same index as the hundreds or tens place
                if (digits[k] % 2 == 0) { // Units place must be even
                    int number = digits[i] * 100 + digits[j] * 10 + digits[k];
                    unique_even_numbers.insert(number);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Convert set to vector and sort
    std::vector<int> result(unique_even_numbers.begin(), unique_even_numbers.end());
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> digits = {2, 1, 3, 0};
    std::vector<int> result = findEvenNumbers(digits);
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This code effectively iterates through all combinations of three digits, ensuring the hundreds place is non-zero, the units place is even, and all digits are unique to the combination. These numbers are stored in a set to handle duplicates, and the final sorted list of unique 3-digit even numbers is returned.
