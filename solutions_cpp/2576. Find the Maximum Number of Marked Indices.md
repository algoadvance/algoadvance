[Leetcode 2576. Find the Maximum Number of Marked Indices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2576)
### Problem Statement

We are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` distinct positive integers. We need to find the maximum number of indices that can be marked. Marked indices must satisfy the following conditions: Suppose we mark `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (with `i < j`), then `2 * nums[i] ≤ nums[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain zero or negative numbers?**
   - No, the problem states that the array consists of distinct positive integers only.
   
2. **What should we return if no indices can be marked?**
   - If no indices can be marked, the function should return 0.

3. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array `n`?**
   - While this is not specified in the problem statement provided, usually constraints are given in the actual problem. For now, we assume `n` is reasonably large but within usual competitive programming limits.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the pairs that satisfy `2 * nums[i] ≤ nums[j]`.
   
2. **Two Pointers Technique**: Utilize two pointers to find the maximum number of valid marked indices:
   - Initialize two pointers: `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the point where it can start finding valid pairs.
   - Iterate with these pointers to count valid pairs satisfying the condition.
   - Move pointers appropriately based on comparisons.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumOfMarkedIndices(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int count = 0;

        while (right < n) {
            // We want nums[right] >= 2 * nums[left]
            while (right < n && 2 * nums[left] > nums[right]) {
                right++;
            }
            
            // If right hasn't reached the end, we can mark these indices
            if (right < n) {
                count += 2; // Mark both nums[left] and nums[right]
                left++;
                right++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` to sort the array.
- **Two Pointers Loop**: `O(n)` to process the two pointers until the end of the array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. This is efficient for typical input sizes in competitive programming.
