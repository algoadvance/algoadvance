[Leetcode 2334. Subarray With Elements Greater Than Varying Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2334)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `threshold`. Your task is to find the length of the longest subarray where each element is greater than some varying threshold. The ith threshold value for element `nums[i]` is given by:

\[ \text{threshold}(i) = threshold + nums[i] \times i \]

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `nums` guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order?**
   Yes, the problem specifies that `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Are the elements in `nums` distinct?**
   The problem does not specify, so we will assume that elements in `nums` could be non-distinct.
3. **Should the subarray only contain elements greater than their respective threshold values?**
   Yes, each element in the subarray should be greater than the corresponding threshold value calculated as `threshold + nums[i] * i`.
4. **Should we consider negative values for both `nums` and `threshold`?**
   Yes, we should consider any integer values for `nums` and `threshold`.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize Variables**: We'll maintain two variables, one for the starting index of the current subarray and one for the maximum length found.
2. **Iterate through Array**: For each element in the array, compute its threshold. If the element is greater than its threshold, continue the subarray. Otherwise, evaluate the length of the current subarray, reset the starting index of the next subarray, and update the maximum length.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases such as an empty array, all elements less than their respective thresholds, or all elements greater than their thresholds.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int longestSubarrayWithThreshold(const std::vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int maxLength = 0;
    int currentLength = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int currentThreshold = threshold + nums[i] * i;
        if (nums[i] > currentThreshold) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 0;
        }
    }
    // In case the longest subarray ends at the last element
    maxLength = std::max(maxLength, currentLength);
    
    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    // Example inputs for testing
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 6, 7, 9};
    int threshold = 2;
    std::cout << "Length of longest subarray: " << longestSubarrayWithThreshold(nums, threshold) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once to determine the lengths of potential subarrays.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is \(O(1)\) as we are only using a few extra variables to store the current length and maximum length, irrespective of the input size.
