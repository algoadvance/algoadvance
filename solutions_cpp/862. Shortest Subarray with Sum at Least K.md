[Leetcode 862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l862)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `K`, return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguous subarray of `nums` with a sum at least `K`. If there is no such subarray, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the input array?
   - What are the constraints on the elements of the input array?
   - Will `K` always be a positive integer?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the input array is empty?
   - Can all elements in the array be negative?

### Code

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int shortestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int K) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int res = INT_MAX;

    // Prefix sum array
    vector<long> preSum(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        preSum[i + 1] = preSum[i] + nums[i];
    }

    // Deque to store the indices of prefix sum array
    deque<int> dq;

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Remove elements from dq which make current subarray's sum >= K
        while (!dq.empty() && preSum[i] - preSum[dq.front()] >= K) {
            res = min(res, i - dq.front());
            dq.pop_front();
        }

        // Maintain the deque such that the elements are in increasing order
        while (!dq.empty() && preSum[i] <= preSum[dq.back()]) {
            dq.pop_back();
        }

        dq.push_back(i);
    }

    return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, -1, 2};
    int K = 3;
    int result = shortestSubarray(nums, K);
    printf("Length of the shortest subarray: %d\n", result);  // Output should be 3
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Compute an array `preSum` where `preSum[i]` is the sum of the elements of `nums` up to the index `i-1`, i.e., `preSum[i] = nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i-1]`.

2. **Deque for Indices:**
   - Use a deque to store the indices of the elements in the prefix sum array in increasing order of their values.
   - This helps in efficiently maintaining the order of elements and finding the shortest subarrays.

3. **Sliding Window:**
   - Iterate through each element in the prefix sum array.
   - For each element `preSum[i]`, remove elements from the front of the deque as long as the difference between `preSum[i]` and `preSum[dq.front()]` is at least `K` and keep track of the minimum length.
   - Remove elements from the back of deque that are greater than or equal to the current `preSum` value to maintain the increasing order.

4. **Result:**
   - The answer is the length of the smallest subarray found. If no such subarray is found, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - Each element is inserted and removed from the deque at most once. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We use a prefix sum array of size `n+1` and a deque which at most stores `n+1` indices.
