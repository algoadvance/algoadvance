[Leetcode 2789. Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2789)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can merge **any two** adjacent elements of the array and replace them with their sum.

The task is to determine the largest element that can remain in the array after performing any number of merge operations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the number of elements in the `nums` array?
   **A**: Typical constraints should be considered, but it's prudent to verify this in the problem statement or clarifying with the interviewer (if there's a live person).

2. **Q**: Can the array have negative elements?
   **A**: Yes, unless itâ€™s mentioned that numbers are always non-negative.

3. **Q**: Do we always need to merge adjacent elements, or can we choose any elements in the array?
   **A**: Only adjacent elements can be merged according to the problem statement.

4. **Q**: Is there a limit to the number of merge operations we can perform?
   **A**: No, there is no specified limit on the number of merge operations.

## Strategy

The strategy is quite straightforward:

1. Merge the numbers from left to right, keeping a running total.
2. The largest number possible through this merging process will be the sum of the entire array, because by repeatedly merging adjacent elements, we will end up combining all numbers into a single sum.

## Code

Here is a C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    int largestElementAfterMerge(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        return std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
    }
};
```

## Explanation

- **Include Relevant Headers**: We included `<vector>` for using the `std::vector` and `<numeric>` to use `std::accumulate`.
- **Merge Mechanism**: If we continually merge the elements of the array, we will eventually form a single element which is the sum of all elements.
- **Efficiency**: Using `std::accumulate` to sum all elements of the array in a straightforward manner ensures both simplicity and efficiency.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(N)\):

- **Summation**: Summing all elements in the array has a linear time complexity, \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space as we are only utilizing a single integer to store the sum during the accumulation process.

This solution ensures optimal performance while maintaining clarity and simplicity.
