[Leetcode 480. Sliding Window Median](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l480)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to find the median of each sliding window of size `k` in an input array `nums`. The median is the middle value in an ordered list. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the mean of the two middle elements.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, you need to return an array of size `n - k + 1`, where the `i-th` element in this output array is the median of the window consisting of `nums[i]` through `nums[i + k - 1]` (inclusive).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should I do if `k` is greater than the length of the array?**
   - It's guaranteed that `k` will be less than or equal to the length of the array `nums`.

2. **What should be returned if the window size or array size is 0?**
   - Assume the inputs will be valid as per usual problem constraints: `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

3. **What data types should be used for the median?**
   - The median should be returned as a floating-point number because the median of an array containing an even number of integers could be a non-integer.

4. **Should the sliding windows overlap?**
   - Yes, each sliding window should overlap with the previous one, moving only one element to the right each time.

## Strategy 

1. **Maintain a Sliding Window:**
   - Use two heaps to manage the elements in the current window: a max-heap for the left half and a min-heap for the right half.
   - The max-heap will contain the smaller half of the elements, and the min-heap will contain the larger half.

2. **Balancing the Heaps:**
   - Ensure that the heaps are balanced; specifically, the left heap can contain at most one more element than the right heap.

3. **Finding the Median:**
   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the top of the max-heap.
   - If it's even, the median is the average of the tops of both heaps.

4. **Sliding the Window:**
   - Remove the element going out of the window and add the new element coming into the window. After adding or removing elements, rebalance the heaps if necessary.

5. **Use Auxiliary Storage:**
   - Use an ordered data structure to add, remove, and get the median efficiently.

Here's the C++ solution following this strategy:

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> medianSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        vector<double> medians;
        multiset<int> minHeap, maxHeap;
        
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            minHeap.insert(nums[i]);
        }

        // Balance heaps such that maxHeap has the first half and minHeap has the rest
        for (int i = 0; i < k / 2; i++) {
            maxHeap.insert(*minHeap.begin());
            minHeap.erase(minHeap.begin());
        }

        for (int i = k; i <= n; i++) {
            if (k % 2 == 0)
                medians.push_back(((double)(*maxHeap.rbegin()) + (double)(*minHeap.begin())) / 2);
            else
                medians.push_back(*minHeap.begin());

            if (i == n)
                break;

            int outgoing = nums[i - k], incoming = nums[i];

            bool balanceNeeded = false;
            if (outgoing <= *minHeap.begin())
                minHeap.erase(minHeap.find(outgoing));
            else
                maxHeap.erase(maxHeap.find(outgoing));
            
            if (incoming > *minHeap.begin())
                minHeap.insert(incoming);
            else
                maxHeap.insert(incoming);

            if (maxHeap.size() > minHeap.size()) {
                minHeap.insert(*maxHeap.rbegin());
                maxHeap.erase(prev(maxHeap.end()));
            } else if (minHeap.size() > maxHeap.size() + 1) {
                maxHeap.insert(*minHeap.begin());
                minHeap.erase(minHeap.begin());
            }
        }
        
        return medians;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Deletion**: `O(log k)` due to multiset operations.
- **Finding Median**: `O(1)` since we just access top elements.
- **Total Complexity**: `O(n log k)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This occurs because each element is added and removed exactly once.

This approach ensures efficient median calculation within the bounds of the sliding window.
