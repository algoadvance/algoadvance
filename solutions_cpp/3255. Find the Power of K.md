[Leetcode 3255. Find the Power of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3255)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. The **power** of a subarray of length `k` is defined as the sum of the elements of the subarray multiplied by the minimum element in the subarray. Compute the sum of the power of all `k`-size subarrays of `nums`. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= n`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, as `1 <= n`.
2. **Are all integers positive in the array?**
   - Yes, since `1 <= nums[i]`.
3. **Is `k` always less than or equal to `n`?**
   - Yes, given `1 <= k <= n`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently calculate the sum of elements and the minimum element for each subarray of size `k`. Here’s the strategy:

1. **Sliding Window for Sum Calculation:**
   - Maintain a running sum of the current `k`-length window and update it as the window slides.

2. **Min Element in k-window:**
   - Use a deque (double-ended queue) to keep track of the minimum element in the current `k`-length window. 
   - The deque will store indices of array elements and ensure that the leftmost element is always the minimum element within the window.

3. **Calculate the Power and Update the Result:**
   - For each window, compute the power as the product of the running sum and the minimum element.
   - Keep adding this power to the result and take modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here’s how the detailed implementation looks in C++:

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
#include <iostream>

#define MOD 1000000007

int sumOfPower(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    long long result = 0;
    
    // Deque to store indices of array elements for maintaining the current minimum
    std::deque<int> deq;
    long long currentSum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Add current element to currentSum
        currentSum += nums[i];
        
        // Remove elements not within the current window
        while (!deq.empty() && deq.front() <= i - k) {
            deq.pop_front();
        }
        
        // Maintain elements in the deque in a way that front always gives the minimum
        while (!deq.empty() && nums[deq.back()] >= nums[i]) {
            deq.pop_back();
        }
        
        // Add current element index to the deque
        deq.push_back(i);
        
        // Check if we have a complete window
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            // Calculate the power of the current k-size subarray
            long long currentPower = currentSum * nums[deq.front()];
            currentPower %= MOD;
            
            // Add to result
            result = (result + currentPower) % MOD;
            
            // Removing the element that goes out of window from currentSum
            currentSum -= nums[i - k + 1];
        }
    }
    
    return (int)result;
}

// Example Usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << sumOfPower(nums, k) << std::endl;  // Output: 60
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sum Calculation:** Keeping the running sum in O(1) per operation as it involves adding and removing one element.
- **Min Calculation Using Deque:** Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, leading to O(n) operations for the minimum calculation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for the given constraints.
