[Leetcode 2741. Special Permutations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2741)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to generate all "special permutations" of integers from 1 to n, such that the absolute difference between any two adjacent integers in the permutation must be a prime number. Return the count of all such permutations.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of `n`?
    - Are there any special cases we need to consider (e.g., small values of `n` like 1 or 2)?

2. **Output Requirements:**
    - Should we return the permutations themselves or just the count of such permutations?

For the sake of this solution, we will assume:
1. \( 1 \le n \le 20 \)
2. We only need to return the count of such permutations.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to generate all permutations of the numbers from 1 to n and count those that satisfy the given condition. We can use the backtracking approach to generate permutations and check if they meet the criteria.

1. **Precompute Prime Numbers:** First, we identify the prime numbers that could be the absolute differences between adjacent numbers, which will be the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.

2. **Backtracking with Pruning:** We'll use a backtracking approach to generate permutations. During the backtracking process, if at any point the condition is violated (absolute difference between any two consecutive numbers is not prime), we prune the branch.

3. **Count Valid Permutations:** As we generate the valid permutations, we'll increment our count of special permutations.

### Prime Checker Function:

We will need a helper function to check if a number is prime quickly.

### Time Complexity:

The worst case time complexity would be \(O(n!)\) for generating all permutations, and each permutation takes \(O(n)\) time to check.

## Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

// Function to check if a number is prime
bool isPrime(int num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num <= 3) return true;
    if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) return false;
    for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6)
        if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0)
            return false;
    return true;
}

// Backtracking function to generate permutations
void backtrack(vector<int>& nums, vector<bool>& used, int n, int depth, int& count, int lastNum) {
    if (depth == n) {
        count++;
        return;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!used[i]) {
            if (depth == 0 || isPrime(abs(lastNum - i))) {
                used[i] = true;
                backtrack(nums, used, n, depth + 1, count, i);
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Main function to compute the count of special permutations
int countSpecialPermutations(int n) {
    vector<int> nums(n);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        nums[i-1] = i;
    }
    vector<bool> used(n + 1, false);
    int count = 0;

    backtrack(nums, used, n, 0, count, 0);
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5; // for example
    cout << "Total special permutations count: " << countSpecialPermutations(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **isPrime Function:** This function checks if a given number is prime.
2. **backtrack Function:** This function generates permutations and checks the special condition.
3. **countSpecialPermutations Function:** This initializes the backtracking process and counts valid permutations.
4. **Main Function:** Demonstrates the function with an example.

With this strategy, we ensure that we only explore viable permutations and count those that meet the given conditions.
