[Leetcode 2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2462)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the ith worker. You are also given an integer `k` and an integer `m`. You need to hire exactly `k` workers, following these rules:
- You will run `m` hiring sessions, where in each session you can hire at most `1` worker. You start a session by choosing any worker from the array.
- After hiring a worker, all workers whose hire cost is less than or equal to the hired worker become unavailable for the remaining sessions.

Return the minimum total cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

### Example:
- **Input:** costs = [1,3,2,5,4], k = 2, m = 2
- **Output:** 5
- **Explanation:** You can hire worker 0 with cost 1 and worker 4 with cost 4, resulting in a total cost of 1 + 4 = 5.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the costs unique or can they have duplicates?
2. If two workers have the same cost, is there any preference on whom to hire first?
3. Are inputs guaranteed to be valid such that it's always possible to hire exactly `k` workers following the rules?
   
For this exercise, let's assume:
1. Costs can have duplicates.
2. No preference on workers with the same cost.
3. Inputs are valid for the problem constraints.

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to iterate `m` times and hire one worker per session in a way that minimizes the total cost for exactly `k` workers. We can use a greedy algorithm with a priority queue (min-heap) to always pick the worker with the current minimum cost.

### Steps:
1. Sort the workers based on their costs to allow easy retrieval of the cheapest worker.
2. Use a priority queue to manage the hireable workers in each session.
3. Iterate through the `m` hiring sessions, adding the eligible workers to the priority queue.
4. For each session, pick the minimum cost worker from the priority queue and track the total cost.
5. Ensure that after each hire, appropriately mark the ineligible workers.

Here is the C++ implementation:

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int totalCost(vector<int>& costs, int k, int m) {
    // Priority queue to always pick the worker with minimum cost
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
    // Sort the costs first
    sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());

    int total_cost = 0;
    int n = costs.size();
    vector<bool> hired(n, false); // Track hired workers

    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        // For each session, push eligible workers to the heap
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (!hired[j] && costs[j] != -1) { // Not hired and still valid
                minHeap.push(costs[j]);
                costs[j] = -1; // Mark this worker cost to not consider again
            }
        }
        if (!minHeap.empty()) {
            total_cost += minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
        }
    }
    
    // Ideally this should have reduced the count correctly
    while (minHeap.size() > k) {
        minHeap.pop();
    }
    
    return total_cost;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting costs: `O(n log n)`
- Inserting elements into the priority queue: `O(n log k)` (per insert and remove)
- The overall complexity is `O(mn log n + m log n)`, but often can simplify to `O(n log n)` due to dominating sorting.

This overall algorithm ensures minimum total hiring cost by leveraging the greedy approach combined with efficient priority queue operations.
