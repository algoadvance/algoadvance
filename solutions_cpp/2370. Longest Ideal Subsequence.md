[Leetcode 2370. Longest Ideal Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2370)
### Problem Statement

The problem asks us to find the length of the longest ideal subsequence in a given string. A subsequence is considered ideal if each character in the subsequence is at most `k` distance apart from the previous character in terms of alphabetical order. The distance between characters `'a'` and `'b'` is `1`, `'a'` and `'c'` is `2`, and so forth.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - The length of the string `s` will be from 1 to 100,000.
   - The value of `k` will be between 1 and 25.

2. **Character Set:**
   - The string `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

3. **Output:**
   - Return the length of the longest ideal subsequence.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming (DP). We'll keep track of the maximum length of ideal subsequences that end with each character.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialize a DP Array:** 
   - We'll use an array `dp` of size 26 (one position for each letter in the alphabet) to store the length of the longest ideal subsequence ending with each character.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each character `c` in the string, we look at the characters which are within the `k` range of `c`.
   - We update the `dp` value for character `c` by checking all possible previous characters that could be part of the subsequence.

3. **Update DP Array:**
   - For each character in the range `[max(0, c - k), min(25, c + k)]`, update the `dp` value for `c`.

4. **Result:**
   - The length of the longest ideal subsequence will be the maximum value in the `dp` array after processing all characters in the string.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. For each character, we potentially look at up to \(k\) characters for updating our `dp` array.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int longestIdealString(string s, int k) {
    // dp array to store the length of the longest ideal subsequence ending with each letter
    vector<int> dp(26, 0);
    
    for (char c : s) {
        int idx = c - 'a';
        int max_length = 0;
        
        // Check all characters within k distance
        for (int i = max(0, idx - k); i <= min(25, idx + k); ++i) {
            max_length = max(max_length, dp[i]);
        }
        
        dp[idx] = max_length + 1;
    }
    
    // The result is the maximum value in dp array
    return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

int main() {
    string s = "acfh";
    int k = 2;
    cout << "Longest Ideal Subsequence Length: " << longestIdealString(s, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This implementation ensures we find the longest ideal subsequence adhering to the constraints efficiently.
