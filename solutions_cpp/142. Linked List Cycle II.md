[Leetcode 142. Linked List Cycle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l142)
## Problem Statement

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `nullptr`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to form a cycle. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle.

**Example:**

- Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
- Output: node with value 2

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if there's no cycle in the linked list?**
   - Return `nullptr` if there's no cycle.

2. **What is the range of values for the linked list nodes?**
   - Each node's value is an integer.

3. **What about the size of the linked list?**
   - The size of the linked list can range from 0 to 10^4.

4. **Will there always be only one cycle in the linked list?**
   - Yes, if a cycle exists, there's only one cycle in the linked list.

## Strategy

To detect the cycle and find the starting node of the cycle, we'll use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm:

1. **Detect the Cycle:**
   - Use two pointers, a slow pointer (tortoise) and a fast pointer (hare).
   - Initially, both pointers are at the head of the linked list.
   - Move the slow pointer one step at a time.
   - Move the fast pointer two steps at a time.
   - If the linked list has a cycle, the slow and fast pointers will eventually meet.
   - If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the linked list (nullptr).

2. **Find the Starting Node of the Cycle:**
   - Once a cycle is detected, initialize another pointer at the head of the linked list.
   - Move both this new pointer and the slow pointer one step at a time.
   - The point at which they meet will be the start of the cycle.

Here's the step-by-step code implementation:

## Code

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;
        
        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head;
        
        // Detect if there is a cycle
        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            
            if (slow == fast) {
                // Cycle detected, find the entry point of the cycle
                ListNode *entry = head;
                while (entry != slow) {
                    entry = entry->next;
                    slow = slow->next;
                }
                return entry; // The start of the cycle
            }
        }
        
        return nullptr; // No cycle
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - In the worst case, we traverse the entire linked list until the cycle is detected in O(n) time.
  - Finding the start of the cycle also requires O(n) time in the worst case.
  - Together, the operations are linear in terms of the number of nodes in the linked list.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
