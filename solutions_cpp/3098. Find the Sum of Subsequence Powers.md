[Leetcode 3098. Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3098)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums`. You should find the sum of the power of all subsequences. The power of a subsequence is defined as the product of its length and the sum of its elements.

Write a function:
```cpp
int sumOfSubsequencePowers(vector<int>& nums);
```
that returns the sum of the power of all subsequences of the given array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the array size?**
   - The array size can be between 1 and 1000.
  
2. **What are the possible values of elements in the array?**
   - The elements can be any integer within the range of \([-10^6, 10^6]\).

3. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array may contain duplicate elements.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to consider all possible subsequences.
   - For each subsequence, calculate the product of its length and the sum of its elements.
   - Sum these values for all subsequences.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Compute the contribution of each element efficiently:
     - Each element `nums[i]` appears in \(2^{(n-1)}\) subsequences since every subsequence either includes or excludes any other element, independently.
     - Thus, each element `nums[i]` contributes to the sum exactly \(nums[i] * 2^{(n-1)}\) times. 

3. **Efficient Computation:**
   - Sum of elements `totalSum` is computed.
   - Calculate `totalSum * 2^{(n-1)}` to get the final result, where \(n\) is the length of the array.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int sumOfSubsequencePowers(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    long long totalSum = 0;
    
    // Calculate the sum of all elements
    for (int num : nums) {
        totalSum += num;
    }
    
    // Calculate the power of 2^(n-1)
    long long power = 1LL << (n - 1); // Using bit shifting for 2^(n-1)
    
    // Every element contributes totalSum * 2^(n - 1)
    return totalSum * power;
}
```

### Explanation
- We compute the sum of all elements in the array.
- Using a bit shift operation, we compute \(2^{(n-1)}\).
- Each element appears in exactly \(2^{(n-1)}\) subsequences, and thus contributes to the final sum \(totalSum * 2^{(n-1)}\).

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are looping through the array once to compute the sum of all elements.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution is efficient and leverages mathematical properties to avoid generating all subsequences explicitly.
