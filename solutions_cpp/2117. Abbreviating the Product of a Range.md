[Leetcode 2117. Abbreviating the Product of a Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2117)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the abbreviation of the product of all integers between `left` and `right` inclusive. An abbreviation of the product is a string representation that retains the leading 5 digits and the trailing 5 digits of the product, and indicates the number of omitted digits by showing it in scientific notation.

For example, if the product is `123456789012345`, its abbreviation would be `12345...23450e10` where `10` is the number of digits omitted. If the product is small enough to be represented without abbreviation, return it without scientific notation.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input values for `left` and `right`?**
   - Typical constraints for competitive programming problems can be large, often up to `10^6`.

2. **Can we assume that `left` and `right` are always positive integers and `left <= right`?**
   - Yes, you can assume `left` and `right` are always positive integers and `left <= right`.

3. **Is integer overflow a concern?**
   - Given the potentially huge range, integer overflow will likely be a concern. We may need to use techniques to handle very large numbers.

4. **Are there any specific requirements for handling trailing zeroes in the product?**
   - The trailing zeroes should not appear in the trailing digits part of the abbreviation.

## Strategy

1. **Large Number Treatment:**
   - Direct multiplication for ranges like `1` to `1,000,000` will cause overflow. Instead, we need techniques to keep track of the significant digits and count the trailing zeroes separately.

2. **Handling Trailing Zeroes:**
   - To accurately track trailing zeroes, we will separate the counting of factors of `2` and `5`.

3. **Abbreviation Construction:**
   - We need to compute the leading 5 and trailing 5 significant digits.
   - We can use modular arithmetic to maintain the last 5 digits without losing track of magnitude.

4. **Scientific Notation:**
   - Compute the number of digits omitted and represent them in the required format.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <string>

std::string abbreviateProduct(int left, int right) {
    int count2 = 0, count5 = 0;
    double lead = 1.0;
    long long trail = 1;
    const long long MOD = 1000000000000LL; // Using a large modulus to prevent overflow in trailing computation

    for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
        int num = i;
        while (num % 2 == 0) {
            num /= 2;
            count2++;
        }
        while (num % 5 == 0) {
            num /= 5;
            count5++;
        }
        trail = (trail * num) % MOD;
        lead *= num;
        // Normalize lead and keep it under control
        while (lead > 1e10) {
            lead /= 10;
        }
    }

    int trailingZeroes = std::min(count2, count5);

    // Adjust leading digits with extra multiplying factors from counts 2 and 5
    int extraFactors = std::abs(count2 - count5);
    for (int i = 0; i < extraFactors; ++i) {
        if (count2 > count5) {
            lead *= 2;
        } else {
            lead *= 5;
        }
        // Normalize lead
        while (lead > 1e10) {
            lead /= 10;
        }
    }

    // Extract leading 5 digits
    while (lead >= 1e5) {
        lead /= 10;
    }
    int leading5 = (int)lead;

    // Extract trailing 5 digits
    int trailing5 = (int)(trail % 100000);

    std::string result;
    if (leading5 == trailing5 && trailingZeroes == 0) {
        result = std::to_string(leading5);
    } else {
        result = std::to_string(leading5) + "..." + std::to_string(trailing5) + "e" + std::to_string(trailingZeroes);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int left = 1;
    int right = 10;
    std::cout << abbreviateProduct(left, right) << std::endl; // Expected output: "36288"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The function `abbreviateProduct` runs in O(N) time where N is the number of integers from `left` to `right`. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables to keep track of the leading digits, trailing digits, and counts of factors of `2` and `5`.
