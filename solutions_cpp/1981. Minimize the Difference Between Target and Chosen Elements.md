## Problem Statement

LeetCode 1981: Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer `target`. Choose one element from each row in such a way that the absolute difference between `target` and the sum of the chosen elements is minimized.

Return the minimum absolute difference.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions and element values?
   - A: The dimensions of the matrix `mat` are `1 <= m, n <= 70`. The values of the elements in the matrix are `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 70`.
   
2. Are there any special edge cases (e.g., matrix with a single element)?
   - Edge cases can include matrices with 1 row or 1 column, but all should be handled by the general solution approach.

3. Can elements from the same row be chosen more than once?
   - No, exactly one element should be chosen from each row.

## Strategy

Given the problem requirements, a dynamic programming (DP) approach can be used to solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - Use a set to keep track of all possible sums that can be obtained by choosing elements up to row `i`.

2. **Iterate through the matrix row by row:**
   - For each element in a row, generate new possible sums by adding the element to each sum generated from the previous row.

3. **Minimize the Absolute Difference:**
   - For the final row, keep track of the closest sum to the `target`.
   
4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a set data structure to keep track of possible sums to avoid redundant sums and keep the memory usage in check.

The code below demonstrates the approach in C++.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minimizeTheDifference(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int target) {
    vector<unordered_set<int>> dp(mat.size() + 1);
    dp[0].insert(0);

    for (int i = 0; i < mat.size(); ++i) {
        for (int sum : dp[i]) {
            for (int val : mat[i]) {
                dp[i + 1].insert(sum + val);
            }
        }
    }

    int min_diff = INT_MAX;
    for (int sum : dp[mat.size()]) {
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(target - sum));
    }

    return min_diff;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> mat = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    int target = 13;
    cout << minimizeTheDifference(mat, target) << endl;  // Output should be 0
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(m * n * maxSum), where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `maxSum` is the maximum possible sum of elements:

- **m**: Number of rows in the matrix.
- **n**: Number of elements in each row.
- **maxSum**: The range of possible sums we might encounter (can go up to `m * max(mat[i][j])`).

The algorithm efficiently utilizes sets to avoid redundant storage of sums and ensures that we are not repeating work unnecessarily, optimizing both time and space complexity.
