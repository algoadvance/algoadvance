[Leetcode 1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1870)
### Problem Statement
You are given a floating-point number `hour`, representing the hours you have to reach the office, and an array `dist` of integers where `dist[i]` represents the distance of the `i-th` segment of the journey. You need to find the minimum integer speed `s` that allows you to arrive at the office on time. If it is not possible to reach the office on time, return `-1`.

The conditions are:
1. You must arrive at the office within or before the given `hour`.
2. You can only travel at integer speeds.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the journey consist of more than one segment?**
   Yes, the journey can consist of multiple segments.

2. **Is the floating-point number `hour` strictly positive?**
   Yes, `hour` is strictly positive.

3. **Do we assume that the distances in `dist` are also strictly positive?**
   Yes, the distances in `dist` are strictly positive.

4. **How should we treat the travel time for each segment?**
   For all segments except the last one, the travel times are rounded up to the nearest integer because you can't complete a segment partially. The last segment's travel time can be taken as is, using the exact floating-point value.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a **binary search** strategy to efficiently find the minimum integer speed required to complete the journey within the given time.

1. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - We start by setting our lower bound `low` to 1 because speed must be at least 1.
   - We set our upper bound `high` to a very large number like 1e7 (reasonable for the context of distances up to 1000).

2. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid` of `low` and `high`.
   - Compute the total time taken to travel all segments with this speed.
   - Adjust `low` and `high` based on whether the total time is within the allowed hours.

3. **Compute Travel Time:**
   - Sum up the travel time for each segment. For all segments except the last, round up the time to the next whole number to account for partial segment completion.

### Code
```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double calculateTime(const vector<int>& dist, int speed) {
        double totalTime = 0.0;
        int n = dist.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (i == n - 1) {
                totalTime += static_cast<double>(dist[i]) / speed;
            } else {
                totalTime += ceil(static_cast<double>(dist[i]) / speed);
            }
        }
        return totalTime;
    }
    
    int minSpeedOnTime(vector<int>& dist, double hour) {
        int low = 1, high = 10000000, result = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (calculateTime(dist, mid) <= hour) {
                result = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary search loop:** O(log(high)) where `high` is fixed at 1e7, which results in a maximum of 24 iterations.
- **Travel time calculation:** O(n) for each of the log(high) iterations where `n` is the number of segments in `dist`.
  
Thus, the total time complexity is O(n * log(high)), which simplifies to O(n * log(1e7)), making it efficient and feasible for typical input sizes.

This binary search approach ensures that we find the minimum speed required in an optimal manner.
