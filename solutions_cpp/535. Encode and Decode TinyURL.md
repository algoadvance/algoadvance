[Leetcode 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l535)
### Problem Statement

Design a URL shortening service like TinyURL. Design two functions:

1. `string encode(string longUrl)` - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
2. `string decode(string shortUrl)` - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is there a specific character limit for the shortened URL?
   **A:** Let's assume typical constraints with a reasonably short length, commonly using a base62 encoding (characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9).

2. **Q:** Will the service need to handle very large numbers of URLs efficiently?
   **A:** Assume yes, so the solution should consider efficient storage and retrieval.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the characters in the URLs?
   **A:** Assume URLs follow standard formatting without special constraints, typically alphanumeric and common punctuation.

4. **Q:** Does the service have to be stateless?
   **A:** No, it's okay to use some form of storage for mappings between original and shortened URLs.

With these questions clarified, let's proceed to the strategy and implementation.

### Strategy

1. **Data Storage**: 
   - Use a hash map (or unordered_map in C++) to map the shortened URL code to the original URL.
   - Implement a counter to generate unique codes for each URL.

2. **Encoding**:
   - Generate a unique ID for each long URL.
   - Convert the ID to a base62 string to create a short URL.

3. **Decoding**:
   - Simply map the short URL back to the original using the stored mappings.

4. **Components**:
   - A map to store the encoded URL mappings.
   - A method to convert a number to a base62 string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

class Solution {
private:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> urlMap;
    int counter;
    std::string base62chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789";

    std::string idToShortURL(int n) {
        std::string shortURL;
        while (n > 0) {
            shortURL += base62chars[n % 62];
            n = n / 62;
        }
        reverse(shortURL.begin(), shortURL.end());
        return shortURL;
    }

    int shortURLToID(const std::string& shortURL) {
        int id = 0;
        for (char c : shortURL) {
            if ('a' <= c && c <= 'z') id = id * 62 + c - 'a';
            if ('A' <= c && c <= 'Z') id = id * 62 + c - 'A' + 26;
            if ('0' <= c && c <= '9') id = id * 62 + c - '0' + 52;
        }
        return id;
    }

public:
    Solution() : counter(1) {}

    std::string encode(const std::string& longUrl) {
        std::string shortURL = idToShortURL(counter);
        urlMap[shortURL] = longUrl;
        ++counter;
        return "http://tinyurl.com/" + shortURL;
    }

    std::string decode(const std::string& shortUrl) {
        std::string shortKey = shortUrl.substr(shortUrl.find_last_of('/') + 1); 
        return urlMap[shortKey];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution tinyUrlService;
    std::string url = "https://www.example.com";
    std::string shortUrl = tinyUrlService.encode(url);
    std::cout << "Short URL: " << shortUrl << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Original URL: " << tinyUrlService.decode(shortUrl) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for encoding and decoding operations is as follows:
- **Encoding**: `O(log N)` - Converting the counter to a base62 string is logarithmic in terms of the number of URLs encoded.
- **Decoding**: `O(1)` - Retrieving the original URL from the map is constant time.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity primarily depends on the number of URLs stored, `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of URLs. The storage for the counter and mappings remains constant relative to the number of entries.
