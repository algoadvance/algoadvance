[Leetcode 113. Path Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l113)
## Problem Statement

**113. Path Sum II**

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals `targetSum`. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, return an empty list.

2. **Can we assume that `targetSum` can be negative?**
   - Yes, `targetSum` can be any integer value including negative numbers.

3. **Can node values be negative?**
   - Yes, node values can be any integer, including negative numbers.

4. **Should the order of paths in the result matter?**
   - No, the order of the paths in the result does not matter.

## Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal:**
   - We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all root-to-leaf paths.

2. **Path Tracking:**
   - While traversing, keep track of the current path and check the sum of the values.

3. **Backtracking:**
   - Utilize backtracking to explore all possible paths from root to leaf.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle edge cases like an empty tree or a tree with only the root node.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        vector<int> currentPath;
        findPaths(root, targetSum, currentPath, result);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void findPaths(TreeNode* node, int targetSum, vector<int>& currentPath, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
        if (!node) return;

        currentPath.push_back(node->val);

        if (!node->left && !node->right && targetSum == node->val) {
            result.push_back(currentPath);
        } else {
            if (node->left) findPaths(node->left, targetSum - node->val, currentPath, result);
            if (node->right) findPaths(node->right, targetSum - node->val, currentPath, result);
        }

        currentPath.pop_back(); // Backtrack
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)
  - Each node is visited exactly once until we find all possible paths.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(H)\)
  - We use additional space for the recursion call stack, where \(H\) is the height of the tree. 
  - In the worst case, \(H = O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. 

This solution effectively explores all potential paths in a binary tree to find those paths that equal the given `targetSum`, using a depth-first search strategy complemented by backtracking.
