[Leetcode 2365. Task Scheduler II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2365)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of tasks where each task requires a unit of time to execute. Each task has to appear at least once, and there must be a cooldown period of `n` units of time before the same task can be executed again.

Return the minimum number of units of time that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any constraint on the number of tasks or the value of `n`?**
   - Typically, you would expect constraints like tasks.length <= 10000 and 1 <= n <= 100.
   
2. **Are tasks represented as any specific data structure?**
   - Tasks can be provided as a vector of integers or characters, where each element indicates a task.

3. **What happens if `n` is zero?**
   - If `n` is zero, there is no cooldown, and tasks can be executed consecutively.

Understanding these constraints can help optimize our solution.

## Strategy

1. **Use a priority queue**:
   - A max-heap (priority queue) can help keep track of the most frequent tasks that need to be executed first.
   
2. **Use a queue to manage cooldowns**:
   - While a task is in cooldown, it should not be available for execution. A queue can be used to manage this cooldown period effectively.

3. **Simulation**:
   - Simulate the process of executing tasks while adhering to the cooldown constraints. Use a priority queue to get the next task with the highest frequency, and a queue to keep track of tasks that are in cooldown.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int taskSchedulerII(vector<int>& tasks, int n) {
        unordered_map<int, long long> taskCooldown;
        long long time = 0;
        
        for(int task : tasks) {
            if (taskCooldown.count(task) && taskCooldown[task] > time) {
                time = taskCooldown[task];
            }
            time++;
            taskCooldown[task] = time + n;
        }
        
        return time;
    }
};
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `taskCooldown`: A hash map to store the next available time for each task.
   - `time`: A counter to simulate the current time in the CPU.

2. **Loop through each task**:
   - Check if the task is in cooldown and update the `time` to the moment it comes out of cooldown if necessary.
   - Execute the task, incrementing the `time`.
   - Update the cooldown for the task to `time + n`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The algorithm processes each task once, resulting in O(T) where T is the number of tasks.
  - Access and update operations on the unordered map (hash map) are average O(1), resulting in a total time complexity of O(T).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space is used for the unordered map to store the cooldown times of tasks, resulting in O(U) where U is the number of unique tasks.

This approach ensures that the task scheduling adheres to the cooldown periods efficiently.
