[Leetcode 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1684)
## Problem Statement
**1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings**

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is considered consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array `words`.

**Example:**
```
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: String "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the characters in the string `allowed` unique?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem statement specifies that `allowed` consists of distinct characters.
   
2. **Q:** What is the length range of `allowed` and `words`?
   - **A:** The lengths are typically within reasonable constraints (e.g., 1 to 26 for `allowed` and lengths of individual strings in `words` can be various, but common problem constraints apply).

3. **Q:** Can `words` contain empty strings?
   - **A:** While possible, the problem context generally implies non-empty strings for practical algorithm creation.

## Strategy
1. **Data Structure Choice:**
   - Utilize a `set` or a `vector<bool>` (size 26) to keep track of characters in `allowed` for O(1) membership checking.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Convert `allowed` characters to a `set` or `vector<bool>`.
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Iterate over each word in `words` and verify if all its characters exist in the `allowed` set/vector.
   - If consistent, increment the counter.
   - Return the counter's value.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `words` is empty, return 0.
   - If there are no consistent strings, return 0.
   
## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * L) where N is the number of words, and L is the average length of a word.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(M) where M (26 in general English alphabet counts).

## Code Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countConsistentStrings(string allowed, vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_set<char> allowedSet(allowed.begin(), allowed.end());
        int consistentCount = 0;
        
        for(const string& word : words) {
            bool isConsistent = true;
            for(char ch : word) {
                if(allowedSet.find(ch) == allowedSet.end()) {
                    isConsistent = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(isConsistent) {
                ++consistentCount;
            }
        }
        
        return consistentCount;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<string> words1 = {"ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"};
    string allowed1 = "ab";
    cout << "The number of consistent strings: " << solution.countConsistentStrings(allowed1, words1) << endl;  // Output: 2

    vector<string> words2 = {"a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"};
    string allowed2 = "abc";
    cout << "The number of consistent strings: " << solution.countConsistentStrings(allowed2, words2) << endl;  // Output: 7

    vector<string> words3 = {"cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"};
    string allowed3 = "cad";
    cout << "The number of consistent strings: " << solution.countConsistentStrings(allowed3, words3) << endl;  // Output: 4

    return 0;
}
```

This implementation employs an `unordered_set` to store the allowed characters and then checks each word against this set to determine consistency, hence counting the number of consistent strings as required.
