[Leetcode 2850. Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2850)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `2 x 2` grid initially filled with zeros. You can perform the following operations:

1. Choose any cell and move a stone from that cell to an adjacent cell (horizontally or vertically).

Your task is to determine the minimum number of moves required such that there is at least one stone in each non-zero cell.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that there are exactly 4 cells in the grid, each having the ability to either contain stones or be empty?
2. Are there any constraints on the number of stones that can be transferred in a single move?
3. Can a cell have more than one stone?

Assuming we have answers:
1. Yes, it is a `2 x 2` grid.
2. Each move allows transferring one stone to an adjacent cell.
3. A cell can have multiple stones but the goal is to ensure each cell has at least one stone.


## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:
1. Identify all cells with stones and those without stones.
2. Utilize a BFS/DFS or any other strategy that ensures minimum moves, this can be simplified to keeping track of adjacent cells transfers.
3. Calculate the number of movements required to distribute the stones evenly across the grid.

The code needs to check all possible scenarios:
  - If initial distribution of stones is lopsided (e.g., all stones are in one cell), then more moves are needed.
  - If stones are already evenly distributed, no moves are needed.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int minMovesToSpreadStones(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    // Calculate total number of stones
    int totalStones = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            totalStones += grid[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    // Each cell must at least have one stone
    int target = 1;
    int moves = 0;
    
    // Using a BFS or DFS approach to spread the stones
    // Initialize queue for BFS
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;
    vector<vector<int>> visited(2, vector<int>(2, 0));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                q.push({i, j});
                visited[i][j] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [x, y] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for (auto [dx, dy] : directions) {
            int nx = x + dx;
            int ny = y + dy;
            
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < 2 && ny >= 0 && ny < 2 && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                int diff = max(grid[x][y] - target, 0);
                moves += diff;
                grid[nx][ny] += diff;
                grid[x][y] -= diff;
                visited[nx][ny] = 1;
                q.push({nx, ny});
            }
        }
    }
	
    return moves;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = {{0, 2}, {3, 0}};
    cout << "Minimum moves to spread stones: " << minMovesToSpreadStones(grid) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since the grid size is fixed (`2x2`). The calculation and movement of stones across these cells are constant operations, and thus, do not depend on the size of inputs. Each move is simply moving stones between these four cells, which is a constant-time operation.
