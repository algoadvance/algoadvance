[Leetcode 768. Max Chunks To Make Sorted II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l768)
### Problem Statement

This problem is a variant of the "Max Chunks To Make Sorted I" problem. Given an array `arr` of integers (possibly containing duplicates), you need to determine the maximum number of chunks you can split the array into such that, when sorted individually within chunks and then concatenated together, the resulting array is sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of sizes for the input array?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the array? Can they be negative or extremely large?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the solution handle edge cases like empty arrays or arrays with a single element?

### Strategy

To determine the maximum number of chunks, we need to compare the partially sorted prefix and suffix arrays. Here's the strategy:

1. **Prefix Maximum Array**: Create an array `maxLeft` where `maxLeft[i]` stores the maximum value from the start of the array up to index `i`.
2. **Suffix Minimum Array**: Create an array `minRight` where `minRight[i]` stores the minimum value from index `i` to the end of the array.
3. **Divide Chunks**: Iterate through the array and compare corresponding values from `maxLeft` and `minRight`. If `maxLeft[i] <= minRight[i + 1]`, it indicates a valid chunk can end at index `i`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Step 1: Create the maxLeft array
        vector<int> maxLeft(n);
        maxLeft[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            maxLeft[i] = max(maxLeft[i - 1], arr[i]);
        }

        // Step 2: Create the minRight array
        vector<int> minRight(n);
        minRight[n - 1] = arr[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            minRight[i] = min(minRight[i + 1], arr[i]);
        }

        // Step 3: Find the maximum number of chunks
        int chunkCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (maxLeft[i] <= minRight[i + 1]) {
                ++chunkCount;
            }
        }

        return chunkCount + 1; // +1 for the last chunk
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Calculating the `maxLeft` array takes O(n) time.
  - Calculating the `minRight` array also takes O(n) time.
  - The final iteration to count the chunks takes O(n) time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Both the `maxLeft` and `minRight` arrays take up O(n) space.

This approach efficiently computes the maximum chunks in which the array can be split such that after sorting each chunk individually, the concatenated result is a sorted array.
