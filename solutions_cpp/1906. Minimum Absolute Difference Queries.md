[Leetcode 1906. Minimum Absolute Difference Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1906)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `queries` where each `queries[i] = [li, ri]`. For each `query`, you need to compute the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subarray `nums[li...ri]` (inclusive).

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the i-th query.

The minimum absolute difference of an array `arr` is defined as the minimum value of `|arr[i] - arr[j]|` for all `0 <= i < j < arr.length`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in `nums` include negative values?
2. Is it guaranteed that `queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1]`?
3. What is the maximum length of the `nums` array and the maximum number of queries?

Assuming the following based on typical constraints:
- `nums` will have up to `10^5` elements.
- `queries` will also have up to `10^5` elements.

### Strategy

To efficiently handle this problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Sort and sliding window approach:** For each query, take the subarray, sort it, and find the minimum absolute difference using a sliding window method. However, this approach is costly due to repeated sorting.

2. **Frequency count and prefix sums:** Maintain a frequency count and use prefix sums or other precomputed data structures to quickly generate subarrays.

Given the size constraints, a combination of prefix frequency sums and an efficient query mechanism using some data segmentation (like segment trees or sparse tables) seems appropriate. But for simplicity, I can use a bucket frequency approach with sorted insertion.

### Implementation in C++

Here is the implementation of a simpler and educational approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

vector<int> minAbsDifferenceQueries(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    vector<int> result;
    
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int li = query[0];
        int ri = query[1];
        
        vector<int> subarray(nums.begin() + li, nums.begin() + ri + 1);
        sort(subarray.begin(), subarray.end());
        
        int min_diff = INT_MAX;
        for (size_t i = 1; i < subarray.size(); ++i) {
            min_diff = min(min_diff, subarray[i] - subarray[i - 1]);
        }
        
        if (min_diff == INT_MAX) {
            min_diff = -1; // No valid pair found
        }
        
        result.push_back(min_diff);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 5, 7};
    vector<vector<int>> queries = \{\{0, 2}, {1, 3}, {0, 3}};
    vector<int> result = minAbsDifferenceQueries(nums, queries);
    
    for (int res : result) {
        cout << res << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** For each query, the subarray of length `k` is sorted in `O(k log k)`, and the minimum difference computation is `O(k)`. Hence, for a single query, it is `O(k log k)`.
- **Overall time complexity:** Given `q` queries and `n` elements, the worst-case complexity if the subarray covers the entire array is `O(q * n log n)`.

This approach may be improved by precomputation techniques like Segment Trees, but it provides a clear baseline solution. If necessary, optimizations can be made based on further constraints and use of advanced data structures.
