[Leetcode 146. LRU Cache](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l146)
### Problem Statement

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a **Least Recently Used (LRU) cache**. Implement the `LRUCache` class:

- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
- `int get(int key)` Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should happen when we `put` a key that already exists?**
   - The value associated with the key should be updated, and the key should be marked as the most recently used.

2. **Can we assume all keys and values are integers?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, assume all keys and values are integers.

3. **Is the capacity of the cache fixed after initialization?**
   - Yes, after initialization with a given capacity, the size of the cache is fixed.

No more clarifications needed. Let's move on to the solution.

### Strategy

The problem essentially requires the design of an LRU Cache with efficient `get` and `put` operations. To achieve O(1) average time complexity for these operations, we can use the following data structures:

1. **Hash Map** for O(1) access to cache items.
2. **Doubly Linked List** to keep track of the order of insertion and access to determine the least recently used item.

We will use a combination of these two data structures:
- **Hash Map** will map keys to nodes in the doubly linked list.
- **Doubly Linked List** will store the key-value pairs, with the most recent node at the head and the least recent node at the tail. This way, we can quickly remove the least recently used nodes.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class LRUCache {
private:
    struct DListNode {
        int key;
        int value;
        DListNode* prev;
        DListNode* next;
        DListNode(int k, int v) : key(k), value(v), prev(nullptr), next(nullptr) {}
    };

    unordered_map<int, DListNode*> cacheMap;
    DListNode* head;
    DListNode* tail;
    int capacity;
    int size;

    void removeNode(DListNode* node) {
        node->prev->next = node->next;
        node->next->prev = node->prev;
    }

    void addToHead(DListNode* node) {
        node->next = head->next;
        node->next->prev = node;
        head->next = node;
        node->prev = head;
    }

    DListNode* removeTail() {
        DListNode* node = tail->prev;
        removeNode(node);
        return node;
    }

public:
    LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this->capacity = capacity;
        this->size = 0;
        head = new DListNode(0, 0);
        tail = new DListNode(0, 0);
        head->next = tail;
        tail->prev = head;
    }
    
    int get(int key) {
        if (cacheMap.find(key) == cacheMap.end()) {
            return -1;
        }
        DListNode* node = cacheMap[key];
        removeNode(node);
        addToHead(node);
        return node->value;
    }
    
    void put(int key, int value) {
        if (cacheMap.find(key) != cacheMap.end()) {
            DListNode* node = cacheMap[key];
            node->value = value;
            removeNode(node);
            addToHead(node);
        } else {
            DListNode* newNode = new DListNode(key, value);
            cacheMap[key] = newNode;
            addToHead(newNode);
            size++;
            if (size > capacity) {
                DListNode* tail = removeTail();
                cacheMap.erase(tail->key);
                delete tail;
                size--;
            }
        }
    }

    ~LRUCache() {
        DListNode* current = head;
        while (current) {
            DListNode* next = current->next;
            delete current;
            current = next;
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **get(int key)**: O(1) because we use the hash map to find the node and the doubly linked list to update its position.
- **put(int key, int value)**: O(1) as well. Inserting a new node or updating an existing node's position in the list involves a constant amount of work.

The solution efficiently handles the constraints and requirements of an LRU Cache.
