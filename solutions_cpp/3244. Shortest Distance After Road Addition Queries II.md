[Leetcode 3244. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3244)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. Initially, some roads are directly connecting pairs of nodes. You need to maintain and determine the shortest distance between any two nodes after a series of road addition queries.

Each query adds a new road between two nodes (if it doesn’t already exist) and asks for the shortest distance between two nodes `(x, y)`. Your task is to efficiently handle these queries.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the number of nodes `n` and the number of initial and query operations?
   - Assume `n` can go up to 500 (to keep solutions manageable and use Floyd-Warshall algorithm).
  
2. **Graph Representation**: How are the initial roads and queries given?
   - Initial roads can be provided as a list of tuples. Each tuple will contain two integers representing a bidirectional road.
   - Each query will be a tuple of three integers representing two nodes to connect and a query for distance.

3. **Weight of Roads**: Are all roads having the same weight, specifically weight one?
   - Assume all roads have a weight of one.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency matrix to represent the graph. Initialize the matrix with high values (indicating no direct road) and zeros on the diagonal (distance from a node to itself).
  
2. **Handling Initial Roads**: Populate the adjacency matrix based on the initial set of roads.

3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Before processing queries, compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - For a given query adding a road, update the adjacency matrix.
   - Use Floyd-Warshall logic to update the shortest paths affected by the new road.
   - Return the shortest path for each distance query.

### Code

Here’s the C++ implementation that targets this problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

const int INF = INT_MAX / 2; // to avoid integer overflow in addition

void floydWarshall(vector<vector<int>>& dist, int n) {
    for(int k = 0; k < n; ++k)
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                if(dist[i][k] != INF && dist[k][j] != INF)
                    dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
}

void addRoadAndUpdateFloydWarshall(vector<vector<int>>& dist, int n, int u, int v) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (dist[i][u] != INF && dist[v][j] != INF) {
                dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][u] + 1 + dist[v][j]);
            }
            if (dist[i][v] != INF && dist[u][j] != INF) {
                dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][v] + 1 + dist[u][j]);
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, q;
    cout << "Enter number of nodes (n), number of edges (m) and number of queries (q): ";
    cin >> n >> m >> q; 
    vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, INF));

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
        dist[i][i] = 0;

    cout << "Enter the edges (m): ";
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;
        --u, --v; // Zero based indexing
        dist[u][v] = 1;
        dist[v][u] = 1;
    }

    floydWarshall(dist, n);

    cout << "Enter the queries (q): ";
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int u, v, x, y;
        cin >> u >> v >> x >> y;
        --u, --v, --x, --y; // Zero based indexing

        if (dist[u][v] > 1) {
            dist[u][v] = 1;
            dist[v][u] = 1;
            addRoadAndUpdateFloydWarshall(dist, n, u, v);
        }

        cout << "Shortest distance (" << x + 1 << "," << y + 1 << "): " << dist[x][y] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization with Floyd-Warshall**: O(n^3)
2. **Processing each query**: For adding a road and updating distances, worst case O(n^2)

This solution is efficient for a relatively dense graph with an upper-bound of n=500 nodes, leveraging the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to keep query handling manageable even with frequent updates.
