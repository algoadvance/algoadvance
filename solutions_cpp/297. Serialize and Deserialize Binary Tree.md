[Leetcode 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l297)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode 297 - Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree:

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and that this string can be deserialized back to the original tree structure.

**Example:**
```
You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
```

**Clarify**: `null` means the absence of a child node.

**Note:** Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the input binary tree can contain negative values, and possibly zero?**
   Yes, the binary tree can contain negative values and zero.

2. **How do we handle an empty binary tree?**
   An empty binary tree should be serialized to "[]".

3. **Is the binary tree a full binary tree?**
   No, the binary tree does not have to be full and can have any structure.

### Strategy

1. **Serialization**:
   - Use level-order traversal (BFS) to serialize the tree. 
   - Use a queue to traverse the nodes. Append "null" for missing children.

2. **Deserialization**:
   - Split the serialized string and use level-order traversal to rebuild the tree.
   - Use a queue to reconstruct the tree's nodes while iteratively linking children.

### Code

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class TreeNode {
public:
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int value) : val(value), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Codec {
public:
    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    std::string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return "[]";
        
        std::ostringstream out;
        std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        out << "[";
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if (node) {
                out << node->val << ",";
                q.push(node->left);
                q.push(node->right);
            } else {
                out << "null,";
            }
        }
        
        std::string result = out.str();
        result.back() = ']';  // Replace last ',' with ']'
        
        return result;
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    TreeNode* deserialize(const std::string& data) {
        if (data == "[]") return nullptr;
        
        std::istringstream in(data.substr(1, data.size() - 2)); // remove '[' and ']'
        std::string val;
        std::getline(in, val, ',');
        
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(std::stoi(val));
        std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if (std::getline(in, val, ',')) {
                if (val != "null") {
                    node->left = new TreeNode(std::stoi(val));
                    q.push(node->left);
                }
            }
            
            if (std::getline(in, val, ',')) {
                if (val != "null") {
                    node->right = new TreeNode(std::stoi(val));
                    q.push(node->right);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};

// Usage example:
int main() {
    Codec codec;
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(5);
    
    std::string serialized = codec.serialize(root);
    std::cout << "Serialized: " << serialized << std::endl;
    
    TreeNode* deserialized = codec.deserialize(serialized);
    std::string reserialized = codec.serialize(deserialized);
    std::cout << "Reserialized: " << reserialized << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Serialization**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Deserialization**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node's value is parsed and children are connected using a queue.
