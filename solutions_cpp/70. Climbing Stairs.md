[Leetcode 70. Climbing Stairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l70)
Sure, let's go through the problem "70. Climbing Stairs" on LeetCode.

### Problem Statement:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 45`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `n` be 0? (No, the minimum value for `n` is 1 according to the constraints.)
2. Are there any specific restrictions or edge cases that we should be aware of other than those mentioned? (No additional constraints beyond those provided.)

### Strategy:
This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, there is only 1 way to get to the top (1 step).
   - If `n` is 2, there are 2 ways to get to the top (1 step + 1 step, 2 steps).

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   For `n` steps, the number of ways to get to the top can be thought of as:
   - From the last step, you could have come from `n-1` or `n-2` steps.
   - Therefore, the number of ways to get to step `n` is the sum of the number of ways to get to step `n-1` and step `n-2`.

   Mathematically, this can be written as:
   \[
   \text{ways}(n) = \text{ways}(n-1) + \text{ways}(n-2)
   \]

3. We can use an array to store the number of ways to reach each step up to `n`.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;

        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1);
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::cout << solution.climbStairs(2) << std::endl; // Output: 2
    std::cout << solution.climbStairs(3) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    std::cout << solution.climbStairs(4) << std::endl; // Output: 5
    return 0;
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \) because we are iterating from 3 to `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) because we are storing the results of each step in a vector of size `n+1`.

This approach ensures that our solution is both efficient and easy to understand.
