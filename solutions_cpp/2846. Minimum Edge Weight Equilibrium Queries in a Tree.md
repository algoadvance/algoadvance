[Leetcode 2846. Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2846)
## Problem Statement
You'll be given a tree (a connected undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes, labeled `[0, n-1]`. Each node has a positive integer weight. Two queries are given: 
1. `x` and `y` - Identify the path between node `x` and node `y`.
2. Return the minimum weight of edges that make the sum of weights of nodes along the path between `x` and `y` an equilibrium.

An equilibrium occurs when the sum of weights is at least the maximum node weight on the path between `x` and `y`.

### Input
- An integer `n` (the number of nodes in the tree).
- A 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` describes an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with a positive weight `w`.
- An integer array `weights` of size `n` giving weights for each node.
- A 2D array `queries` where each query is of the form `[x, y]`.

### Output
An array, where each element is the answer to the corresponding query.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the nodes be disconnected? 
   - No, by definition, the nodes are in a connected tree.
2. What are the bounds for `n` and `edges`?
   - This needs to be confirmed with the problem constraints but typically, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and weights are positive integers within a reasonable range.
3. Is there any specific order in returning the results of the queries?
   - Yes, the results should be in the same order as the queries provided.

## Strategy
1. **Tree Representation**: Use adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)**: Use Binary Lifting technique for efficient LCA computation.
3. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: To populate parent and max_edge arrays for binary lifting and depth computation.
4. **Max Edge Weight**: Helper function to get the maximum weighted edge on the path between two nodes.
5. **Queries**: Use the LCA to break down the path, compute the weights and find equilibrium.

## Time Complexity
- Building the tree and preprocessing with DFS: `O(n log n)`
- Processing each query: `O(log n)`
- Overall complexity with `m` queries: `O((n + m) log n)`
