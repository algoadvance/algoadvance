[Leetcode 25. Reverse Nodes in k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l25)
### Problem Statement

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list `k` at a time and return its modified list. `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as they are.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of the ListNode structure?**
   ```cpp
   struct ListNode {
       int val;
       ListNode *next;
       ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
       ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
       ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
   };
   ```
   
2. **Can we assume that the input linked list is non-empty?**
   - Yes, we can assume the input linked list is non-empty.

3. **What should we return if the length of the linked list is less than `k`?**
   - Return the original linked list without any modifications.

### Strategy

1. **Count the nodes:** First, traverse the linked list to get its length.
2. **Reverse in chunks:** Use a loop to reverse every `k` nodes until the remaining nodes are fewer than `k`.
3. **Reversal Function:** Implement a helper function to reverse `k` nodes of the list and attach the reversed segments properly.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if (!head || k == 1) return head;

        // Calculate the length of the list
        int length = 0;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        while (curr) {
            length++;
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        ListNode dummy(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode* prevGroupEnd = &dummy;

        while (length >= k) {
            ListNode* prev = nullptr;
            ListNode* curr = prevGroupEnd->next;
            ListNode* next = nullptr;
            ListNode* groupStart = curr;

            // Reverse 'k' nodes
            for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
                next = curr->next;
                curr->next = prev;
                prev = curr;
                curr = next;
            }

            // Connect with the previous part
            prevGroupEnd->next = prev;
            groupStart->next = curr;
            prevGroupEnd = groupStart;

            length -= k;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list to count nodes and then process each node exactly once during the reversal in chunks.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are only using a constant amount of extra space for pointers.

This solution ensures that the list is modified in-place with efficient time and space complexity.
