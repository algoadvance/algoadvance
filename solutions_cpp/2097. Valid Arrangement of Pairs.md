[Leetcode 2097. Valid Arrangement of Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2097)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents a directed edge between nodes `start_i` and `end_i`. A valid arrangement of pairs is an arrangement of pairs such that for every pair `[a, b]` in the arrangement, `end_i` should either be the start node of the next pair or should be at the end of the arrangement.

You need to determine if there is a valid arrangement of these pairs and, if so, return any arrangement that is valid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the number of pairs?**
   - The number of pairs can be assumed to be within reasonable constraints (typically hundreds or thousands).
   
2. **What should be returned if no valid arrangement exists?**
   - We only need to return a valid arrangement if one exists.

3. **Can the same start and end nodes occur in multiple pairs?**
   - Yes, the same nodes can appear in multiple pairs.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can effectively model it as an Eulerian Path problem in a directed graph:
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Create a graph using adjacency lists for easy representation of pairs.
   - Track the in-degree and out-degree for each node to facilitate finding the starting point of the Eulerian Path.
   
2. **Eulerian Path Conditions:**
   - For an Eulerian Path to exist in a directed graph:
     - Exactly one vertex should have `(out-degree - in-degree) = 1`.
     - Exactly one vertex should have `(in-degree - out-degree) = 1`.
     - All other vertices should have equal in-degree and out-degree.

3. **Hierholzer's Algorithm:**
   - Start from the node with `(out-degree - in-degree) = 1` (if exists).
   - Perform Hierholzer's algorithm to find the Eulerian Path:
     - This involves a DFS traversal to form the path by removing edges as they are visited.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> validArrangement(vector<vector<int>>& pairs) {
        // adjacency list and degree trackers
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
        unordered_map<int, int> outDegree;
        unordered_map<int, int> inDegree;
        
        // build the graph and update degrees
        for (auto& p : pairs) {
            graph[p[0]].push_back(p[1]);
            outDegree[p[0]]++;
            inDegree[p[1]]++;
        }
        
        // find the starting point for the Eulerian path
        int start = pairs[0][0];
        for (auto& node : graph) {
            if (outDegree[node.first] - inDegree[node.first] == 1) {
                start = node.first;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        // Hierholzer's Algorithm
        vector<int> result;
        stack<int> stack;
        stack.push(start);
        
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            int u = stack.top();
            if (graph[u].empty()) {
                result.push_back(u);
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                stack.push(graph[u].back());
                graph[u].pop_back();
            }
        }
        
        // convert result to pairs
        vector<vector<int>> validArrangement;
        for (int i = result.size() - 1; i > 0; --i) {
            validArrangement.push_back({result[i], result[i-1]});
        }
        
        return validArrangement;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph:**
  - Building the adjacency list and in-degree/out-degree maps takes `O(N)` time, where `N` is the number of pairs.
  
- **Finding the Eulerian Path:**
  - Hierholzer's algorithm runs in `O(V + E)` time where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

The overall time complexity of the solution is `O(N)` since processing the vertices and edges dominates the runtime. The space complexity is also `O(N)` due to the storage requirements of the graph and degree maps.
