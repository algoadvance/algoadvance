[Leetcode 903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l903)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` that represents a **DI** sequence, return the number of valid permutations of *[0, 1, ..., n]* such that for all `i`:

- If `s[i] == 'D'`, then `perm[i] > perm[i + 1]`, and
- If `s[i] == 'I'`, then `perm[i] < perm[i + 1]`.

Where `n == s.length`.

Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo 10^9 + 7**.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `s.length`?**
   - It is guaranteed that `s.length` will be between 1 and 200.

2. **Can the string `s` include any other characters apart from 'D' and 'I'?**
   - No, the string `s` will only contain the characters 'D' and 'I'.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We'll use a DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid permutations of the first `i+1` integers that end with the number `j`.
   - Initialize the dp table and iterate through the length of `s`.
   - Update the dp table based on whether the current character in `s` is 'D' or 'I'.
   - Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int numPermsDISequence(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
    
    // Base case: there's one way to arrange 0...0 (one element)
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (s[i - 1] == 'I') {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; ++j) {
                sum = (sum + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
                dp[i][j] = sum;
            }
        } else { // s[i - 1] == 'D'
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; --j) {
                sum = (sum + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
                dp[i][j] = sum;
            }
        }
    }

    int result = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j) {
        result = (result + dp[n][j]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cout << "Enter the DI sequence: ";
    cin >> s;
    cout << "Number of valid permutations: " << numPermsDISequence(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` means the number of valid sequences of length `i+1` ending in `j`.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each character in `s`:
     - **If 'I'**: Update from left to right.
     - **If 'D'**: Update from right to left.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Sum up all possible permutations of length `n + 1`.

### Time Complexity

- **O(n^2)**:
  - We have a nested loop where both dimensions run up to `n`, where `n` is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity

- **O(n^2)**:
  - The DP table of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` is used.
