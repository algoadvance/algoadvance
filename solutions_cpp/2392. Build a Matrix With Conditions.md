[Leetcode 2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2392)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `k`, you are required to build a `k x k` matrix such that:
- The integers from `1` to `k` are the rows.
- The integers from `1` to `k` are the columns.

Also, given two lists `rowConditions` and `colConditions`, each containing pairs of integers, we need to ensure:
- For each pair `(a, b)` in `rowConditions`, integer `a` should appear before integer `b` in the row.
- For each pair `(a, b)` in `colConditions`, integer `a` should appear before integer `b` in the column.

Determine if it's possible to build such a matrix. If it is possible, return the matrix, otherwise return an empty matrix.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the values in the rowConditions or colConditions be outside the range 1 to k?**
   - No, all values in `rowConditions` and `colConditions` are within the range from `1` to `k`.

2. **Can there be cycles in the conditions?**
   - No, the problem guarantees that the input will be such that there are no cyclic dependencies among the conditions.

3. **What is the size of `rowConditions` and `colConditions`?**
   - The size is not explicitly bounded, but we assume it's not excessively large compared to `k`.

### Strategy

1. **Topological Sorting**:
    - Use topological sorting to determine the order of elements as per the row and column conditions.
    - This can be achieved using Kahn's Algorithm (BFS based) or DFS to create the required ordering from the given conditions.

2. **Matrix Construction**:
    - Once the topological ordering for row and column elements are determined, use it to fill the `k x k` matrix.

### Code

Here is the solution implemented in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

// Function to perform topological sort
vector<int> topologicalSort(int n, const vector<pair<int, int>>& conditions) {
    vector<int> inDegree(n + 1, 0);
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;

    // Build the graph
    for (const auto& condition : conditions) {
        int u = condition.first;
        int v = condition.second;
        graph[u].push_back(v);
        ++inDegree[v];
    }

    // Initialize zero in-degree queue
    queue<int> zeroInDegreeQueue;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
            zeroInDegreeQueue.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Perform BFS
    vector<int> topOrder;
    while (!zeroInDegreeQueue.empty()) {
        int node = zeroInDegreeQueue.front();
        zeroInDegreeQueue.pop();
        topOrder.push_back(node);

        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            --inDegree[neighbor];
            if (inDegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                zeroInDegreeQueue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if topological sort is possible
    return (topOrder.size() == n) ? topOrder : vector<int>();
}

vector<vector<int>> buildMatrix(int k, vector<pair<int, int>>& rowConditions, vector<pair<int, int>>& colConditions) {
    // Perform topological sort for the rows and columns.
    vector<int> rowOrder = topologicalSort(k, rowConditions);
    vector<int> colOrder = topologicalSort(k, colConditions);

    if (rowOrder.empty() || colOrder.empty()) {
        return {}; // Topological sort failed, return an empty matrix
    }

    // Map the topological order to row and column indices
    unordered_map<int, int> rowIndex, colIndex;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        rowIndex[rowOrder[i]] = i;
        colIndex[colOrder[i]] = i;
    }

    // Build the matrix
    vector<vector<int>> matrix(k, vector<int>(k, 0));
    for (int num = 1; num <= k; ++num) {
        int r = rowIndex[num];
        int c = colIndex[num];
        matrix[r][c] = num;
    }

    return matrix;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is `O(k + e) + O(k + e)`, where `e` is the number of edges (i.e., conditions):
- Each topological sort process runs in `O(k + e)`, and since we perform it twice (once for rows and once for columns), the total cost becomes `O(2 * (k + e))`.
- Building the matrix itself takes `O(k^2)` time since we are filling a `k x k` matrix.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(k + e + k^2)`.
