[Leetcode 1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1857)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **directed graph** of **n** colored nodes and **m** edges. Each node is colored with one of the `26` different letters from `'a'` to `'z'`.

You need to determine the largest color value in any path in the graph. The color value of a path is the number of nodes in the path that are colored the same color. If the graph contains a cycle, return `-1`.

### Example:

**Input:**
- `colors = "abaca"`
- `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`

**Output:**
- `3`

**Explanation:**
- The path with the largest color value is `2 -> 3 -> 4`, and it's value is `3` because all three nodes are colored `a`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can colors have more than one character or any other character than 'a' to 'z'?**
   - No, colors are single characters ranging from 'a' to 'z'.

2. **Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   - Typically, in such problems, the edges are unique, but we assume duplicates are allowed unless stated otherwise. They can be preprocessed to remove duplicates.

3. **Is it possible for the graph to contain cycles?**
   - Yes, if the graph contains cycles, the function must return `-1` as specified.

4. **Should we consider disconnected nodes?**
   - Yes, all nodes and their colors should be considered, even if they are disconnected.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the directed graph.
   - Maintain an in-degree array to help detect cycles using Kahn's Algorithm.

2. **Topological Sorting (Kahn's Algorithm):**
   - To detect a cycle, perform topological sorting using Kahn's Algorithm.
   - If all nodes are not processed during topological sorting, it indicates the presence of a cycle.

3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use a DP table where `dp[node][color]` keeps track of the maximum count of the color in paths ending at `node`.

4. **Processing Nodes:**
   - Process nodes in topologically sorted order.
   - Update the `dp` table based on adjacency and the current color of the processing node.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int largestPathValue(string colors, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = colors.size();
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
        vector<int> in_degree(n, 0);

        // Building the graph and in-degree array
        for (const auto &edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            in_degree[edge[1]]++;
        }

        // Queue for Kahn's Algorithm (Topological Sort)
        queue<int> q;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(26, 0));
        
        // Push nodes with zero in-degree
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (in_degree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
                dp[i][colors[i] - 'a'] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        int processed = 0;
        int max_color_value = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            processed++;

            // Update max color value
            max_color_value = max(max_color_value, *max_element(dp[node].begin(), dp[node].end()));

            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                // Decrease in-degree of neighbor
                in_degree[neighbor]--;
                
                // Update the DP table
                for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
                    dp[neighbor][i] = max(dp[neighbor][i], dp[node][i] + (i == (colors[neighbor] - 'a')));
                }
                
                // Push zero in-degree neighbors to the queue
                if (in_degree[neighbor] == 0) q.push(neighbor);
            }
        }

        // If not all nodes processed, there is a cycle
        if (processed != n) return -1;
        
        return max_color_value;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building Graph and In-Degree Array:** `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of edges.
- **Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm):** `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges.
- **Updating DP Table:** `O(n * 26)`, for each node, we iterate over 26 possible colors.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * 26 + m)`, which simplifies to `O(n + m)` considering constant factors.
