[Leetcode 3181. Maximum Total Reward Using Operations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3181)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of positive integers `reward` where `reward[i]` represents the reward at index `i`. 
You are also given another array of positive integers `operation` where `operation[i]` represents the number of operations you can perform at index `i`.

You need to maximize the total reward by either skipping the reward[i] (taking zero) or performing an operation:

1. **Operation 0**: Pick the reward as is.
2. **Operation x**: Perform x operations on reward[i]. Each operation reduces the reward by half (integer division by 2).

Write a function `max_total_reward(reward, operation)` to maximize the total reward using the given operations. You need to return a single integer representing the maximum possible reward.

### Example:
```cpp
reward = [8, 15, 3, 7]
operation = [1, 3, 1, 2]

Output: 10
Explanation: 
- For reward[0], pick 8 (Operation 0)
- For reward[1], pick 15 (Operation 0)
- For reward[2], perform 1 operation to get 1 (Operation 1: 3 -> 1)
- For reward[3], perform 2 operations to get 1 (Operation 2: 7 -> 3 -> 1)
Total reward = 8 + 15 + 1 + 1 = 25
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the elements in the `reward` and `operation` arrays guaranteed to be non-negative?
2. Is there a limit on the size of the arrays?
3. Are we allowed to modify the given arrays or do we need to maintain the original input?

## Strategy
1. **Simulate Operations**: For each reward, we perform the allowed number of operations keeping track of the potential reductions and select the maximum reward we can retrieve.
2. **Selection**: Calculate the reward either by picking it straight or performing operations and compare to choose the best.
3. **Summation**: Sum up all the chosen rewards to get the maximum total reward.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int max_total_reward(vector<int>& reward, vector<int>& operation) {
    int total_reward = 0;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < reward.size(); ++i) {
        int current_reward = reward[i];
        int max_reward = current_reward;
        int operations_left = operation[i];
        
        // Perform operations as allowed by operation[i]
        for (int j = 0; j < operations_left; ++j) {
            current_reward /= 2;
            max_reward = max(max_reward, current_reward);
        }
        
        total_reward += max_reward;
    }
    
    return total_reward;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(N * logR)**: Where N is the number of elements in the reward array and R is the initial reward. This logR comes from the halvings done on each number.

---
This design assumes direct manipulations and checks each possible manipulation for reward[i] up to operation[i] times, ensuring we always get the maximum possible reward.
