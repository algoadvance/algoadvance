[Leetcode 2523. Closest Prime Numbers in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2523)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integers `left` and `right`, and you need to find the two prime numbers such that:
1. The two primes are in the inclusive range `[left, right]`.
2. If there are multiple pairs of primes, choose the pair with the smallest difference.
3. If no such pair of primes exists, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `left` and `right`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but usually, such problems will have constraints. E.g., for LeetCode problems, they usually specify ranges like [1, 10^6] or similar. We should assume reasonable constraints unless otherwise stated.

2. **How do we handle edge cases, such as when `left` and `right` are very small or very large?**
   - This aligns with the constraints, and we need a general approach that can handle large ranges efficiently.

3. **Is `left` always less than or equal to `right`?**
   - We should assume `left` <= `right` based on the problem statement.

### Strategy
1. **Generate Primes**:
   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to `right`. This will help us efficiently determine the primes within the range `[left, right]`.

2. **Filter Primes**:
   - Extract primes within the range `[left, right]` from the generated primes.

3. **Find Closest Pair**:
   - Linear scan the filtered primes to find the pair with the smallest difference.

### Pseudocode
1. Generate all primes up to `right` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
2. Collect the primes in the range `[left, right]`.
3. Iterate through the collected primes to find the smallest difference pair.
4. Return the pair with the smallest difference or `[-1, -1]` if no such pair exists.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <limits>

std::vector<int> closestPrimes(int left, int right) {
    // Use Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes up to right
    int maxN = right + 1;
    std::vector<bool> isPrime(maxN, true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= right; ++i) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= right; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Collect primes within the range [left, right]
    std::vector<int> primesInRange;
    for (int i = left; i <= right; ++i) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            primesInRange.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    // If there are fewer than 2 primes in the range, return [-1, -1]
    if (primesInRange.size() < 2) {
        return {-1, -1};
    }

    // Find the closest pair
    int bestDifference = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
    int prime1 = -1, prime2 = -1;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < primesInRange.size(); ++i) {
        int diff = primesInRange[i] - primesInRange[i - 1];
        if (diff < bestDifference) {
            bestDifference = diff;
            prime1 = primesInRange[i - 1];
            prime2 = primesInRange[i];
        }
    }
    return {prime1, prime2};
}

int main() {
    int left = 10;
    int right = 50;
    std::vector<int> result = closestPrimes(left, right);

    std::cout << "Closest primes in range [" << left << ", " << right << "] are: ";
    if (result[0] == -1) {
        std::cout << "No primes found" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << result[0] << " and " << result[1] << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: \(O(n \log \log n)\) where \(n\) is `right`.
- **Filtering primes within [left, right]**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements from `left` to `right`.
- **Finding the closest pair**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of primes within the specified range.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the Sieve of Eratosthenes, so it is \(O(n \log \log n)\).
