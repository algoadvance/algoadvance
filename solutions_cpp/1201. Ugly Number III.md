[Leetcode 1201. Ugly Number III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1201)
### Problem Statement

Given four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`, return the `n`-th ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive integers that are divisible by either `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`?**
   - Typically, constraints for LeetCode problems are provided, but for practical implementation, we should assume `1 <= a, b, c, n <= 2 * 10^9`.

2. **What should be returned if multiple numbers qualify for nth position?**
   - Even though it's rare due to distinct prime factors, the smallest number is generally considered.

3. **Can `a`, `b`, and `c` be the same?**
   - Generally yes, but since nth ugly number is defined, the principles remain consistent.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The main idea is to find the smallest number `x` such that there are at least `n` numbers less than or equal to `x` which are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

1. **Binary Search**: Use a binary search on the range to find the smallest number that meets the criteria.
2. **Counting Function**: Create a helper function to count the numbers less than or equal to `x` that are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.
3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: Efficiently leverage LCM to avoid double counting numbers when they are divisible by multiple values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

// Function to compute LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers
long long lcm(long long a, long long b) {
    return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
}

// Helper function to count the number of ugly numbers up to x
long long countUglyNumbers(long long x, long long a, long long b, long long c) {
    return x / a + x / b + x / c 
           - x / lcm(a, b) 
           - x / lcm(b, c) 
           - x / lcm(c, a) 
           + x / lcm(lcm(a, b), c);
}

int nthUglyNumber(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    long long low = 1, high = 2LL * 1e9;
    while (low < high) {
        long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (countUglyNumbers(mid, a, b, c) < n) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    return low;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5;
    cout << nthUglyNumber(n, a, b, c) << endl; // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The range of search is from `1` to `2 * 10^9`, thus requiring `O(log(max(a, b, c) * n))` iterations.
- **Count Function**: The counting calculation involves constant time O(1) operations.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(log(max(a, b, c) * n))`.

This solution is efficient considering the constraint limits and operates within a feasible time for large inputs.
