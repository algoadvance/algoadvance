[Leetcode 2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2203)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes of a weighted directed graph. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` denotes that there exists a directed edge from `from_i` to `to_i` with weight `weight_i`.

Additionally, you are given three distinct integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` denoting three distinct nodes of the graph.

Return the minimum weight of a subgraph that has all the nodes `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` such that there are exactly two edge-disjoint paths:

1. from `src1` to `dest` and
2. from `src2` to `dest`.

If such a subgraph does not exist, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Assumptions about negative weights**: Are there any negative weights in the graph? If yes, are negative cycles possible?
2. **Edge Disjoint**: Are edge disjoints paths only referring to paths not sharing the same edges or completely independent paths (not sharing nodes as well)?

## Strategy

**Objective**: Find the minimum weight of subgraph with exactly two edge-disjoint paths from `src1` to `dest` and `src2` to `dest`.

This problem can be approached using Dijkstra's algorithm (if weights are non-negative and we can assume no negative weights).

### Approach

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   
   - **From src1 to all nodes**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths from `src1` to all nodes.
   - **From src2 to all nodes**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths from `src2` to all nodes.
   - **From dest to all nodes**: Create a new graph reversing all edges and then use Dijkstra's algorithm from `dest` to all nodes in this new graph.

2. For each node `u`, compute the total cost:
   - The shortest path from `src1` to `u` +
   - The shortest path from `src2` to `u` +
   - The shortest path from `u` to `dest`.
   
3. Return the minimal value of this sum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

struct Edge {
    int to, weight;
};

void Dijkstra(const vector<vector<Edge>>& graph, int start, vector<long long>& dist) {
    int n = graph.size();
    dist.assign(n, LLONG_MAX);
    dist[start] = 0;
    
    priority_queue<pair<long long, int>, vector<pair<long long, int>>, greater<pair<long long, int>>> pq;
    pq.push({0, start});
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [d, u] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if (d > dist[u]) continue;
        
        for (auto& edge : graph[u]) {
            int v = edge.to;
            long long w = edge.weight;
            if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                pq.push({dist[v], v});
            }
        }
    }
}

long long minimumWeight(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int src1, int src2, int dest) {
    vector<vector<Edge>> graph(n), reverseGraph(n);
    
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int from = edge[0], to = edge[1], weight = edge[2];
        graph[from].push_back({to, weight});
        reverseGraph[to].push_back({from, weight});
    }
    
    vector<long long> dist1, dist2, distFromDest;
    
    Dijkstra(graph, src1, dist1);
    Dijkstra(graph, src2, dist2);
    Dijkstra(reverseGraph, dest, distFromDest);
    
    long long res = LLONG_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dist1[i] == LLONG_MAX || dist2[i] == LLONG_MAX || distFromDest[i] == LLONG_MAX) continue;
        res = min(res, dist1[i] + dist2[i] + distFromDest[i]);
    }
    
    return res == LLONG_MAX ? -1 : res;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    vector<vector<int>> edges = \{\{0, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 2}, {0, 3, 6}, {1, 4, 4}, {4, 3, 1}};
    int src1 = 0, src2 = 1, dest = 3;
    
    cout << minimumWeight(n, edges, src1, src2, dest) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: \(O((V + E) \log V)\) for each run.
- **Total**: Since Dijkstra is run three times, the total time complexity is \(O(3 \times (V + E) \log V)\), simplifying to \(O((V + E) \log V)\).

This solution ensures optimal paths are computed efficiently using Dijkstra's algorithm, making it suitable for graphs with non-negative weights.
