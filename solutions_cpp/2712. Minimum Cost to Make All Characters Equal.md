[Leetcode 2712. Minimum Cost to Make All Characters Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2712)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that consists of only two characters `'0'` and `'1'`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

1. Select a contiguous substring of `s` and remove it. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring.

The goal is to make all the characters in the string equal (all '0's or all '1's) at the minimum possible cost.

Return the minimum cost to make all characters in the string equal.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: s = "010101"
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to make the string equal is to remove all '1's. 
There are 3 '1's at positions (2, 4, 6), and removing them requires at least 4 operations.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the string be empty?
2. What is the maximum possible length of the string?
3. Should the function handle cases where the input string is already made up of equal characters?

## Strategy

1. **Observation:** 
   - The cost to make all characters the same can be derived by removing the smaller segment size (either all '0's or all '1's) from the string.
   - The cost to remove a segment of contiguous characters is its length.
   
2. **Steps:**
   - Count the number of '1's and '0's.
   - The result will be the length of the smaller group of contiguous segments of '0's or '1's.
   
3. **Algorithm:**
   - Traverse the string and maintain a counter for contiguous segments of '0's and '1's.
   - Return the minimum of these counters.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This includes a single pass to count segments.

Here is the code implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumCost(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int zero_segments = 0, one_segments = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n;) {
        char current_char = s[i];
        while (i < n && s[i] == current_char)
            i++;
        if (current_char == '0')
            zero_segments++;
        else
            one_segments++;
    }

    return std::min(zero_segments, one_segments);
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "010101";
    std::cout << "Minimum Cost: " << minimumCost(s) << std::endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

The provided code calculates the minimum cost to make all characters in the string `s` equal by counting contiguous segments of '0's and '1's and returning the smaller of these segment counts.
