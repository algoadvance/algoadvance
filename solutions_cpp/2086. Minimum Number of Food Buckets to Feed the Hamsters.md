[Leetcode 2086. Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2086)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `hamsters` where each character is either 'H' (representing a hamster) or '.' (representing an empty space). You need to place buckets of food in the empty spaces such that each hamster has access to at least one bucket. A hamster can access a bucket if it is adjacent to it (either to its left or right). If it is impossible to feed all the hamsters, return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum number of buckets required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can buckets be placed anywhere?**
   Yes, buckets can only be placed on empty spaces ('.').

2. **Does a hamster need more than one bucket?**
   No, each hamster only needs access to at least one bucket.

3. **Can multiple hamsters share the same bucket?**
   Yes, as long as they are adjacent to the bucket.

### Strategy

1. **Greedy Placement**:
   - Iterate through the string and try placing buckets in a greedy fashion.
   - Prioritize placing a bucket in a way that maximizes its utility (i.e., more hamsters can access the same bucket).

2. **Traversing and Decision Making**:
   - Start from the left and traverse right.
   - When a hamster ('H') is found:
     - Check if it already has access to a bucket from the left.
     - If not, place a bucket to its right if possible.
     - If placing a bucket to the right is also not possible (because it's already taken by another hamster), then itâ€™s impossible to feed all hamsters, return -1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Multiple consecutive hamsters with no empty spaces in between.
   - Hamsters at the edges of the string.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int minBuckets(string hamsters) {
    int n = hamsters.size();
    int bucketCount = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (hamsters[i] == 'H') {
            // Check left
            if (i > 0 && hamsters[i - 1] == 'B') {
                continue;
            }
            // Check right and place bucket if possible
            if (i < n - 1 && hamsters[i + 1] == '.') {
                hamsters[i + 1] = 'B';
                bucketCount++;
            } else if (i > 0 && hamsters[i - 1] == '.') {
                hamsters[i - 1] = 'B';
                bucketCount++;
            } else {
                return -1; // Not possible to place a bucket
            }
        }
    }
    return bucketCount;
}

int main() {
    string hamsters = ".H.H..H.";
    cout << minBuckets(hamsters) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)** traversal of the string, where \( n \) is the length of the input string `hamsters`.
- Each operation within the traversal (placement check and placement) is O(1).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with zero buckets.
2. **Traverse the string**: For each hamster ('H'), check if it already has access to a bucket from its left.
3. **Place Buckets**: If it doesn't, place a bucket to its right if possible, else place it to its left.
4. **Edge Cases**: If no appropriate empty spaces are found while required, return -1.

This approach ensures every hamster has access to at least one bucket in an optimal manner by placing buckets in the most effective empty spots.
