[Leetcode 397. Integer Replacement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l397)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, you can perform the following operations:
1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n / 2`.
2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

Your task is to return the minimum number of replacements needed for `n` to become 1.

For example:
- Input: `n = 8`
- Output: `3`
  - Explanation: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

- Input: `n = 7`
- Output: `4`
  - Explanation: 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
  - or: 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

- Input: `n = 4`
- Output: `2`
  - Explanation: 4 -> 2 -> 1

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be very large?** 
   - Yes, `n` can be as large as 2^31 - 1.

2. **Should the solution minimize memory usage or is there a specific time constraint?**
   - Typically, solutions should balance time and space complexity, but time complexity will be our primary focus.

## Strategy

1. Use a recursive approach with memoization to minimize recomputation.
2. If `n` is even, the problem reduces to `integerReplacement(n / 2) + 1`.
3. If `n` is odd, the problem has two subcases:
   - Replace `n` with `n + 1` and solve for `n + 1`
   - Replace `n` with `n - 1` and solve for `n - 1`
4. Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
5. Recursion should be optimal given the constraints.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity primarily depends on the depth of the recursion tree. 
- Since each step approximately halves the number, the depth of the tree is \(O(\log n)\).
- Memoization ensures each subproblem is solved only once, making the overall time complexity \(O(\log n)\).

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    int integerReplacement(int n) {
        return helper(n);
    }
    
private:
    std::unordered_map<long long, int> memo;
    
    int helper(long long n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        if (memo.find(n) != memo.end()) return memo[n];
        
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            memo[n] = 1 + helper(n / 2);
        } else {
            memo[n] = 1 + std::min(helper(n + 1), helper(n - 1));
        }
        
        return memo[n];
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case:** If `n` is 1, the function returns 0 since no operations are needed.
2. **Memoization:** A map `memo` is used to store previously computed results for subproblems.
3. **Even `n`:** If `n` is even, the function recursively solves for `n/2` and adds 1 to account for the operation.
4. **Odd `n`:** If `n` is odd, it solves both `n+1` and `n-1` cases recursively, taking the minimum of the two results and adds 1 to account for the operation.
5. **Recursive Function:** Uses a private helper function that performs the recursion and memoization.

This code efficiently computes the minimum number of replacements for any given `n`, leveraging memoization to ensure optimal performance.
