[Leetcode 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1663)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integers `n` and `k`. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to `n` and numeric value equal to `k`.

The numeric value of a string is defined as the sum of its characters, where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, 'c' = 3, ..., 'z' = 26, and the lexicographically smallest string is the string that appears first in a dictionary.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on `n` and `k`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 100000`
   - `n <= k <= 26 * n`

2. **What should the function return if it's not possible to form such a string given `n` and `k`?**
   - It is always possible to form such a string given the constraints, so no need to handle impossible cases.

### Strategy
1. **Start with 'a'**:
   - The smallest possible lexicographical character is 'a'. To ensure the smallest lexicographical string, we start with a string filled with 'a'.
   - Initialize a string `result` of length `n` filled with 'a' (`result = std::string(n, 'a')`).
   
2. **Calculate remainder**: 
   - Calculate how much value is still required after filling with 'a'. Initial total value is `n` (each 'a' contributes 1).
   - Remaining value required: `remainingValue = k - n`.

3. **Adjust characters from right to left**:
   - To keep it lexicographically smallest:
     - Start from the rightmost position and move leftward.
     - For each position, determine the maximum character that can be used.
     - Convert as many 'a' to 'z' as possible without exceeding the required numeric value.
   - For a position `i` from the last to the first:
     - Calculate the increment needed for that position without exceeding bounds `remainingValue`:
       - Add `increment = min(25, remainingValue)` to the current character.

4. **Convert to character**:
   - Update character at position `i` using: `result[i] = 'a' + increment`.

5. **Update remaining value**:
   - Decrement `remainingValue` by the value of increment added.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the initial string takes `O(n)`.
- Adjusting the string, working from the rightmost character to the leftmost character, also takes `O(n)`.
- Overall time complexity: `O(n)`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
    // Step 1: Create a string of length n filled with 'a'
    std::string result(n, 'a');
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the remaining value needed
    int remainingValue = k - n;
    
    // Step 3: Adjust characters from the end to the start
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && remainingValue > 0; --i) {
        // Increment needed for current position, ensuring it doesn't exceed bounds.
        int increment = std::min(25, remainingValue);
        result[i] += increment;
        remainingValue -= increment;  // Update the remaining value
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization**: Start with a string of 'a's which contributes the lowest value.
- **Remainder calculation**: Calculate how much more value is needed to reach `k`.
- **Character adjustment**: Go from the end of the string to the start, adjusting each character to contribute the maximum possible value without making the string lexicographically larger than necessary.
- **Return the result**.

This approach ensures that we get the lexicographically smallest string with the required numeric value efficiently.
