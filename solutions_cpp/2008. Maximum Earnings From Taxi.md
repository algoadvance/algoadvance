[Leetcode 2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2008)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `rides` where each `rides[i]` is a triplet: `[start_i, end_i, tip_i]`. `start_i` represents the start point, `end_i` represents the end point, and `tip_i` represents the tip associated with that ride. We need to select a subset of non-overlapping rides which maximizes earnings. Earnings for a ride from `start_i` to `end_i` are calculated as `end_i - start_i + tip_i`.

We need to return the maximum earnings from the selected rides.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Sorting Criteria**: Are the rides sorted in any specific order?
   - **Answer**: Assume rides are given in arbitrary order.
  
2. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the values of `start_i`, `end_i`, and `tip_i`?
   - **Answer**: Generally, we assume that:
     - `1 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6`
     - `0 <= tip_i <= 10^6`

3. **Ride End**: Is the end point inclusive or exclusive?
   - **Answer**: The end point is inclusive.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, an efficient approach is required as a brute force method would be computationally expensive. We can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Sort the Rides**: First, sort the rides based on the ending point `end_i` since, for any optimal solution, we need to complete earlier rides first.
2. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: Use a combination of dynamic programming (DP) and binary search:
   - Define `dp[i]` to be the maximum earnings considering all rides up to the i-th ride (sorted by `end_i`).
   - For each ride, we can decide:
     - Either take this ride and add its earnings to the maximum earnings of the last non-conflicting ride (found via binary search).
     - Or skip this ride and carry forward the earnings without this ride.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Ride {
    int start;
    int end;
    int tip;
    int earning;
};

int maxTaxiEarnings(int n, vector<vector<int>>& rides) {
    vector<Ride> rideList;
    for (auto& ride : rides) {
        rideList.push_back({ride[0], ride[1], ride[2], ride[1] - ride[0] + ride[2]});
    }
    
    // Sort rides by end time
    sort(rideList.begin(), rideList.end(), [](const Ride& a, const Ride& b) {
        return a.end < b.end;
    });

    // Dynamic programming array
    vector<long long> dp(rideList.size(), 0);
    
    dp[0] = rideList[0].earning;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < rideList.size(); ++i) {
        // Include current ride earnings
        long long include = rideList[i].earning;
        
        // Find the last non-conflicting ride using binary search
        int low = 0, high = i - 1, lastNonConflict = -1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (rideList[mid].end <= rideList[i].start) {
                lastNonConflict = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        if (lastNonConflict != -1) {
            include += dp[lastNonConflict];
        }
        
        // Maximize earnings
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], include);
    }
    
    return dp.back();
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of rides.
- **Dynamic Programming and Binary Search**: For each ride, binary search takes `O(log m)` and there are `m` rides, yielding a total of `O(m log m)`.
- **Total Complexity**: `O(m log m)`.

This solution efficiently handles the problem using sorting and dynamic programming with binary search to ensure that we maximize the earnings while considering only non-overlapping rides.
