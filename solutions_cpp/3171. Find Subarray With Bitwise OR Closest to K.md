[Leetcode 3171. Find Subarray With Bitwise OR Closest to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3171)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `arr` and an integer `K`. Your task is to find the subarray (contiguously contiguous part of the array) whose bitwise OR is closest to `K`. If there are multiple such subarrays, return the one with the smallest starting index. If there are still multiple candidates, return the smallest in length.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: 
   - What are the constraints on the size of the array?
   - What is the range of the values within the array?
  
2. **Definition of Closeness**: 
   - How do we define "closest" when it comes to the bitwise OR? Is it the smallest absolute difference between the OR and `K`?

3. **Output**:
   - Should we return the subarray itself, or the indices of this subarray?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the closest OR value to `K`, the smallest difference, and the starting and ending indices of the best subarray found so far.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Considering all possible subarrays would typically involve a nested loop, but due to the nature of bitwise OR, which tends to build up as we stretch the subarray, we can use this property to our advantage.
   - Iterate over all possible subarrays and compute their bitwise OR. For every subarray, calculate the absolute difference between the OR and `K`.

3. **Update the Result**:
   - Keep track of the smallest difference and update the starting and ending indices if a closer OR value is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Include cases where the array has one element, or all elements are high compared to `K`.

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm involves examining every possible subarray and calculating the OR, leading to a time complexity of approximately `O(n^2)`. However, optimizations are possible using bit properties.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits.h>
#include <cmath>

std::vector<int> findSubarrayWithORClosestToK(const std::vector<int>& arr, int K) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int closestDiff = INT_MAX; // To store the minimum difference
    int closestOR = 0;
    int bestStart = 0, bestEnd = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int currentOR = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            currentOR |= arr[j];
            int currentDiff = std::abs(currentOR - K);
            if (currentDiff < closestDiff || 
                (currentDiff == closestDiff && (j - i < bestEnd - bestStart || (j - i == bestEnd - bestStart && i < bestStart)))) {
                closestDiff = currentDiff;
                closestOR = currentOR;
                bestStart = i;
                bestEnd = j;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return std::vector<int>(arr.begin() + bestStart, arr.begin() + bestEnd + 1);
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int K = 7;
    std::vector<int> result = findSubarrayWithORClosestToK(arr, K);

    std::cout << "Subarray closest to OR = " << K << ": [";
    for (int num : result) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "]" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we brute force over every subarray, calculating their OR and comparing it to `K`. This is not the most optimized solution, but it ensures correctness. With further analysis and understanding of bitwise operations, it can possibly be optimized.
