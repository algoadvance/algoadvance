[Leetcode 2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2210)
Sure, let's break this down step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. An index `i` is part of a hill or a valley if the surroundings fulfill the following conditions:
- `nums[i]` is a part of a hill if `nums[i-1] < nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.
- `nums[i]` is a part of a valley if `nums[i-1] > nums[i] < nums[i+1]`.

Count the number of hills and valleys in the given array `nums`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 hills or valleys, they are 4, 1, and 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What is the minimum and maximum length of `nums`?
   **A**: The minimum length of `nums` is 3, and there is no explicit limit but generally follows the typical constraints of competitive programming problems (e.g., up to \(10^5\)).

2. **Q**: Can there be consecutive equal numbers?
   **A**: Yes, consecutive equal numbers are allowed, but they cannot form hills or valleys directly.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll iterate over the array `nums` and check each element (except the first and last element) to see if it forms a hill or a valley. We'll handle consecutive equal numbers carefully to avoid false counts.

1. We'll iterate through the array from the second element to the second-last element.
2. For each element `nums[i]`, we check its neighbors `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i+1]`.
3. We'll skip checking when neighboring elements are equal to ensure no false positives.
4. Count the number of elements satisfying the hill or valley conditions.

### Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countHillValley(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if ((nums[i-1] < nums[i] && nums[i] > nums[i+1]) || (nums[i-1] > nums[i] && nums[i] < nums[i+1])) {
                ++count;
            }
            // Skip the same elements to avoid double-counting
            while (i < nums.size() - 1 && nums[i] == nums[i+1]) {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of hills and valleys in the array with a single traversal, adhering to the constraints and handling edge cases like consecutive equal elements appropriately.
