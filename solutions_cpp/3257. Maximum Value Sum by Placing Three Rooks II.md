[Leetcode 3257. Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3257)
### Problem Statement
You are given a `n x n` chessboard (`matrix`) filled with integers, which can be positive, zero, or negative. Your task is to place three rooks on this board such that no two rooks can attack each other, meaning no two rooks can share the same row or column. The goal is to maximize the sum of the values on the cells where the rooks are placed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of `n` (the size of the chessboard)?
    - Can the values in the matrix be negative?
  
2. **Output:**
    - Should we return the maximum sum of the values where the rooks are placed?

Assuming typical constraints for competitive programming:
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- The values in the matrix can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

### Strategy
1. **Understand the Board and Constraints:**
    - You need to place three rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks are in the same row or column.

2. **Brute Force Combination:**
    - Pick three different rows and three different columns.
    - Calculate the sum of placing rooks in these selected positions.
    - Ensure that the chosen positions do not have any overlap in rows/columns.

3. **Optimization Considerations:**
    - Given `n` can be up to 50, the number of combinations of rows and columns taken 3 at a time will be feasible to compute exhaustively since it results in `C(50, 3) = 19600` which is manageable.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int maximumValueSumByPlacingRooks(const vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    int n = matrix.size();
    int maxSum = INT_MIN;
    
    // Try every combination of 3 different rows
    for (int r1 = 0; r1 < n; ++r1) {
        for (int r2 = r1 + 1; r2 < n; ++r2) {
            for (int r3 = r2 + 1; r3 < n; ++r3) {
                // Try every combination of 3 different columns
                for (int c1 = 0; c1 < n; ++c1) {
                    for (int c2 = c1 + 1; c2 < n; ++c2) {
                        for (int c3 = c2 + 1; c3 < n; ++c3) {
                            int currentSum = matrix[r1][c1] + matrix[r2][c2] + matrix[r3][c3];
                            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> matrix = {
        {5, 6, -1},
        {3, -2, 4},
        {1, 1, 1}
    };
  
    cout << "Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks: " << maximumValueSumByPlacingRooks(matrix) << endl;
  
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity can be analyzed as follows:
- **Combination of Rows:** \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \)
- **Combination of Columns:** \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \)

Operating within the nested loops, the total number of iterations is:
\[ \mathcal{O}(n^6) \]

However, note that \( \binom{n}{3} \) grows polynomially, so for `n = 50`, it's still within feasible limits of brute-force processing within a reasonable time for competitive programming solutions.

### Conclusion
This approach tries all possible combinations of positions for the three rooks. It ensures that no two rooks attack each other and finds the maximum possible sum efficiently given the problem constraints.
