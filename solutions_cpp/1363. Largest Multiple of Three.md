[Leetcode 1363. Largest Multiple of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1363)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of digits, return the largest multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in any order. If there is no such number, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array contain digits that are zero?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can include zero but the resulting number should not start with zero unless the number is zero itself.

2. **Q:** What is the expected range of the array length?
   - **A:** The length of the array can range from 1 to 10^4.

3. **Q:** Should the resultant number be represented as a string?
   - **A:** Yes, the result should be returned as a string.

4. **Q:** If there are multiple solutions, should we return the lexicographically largest one?
   - **A:** Yes, we should return the largest possible number which ensures lexicographical largeness.

### Strategy

To form the largest multiple of three, follow these steps:

1. **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the sum of all digits.
2. **Check Sum Divisibility:** Check if the sum is already a multiple of 3.
3. **Modular Arithmetic Adjustments:**
    - If `sum % 3 == 1`:
        - Remove one smallest digit with `remainder == 1` if it exists, else remove two smallest digits with `remainder == 2`.
    - If `sum % 3 == 2`:
        - Remove one smallest digit with `remainder == 2` if it exists, else remove two smallest digits with `remainder == 1`.
4. **Edge Cases:** Consider cases where removing digits might lead to an empty set or leading zeros.
5. **Sort in Descending Order:** After necessary removals, sort the array in descending order to get the largest possible number.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity should be approximately \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting of digits and handling adjustments.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::string largestMultipleOfThree(std::vector<int>& digits) {
    std::vector<int> count(10, 0);  // Digit count from 0 to 9
    int sum = 0;
    
    for (int digit : digits) {
        count[digit]++;
        sum += digit;
    }
    
    auto remove_one = [&](int remainder) {
        for (int i = remainder; i < 10; i += 3) {
            if (count[i] > 0) {
                count[i]--;
                sum -= i;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    };
    
    auto remove_two = [&](int remainder) {
        int remove_count = 0;
        for (int i = remainder; i < 10; i += 3) {
            while (count[i] > 0 && remove_count < 2) {
                count[i]--;
                sum -= i;
                remove_count++;
            }
            if (remove_count == 2) return true;
        }
        return false;
    };
    
    if (sum % 3 == 1) {
        if (!remove_one(1)) {
            remove_two(2);
        }
    } else if (sum % 3 == 2) {
        if (!remove_one(2)) {
            remove_two(1);
        }
    }
    
    if (sum == 0) {
        return count[0] > 0 ? "0" : "";
    }
    
    std::string result;
    for (int i = 9; i >= 0; --i) {
        result.append(count[i], '0' + i);
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> digits = {8, 1, 9};
    std::string result = largestMultipleOfThree(digits);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;  // Output: "981"
    return 0;
}
```

This code first counts the occurrences of each digit and calculates their sum. Depending on the remainder when the sum is divided by 3, it deletes the smallest feasible digits to make the sum a multiple of 3. Finally, it constructs the largest possible number by arranging the digits in descending order.
