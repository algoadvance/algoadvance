[Leetcode 1959. Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1959)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` that represents the sizes of memory blocks you need. You need to Resize Memory a total of `k` times. The initial size is zero. And for each memory resize, the size will increase to `max(size of current block, the new block size)`.

Write a function to calculate the minimum wasted memory space after performing `k` resizing operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and `k`?**
   - The array `nums` will have a length between 1 and 1000.
   - Each element of `nums` will be between 1 and 10^6.
   - `k` will be between 0 and `nums.length - 1`.

2. **What is considered as wasted space?**
   - Wasted space is the difference between the allocated memory and the memory actually used.

3. **Is the value of `k` fixed or can it vary?**
   - `k` is fixed as per the problem statement.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. Here are the key points of our strategy:
   - Use a 2D array `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the end index of the subarray and `j` is the number of resizes used.
   - Base Case: If no resizing operations are used (`j == 0`), the wasted space is the difference between the total memory allocated (maximum of the subarray) and the sum of the subarray.
   - Transition: If we use `j` resizes and we know the minimum wasted space for a subarray ending at `i` with `j-1` resizes, we can extend the subarray by considering each position as possible starting points for the next partition.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2 * k), where n is the length of the array `nums` and `k` is the number of allowed resizing operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k) for storing the DP table.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int minSpaceWastedKResizing(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 2, INT_MAX));
    dp[0][0] = 0; // Base case

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= k + 1; ++j) {
            int max_size = 0;
            int total_size = 0;
            for (int l = i; l > 0; --l) {
                max_size = max(max_size, nums[l-1]);
                total_size += nums[l-1];
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[l-1][j-1] + max_size * (i - l + 1) - total_size);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k + 1];
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {10, 20, 30};
    int k = 1;
    cout << "Minimum space wasted with " << k << " resizing operations: " << minSpaceWastedKResizing(nums, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **DP Initialization**: We initialize a DP table of size `(n+1) x (k+2)` to store the minimum wasted space.
2. **Base Case**: `dp[0][0] = 0`, since if no memory blocks are allocated, no space is wasted.
3. **DP Filling**: For each position `i` in the array, and for each possible number of resizes `j`, we calculate the minimum wasted space by considering all subarrays ending at `i`.
4. **Result**: The answer will be in `dp[n][k+1]`.

Through this approach, the code dynamically computes the minimum wasted space efficiently using the constraints provided.
