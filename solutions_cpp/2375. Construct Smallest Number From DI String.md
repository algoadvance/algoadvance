[Leetcode 2375. Construct Smallest Number From DI String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2375)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `pattern` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. 'I' means increasing and 'D' means decreasing. You need to construct the lexicographically smallest permutation of the numbers `[1, 2, ..., n + 1]` that satisfies the given pattern.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `pattern` string?
     - The `pattern` string can be up to 10^5 characters long.

2. **Output:**
   - Do we return the permutation as a string or as an array of integers?
     - The permutation should be returned as a string.

3. **Pattern Validity:**
   - Will the pattern always be valid (only consist of 'I' and 'D' characters)?
     - Yes, the pattern will only consist of 'I' and 'D'.

## Strategy
To construct the smallest lexicographical permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n + 1]` that matches the pattern, we can use a stack-based approach:

1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty stack and an empty result string.
2. **Traversing the Pattern:**
   - Iterate through each character of the pattern.
   - Push the current number (`i + 1`) onto the stack.
   - When we hit an 'I' (or the end of the pattern), pop all elements from the stack and add them to the result.
3. **Completion:**
   - At the end of the traversal, there will be one last number to push onto the stack and subsequently pop to complete the result.

This ensures that we construct the smallest lexicographical permutation while maintaining the required ordering as per the pattern.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <string>

std::string smallestNumber(std::string pattern) {
    int n = pattern.length();
    std::stack<int> st;
    std::string result;

    // Push initial value and process the pattern
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
        st.push(i + 1);

        // On 'I' or end of pattern, pop all elements from the stack
        if (i == n || pattern[i] == 'I') {
            while (!st.empty()) {
                result += std::to_string(st.top());
                st.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string pattern = "IDID";
    std::cout << "Result: " << smallestNumber(pattern) << std::endl; // Expected output: "13254"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `pattern`. This is because each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once, and constructing the result string involves appending characters sequentially. 

Space complexity is **O(n)** mainly due to the stack storage used in the process.
