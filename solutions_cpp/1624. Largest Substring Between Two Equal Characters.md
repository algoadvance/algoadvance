[Leetcode 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1624)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, exclusive of the two characters. If there is no such substring, return `-1`.

### Example
1. Input: `s = "aa"`
   Output: `0`
   Explanation: The only substring between the two 'a's is an empty string.
   
2. Input: `s = "abca"`
   Output: `2`
   Explanation: The substring between the two 'a's is "bc".
   
3. Input: `s = "cbzxy"`
   Output: `-1`
   Explanation: There are no two identical characters, hence no valid substring exists.

4. Input: `s = "cabbac"`
   Output: `4`
   Explanation: The substring between the two 'c's is "abba".

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all characters in `s` lowercase English letters?
2. Is there a length constraint on the input string `s`?

## Strategy
1. **Initialize a map** to store the first occurrence index of each character.
2. Traverse the string `s` and for each character, do the following:
    - Check if the character is already in the map:
        - **If yes**: Calculate the length of the substring between the current position and the stored index of the first occurrence of the character.
        - **Update the maximum length** if the calculated length is greater than the current maximum length.
        - Do not update the map since we are interested in the first and last occurrence.
    - **If no**: Store the index of the character in the map.
3. Finally, return the maximum length or `-1` if no valid substring is found.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(string s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> firstIndex;
    int maxLength = -1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (firstIndex.find(s[i]) != firstIndex.end()) {
            int currentLength = i - firstIndex[s[i]] - 1;
            maxLength = max(maxLength, currentLength);
        } else {
            firstIndex[s[i]] = i;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

// Sample usage
int main() {
    string s = "cabbac";
    cout << maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(s) << endl;  // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we only traverse the string once, and each operation inside the loop (hash map operations) can be done in constant time on average.
