[Leetcode 3219. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3219)
## Problem Statement

You're given a rectangular cake of dimensions h x w and two arrays horizontalCuts and verticalCuts where horizontalCuts[i] denotes the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut and verticalCuts[j] denotes the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the jth vertical cut.

Return the minimum cost to cut the cake into pieces such that the sum of the max horizontal piece length and the max vertical piece length is minimized.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the order of elements in horizontalCuts and verticalCuts relevant?**
   - No, the order is not relevant; you may assume the cuts can be applied in any order.

2. **What are the constraints on dimensions h and w and the lengths of horizontalCuts and verticalCuts?**
   - These constraints help us understand the problem's complexity:
     - `1 <= h, w <= 10^9`
     - `1 <= horizontalCuts.length, verticalCuts.length <= min(h, w)`
     - `1 <= horizontalCuts[i] <= h-1`
     - `1 <= verticalCuts[j] <= w-1`

3. **Are duplicate values allowed in horizontalCuts and verticalCuts?**
   - No, since each cut represents a unique position, duplicate values aren't allowed.

4. **What is the range for minimum and maximum integer value in the context of this problem?**
   - `INT_MAX` to represent the upper bounds in cost.

## Strategy

The key to solving this problem is to find the maximum segments in the horizontal and vertical directions, created by the cuts. The goal is to minimize the sum of these maximum segments.

To achieve this, we can:
1. Sort the `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`.
2. Compute the maximum difference between consecutive horizontal cuts and between consecutive vertical cuts, including the edges of the cake.
3. Sum these maximum values to get the desired minimum cost.

Steps:
1. Sort `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`.
2. Calculate the maximum gap between two adjacent cuts and also consider the edge space (0-to-first cut and last cut-to-edge).
3. Return the sum of the maximum horizontal and vertical gaps.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int minCostForCuttingCake(int h, int w, std::vector<int>& horizontalCuts, std::vector<int>& verticalCuts) {
    // Sort the horizontal and vertical cuts
    std::sort(horizontalCuts.begin(), horizontalCuts.end());
    std::sort(verticalCuts.begin(), verticalCuts.end());
    
    // Find the maximum distance between two horizontal cuts
    int maxHorDist = horizontalCuts[0]; // from the edge to the first cut
    for (int i = 1; i < horizontalCuts.size(); ++i) {
        maxHorDist = std::max(maxHorDist, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i-1]);
    }
    // Consider the distance from the last cut to the bottom edge
    maxHorDist = std::max(maxHorDist, h - horizontalCuts.back());

    // Find the maximum distance between two vertical cuts
    int maxVerDist = verticalCuts[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < verticalCuts.size(); ++i) {
        maxVerDist = std::max(maxVerDist, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i-1]);
    }
    // Consider the distance from the last cut to the right edge
    maxVerDist = std::max(maxVerDist, w - verticalCuts.back());

    // The minimum cost is the sum of the maximum distances found
    return maxHorDist + maxVerDist;
}

int main() {
    int h = 5, w = 4;
    std::vector<int> horizontalCuts = {1, 2, 4};
    std::vector<int> verticalCuts = {1, 3};
    std::cout << "Minimum cost to cut the cake: " << minCostForCuttingCake(h, w, horizontalCuts, verticalCuts) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` will take O(n log n) where `n` is the length of the list of cuts.
- Finding the maximum difference will take O(n) time since it requires a single pass over the sorted list.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the longer list between `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`.
