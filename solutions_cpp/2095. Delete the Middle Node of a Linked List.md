[Leetcode 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2095)
## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, delete the middle node and return the `head` of the modified list. The middle node is the node that is exactly in the middle of the list when it's counted. If the list has an even number of nodes, there will be two middle nodes, and we delete the second middle node.

For instance:
- Input: `head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]`
- Output: `[1,3,4,1,2,6]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the definition of the middle node when the linked list has an even number of elements?
   **A:** When the list has an even number of nodes, we consider the second middle node (one-indexed).
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned when the list has only one node?
   **A:** If the list has only one node, deleting that node would result in an empty list, so we return `nullptr`.

3. **Q:** Can the input list be empty?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that there is at least one node in the list.

## Strategy

1. Use the two-pointer technique to find the middle node. We employ two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `fast` pointer will move at twice the speed of `slow`. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle.
2. To delete the middle node, we need to keep track of the node just before the middle node. This can be done by maintaining a `prev` pointer that follows the `slow` pointer.
3. Adjust the `next` pointer of the `prev` node to skip the middle node.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* deleteMiddle(ListNode* head) {
        // Edge case: If there's only one node, return nullptr
        if (!head || !head->next) {
            return nullptr;
        }

        ListNode *slow = head;
        ListNode *fast = head;
        ListNode *prev = nullptr;

        // Move `fast` at twice the speed of `slow`
        while (fast && fast->next) {
            fast = fast->next->next;
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow->next;
        }

        // Delete the middle node
        prev->next = slow->next;
        delete slow;

        return head;
    }
};

// Helper function to print the list
void printList(ListNode* node) {
    while (node != nullptr) {
        std::cout << node->val << " ";
        node = node->next;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Helper function to create a list from an array
ListNode* createList(const std::vector<int>& vals) {
    if (vals.empty()) return nullptr;
    ListNode* head = new ListNode(vals[0]);
    ListNode* current = head;
    for (size_t i = 1; i < vals.size(); ++i) {
        current->next = new ListNode(vals[i]);
        current = current->next;
    }
    return head;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> vals = {1, 3, 4, 7, 1, 2, 6};
    ListNode* head = createList(vals);
    
    Solution sol;
    ListNode* modifiedHead = sol.deleteMiddle(head);
    
    printList(modifiedHead);
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list twice, once with the `fast` and `slow` pointers and then while updating the pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.
