[Leetcode 1922. Count Good Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1922)
### Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer `n`. Determine the number of "good" digit strings of length `n`.

A string is considered "good" if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. At every even index, the digit is one of the prime digits (2, 3, 5, 7).
2. At every odd index, the digit is one of the even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).

Return the number of good digit strings of length `n` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`?
     - `0 <= n <= 10^15`.

2. **Output Constraints**:
   - Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Clarifications**:
   - Indexing is zero-based.

### Strategy

1. **Prime and Even Digit Rules**:
   - For indexes 0, 2, 4, ..., (even indexes): The digits can be one of (2, 3, 5, 7). Hence, we have 4 choices.
   - For indexes 1, 3, 5, ..., (odd indexes): The digits can be one of (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Hence, we have 5 choices.

2. **Total Good Numbers Calculation**:
   - Let `k` be the number of even indexes: `k = (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Let `m` be the number of odd indexes: `m = n // 2`.
   - The total number of good digit strings of length `n` will be calculated as `4^k * 5^m % (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Modular Exponentiation**:
   - We need efficient modular exponentiation due to the constraints (`n` can be as large as `10^15`).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// Constants
const long long MOD = 1000000007;

// Function for modular exponentiation
long long mod_exp(long long base, long long exp, long long mod) {
    long long result = 1;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2 == 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        base = (base * base) % mod;
        exp /= 2;
    }
    return result;
}

int countGoodNumbers(long long n) {
    long long exponentEven = (n + 1) / 2;
    long long exponentOdd = n / 2;
    
    long long part1 = mod_exp(4, exponentEven, MOD);
    long long part2 = mod_exp(5, exponentOdd, MOD);
    
    return (part1 * part2) % MOD;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    long long n = 50;
    std::cout << countGoodNumbers(n) << std::endl; // Output the count of good numbers for the given n
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The modular exponentiation function `mod_exp` runs in `O(log exp)`, where `exp` is the exponent.
   - Since the maximum exponent can be `10^15`, the time complexity for each exponentiation is `O(log(10^15))` = `O(50)`.
- Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(50 + 50) = O(1)` in practice due to the constant-time operations under logarithmic constraints.
