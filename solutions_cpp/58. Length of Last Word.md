[Leetcode 58. Length of Last Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l58)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal sub-string consisting of non-space characters only.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be returned if the string is empty or contains only spaces?
   **A:** For an empty string or a string with only spaces, the expected output should be `0` since there are no words.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the input string length?
   **A:** Usually, strings in such problems can be reasonably assumed to be within typical constraints, like up to \(10^4\) characters.

### Strategy

1. **Trim Trailing Spaces:** We need to discard any trailing spaces at the end of the string to correctly identify the last word.
2. **Find the Last Word:** 
   - Start from the end of the trimmed string and move backwards to find the beginning of the last word.
   - Count the length as we find the characters of the last word.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm> // for std::find_if

int lengthOfLastWord(const std::string &s) {
    int length = 0;
    int i = s.size() - 1;

    // Skip trailing spaces
    while (i >= 0 && s[i] == ' ') --i;

    // Count length of last word
    while (i >= 0 && s[i] != ' ') {
        --i;
        ++length;
    }
    
    return length;
}

int main() {
    std::string test1 = "Hello World";
    std::string test2 = "   fly me   to   the moon  ";
    std::string test3 = "luffy is still joyboy";
    std::string test4 = "       ";

    std::cout << lengthOfLastWord(test1) << std::endl; // Output: 5
    std::cout << lengthOfLastWord(test2) << std::endl; // Output: 4
    std::cout << lengthOfLastWord(test3) << std::endl; // Output: 6
    std::cout << lengthOfLastWord(test4) << std::endl; // Output: 0

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because, in the worst case, we may need to traverse the entire string to skip leading spaces and count the length of the last word.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we only use a few extra variables for counting and indexing.
