[Leetcode 264. Ugly Number II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l264)
### Problem Statement
Write a program to find the `nth` ugly number.

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input**: What is the range of `n`? 
   - The input `n` is a positive integer and can be as large as `1690`.
2. **Output**: Should we return the `nth` ugly number as an integer?
   - Yes, return the `nth` ugly number.

### Strategy
To find the `nth` ugly number, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with a min-heap (priority queue). 

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize a minimum heap and insert the first ugly number `1` along with its multiples by `2`, `3`, and `5`.
    - Use a set to avoid duplicates.
    
2. **Iterate**:
    - Extract the minimum number from the heap.
    - For each extracted number, generate its multiples (`current_number * 2`, `current_number * 3`, `current_number * 5`) and insert them back into the heap if they are not already present.
    - Track the count of numbers extracted until we reach the `nth` ugly number.

3. **Return**:
    - Return the `nth` number when the count matches `n`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0; // Assuming we handle invalid inputs with a default return value.
    
    std::priority_queue<long, std::vector<long>, std::greater<long>> minHeap;
    std::unordered_set<long> seen; // To avoid duplicates

    // Initialize with the first ugly number
    minHeap.push(1);
    seen.insert(1);

    long currentUgly = 1;

    // Factors for computing ugly numbers
    std::vector<int> factors = {2, 3, 5};

    // We need to find the nth ugly number
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        currentUgly = minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();

        for (int factor : factors) {
            long newUgly = currentUgly * factor;
            if (seen.find(newUgly) == seen.end()) {
                minHeap.push(newUgly);
                seen.insert(newUgly);
            }
        }
    }

    return static_cast<int>(currentUgly);
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example usage
    std::cout << "The " << n << "th ugly number is: " << nthUglyNumber(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Heap Operations**: Inserting and extracting the minimum element from the heap takes `O(log k)`, where `k` is the size of the heap.
- **Overall Complexity**: Given that each number generates three new candidate numbers and we perform this up to `n` times, the overall complexity is `O(n log n)`. 

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is influenced by the space needed for the heap and the hash set. In the worst case, this is proportional to the number of distinct ugly numbers less than the `nth` ugly number:
  - **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
