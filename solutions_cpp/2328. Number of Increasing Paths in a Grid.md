[Leetcode 2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2328)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integers grid `grid`, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell in 4 directions (up, down, left, right). Return the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid such that you can start and stop at any cell in the grid.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are diagonal movements allowed?**
   - No, movements can only be up, down, left, or right.
   
2. **What is considered an "increasing path"?**
   - An increasing path is one where each subsequent cell's value is strictly greater than the previous cell's value.
   
3. **Can we revisit cells along a path?**
   - No indication suggests it's forbidden, but since each value must be greater than the previous, revisiting would naturally not violate this constraint if movement is permitted.

4. **Can cells have negative or zero values?**
   - The problem does not specify, so we assume values can be any integers.

5. **What are the constraints on m and n?**
   - This information is typically provided to help us understand potential sizes of the grid.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) with memoization. Here's the general approach:

1. **DFS with Memoization**:
   - Use DFS to explore all increasing paths starting from each cell.
   - Use a 2D array to store the number of increasing paths starting from each cell to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We will keep a 2D memo array where `memo[i][j]` represents the number of increasing paths starting from cell `(i, j)`.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result may be large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure results fit within standard integer ranges.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int m, n;
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

    int dfs(int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
        if (memo[i][j] != -1) return memo[i][j];
        
        int paths = 1; // start with the current cell itself as a path
        for (auto dir : directions) {
            int x = i + dir[0], y = j + dir[1];
            if (x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n && grid[x][y] > grid[i][j]) {
                paths = (paths + dfs(x, y, grid, memo)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        return memo[i][j] = paths;
    }

    int countPaths(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        m = grid.size();
        n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> memo(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        int result = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                result = (result + dfs(i, j, grid, memo)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)` 
  - Each cell is visited once and calculates its increasing paths using memoization. Since each cell's DFS runs in constant time due to memoization, this results in an overall linear complexity relative to the grid size.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`
  - Space is used for the memoization grid and the call stack depth in case of DFS, which is manageable within typical constraints.
