[Leetcode 1079. Letter Tile Possibilities](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1079)
## Problem Statement

You have a set of `tiles`, where each tile has one letter printed on it. You can make words using these tiles by rearranging the letters. Each tile can be used only once. You need to return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `tiles = "AAB"`
- Output: `8`
  - Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= tiles.length <= 7`
- `tiles` consists of uppercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same letter be used more than once in a single sequence?**
   - No, each letter/tile can be used exactly once in a sequence.
   
2. **Are the sequences case-sensitive?**
   - No, all letters are upper case by the problem definition.
   
3. **Do the sequences need to be valid English words?**
   - No, any sequence of the given letters is valid regardless of dictionary words.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive backtracking technique to generate all possible sequences from the given set of tiles. We will use a set to store the unique sequences to avoid duplicates.

The steps are:
1. Convert the `tiles` string to a frequency map to track letter usage.
2. Use a recursive function to generate sequences.
3. In each recursive call, iterate over all possible letters:
   - If the count of the current letter is greater than zero, append it to the current sequence, decrement the count, and make a recursive call.
   - Backtrack by removing the letter from the sequence and restoring its count.

4. Use a set to keep track of all unique sequences generated in the recursive process.

## Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

void backtrack(string& path, unordered_map<char, int>& count_map, unordered_set<string>& results) {
    // Add the current path (if non-empty) to results
    if (!path.empty()) {
        results.insert(path);
    }
    
    // Explore all possibilities
    for (auto& entry : count_map) {
        char tile = entry.first;
        int count = entry.second;
        
        if (count > 0) {
            path.push_back(tile);
            count_map[tile]--;
            backtrack(path, count_map, results);
            path.pop_back();
            count_map[tile]++;
        }
    }
}

int numTilePossibilities(string tiles) {
    unordered_map<char, int> count_map;
    for (char tile : tiles) {
        count_map[tile]++;
    }
    
    unordered_set<string> results;
    string path;
    backtrack(path, count_map, results);
    
    return results.size();
}

int main() {
    string tiles = "AAB";
    cout << numTilePossibilities(tiles) << endl;  // Example output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N \cdot N!)\), where \(N\) is the length of the `tiles` string. This is because:
1. Each letter can be used in \(N\) possible positions.
2. For each position, there are permutations of the remaining \(N-1\) letters, and so on.

The backtracking technique ensures we explore all possible permutations and combinations, leading to the factorial nature of the complexity. Given the constraint (max `tiles.length` is 7), this approach is feasible.
