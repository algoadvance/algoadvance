[Leetcode 1177. Can Make Palindrome from Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1177)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are given a list of queries where each query consists of `three integers {left, right, k}`. For each query, determine if we can make the substring `s[left...right]` a palindrome after replacing at most `k` characters.

Return a list of boolean results, with each result corresponding to whether the substring can be made a palindrome for the corresponding query.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `s` and its characters**: What is the maximum length for `s`?
   - *Answer*: The maximum length of `s` is 10^5 and `s` only contains lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Number of queries**: How many queries can there be?
   - *Answer*: There can be up to 10^4 queries.

3. **Edge case with k = 0**: Do we need to handle cases where no replacements are allowed?
   - *Answer*: Yes, we should check if the substring is already a palindrome if `k = 0`.

4. **Character replacement details**: Are character replacements counted globally or per character?
   - *Answer*: You can replace at most `k` characters in the substring itself, meaning you can change any `k` characters of your choice.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently given the constraints, we can use the following approach:

1. **Count Frequency Using Prefix Sum Arrays**: Construct a prefix frequency array for each character in the alphabet within the string to quickly determine character counts in any substring.
2. **Character Count Analysis**: For each query, use the prefix sums to get the character frequencies in the substring. Determine the number of characters that appear an odd number of times.
3. **Palindrome Conditions**: 
   - For the substring to form a palindrome, at most one character can appear an odd number of times (if length is odd). 
   - If more characters appear an odd number of times, calculate if they can be balanced using up to `k` replacements.

4. **Formulate the Result for Each Query**: Based on the above conditions, formulate the result for each substring and store the results in the output list.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> canMakePaliQueries(string s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int n = s.size();
        // 26 letters, initialize prefix sums
        vector<vector<int>> prefix(n + 1, vector<int>(26, 0)); 
        
        // Fill prefix sum array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefix[i + 1] = prefix[i];
            prefix[i + 1][s[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        
        vector<bool> result;
        for (const auto& q : queries) {
            int left = q[0];
            int right = q[1];
            int k = q[2];
            
            int odd_count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
                int char_count = prefix[right + 1][i] - prefix[left][i];
                if (char_count % 2 != 0) {
                    odd_count++;
                }
            }
            
            // Condition to form palindrome
            bool can_form_palindrome = (odd_count / 2 <= k);
            result.push_back(can_form_palindrome);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Pre-processing**: Building the prefix sum array takes O(n * 26) == O(n) where `n` is the length of string `s`.
- **Query Processing**: Each query takes O(26) == O(1) time for checking the odd counts because we have 26 characters.

Thus, the overall complexity is:
- O(n) for building the prefix sums.
- O(q) for answering `q` queries (`q` <= 10^4).

Total complexity: **O(n + q)** which is efficient for the problem's constraints.
