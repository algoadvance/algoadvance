[Leetcode 975. Odd Even Jump](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l975)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:

- For odd-numbered jumps (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...), you jump to the smallest index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]`.
- For even-numbered jumps (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...), you jump to the smallest index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]`.

If there are multiple such indices `j`, you jump to the smallest such index `j`. It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps to make.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by making a series of odd-numbered or even-numbered jumps.

Return the number of good starting indices.

### Example:
```
Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From index 0 and 2, we can reach the end of the array by jumps.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `arr` contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - No, `arr` will only contain positive integers.
   
2. **What is the range of the length of `arr`?**
   - The length of `arr` can be up to 100,000.

## Strategy
1. **Preliminary Sorting:**
   - Sort the indices of `arr` such that it becomes easy to determine the next index for odd and even jumps.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Setup:**
   - Use two boolean arrays `odd[i]` and `even[i]` where `odd[i]` indicates if starting at index `i` with an odd jump can reach the end, and `even[i]` indicates if starting at index `i` with an even jump can reach the end.
   
3. **Monotonic Stack for Indices:**
   - Use a monotonic stack to efficiently build the mapping of indices for odd and even jumps.

4. **Iterate and Determine:**
   - Initialize from the last index and use backtracking to fill the boolean arrays `odd` and `even`.
   - Count the number of `true` values in `odd` starting points.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int oddEvenJumps(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        
        vector<int> odd_next(n, -1), even_next(n, -1);
        map<int, int> val_idx;
        
        // Fill next higher jump (odd jump)
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            auto hi = val_idx.lower_bound(arr[i]);
            if (hi != val_idx.end())
                odd_next[i] = hi->second;
            val_idx[arr[i]] = i;
        }
        
        val_idx.clear();
        
        // Fill next lower jump (even jump)
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            auto lo = val_idx.upper_bound(arr[i]);
            if (lo != val_idx.begin())
                even_next[i] = (--lo)->second;
            val_idx[arr[i]] = i;
        }
        
        vector<bool> odd(n, false), even(n, false);
        odd[n - 1] = even[n - 1] = true;
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (odd_next[i] != -1)
                odd[i] = even[odd_next[i]];
            if (even_next[i] != -1)
                even[i] = odd[even_next[i]];
        }
        
        return count(odd.begin(), odd.end(), true);
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting operations and filling maps can take O(n log n).
- Iterating and filling the boolean arrays is linear, O(n).
- So, overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting and map operations.

This solution should handle the upper constraints efficiently.
