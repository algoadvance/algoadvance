[Leetcode 724. Find Pivot Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l724)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to find the pivot index of an array. The pivot index is defined as an index `i` such that the sum of the elements to the left of `i` is equal to the sum of the elements to the right of `i`. If no such index exists, return -1. If there are multiple pivot indexes, you should return the left-most pivot index.

### Example:
- Input: `nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: 
  The pivot index is 3. 
  Left sum: `1 + 7 + 3` = 11 
  Right sum: `5 + 6` = 11

- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- Output: `-1`
- Explanation: 
  No pivot index exists.

### Note:
1. The length of `nums` will be in the range `[0, 10000]`.
2. Each element `nums[i]` will be an integer in the range `[-1000, 1000]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array be empty? 
   - Yes, if the array is empty, we should return -1.
2. If there are multiple valid pivot indexes, should we return the smallest index?
   - Yes, we should return the left-most pivot index.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the total sum of the array**: This will help us to avoid calculating the right sum repetitively.
2. **Iterate through the array**: Maintain a running sum of elements on the left side of the current index. The right sum can be computed as `totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.
3. **Check the condition**: At each index `i`, check if the left sum equals the right sum.
4. **Return the index** if such a pivot exists; otherwise, return -1 after the loop.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <numeric> // for std::accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    int pivotIndex(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int totalSum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);
        int leftSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            leftSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we traverse the array twice (once for calculating `totalSum` and once for finding the pivot index). The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently finds the pivot index, leveraging a single scan of the array to check each candidate index while maintaining a running sum of the left-hand side.
