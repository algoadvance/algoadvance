[Leetcode 1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1928)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, time_i]` indicates there is a directed edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i` that takes `time_i` to travel. You are also given an integer `maxTime`, and an array `passingFees` where `passingFees[j]` is the cost to travel through the city `j`.

Your task is to find out the minimum cost to reach from city `0` to city `n-1` within `maxTime`. If you cannot reach the destination city within `maxTime`, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
2. Is there any guaranteed path from the start to the end within the given constraints?
3. What are the constraints on the number of nodes and edges?

### Strategy
We will use a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem. Instead of minimizing the distance, we will minimize the cost while also keeping track of the time spent.

1. **Data Structures**:
    - A priority queue to fetch the node with the least cost.
    - A 2D DP array where `dp[node][time]` stores the minimum cost to reach `node` using `time`.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Start with city `0` with cost `passingFees[0]` and time `0`.

3. **Algorithm**:
    - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the city, current cost, and current time.
    - For the current city, attempt to traverse each outgoing edge if the total time does not exceed `maxTime`.
    - Update the DP table and push new states to the priority queue.

4. **Termination**:
    - If we reach the destination within the allowed time, return the cost.
    - If the priority queue is empty and we haven't reached the destination, return `-1`.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int pos, cost, time;
    bool operator>(const Node& other) const {
        return cost > other.cost;
    }
};

int minCostToReachDestinationInTime(int maxTime, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& passingFees) {
    int n = passingFees.size();
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n);
    
    for (auto& edge : edges) {
        int from = edge[0], to = edge[1], time = edge[2];
        graph[from].emplace_back(to, time);
        graph[to].emplace_back(from, time); // Add the reverse edge since the graph is undirected
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(maxTime + 1, INT_MAX));
    priority_queue<Node, vector<Node>, greater<Node>> pq;
    
    dp[0][0] = passingFees[0];
    pq.push({0, passingFees[0], 0});
    
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [curPos, curCost, curTime] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        
        if (curPos == n - 1) {
            return curCost;
        }
        
        for (auto& [nextPos, travelTime] : graph[curPos]) {
            int nextTime = curTime + travelTime;
            if (nextTime > maxTime) continue;
            int nextCost = curCost + passingFees[nextPos];
            if (nextCost < dp[nextPos][nextTime]) {
                dp[nextPos][nextTime] = nextCost;
                pq.push({nextPos, nextCost, nextTime});
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
}

// Example Usage
int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1, 10}, {1, 2, 10}, {0, 3, 1}, {3, 4, 10}, {4, 2, 10}};
    vector<int> passingFees = {5, 1, 2, 20, 20};
    int maxTime = 30;
    
    int result = minCostToReachDestinationInTime(maxTime, edges, passingFees);
    cout << "Minimum cost: " << result << endl;  // Expected output: 20
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(E \log(N \times T))\) where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(T\) is `maxTime`. The priority queue operations contribute to the logarithmic factor.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N \times T)\) to store the DP table.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths within `maxTime` and find the minimum cost effectively.
