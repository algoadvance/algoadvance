[Leetcode 343. Integer Break](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l343)
## Problem Statement

The problem from Leetcode 343, "Integer Break", reads:

Given a positive integer `n`, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```

**Note:**
- `n` is guaranteed to be greater than 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `n` include values as low as 2?
   - **A:** Yes, as per the problem statement `n` should be greater than 1.
   
2. **Q:** Is there an upper constraint on `n` that we should consider?
   - **A:** Yes, the constraint typically implies `n` can be reasonably large, but exact limits can usually be found in the problem constraints section of Leetcode.

## Strategy

The problem requires breaking `n` into at least two smaller positive integers such that their product is maximized. Here are the steps to tackle this:

1. **Mathematical Insight:** 
   - For any integer `n`, breaking it down into parts of values 1, 2, and 3 is considered optimal as 3s maximize the product in larger chunks.
   - We generally try to get as many 3s as possible because growing numbers exponentially provide higher products.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the maximum product obtainable for integer `i`.
   - Iterate from 2 to `n` and calculate the possible maximum products.
   - For each integer `i`, iterate through all j from 1 to `i/2`, and calculate which combination provides the highest product using previously computed dp arrays.

3. **Greedy Approach Insight:**
   - The largest product comes when breaking `n` into multiple 3s. Handle the remainder cases (if `n % 3 == 1` then adjust one 3 to a 4).

### Code Implementation

Here is a C++ implementation using the dynamic programming approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

int integerBreak(int n) {
    if (n == 2) return 1;
    if (n == 3) return 2;
    
    std::vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    dp[3] = 3;
    
    int maxProduct = 0;
    
    for (int i = 4; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i / 2; ++j) {
            dp[i] = std::max(dp[i], dp[j] * dp[i - j]);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

int main() {
    int n = 10; // Example input
    std::cout << "Maximum product of breaking " << n << " is: " << integerBreak(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
  - We have a nested loop iterating from 4 to `n` and within that, a loop iterating up to `i/2`, making it quadratic.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We are using an additional array `dp` to store the results for each integer up to `n`.

This approach should be efficient enough for reasonable values of `n` as typically required by such Leetcode problems.
