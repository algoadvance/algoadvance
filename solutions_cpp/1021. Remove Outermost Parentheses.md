[Leetcode 1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1021)
### Problem Statement
Given a valid parentheses string, `s`, you need to remove the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of `s`. A primitive string is a non-empty string that cannot be split into two non-empty valid parentheses strings.

### Example
- Input: `s = "(()())(())"`
- Output: `"()()()"`
- Explanation: The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive strings in the primitive decomposition being "(()())" and "(())". After removing outermost parentheses of each part, this removes 1st and last parentheses in both parts yielding "()()()".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length constraint of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` will be between 1 and 10,000.
2. **Is the input always guaranteed to be a valid parentheses string?**
   - Yes, the input is always guaranteed to be a valid parentheses string.

### Strategy
The goal is to iterate through the string while maintaining a counter to track the nesting level of the parentheses to identify the outermost ones. Here's the approach step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Create a variable `count` to keep track of the balance between `(` and `)`.
   - Use a string `result` to store the modified string without the outermost parentheses.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Loop through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the current character is `(`:
     - If `count` is greater than 0, append `(` to the result (indicating it's not the outermost `(`).
     - Increment `count`.
   - If the current character is `)`:
     - Decrement `count`.
     - If `count` is greater than 0, append `)` to the result (indicating it's not the outermost `)`).

3. The balancing of the `count` variable ensures that we correctly identify the outermost parentheses in each primitive segment.

### Code
```cpp
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string removeOuterParentheses(string s) {
        string result = "";
        int count = 0;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                if (count > 0) {
                    result += c;
                }
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
                if (count > 0) {
                    result += c;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we only iterate over the string once.

The space complexity is **O(n)** as well due to storing the resultant string without the outermost parentheses.
