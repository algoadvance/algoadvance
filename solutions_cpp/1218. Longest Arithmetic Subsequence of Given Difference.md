[Leetcode 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1218)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in the array which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is equal to `difference`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are duplicates allowed in the array?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.
2. **What is the expected output if the array is empty?**
   - The output should be `0` since there are no elements in the array.
3. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have negative numbers.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int difference) {
        unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            dp[num] = dp[num - difference] + 1;
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[num]);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, follow these steps:
1. **Use a HashMap (unordered_map) to keep track of the lengths of arithmetic subsequences:** 
   - Let `dp[x]` represent the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending with the element `x`.

2. **Iterate through the array:** 
   - For each element `num` in the array, calculate the length of the longest subsequence that can end at `num` by checking the length of the subsequence that could end at `num - difference`. Update `dp[num]` to be `dp[num - difference] + 1`.

3. **Update the maximum length of the subsequence:**
   - During each iteration, update the `maxLength` with the value of `dp[num]` if it is greater than the current `maxLength`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We are iterating through the array once, and each hash map operation (insertion and lookup) is O(1) on average.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We are using a hash map that in the worst case can store an entry for every element in the array.
