[Leetcode 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l30)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings in `words` are of the same length. A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings in `words` concatenated in any order. 

Write a function to return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. The function signature should be:

```cpp
vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words);
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` could be up to 10,000 characters.

2. **What is the maximum length of each word in `words` and the number of words in `words`?**
   - Each word in `words` can be up to 100 characters, and there can be up to 500 words.

3. **Are there any constraints on the content of `s` and the words in `words`?**
   - Both `s` and the words in `words` contain only lowercase English letters.

4. **Can words in `words` be repeated?**
   - Yes, words in `words` can be repeated.

### Strategy:
1. **Calculate Total Length of Concatenated Words:** The length of the substring we are looking for will be the sum of the lengths of all words.
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use a sliding window of the calculated length to move through the string `s` and check if the substring contains all the words in `words`.
3. **Hash Map to Count Words:** Use a hash map to store the frequency of each word in `words`.
4. **Check Validity:** For each window, check if it contains exactly the right frequency of all words using a secondary map.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (words.empty() || s.empty()) return result;

    // Step 1: Initial Setup
    int wordLen = words[0].size();
    int numWords = words.size();
    int totalLength = wordLen * numWords;

    if (s.size() < totalLength) return result;

    unordered_map<string, int> wordCount;
    for (const string& word : words) {
        wordCount[word]++;
    }

    // Step 2: Sliding Window
    for (int i = 0; i <= s.size() - totalLength; ++i) {
        unordered_map<string, int> seen;
        int j = 0;
        while (j < numWords) {
            string word = s.substr(i + j * wordLen, wordLen);
            if (wordCount.find(word) != wordCount.end()) {
                seen[word]++;
                if (seen[word] > wordCount[word]) break;
            } else {
                break;
            }
            ++j;
        }

        if (j == numWords) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization:** Constructing the `wordCount` hash map takes O(m) where `m` is the number of words times the length of each word.
- **Sliding Window:** For each starting index up to `s.size() - totalLength`, the worst-case is examining every word, resulting in `O((n - totalLength) * m)`, where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the number of words.
  
Hence, the overall time complexity is approximately **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the length of string `s` and `m` is the total number of words. This is efficient given the constraints.
