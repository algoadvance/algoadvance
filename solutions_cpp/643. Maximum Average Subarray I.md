[Leetcode 643. Maximum Average Subarray I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l643)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than 10^-5 will be accepted.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `n` be smaller than `k`?
   **A:** No, `n` will always be greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Q:** Can the array have negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can have negative numbers.

3. **Q:** Is the array always non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, the array is non-empty, and `k` is a valid number.

4. **Q:** How large can `n` and `k` be?
   **A:** Typically, constraints are given such that both `n` and `k` will be within reasonable limits for performance in an O(n) approach.

## Strategy

To find the subarray of length `k` with the maximum average, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first `k` elements. This will be the initial sum and average.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window to traverse through the array:
    - For each position from `k` to `n - 1`:
        - Subtract the element that is sliding out of the window (i.e., `nums[i - k]`).
        - Add the element that is sliding into the window (i.e., `nums[i]`).
        - Update the maximum sum if the new sum is greater than the current maximum sum.
3. **Compute Average**: Divide the maximum sum by `k` to get the maximum average.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    double findMaxAverage(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int current_sum = 0;
        
        // Compute the sum of the first k elements
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            current_sum += nums[i];
        }
        
        int max_sum = current_sum;
        
        // Sliding window to find the maximum sum of k consecutive elements
        for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
            current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            if (current_sum > max_sum) {
                max_sum = current_sum;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum average
        return (double)max_sum / k;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Calculating initial sum of the first `k` elements takes `O(k)`.
- **Sliding Window**: Updating the window's sum for the remainder of the array takes `O(n - k)`, which is `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
