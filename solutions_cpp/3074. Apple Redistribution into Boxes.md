[Leetcode 3074. Apple Redistribution into Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3074)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `apples` where `apples[i]` denotes the number of apples in the i-th box. You need to redistribute the apples such that each box has at most `k` apples. Determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve this, where each move consists of taking an apple from one box and putting it into another box.

### Example

**Input:**
```cpp
apples = [10, 5, 6, 3, 8]
k = 5
```
**Output:**
```cpp
10
```

**Explanation:**
1. Take 5 apples from the first box and put them into other boxes.
2. Similarly redistribute other apples till each box has at most `k` apples.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify the input constraints:**
    - What is the maximum length of the apples array? Are all elements non-negative integers?
    - What is the value range for `k`?

2. **Details about output:**
    - Should the result always be printed, or returned by a function?
    - How do you handle edge cases like when `k` is very large compared to the number of apples in boxes?

## Strategy

1. First, find out how many apples need to be removed from boxes having more than `k` apples.
2. Calculate the total number of excess apples by summing the amounts by which each overloaded box exceeds `k`.
3. Distribute these excess apples in boxes that have less than `k` apples.
4. Accumulate the number of moves required.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)** where `n` is the number of boxes. This complexity arises from the need to make a single pass through the list to calculate the excess apples and effective redistributions.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int minMovesToRedistributeApples(std::vector<int>& apples, int k) {
    int moves = 0;
    int excess = 0;

    for (int appleCount : apples) {
        if (appleCount > k) {
            excess += (appleCount - k);
        }
    }
    
    for (int appleCount : apples) {
        if (appleCount < k && excess > 0) {
            int needed = k - appleCount;
            int taken = std::min(needed, excess);
            moves += taken;
            excess -= taken;
        }
    }
    
    // Final adjustment to ensure all excesses are accounted as moves
    moves += excess;
    
    return moves;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> apples = {10, 5, 6, 3, 8};
    int k = 5;
    std::cout << minMovesToRedistributeApples(apples, k) << std::endl; // Output: 10
    return 0;
}
```

This function calculates the minimum moves required to ensure that no box has more than `k` apples by redistributing the excess apples to other boxes.
