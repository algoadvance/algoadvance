[Leetcode 2953. Count Complete Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2953)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the number of **complete substrings**. A **complete substring** is a substring that contains every letter in the alphabet at least once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the string `s`?**
   - This affects the computational feasibility of our solution.
2. **Do we need to consider case sensitivity?**
   - Treating 'A' and 'a' as the same or different affects the implementation.
3. **What characters does the string contain?**
   - Confirm if the string only has lowercase English letters.

### Assumptions
- The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- The length of `s` is reasonable for a sliding window and frequency count based solution.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use two pointers to maintain a window that potentially contains all letters of the alphabet.
2. **Frequency Count**: Maintain a count of how many unique letters from the alphabet are within the current window.
3. **Expand and Contract Window**: Expand the right end until the window contains all characters, then try contracting the left end while maintaining the complete substring criteria.

### Code

Below is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

int countCompleteSubstrings(string s) {
    const int alphabetSize = 26;
    int numCompleteSubstrings = 0;

    for (int start = 0; start < s.size(); ++start) {
        unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
        int distinct = 0;

        for (int end = start; end < s.size(); ++end) {
            charCount[s[end]]++;
            if (charCount[s[end]] == 1) {
                distinct++;
            }
            if (distinct == alphabetSize) {
                numCompleteSubstrings += s.size() - end;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return numCompleteSubstrings;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
    cout << "Number of complete substrings: " << countCompleteSubstrings(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Outer Loop**: Iterate over all potential starting points for substrings.
2. **Inner Loop**: Expand the substring by moving the end pointer.
3. **Frequency Count**: A hashmap maps each character to its count within the current window.
4. **Check Complete Substring**: When all 26 alphabet characters are present, count substrings formed from this point to the end of the string.

### Time Complexity
- **Outer loop**: runs in O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Inner loop**: also runs in O(n) in the worst case, resulting in an O(n^2) combined complexity.
- **Frequency Count Operations**: These are O(1) for updates and checks due to the fixed size of the alphabet.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2), which is acceptable for reasonable lengths of `s`.

Would you like to test this with specific inputs or need further optimization?
