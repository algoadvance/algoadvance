[Leetcode 2719. Count of Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2719)
## Problem Statement

You are given a range `[low, high]` as two integers, `low` and `high`. Your task is to count all integers within this range. This problem appears to be a bit ambiguous based on the title, so let's refine it with a few assumptions:
- **Input:** Two integers `low` and `high`, where `low <= high`.
- **Output:** An integer representing the count of integers within the range `[low, high]`.

Here is an example:
- Input: `low = 3`, `high = 7`
- Output: `5` (Because the integers between 3 and 7 inclusive are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Inclusive Range:** Are the boundaries `low` and `high` inclusive?
   - Yes, include the boundaries in the count.

2. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the values of `low` and `high`?
   - Typical constraints might be, `-10^9 <= low <= high <= 10^9`.

3. **Edge Cases:** What should be returned if `low` and `high` are the same?
   - Return 1 because the range includes only one number, which is both `low` and `high`.

## Strategy

Given the clarified problem, the simplest way to compute the count of integers within the range `[low, high]` is to use the formula: 
```cpp
count = high - low + 1
```
This ensures that the boundaries are inclusive.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is O(1) because it's a simple arithmetic operation.

## Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the refined problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int countOfIntegers(int low, int high) {
    return high - low + 1;
}

int main() {
    int low, high;
    std::cout << "Enter the values for low and high: ";
    std::cin >> low >> high;

    // Check if low is less than or equal to high
    if (low > high) {
        std::cerr << "Invalid range: low should be less than or equal to high.\n";
        return 1; // Return an error code
    }

    int count = countOfIntegers(low, high);
    std::cout << "The count of integers in the range [" << low << ", " << high << "] is: " << count << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads `low` and `high` from the user, calculates the count of integers in the inclusive range `[low, high]`, and outputs the result.

In summary, the problem is straightforward and solved with a simple subtraction and addition operation, making the time complexity constant, O(1).
