[Leetcode 794. Valid Tic](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l794)
### Problem Statement:
Implement a function to check if a given Tic-Tac-Toe board state is valid. The board is a 3x3 array where each element is either `'X'`, `'O'`, or `' '`. A valid Tic-Tac-Toe board must satisfy the following conditions:
1. The number of 'X's cannot be less than the number of 'O's and cannot exceed the number of 'O's by more than 1.
2. A player wins if they have three of their characters in a row, column, or diagonal.
3. If a player wins, the game ends and no more moves are possible.

Write a function `bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board)` to return whether the given board state is valid.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Will the board always be a valid 3x3 grid?
   - Yes, the board will always be a valid 3x3 grid.
   
2. Should the function account for invalid characters in the grid?
   - No, you can assume the board contains only 'X', 'O', and spaces.

3. Can there be multiple winners?
   - No, there can be at most one winner.

### Strategy:
1. **Count the number of 'X' and 'O'**:
   - Ensure the count of 'X' is either equal to or exactly one more than the count of 'O'.

2. **Check for winning conditions**:
   - If 'X' wins, ensure there is exactly one more 'X' than 'O'.
   - If 'O' wins, ensure there are exactly the same number of 'X' and 'O'.

3. **Define win conditions**:
   - Check all rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning condition.

4. **Handle invalid cases**:
   - Return false if any of the above conditions are violated.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

bool isWinner(const vector<string>& board, char player) {
    // Check rows and columns
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        if (board[i][0] == player && board[i][1] == player && board[i][2] == player) return true;
        if (board[0][i] == player && board[1][i] == player && board[2][i] == player) return true;
    }

    // Check diagonals
    if (board[0][0] == player && board[1][1] == player && board[2][2] == player) return true;
    if (board[0][2] == player && board[1][1] == player && board[2][0] == player) return true;

    return false;
}

bool validTicTacToe(vector<string>& board) {
    int countX = 0, countO = 0;
    
    // Count X's and O's
    for (const auto& row : board) {
        for (const auto& cell : row) {
            if (cell == 'X') ++countX;
            if (cell == 'O') ++countO;
        }
    }

    // If the number of 'O's is greater than 'X's, or 'X' is greater by more than 1, return false
    if (countO > countX || countX > countO + 1) return false;

    bool xWins = isWinner(board, 'X');
    bool oWins = isWinner(board, 'O');

    // If 'X' wins, then there should be exactly one more 'X' than 'O'
    if (xWins && countX != countO + 1) return false;

    // If 'O' wins, then the number of 'X' and 'O' should be equal
    if (oWins && countX != countO) return false;

    // If both 'X' and 'O' win, it's invalid
    if (xWins && oWins) return false;

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Counting X's and O's**: \(O(9)\) since we iterate over a 3x3 grid.
- **Checking winner conditions**: \(O(1)\) as we only check a fixed number of rows, columns, and diagonals.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(1)\).
