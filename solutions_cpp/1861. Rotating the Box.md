[Leetcode 1861. Rotating the Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1861)
Certainly! Let's work through the LeetCode problem 1861: Rotating the Box.

### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a box, where each cell is one of the following:

- A stone '#'
- A stationary obstacle '*'
- Empty '.'

The box is rotated 90 degrees clockwise which means the elements will be shifted such that the first row of the original box becomes the last column of the rotated box, and so on.

After the rotation, assuming gravity also acts on the stones, each stone falls down until it lands on another stone or obstacle or reaches the bottom of the box. Write a function to return the box after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise and applying gravity to the stones.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the box given guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the box?

#### Assumptions:
- The input matrix is non-empty.
- The size of the matrix is within reasonable limits to fit in memory.

### Strategy

The solution involves two main steps:
1. Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise.
2. Apply gravity to the stones in the newly formed columns.

**Step-by-Step Approach:**

1. **Rotation:**
   - If the original box is `m x n`, the rotated box will be `n x m`. 
   - For each element in the original matrix at position (i, j), it will map to (j, m - i - 1) in the rotated matrix.

2. **Applying Gravity:**
   - Once the box has been rotated, simulate the effect of gravity on the stones. 
   - Traverse each column from bottom to top, and let each stone fall to the lowest possible empty cell.

### Code

Here's the C++ solution to the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<char>> rotateTheBox(vector<vector<char>>& box) {
        int m = box.size();
        int n = box[0].size();
        
        // Step 1: Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise
        vector<vector<char>> rotatedBox(n, vector<char>(m));
        for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                rotatedBox[j][m - i - 1] = box[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Apply gravity in the rotated box
        for(int col = 0; col < m; ++col) {
            int emptySpace = n - 1;
            for(int row = n - 1; row >= 0; --row) {
                if(rotatedBox[row][col] == '#') {
                    rotatedBox[row][col] = '.';
                    rotatedBox[emptySpace][col] = '#';
                    emptySpace--;
                } else if(rotatedBox[row][col] == '*') {
                    emptySpace = row - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return rotatedBox;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Rotation:**
  - Rotating the matrix takes \(O(m \times n)\) time since each element is accessed exactly once.
  
- **Gravity Application:**
  - Applying gravity involves scanning each column of the rotated matrix, which also takes \(O(m \times n)\) time.
  
Thus, the total time complexity of the solution is **O(m \times n)**.
