[Leetcode 3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3016)
## Problem Statement:

Given a keyboard where each key has a specific value, your task is to determine the minimum number of pushes required to type a given word. Each key represents either a single letter or a sequence of letters. The keyboard is represented by a list of strings, with each string indicating the keys on a single row of the keyboard. Your goal is to type the word with the minimum number of key pushes. The keys are case-sensitive.

### Input:
1. A 2D array where each element is a string representing a row of the keyboard.
2. A string `word` that needs to be typed.

### Output:
Return the minimum number of key pushes required to type the `word`.

### Example:
For a keyboard represented as:
```
[
  ["qwertyuiop"],
  ["asdfghjkl"],
  ["zxcvbnm"]
]
```
And the word `"apple"`, the result should be `5` because each character in "apple" is present as a single character on the keyboard.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is each string in the 2D array guaranteed to contain unique characters?** 
   - Yes, each string representing a row in the 2D array will not have repeated characters.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the case sensitivity?**
   - Yes, the keyboard and the word are case-sensitive.

3. **Can there be overlapping characters between different rows?**
   - Yes, characters can overlap between different rows. A character appearing in two rows can be typed by pressing either of the keys in respective rows.

4. **Is the word guaranteed to consist of characters present on the keyboard?**
   - Yes, the word will only contain characters that are present somewhere on the keyboard.

## Strategy:

1. **Character Mapping**: Create a hash map from characters to key pushes using the keyboard array. The value of each key in the hash map will be 1, indicating one key push.
2. **Calculation of Pushes**: Sum up the key pushes for each character in the word using the hash map.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

int minPushesToTypeWordII(const std::vector<std::string>& keyboard, const std::string& word) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> keyMap;
    
    // Create a map with character to key push count (always 1 here)
    for (const auto& row : keyboard) {
        for (char ch : row) {
            keyMap[ch] = 1; // Each key push is counted as 1
        }
    }
    
    int pushes = 0;
    
    // Calculate total key pushes required for the word
    for (char ch : word) {
        pushes += keyMap[ch];
    }
    
    return pushes;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> keyboard = {"qwertyuiop", "asdfghjkl", "zxcvbnm"};
    std::string word = "apple";

    std::cout << "Minimum number of pushes: " << minPushesToTypeWordII(keyboard, word) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

**O(n + m)** where:
- **n** is the total number of characters in the keyboard (sum of lengths of all rows).
- **m** is the length of the word to be typed.

The solution efficiently maps characters to key pushes in linear time using a hash map and then calculates the required key pushes by summing up the values in linear time.

This provides an optimal approach to solve the problem within given constraints.
