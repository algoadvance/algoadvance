[Leetcode 1095. Find in Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1095)
### Problem Statement

(This problem is an interactive problem.)

You may recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the minimum `index` such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

You cannot access the mountain array directly. You may only access elements using the `MountainArray` interface:

```cpp
class MountainArray {
public:
    int get(int index);
    int length();
};
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarify the Interface**: Does the `MountainArray` interface provide the `get` and `length` methods as described?
   - Yes, you have `mountainArr.get(index)` to get the value at a specific index and `mountainArr.length()` to get the total length of the array.
   
2. **Range of Values**: What are the constraints on `arr.length`, and the values contained within the array?
   - `3 <= mountainArr.length() <= 10000`.
   - `0 <= mountainArr.get(index) <= 1000000`.

3. **Unique Values**: Are all the values in the mountain array unique?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the values are unique, which helps in simplifying our algorithm.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Peak Index**: Use binary search to locate the peak element, the element which is greater than its neighbors.
2. **Binary Search in Ascending Part**: Perform binary search in the ascending part of the array from start to the peak element.
3. **Binary Search in Descending Part**: If the target is not found, perform binary search in the descending part from the peak element to the end.

### Code

Let's implement this logic in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MountainArray {
public:
    int get(int index) const;    // returns the value at index
    int length() const;          // returns the length of the mountain array
};

class Solution {
public:
    int findInMountainArray(int target, MountainArray &mountainArr) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = mountainArr.length() - 1;
        
        // Find the peak of the mountain array
        int peak = findPeak(mountainArr, left, right);
        
        // Try to find target in the ascending part
        int index = binarySearchAscending(mountainArr, target, 0, peak);
        if (index != -1) {
            return index;
        }
        
        // Try to find target in the descending part
        return binarySearchDescending(mountainArr, target, peak + 1, mountainArr.length() - 1);
    }
    
private:
    int findPeak(const MountainArray &mountainArr, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left; // Peak element index
    }
    
    int binarySearchAscending(const MountainArray &mountainArr, int target, int left, int right) {
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            int midVal = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (midVal == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (midVal < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
    
    int binarySearchDescending(const MountainArray &mountainArr, int target, int left, int right) {
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            int midVal = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (midVal == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (midVal > target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Finding the Peak**: O(log n), where n is the length of the array.
2. **Binary Search in Ascending Part**: O(log n) in the worst case.
3. **Binary Search in Descending Part**: O(log n) in the worst case.

So the overall time complexity is O(log n), which is very efficient.
