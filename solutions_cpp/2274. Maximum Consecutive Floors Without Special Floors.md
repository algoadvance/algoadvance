[Leetcode 2274. Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2274)
## Problem Statement
You have been given a range of floors in a building, defined by two integers `bottom` and `top`, and a list of integers `special`, representing floors that are considered special. You are required to find the maximum number of consecutive floors that are not special.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input: bottom = 2, top = 9, special = [4, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The range is from 2 to 9.
The special floors are 4 and 6.
The floors without any special floor in between are: [2, 3], [5], [7, 8, 9].
The maximum number of such consecutive floors is 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Do the `bottom` and `top` floors inclusive in the range?**
   - Yes, the floors from `bottom` to `top` are inclusive.
  
2. **Can `special` contain duplicates?**
   - No, the `special` list will contain unique elements.
   
3. **Is it guaranteed that `special` floors will always lie within the `bottom` and `top` range?**
   - Yes, all elements in `special` will be within the range `[bottom, top]`.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the Special Floors:** First, sort the list of special floors.
2. **Find Gaps:** Calculate the gaps between consecutive special floors, and also consider the gaps before the first special floor and after the last special floor.
3. **Compute Maximum Consecutive Floors:** Track the maximum number of consecutive floors that are not special.

## Code
Here is the C++ function to implement the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, std::vector<int>& special) {
    std::sort(special.begin(), special.end());
    int maxConsecutiveFloors = 0;

    // Check the gap before the first special floor
    if (special[0] > bottom) {
        maxConsecutiveFloors = special[0] - bottom;
    }
    
    // Check gaps between consecutive special floors
    for (size_t i = 1; i < special.size(); ++i) {
        int gap = special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1; // subtracting 1 as we also need to exclude both special floors.
        maxConsecutiveFloors = std::max(maxConsecutiveFloors, gap);
    }
    
    // Check the gap after the last special floor
    if (special.back() < top) {
        int gap = top - special.back();
        maxConsecutiveFloors = std::max(maxConsecutiveFloors, gap);
    }

    return maxConsecutiveFloors;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting Special Floors:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of special floors.
- **Iterating Through Special Floors:** \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), mainly dominated by the sorting step.
