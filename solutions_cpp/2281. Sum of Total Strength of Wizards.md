[Leetcode 2281. Sum of Total Strength of Wizards](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2281)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `strength`, where `strength[i]` denotes the strength of the `i-th` wizard. The total strength of a group of wizards is defined as the sum of the minimum wizard's strength in the group multiplied by the sum of the strengths of wizards in that group.

Formally, for a group `arr[l...r]` (where `0 <= l <= r < n`), the total strength is defined as:
```
totalStrength(arr[l...r]) = min(arr[l...r]) * (arr[l] + arr[l+1] + ... + arr[r])
```

Return the sum of the total strengths of all possible groups of wizards. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n` (number of wizards)?
   - What kind of values can `strength[i]` take?

2. **Groups:**
   - Is the group size between 1 to `n`?

3. **Edge cases:**
   - Should we consider an empty group? (Typically no in such problems)
   - Are there any constraints on `strength[]` values (e.g., non-negative)?

Given these clarifications, let’s move on to the strategy for solving this problem.

### Strategy

1. **Simplifying the Calculation:**
   - We need to calculate min(arr[l...r]) and sum(arr[l...r]) for all subarrays `arr[l...r]`.
   - A brute-force solution will be too slow since checking all subarrays can result in O(n^3) time complexity.

2. **Efficient Calculation Using Monotonic Stack and Prefix Sums:**
   - **Prefix Sum Array:** To quickly get the sum of any subarray, maintain a prefix sum array.
   - **Monotonic Stack:** To quickly locate the range wherein each element is the minimum, use a monotonic stack.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Compute the prefix sum array.
   - For each element in the `strength` array, utilize the monotonic stack to determine the span where the current element is the minimum.
   - Calculate the contribution of current element towards the total sum of strengths for all subarrays where it’s the minimum.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:** Given constraints will likely require using modulo `10^9 + 7` for all arithmetic operations to avoid overflow.

### Time Complexity
This algorithm should run in `O(n)` time for deriving the prefix sums and processing each element with the help of the stack, leading to an efficient solution.

### Code

Below is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int totalStrength(vector<int>& strength) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = strength.size();
        
        vector<long long> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = (prefixSum[i] + strength[i]) % MOD;
        }
        
        vector<long long> prefixPrefixSum(n + 2, 0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1; ++i) {
            prefixPrefixSum[i] = (prefixPrefixSum[i - 1] + prefixSum[i - 1]) % MOD;
        }
        
        stack<int> st;
        long long answer = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            while (!st.empty() && (i == n || strength[st.top()] > strength[i])) {
                int mid = st.top();
                st.pop();
                int left = st.empty() ? -1 : st.top();
                int leftCount = mid - left;
                int rightCount = i - mid;
                
                long long leftSum = (prefixPrefixSum[mid + 1] - prefixPrefixSum[left + 1] + MOD) % MOD;
                long long rightSum = (prefixPrefixSum[i + 1] - prefixPrefixSum[mid + 1] + MOD) % MOD;

                long long totalLeftContribution = rightCount * leftSum % MOD;
                long long totalRightContribution = leftCount * rightSum % MOD;
                long long total = (totalLeftContribution + totalRightContribution) % MOD;
                
                answer = (answer + total * strength[mid]) % MOD;
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
};
```

This solution efficiently calculates the required sum of total strengths by focusing on modular arithmetic and leveraging data structures to handle subarray minimums and sums without the potential pitfalls of brute force approaches.
