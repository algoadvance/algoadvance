[Leetcode 936. Stamping The Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l936)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `stamp` and `target`. Initially, there is a string `target` of length `n` consisting of question marks `'?'`. You need to replace exactly `m` (the length of `stamp`) consecutive question marks `'?'` with `stamp`. Repeatedly apply this operation until the string `target` becomes the string `target`.

Return an array of the indices of the stamps such that `target` will be equal to the original target after all the operations, or return an empty array if it is not possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the same position be stamped multiple times?
2. Is there a limit on the size of the `stamp` and `target` strings?
3. What characters does the `stamp` and `target` consist of? Are they limited to lowercase English letters?

## Strategy

1. **Stamp Replacement and Backtracking:**
    - We will utilize a greedy approach to iteratively apply the stamp to replace question marks and match parts of the `target` until the entire `target` is matched.
    - Start from the beginning of the `target` string, try to stamp where possible.
    - Replace as many parts as possible and keep track of the indices where we place stamps.
    - After each stamping, update the `target`, and continue until we fully transform `target` to its initial state.

2. **Reverse Order to Find Stamping Indices:**
    - Since we record the indices in the order we transform `target`, we will finally reverse this order to return the indices as needed.
    
3. **Character Matching:**
    - We will attempt to match `stamp` with part of `target` considering overlaps and partially-shadowed areas by already stamped parts (i.e., `?`).

4. **Terminating Conditions:**
    - If we are stuck and cannot make any further replacements, and the `target` is not fully transformed, we return an empty array indicating it's not possible.
    
This approach systematically transforms the `target` using a greedy strategy to place stamps and reverse the order of steps to produce the required sequence of stamping indices.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> movesToStamp(string stamp, string target) {
        vector<int> result;
        bool loop = true;
        int totalStamped = 0;
        int stampCount = 0;
        
        while (loop) {
            loop = false;
            
            // Check each window of size stamp in target
            for (int i = 0; i <= target.size() - stamp.size(); ++i) {
                int stamped = 0;

                // Check if we can stamp the current position
                if (canStamp(stamp, target, i)) {
                    stampCount = doStamp(stamp, target, i);
                    result.push_back(i);
                    totalStamped += stampCount;
                    loop = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If we have replaced the whole target string
        if (totalStamped == target.size()) {
            reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
            return result;
        }
        
        return {};
    }
    
private:
    bool canStamp(const string& stamp, const string& target, int pos) {
        int n = stamp.size();
        bool canStamp = false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (target[pos + i] == '?') continue;
            if (target[pos + i] != stamp[i]) return false;
            canStamp = true;
        }
        
        return canStamp;
    }
    
    int doStamp(const string& stamp, string& target, int pos) {
        int n = stamp.size();
        int stamped = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (target[pos + i] != '?') {
                target[pos + i] = '?';
                stamped++;
            }
        }
        
        return stamped;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N*M*(N-M+1)), where `N` is the length of the `target` and `M` is the length of the `stamp`. In the worst case, for each window in the `target`, we might have to check/attempt stamping several times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) apart from the space used to store the result array, as we manipulate the `target` string in place and use a fixed set of helper variables.
