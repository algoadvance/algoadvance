[Leetcode 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l915)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:
1. Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
2. `left` and `right` are non-empty.
3. `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the length of `left` after such a partitioning.

You may assume that all elements of `nums` are unique.
The test cases are generated such that there is always a valid answer.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   - The array size can range from 2 to 30000 elements.
2. Can the numbers in `nums` be negative?
   - Yes, there is no constraint on the sign of the integers.

## Strategy
1. **Track Maximum and Min Arrays**: 
   - Use two auxiliary arrays:
     - `max_left[i]` which stores the maximum value from `nums[0]` to `nums[i]`
     - `min_right[j]` which stores the minimum value from `nums[j]` to `nums[nums.size() - 1]`
2. **Populate the Arrays**:
   - Populate `max_left` by iterating from left to right.
   - Populate `min_right` by iterating from right to left.
3. **Find Partition Point**:
   - Iterate through the array with the condition where `max_left[i] <= min_right[i + 1]` and return the index `i + 1`.

## Code
Here is the C++ code for the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int partitionDisjoint(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> max_left(n), min_right(n);
    
    // Initialize the max_left array
    max_left[0] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        max_left[i] = std::max(max_left[i - 1], nums[i]);
    }

    // Initialize the min_right array
    min_right[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        min_right[i] = std::min(min_right[i + 1], nums[i]);
    }

    // Find the partition point
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        if (max_left[i] <= min_right[i + 1]) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }

    // It is guaranteed that there is always a valid partition
    return -1;  // This line should never be reached
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** since:
  - Constructing the `max_left` array requires a single pass through the array: O(n).
  - Constructing the `min_right` array also requires a single pass through the array: O(n).
  - Finding the partition point requires another single pass through the array: O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is `3 * O(n)` which simplifies to **O(n)**. 

- The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the additional arrays `max_left` and `min_right` of size `n`.
