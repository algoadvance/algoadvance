[Leetcode 1900. The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1900)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of players in a tournament, which are initially standing in a single line. The players are numbered from 1 to n (1-based). In each round, every pair of players (first player from the start and the first player from the end) compete against each other, and the winners move on to the next round.

The tournament ends when only one player remains or if there are no more pairs to form. Here, you need to determine the earliest possible round and the latest possible round in which two specific players `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` can compete against each other.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
Output: [3, 4]
Explanation:
In the first round: players 1 and 11 compete, 2 and 10, 3 and 9, 4 and 8, 5 and 7, and player 6 automatically goes to the next round.
In the second round: players 1 and 6 compete, 2 and 9, 3 and 8, and 4 and 7.
In the third round: players 1 and 4, 2 and 3. Now 2 and 3 can compete against each other in the earliest round possible.
The latest possible round, they remain in competition until one of them wins. Given the constraints, round 4 is the latest round in which they can compete.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do the players necessarily have to compete in every round?**
   - Yes, the elimination happens in each round until there is only one player left standing.

2. **Is the player numbering continuous and inclusive of all integers from 1 to n?**
   - Yes, player numbers go from 1 to n, and everyone competes, paired from start to end of the line.

3. **What happens if `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` compete early in the rounds?**
   - We need to find out both the earliest and latest rounds in which they can possibly compete if they are to face each other in the tournament.

### Strategy

1. **Simulate the Tournament:**
   - Model each round of the tournament, progressively halving the number of players each time.
   - Track the rounds in which `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` can possibly face off using their indexes.
   
2. **Determine First Round:**
   - Simulate rounds until the two players meet for the first time.

3. **Determine Last Round:**
   - Simulate the scenario where the players avoid each other as long as possible until it's inevitable they face off.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

pair<int, int> earliestAndLatest(int n, int firstPlayer, int secondPlayer) {
    vector<int> positions(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
        positions[i] = i + 1;

    int earliest = -1, latest = -1, round = 1;
    while (positions.size() > 1) {
        vector<int> nextRound;
        int left = 0, right = positions.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            bool firstInThisPair = false, secondInThisPair = false;

            if (positions[left] == firstPlayer || positions[right] == firstPlayer)
                firstInThisPair = true;
            if (positions[left] == secondPlayer || positions[right] == secondPlayer)
                secondInThisPair = true;

            if (firstInThisPair && secondInThisPair) {
                if (earliest == -1)
                    earliest = round;
                latest = round;
            }

            if (firstInThisPair || secondInThisPair) {
                if (positions[left] == firstPlayer || positions[right] == firstPlayer)
                    nextRound.push_back(firstPlayer);
                else
                    nextRound.push_back(secondPlayer);
            } else {
                nextRound.push_back(positions[left]);
            }

            ++left;
            --right;
        }

        positions = nextRound;
        ++round;
    }

    return {earliest, latest};
}

int main() {
    int n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4;
    auto result = earliestAndLatest(n, firstPlayer, secondPlayer);
    cout << "Earliest: " << result.first << ", Latest: " << result.second << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this strategy is `O(n log n)`. This is derived from the fact that in each round the number of players roughly halves, and each round requires linear time through the pairs of players. Thus, the overall complexity can be understood as linear logarithmic.
