[Leetcode 2906. Construct Product Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2906)
### Problem Statement

Given two sparse matrices `a` and `b`, your task is to compute the matrix product of `a` and `b`. A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero.

Two matrices `a` of size `m x n` and `b` of size `n x p` can be multiplied if the number of columns in `a` is equal to the number of rows in `b` (i.e., `n`), resulting in a matrix `c` of size `m x p`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Specifications**:
   - How are the sparse matrices given? Are they in the form of two-dimensional arrays or in any specific sparse matrix representation (like CSR or COO)?
   
2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Should the result be in the form of a regular matrix or a specific sparse representation?
   - Are there any specific constraints on the size of the matrices?

3. **Zero Elements**:
   - Do we need to keep track of zeros explicitly, or can we ignore them entirely due to sparsity?

Once these questions are clarified, we can move forward with the implementation.

### Code

Here's the code to multiply two sparse matrices represented as 2D arrays:

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> multiply(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
    int m = A.size(); // number of rows in A
    int n = A[0].size(); // number of columns in A (and rows in B)
    int p = B[0].size(); // number of columns in B
    
    vector<vector<int>> result(m, vector<int>(p, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            if (A[i][k] != 0) {
                for (int j = 0; j < p; j++) {
                    if (B[k][j] != 0) {
                        result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: 
   - Ensure matrix `A` has dimensions `m x n` and matrix `B` has dimensions `n x p`.
   
2. **Sparse Multiplication Concept**:
   - Iterate through each element in matrix `A`.
   - For each non-zero element in `A`, compute its contributions to the resulting matrix `C`.
   - For a non-zero element `A[i][k]`, it contributes to every position in the result `C` that corresponds to column `k` in `B`.

3. **Avoid Unnecessary Computations**:
   - Skip calculations involving zero elements to leverage the sparsity of the matrices for efficiency.

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: `O(m * n * p)` when the matrices are dense.
- **Optimized Average Case**: Reduced based on the number of non-zero elements in matrices `A` and `B`.
  
The complexity primarily depends on the actual values in the matrices rather than the overall matrix size, which generally provides a performance benefit for sparse matrices.
