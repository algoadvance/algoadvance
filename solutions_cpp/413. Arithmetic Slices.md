[Leetcode 413. Arithmetic Slices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l413)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of `nums`.

An arithmetic array is any contiguous subarray of `nums` where the difference between the consecutive elements is the same.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have three arithmetic slices in [1, 2, 3, 4]: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the minimum constraint on the length of the input array?
   **A:** The input array `nums` will have at least 1 element.
   
2. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers and zero?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain any integers, including negative numbers and zero.

3. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the array?
   **A:** Typically, for LeetCode problems, the array length might go up to 10,000 or more, but we'll write a general solution that should work within these common constraints.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the total arithmetic slices.
2. Traverse the array while checking for arithmetic slices:
   - For each possible slice, calculate the difference between consecutive elements.
   - If the difference remains constant for at least 3 elements (i.e., the minimum number needed for an arithmetic slice), it's a valid slice.
3. Track the number of valid slices that end at each position using a variable.
4. Sum up all valid slices found during the traversal.

### Code

Here's a C++ function to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        if (n < 3) return 0;  // An arithmetic slice must have at least 3 elements
        
        int totalSlices = 0;
        int currentSlices = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] == nums[i - 1] - nums[i - 2]) {
                ++currentSlices;
                totalSlices += currentSlices;
            } else {
                currentSlices = 0;
            }
        }

        return totalSlices;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once, which gives us linear time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. We use a constant amount of space for our variables, regardless of the input array size. 

This approach efficiently counts all arithmetic slices in a single pass through the array, leveraging the property of continuous arithmetic sequences.
