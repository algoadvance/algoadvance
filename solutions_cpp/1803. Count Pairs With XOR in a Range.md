[Leetcode 1803. Count Pairs With XOR in a Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1803)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `low` and `high`, return _the number of **good** pairs_.

A **pair** `(i, j)` is defined as:

- `0 <= i < j < nums.length`
- `low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the array size**: What is the maximum size for the array `nums`?
   - Typical upper bounds for problem sizes in LeetCode are around 10,000 or less.

2. **Value ranges**: What are the ranges of values for the integers in `nums`, `low`, and `high`?
   - Values in `nums` can range up to \(10^9\), and `low`/`high` up to \(10^9\) as well, making the differences potentially large.

3. **Expected output**: Are we expected to output a single integer which is the count of all such pairs?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

We need to count the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` such that `low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high`. A brute-force solution (checking all possible pairs) would be inefficient given the constraints. 

Instead, we can leverage a prefix tree (Trie) to efficiently count the pairs:
1. Insert numbers into a Trie.
2. For each number, use the Trie to count the numbers that give XOR results within the specified range `[low, high]`.

### Steps:
1. Implement a Trie with insertion and counting functions specifically tailored for XOR operations.
2. For each number in `nums`, count how many previously inserted numbers satisfy the condition when XORed with the current number.
3. Use the Trie to efficiently check the XOR conditions.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[2] = {nullptr, nullptr};
    int count = 0;
};

class Trie {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
public:
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    void insert(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (!node->children[bit]) {
                node->children[bit] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[bit];
            node->count++;
        }
    }
    
    int countLessThan(int num, int limit) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (!node) break;
            int numBit = (num >> i) & 1;
            int limitBit = (limit >> i) & 1;
            if (limitBit) {
                if (node->children[numBit]) {
                    count += node->children[numBit]->count;
                }
                node = node->children[1 - numBit];
            } else {
                node = node->children[numBit];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<int>& nums, int low, int high) {
        Trie trie;
        int res = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            res += trie.countLessThan(num, high + 1) - trie.countLessThan(num, low);
            trie.insert(num);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insertion**: O(32) for each number in `nums`, leading to O(32 * n) for `n` numbers.
- **Counting XOR pairs**: O(32) for each number in `nums`, similar reasoning as above.
- **Overall complexity**: O(32 * n) for inserting all numbers and counting pairs.

Given our constraints, this approach is efficient and feasible.
