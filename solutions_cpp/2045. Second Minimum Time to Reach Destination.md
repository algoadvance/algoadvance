[Leetcode 2045. Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2045)
## Problem Statement

You are given a directed weighted graph of `n` nodes and `m` edges and an integer `time` which represents the time it takes to traverse any edge. You are also given an array `change` where `change[i]` represents how often in seconds the traffic light at node `i + 1` changes. Initially, all traffic lights are green. The graph doesn't necessarily connect all nodes. You are required to find the second minimum time it takes to travel from node `1` to node `n` (1-indexed). If it is not possible to reach from node `1` to node `n` for the second time, return `-1`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input:
n = 5
edges = [[1,2,2],[1,3,3],[2,4,3],[3,4,2],[4,5,2]]
time = 3
change = [5,5,5,5,5]

Output:
13

Explanation:
The graph has a shortest path from node 1 to node 5: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 with time cost 8.
The second shortest path is 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 with time cost 13.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all nodes connected?**
   - No, nodes in the graph are not necessarily connected.
   
2. **Are edge weights and `change` values guaranteed to be within a specified range?**
   - We assume `time` and `change` values are positive integers.
   
3. **Is it guaranteed that there is at least one path from node `1` to node `n`?**
   - It is not guaranteed. If there is no second minimum time to reach node `n`, we return `-1`.

## Strategy

### BFS with Priority Queue
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
   
2. **Tracking Paths:**
   - Use a combination of BFS and a priority queue (min-heap) to track paths and their respective times.
   
3. **Traffic Light Calculation:**
   - Adjust time based on traffic light changes by calculating when to wait for green lights.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Parse the input to create a graph using an adjacency list.
2. Implement a BFS using a priority queue to explore shortest paths.
3. Keep track of distinct times to reach each node using a dictionary.
4. Ignore paths already visited twice to avoid unnecessary calculations.
5. Use the `change` value to calculate the waiting times at nodes.

### Time Complexity
Time complexity of the algorithm is \(O((E + V) \log V)\), where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices, due to the priority queue operations.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int secondMinimum(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int time, vector<int>& change) {
        // Create adjacency list for the graph
        vector<vector<int>> graph(n + 1);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].emplace_back(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].emplace_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Priority queue to facilitate BFS with time tracking
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<>> pq;
        pq.push({0, 1});  // (time, node)
        
        // Dictionary to track visit times for each node
        unordered_map<int, set<int>> times;
        times[1].insert(0);

        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto [curr_time, node] = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
          
            // Explore all neighbors
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                int travel_time = curr_time + time;
                int total_change = change[neighbor - 1];

                // Traffic signal adjustment
                if ((curr_time / total_change) % 2 == 1) {
                    travel_time = (curr_time / total_change + 1) * total_change + time;
                }
                
                if (times[neighbor].size() < 2) {
                    times[neighbor].insert(travel_time);
                    pq.push({travel_time, neighbor});
                }
                
                // Maintain only the shortest and second shortest times to a node
                if (times[neighbor].size() == 3) {
                    auto it = times[neighbor].end();
                    --it;
                    times[neighbor].erase(it);
                }
            }
        }
        
        if (times[n].size() < 2) return -1;
        auto it = times[n].begin();
        ++it;
        return *it;
    }
};
```

This solution ensures the second minimum time is accurately found by tracking the distinct times. If only one or zero paths exist, it returns `-1` as required.
