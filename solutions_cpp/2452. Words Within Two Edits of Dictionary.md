[Leetcode 2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2452)
### Problem Statement
You are given two arrays, `queries` and `dictionary`. A query word is considered to be within two edits of a dictionary word if the edit distance (Levenshtein distance) between the query word and the dictionary word is at most two.

An edit operation can be:
1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

Return a list of all query words that are within two edits of at least one word in the dictionary.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the words in `queries` and `dictionary`?
   - How many words can `queries` and `dictionary` contain?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output list preserve the order of the `queries`?

### Strategy
Given the nature of the problem:
1. Loop through each word in `queries`.
2. For each query word, loop through each word in `dictionary`.
3. Compute the edit distance between the query word and the dictionary word.
4. If the edit distance is less than or equal to 2, add the query word to the result list.
5. Use a helper function to compute the edit distance between two words.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

// Function to compute the edit distance between two words
int editDistance(const string &a, const string &b) {
    int m = a.size();
    int n = b.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, n + 1);

    for (int i = 0; i <= m; ++i)
        dp[i][0] = i;
    for (int j = 0; j <= n; ++j)
        dp[0][j] = j;

    for (int i = 1; i <= m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; // No change required
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + min({dp[i - 1][j],    // Deletion
                                    dp[i][j - 1],    // Insertion
                                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] // Replacement
                                   });
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[m][n];
}

vector<string> twoEditsAway(vector<string>& queries, vector<string>& dictionary) {
    vector<string> result;

    for (const string &query : queries) {
        for (const string &dictWord : dictionary) {
            if (editDistance(query, dictWord) <= 2) {
                result.push_back(query);
                break; // No need to check this query with other dictionary words
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Edit Distance Calculation**: The edit distance computation for two words of length `m` and `n` takes O(m * n) time.
- **Overall Complexity**: If `Q` is the number of query words and `D` is the number of dictionary words, and `L` is the average length of the words, the overall time complexity is O(Q * D * L^2). This is because for each query word, we may compare it with each dictionary word, and each comparison takes O(L^2).

### Example
Given:

```cpp
vector<string> queries = {"hello", "world", "leetcode"};
vector<string> dictionary = {"hell", "word", "leet", "code"};

vector<string> result = twoEditsAway(queries, dictionary);

// Output should be: ["hello", "world", "leetcode"] since each word is within two edits of at least one dictionary word.
```

This solution effectively checks each query word against the dictionary to find words that are within two edits based on the Levenshtein distance criteria.
