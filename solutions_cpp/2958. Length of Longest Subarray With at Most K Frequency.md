[Leetcode 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2958)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest subarray such that each element appears at most `k` times in that subarray.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements in the array integers?**
   * Yes, the array consists of integers.
   
2. **Can `k` be zero?**
   * No, you can assume `k` is always positive.

3. **What should be returned if the array is empty?**
   * Return 0 if the input array is empty.

4. **Can elements be negative?**
   * Yes, elements can be negative or positive integers.

5. **What is the expected time complexity?**
   * Ideally, we should aim for an efficient solution, potentially O(n).

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using a sliding window approach:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Data Structures:** Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the current window. Use an unordered map to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window.

2. **Expand the Window:** Move the `right` pointer to expand the window and include new elements while updating their frequencies in the map.

3. **Validate the Window:** If at any point the frequency of any element exceeds `k`, increment the `left` pointer to shrink the window until all elements meet the criteria.

4. **Track the Maximum Length:** Keep track of the maximum length of valid subarrays encountered during the process.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubarrayWithKFreq(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;

        int left = 0, maxLength = 0;
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
            int currentElement = nums[right];
            freqMap[currentElement]++;
            
            // Validate and potentially shrink the window from the left
            while (freqMap[currentElement] > k) {
                freqMap[nums[left]]--;
                if (freqMap[nums[left]] == 0) {
                    freqMap.erase(nums[left]);
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            // Calculate the length of the current valid subarray
            maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of unique elements in the `nums` array stored in the `freqMap`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the longest subarray where each element appears at most `k` times using a linear time sliding window approach.
