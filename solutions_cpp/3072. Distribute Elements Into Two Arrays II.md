[Leetcode 3072. Distribute Elements Into Two Arrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3072)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of size `2n`, you need to partition the element into two arrays (array1 and array2) such that:

1. Both array1 and array2 each contain exactly `n` elements.
2. The absolute sum difference between the sums of array1 and array2 is minimized. In other words, you need to minimize `|sum(array1) - sum(array2)|`.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be zero?**
   - No, `n` will always be a positive integer because `nums` has size `2n`.

2. **Can the elements of `nums` be negative?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.

3. **What is the range of elements within `nums`?**
   - Typically, elements will be within a reasonable integer range.
   
4. **Is performance a key concern in this problem?**
   - Yes, since the problem can have a large input size (array size up to 2n), efficient algorithms are needed.

### Strategy

We need to partition the array into two subsets such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimized. This problem is equivalent to a "Partition Problem" and can be solved using dynamic programming or backtracking, but both approaches can be computationally expensive for larger arrays.

We can use the following steps to solve this:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the array:**
   Let `S` be the total sum of the array `nums`. Our goal is to find two subsets whose sums are as close to `S/2` as possible.

2. **Use Dynamic Programming:**
   Create a DP table to verify what sums can be made with `n` elements from `nums`.

3. **Finding the Closest Partition:**
   Use the DP table to find the sum closest to `S/2` that can be made with `n` elements. The absolute difference would be minimized by checking the sums close to `S/2`.

### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits>
#include <unordered_set>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size() / 2;
        int totalSum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0);

        // Generate possible sums for each subset size up to n
        std::vector<std::unordered_set<int>> possibleSums(n + 1);
        possibleSums[0].insert(0);

        // Using subset sums approach
        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
                for (int sum : possibleSums[i - 1]) {
                    possibleSums[i].insert(sum + num);
                }
            }
        }

        int target = totalSum / 2;
        int minDifference = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
        
        // Check possible sums for n elements to minimize the difference
        for (int sum : possibleSums[n]) {
            minDifference = std::min(minDifference, std::abs(totalSum - 2 * sum));
        }

        return minDifference;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 6, 11, 5};
    int result = solution.minimumDifference(nums);
    std::cout << "Minimum absolute sum difference: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Computing Sums:** `O(n * 2^n)`
  - The worst-case scenario for generating subset sums is `O(n * 2^n)` because we consider each subset of size `n`.

- **Total Complexity:**
  - The complexity essentially boils down to `O(n * 2^n)`, given that subset sum problems might require exponential time.

### Space Complexity

- **DP Table:** `O(n * 2^n)`
  - We need space to store possible sums for subsets of size `n`.

This solution leverages the balance between computational feasibility and algorithmic efficiency for reasonably large arrays.
