[Leetcode 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l374)
### Problem Statement

The "Guess Number Higher or Lower" is a classic problem in computer algorithms. Here is the formal problem statement:

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

- I pick a number from 1 to `n`. 
- You have to guess which number I picked.
- Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results:
- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked.
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked.
- `0`: Your guess is equal to the number I picked.

Your goal is to find the number I picked.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the typical value range of `n`? Although the general approach wouldn't change, the value of `n` might impact the efficiency details.
2. **Number of guesses**: Is there a constraint on the maximum number of guesses allowed?
3. **Thread Safety**: Is the environment multi-threaded, or can we assume single-threaded execution?
4. **Return Value**: Should our function return the picked number when guessed correctly, or handle the result differently?

Given common conventions and based on the problem statement, we can assume:
- `n` can be any value within the typical bounds of an integer.
- The function returns the guessed number.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, a binary search algorithm is appropriate, leveraging the feedback provided by the `guess(int num)` API. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to 1 and `n`, respectively.
2. Perform a binary search:
   - Calculate the middle point: `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.
   - Call the `guess(mid)` API with the middle point.
   - If `guess(mid)` returns `0`, we have found the number.
   - If `guess(mid)` returns `-1`, the target number is lower, so adjust `high`.
   - If `guess(mid)` returns `1`, the target number is higher, so adjust `low`.
3. Repeat until the number is found.

This algorithm ensures a logarithmic time complexity due to the halving of the search interval in each step.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
// Forward declaration of guess API.
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1, high = n;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int res = guess(mid);
            
            if (res == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (res == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // This line should never be reached if input is valid.
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is **O(log n)**:

- In each iteration, the search range is halved.
- Thus, to reduce the range down to 1 element, it takes at most `log2(n)` iterations.

The space complexity is **O(1)** as only a fixed amount of extra space (variables `low`, `high`, `mid`, `res`) is used.

This approach ensures efficiency and simplicity in finding the correct number.
