[Leetcode 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1559)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of characters, determine if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in the grid. A cycle is defined as a path where the starting node is the same as the ending node, and it contains at least four nodes. You can move in the four possible directions (up, down, left, right) from one node to another.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the size range of the grid (number of rows and columns)?
   - Can characters in the grid be any arbitrary characters, or are they restricted to certain values?

   **Response**: The grid size constraints are typically up to 100x100. Characters can be any character from the lowercase English alphabet.

2. **Cycle Definition**:
   - A cycle must revisit the starting point and contain at least four nodes. Does diagonal movement count towards forming a cycle?

   **Response**: No, only movements in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) are allowed.

### Strategy

We will use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid and detect cycles. The DFS will be modified to backtrack if it cycles back to a previously visited node that forms a cycle according to the problem's constraints.

#### Steps to Solve:

1. Iterate through every cell in the grid.
2. Use DFS to explore all possible paths starting from that cell.
3. Keep track of the parent node to avoid immediate backtracking.
4. Use a visited matrix to mark the nodes visited in the current DFS path.
5. Check if moving to a previously visited node (other than the parent) forms a valid cycle.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool containsCycle(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int rows = grid.size();
        int cols = grid[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(rows, vector<bool>(cols, false));
        
        // Directions: up, down, left, right
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        
        auto isValid = [&](int x, int y) {
            return x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols;
        };
        
        function<bool(int, int, int, int, char)> dfs = [&](int x, int y, int px, int py, char ch) {
            if (visited[x][y]) return true;
            visited[x][y] = true;

            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir.first;
                int ny = y + dir.second;
                
                if (isValid(nx, ny) && !(nx == px && ny == py) && grid[nx][ny] == ch) {
                    if (dfs(nx, ny, x, y, ch)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
            return false;
        };
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j) {
                if (!visited[i][j]) {
                    if (dfs(i, j, -1, -1, grid[i][j])) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot M)\), where \(N\) is the number of rows and \(M\) is the number of columns. Each cell is visited once, and DFS operation is bounded by the size of the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot M)\), for the `visited` matrix and the implicit call stack used by DFS.

This solution effectively checks for cycles in the grid and ensures all conditions of the cycle are met based on the given constraints.
