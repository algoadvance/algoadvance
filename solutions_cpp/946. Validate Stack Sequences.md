[Leetcode 946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l946)
### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, and each of them being a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. The task is to return `true` if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Will the length of `pushed` and `popped` arrays be the same?**
   - Yes, the lengths of both arrays will be the same.

2. **Are all values in `pushed` and `popped` unique and within the same range?**
   - Yes, all values are unique and are permutations of the integers from `1` to `n` where `n` is the length of the arrays.

3. **Can we assume that input arrays are valid permutations?**
   - Yes, the input arrays are valid permutations of integers from `1` to `n`.

### Strategy:
1. Use a stack to simulate the push and pop operations.
2. Iterate through each element in the `pushed` array, pushing elements onto the stack.
3. After each push operation, check if the top of the stack matches the next element needed in the `popped` array.
4. If it matches, pop the element from the stack and move to the next element in the `popped` array.
5. Continue the process until all elements have been processed.
6. If the stack is empty after processing both arrays entirely, it means the sequences are valid, otherwise, they are not.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

bool validateStackSequences(std::vector<int>& pushed, std::vector<int>& popped) {
    std::stack<int> stack;
    int popIndex = 0;

    for (int elem : pushed) {
        stack.push(elem);
        // Check if the next element to pop matches the top of the stack
        while (!stack.empty() && stack.top() == popped[popIndex]) {
            stack.pop();
            popIndex++;
        }
    }

    // If the stack is empty, all operations have matched successfully
    return stack.empty();
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where `n` is the number of elements in the `pushed` array.
  
### Explanation:
- `for (int elem : pushed)`: Iterate through each element in `pushed`. This is O(n) because we visit each element once.
- The inner `while` loop: Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, resulting in a total of O(n) operations for the stack operations.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
