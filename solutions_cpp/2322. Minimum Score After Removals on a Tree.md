[Leetcode 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2322)
### Problem Statement
You're given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` edges. Each node has a value associated with it, given by the array `values`. You need to remove exactly two edges from the tree to split it into three non-empty connected components. The score of splitting the tree like that is the XOR of the nodes' values in each of the three components. Your task is to find the minimum score after removing exactly two edges.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:**
   - An integer `n` representing the number of nodes.
   - A list of integers `values` where `values[i]` is the value associated with node `i`.
   - A list of `n-1` edges, each represented by a pair of integers `[u, v]` indicating an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
   
2. **Output:**
   - An integer representing the minimum possible score after removing two edges.

3. **Assumptions:**
   - All node values are non-negative integers.
   - `values` array length and edges list are consistent with the tree structure (i.e., `values` has `n` elements and `edges` has `n-1` elements).

### Strategy
1. **Tree Representation and Preprocessing:**
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
   - Compute the XOR value of the entire tree.

2. **DFS for Subtree XOR Computation:**
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to compute XOR values for subtrees rooted at each node.

3. **Combination of Edge Removals:**
   - For each pair of removable edges, calculate the resulting XOR values for the three components formed and track the minimum score.

4. **Evaluate XOR Scores:**
   - Removing two edges splits the tree into three components; compute the XOR for each component and calculate their XOR score.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumScore(vector<int>& values, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = values.size();
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n);
        
        // Build adjacency list
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        vector<int> subtreeXOR(n, 0);
        dfs(0, -1, adj, values, subtreeXOR);
        
        int totalXor = subtreeXOR[0];
        int minScore = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (adj[i].empty() || adj[j].empty()) continue;
                
                // Calculate XOR for three components
                int component1 = subtreeXOR[i];
                int component2 = subtreeXOR[j];
                int component3 = totalXor ^ component1 ^ component2;
                
                int score = max({component1, component2, component3}) 
                          - min({component1, component2, component3});
                
                minScore = min(minScore, score);
            }
        }
        
        return minScore;
    }

private:
    void dfs(int node, int parent, const vector<vector<int>>& adj, const vector<int>& values, vector<int>& subtreeXOR) {
        subtreeXOR[node] = values[node];
        
        for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            
            dfs(neighbor, node, adj, values, subtreeXOR);
            subtreeXOR[node] ^= subtreeXOR[neighbor];
        }
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **DFS computation:** `O(n)` for the traversal to compute all subtree XOR values.
- **Combination evaluation:** `O(E^2)` where `E` is the number of edges, thus leading to `O(n^2)` in the bad case.
- Overall, the complexity is `O(n^2)` due to evaluating pairs of edges.
