[Leetcode 2472. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2472)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to determine the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings of minimum length `k` that can be found in the string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` will be between 1 and 1000.
2. **What is the range of the integer `k`?**
   - `k` will be between 1 and the length of the string `s`.
3. **Are there any constraints on the palindrome substrings (e.g., case sensitivity)?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but usually, palindrome checks are case-insensitive.
4. **Does the string contain only alphanumeric characters or could there be special characters as well?**
   - Assuming the string contains only alphanumeric characters unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy
1. **Palindrome Check:**
   - Implement a helper function to check if a given substring is a palindrome.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming / Greedy Approach:**
   - Use a two-pointer technique to iterate through the string and use the palindrome checking function to find non-overlapping palindromes.
   - Maintain a counter to track the maximum number of non-overlapping palindromes.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome
bool isPalindrome(const string& s, int start, int end) {
    while (start < end) {
        if (s[start] != s[end]) {
            return false;
        }
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    return true;
}

int maxPalindromes(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    int count = 0;
    int i = 0;

    while (i <= n - k) {
        bool found = false;
        // We will look for the longest palindrome starting at index i
        for (int j = i + k - 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, i, j)) {
                count++;
                i = j + 1;  // Move past the found palindrome
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            i++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    int k;
    cin >> s >> k;
    cout << maxPalindromes(s, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Palindrome check:** Each palindrome check takes O(Length of the substring), which is O(n) in the worst case.
- **Overall Complexity:** The outer loop runs at most n times and the inner loop runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop. Despite this, since we skip over parts of the string that are identified as palindromes, the practical complexity is closer to O(n).

In the worst case, this approach might seem to be O(n^2) due to nested loops but skipping will considerably reduce the practical runtime.
