[Leetcode 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l222)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

A **complete** binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the number of nodes in the tree?
   - Can the tree be empty?

2. **Output Specification**:
   - Do we need to return the result as an integer?
   
3. **Function Signature**:
   - What should be the function signature? For example: `int countNodes(TreeNode* root)`?

## Code

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int left_depth = getDepth(root->left);
        int right_depth = getDepth(root->right);

        if (left_depth == right_depth) {
            return (1 << left_depth) + countNodes(root->right);
        } else {
            return (1 << right_depth) + countNodes(root->left);
        }
    }
    
private:
    int getDepth(TreeNode* node) {
        int depth = 0;
        while (node) {
            depth++;
            node = node->left;
        }
        return depth;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Complete Binary Tree**:
   - In a complete binary tree, the leftmost path gives the maximum depth.
   - Each complete binary tree can be divided into a perfect binary tree and a subtree of another complete binary tree.

2. **Recursion Approach**:
   - The depth of the left and right subtrees can help decide whether:
     - Left subtree is a perfect binary tree.
     - Right subtree is a perfect binary tree.
   - Using this property allows us to count the nodes efficiently without traversing all nodes.

3. **Perfect Binary Tree Nodes**:
   - If the left and right subtree depths are the same, then the left subtree is a perfect binary tree.
   - Number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of depth `d` is `2^d - 1`.
   
4. **Counting Nodes**:
   - Use the depth information to determine whether the left or right subtree is perfect.
   - Calculate the number of nodes in the perfect subtree using `1 << depth`.
   - Recursively count nodes in the subtree that is not perfect.

## Time Complexity

- **Depth Calculation**: 
  - Calculating the depth of a subtree takes `O(log n)` where `n` is the number of nodes.
  
- **Recursive Traversal**:
  - Each recursive step reduces the problem size by approximately half, leading to a logarithmic number of recursive calls.
  
- **Overall**: 
  - The overall time complexity is `O(log^2 n)` because at each level of recursion, depth calculation is `O(log n)` and there are `O(log n)` levels due to the halving nature of each step.

This approach leverages the properties of complete binary trees to achieve an efficient counting method.
