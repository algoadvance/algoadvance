[Leetcode 890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l890)
Sure, let's break down the solution for the LeetCode problem "890. Find and Replace Pattern". Here we will discuss the problem statement, potential clarifications, a detailed strategy, code implementation in C++, and analysis of the time complexity.

### Problem Statement
You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`. You need to return a list of `words` that match the given `pattern`.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters such that `pattern` could be transformed into the `word`. Match the pattern means that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a letter in `word`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Length of Words and Pattern**: Do all the words in the `words` list and the `pattern` have the same length?
   - **Clarification**: Yes, all the strings are of the same length.
   
2. **Character Set**: Are the words and pattern strictly lower-case English letters (a-z)?
   - **Clarification**: Yes, they are all lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, you need to compare the structure of each word with the pattern. This can be achieved using a mapping mechanism to ensure each character in the word maps to a character in the pattern uniquely and vice versa.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:
1. **Normalization**: Create a helper function to normalize both the word and the pattern. Transform the word/pattern such that characters are replaced by their first occurrence indices.
2. **Mapping Check**: For the word and pattern to match, their normalized forms must be identical.
3. **Normalization Process**: For example, "abb" would be normalized to "011", because the first character is 'a' at index 0, the second character 'b' is new so gets 1, and the third character, also 'b', gets the same number 1.

### Code
Here is the C++ implementation of the strategy outlined:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

vector<int> normalize(const string& s) {
    unordered_map<char, int> char_to_index;
    vector<int> normalized;
    for (char c : s) {
        if (char_to_index.find(c) == char_to_index.end()) {
            char_to_index[c] = char_to_index.size();
        }
        normalized.push_back(char_to_index[c]);
    }
    return normalized;
}

vector<string> findAndReplacePattern(vector<string>& words, string pattern) {
    vector<string> result;
    vector<int> pattern_norm = normalize(pattern);
    
    for (const string& word : words) {
        if (normalize(word) == pattern_norm) {
            result.push_back(word);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Normalization Function**: Normalizing a single word or the pattern takes O(L) time, where L is the length of the word/pattern.
- **Overall Complexity**:
  - Normalizing the pattern: O(L)
  - Normalizing each word and comparison: For N words, each of length L, it takes O(N * L).
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(N * L), where N is the number of words and L is the length of each word/pattern.

This approach ensures a clear, concise, and efficient solution to identify and select words matching the given pattern in terms of structural character mapping.
