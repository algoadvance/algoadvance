[Leetcode 1680. Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1680)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of `1` to `n` in order, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum value of `n`?**
   - Clarification: The value of `n` can go up to `10^5`.

2. **How should overflow be handled?**
   - The result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Are there any constraints on time complexity?**
   - Efficient solutions are expected due to the constraints, ideally linear time complexity in terms of `n`.

### Strategy

The overall strategy is to traverse through the numbers from `1` to `n`, convert each number to its binary representation, concatenate these binary strings in an efficient mathematical manner, and then compute the resultant value modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Concatenation in Binary:** For each number `i` from `1` to `n`, compute its binary length `len`. This can be obtained using `bit_length()` in some languages, or by repeatedly dividing the number by `2`.
2. **Shift left:** Shift the current concatenated result left by `len` bits (`shift left` equivalent to multiplying by `2^len`).
3. **Add the new number:** Add `i` to the shifted result.
4. **Modulo Operation:** Since we can have very large numbers, we take modulo `10^9 + 7` at every step to prevent overflow.

### Code

Below is the C++ implementation following this strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1'000'000'007;
        long long result = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            // Number of bits in the current number i
            int len = 0;
            int x = i;
            while (x > 0) {
                len++;
                x >>= 1; // Equivalent to x = x / 2
            }
            // Shift the current result left by len bits and add the current number i
            result = ((result << len) % MOD + i) % MOD;
        }
        return static_cast<int>(result);
    }
};

// Example usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 12;
    std::cout << "The result is: " << sol.concatenatedBinary(n) << std::endl; // Example input
    return 0;
}
```
### Time Complexity

- The main loop runs `n` times, which is `O(n)`.
- Inside the loop, shifting and bitwise operations are `O(1)` for each number.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**. The solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the result is computed in linear time.
