[Leetcode 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1372)
### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree. A ZigZag path for a binary tree starts at any node and follows these rules:

1. You can move from a node to its left child if you came from its right child, and vice versa.
2. You cannot move to a nodeâ€™s left child if you came from its left child, and vice versa.

A ZigZag path in a binary tree is defined as a path that follows the above rules. Your objective is to return the length of the longest ZigZag path in the binary tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - Are there any constraints on the number of nodes in the tree?
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should we return if the tree is empty?
   - How do we handle a tree with only one node?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is suitable. We need to keep track of the length of the ZigZag path for every node when we move either left or right. 

We will maintain two states for DFS:
1. Moving Left from Right (i.e., the last move was to a right child, and the current move is to a left child).
2. Moving Right from Left (i.e., the last move was to a left child, and the current move is to a right child).

We'll use a recursive DFS function that calculates the length for both states at each node while simultaneously updating the maximum ZigZag path found.

### Code

```cpp
#include <algorithm>  // For std::max
#include <iostream>   // For std::cout
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int longestZigZag(TreeNode* root) {
        // Pair: {leftZigZag, rightZigZag}
        // leftZigZag -> if we move left from this node
        // rightZigZag -> if we move right from this node
        return dfs(root).first - 1;
    }

private:
    pair<int, int> dfs(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return {0, 0};
        
        // Recursively find the lengths of the ZigZag paths
        pair<int, int> left = dfs(node->left);
        pair<int, int> right = dfs(node->right);

        // Update the global result with the maximum between:
        // 1. Current zigzag length going left
        // 2. Current zigzag length going right
        int leftZigZag = 1 + left.second;
        int rightZigZag = 1 + right.first;

        globalMax = max({globalMax, leftZigZag, rightZigZag});

        return {leftZigZag, rightZigZag};
    }

    int globalMax = 0;
};

int main() {
    // Construct a tree for testing
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(7);

    Solution sol;
    int result = sol.longestZigZag(root);
    cout << "Longest ZigZag Path Length: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the DFS.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(H)\) due to the recursive stack used in the DFS traversal, where \(H\) is the height of the binary tree. The worst case for space complexity is \(O(N)\) for a skewed tree. 

This strategy ensures that our solution is efficient and scalable even for larger binary trees.
