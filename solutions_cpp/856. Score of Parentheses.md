[Leetcode 856. Score of Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l856)
### Problem Statement

Given a balanced parentheses string `S`, compute the score of the string based on the following rules:

1. `()`: Provides a score of `1`.
2. `AB`: Where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings, the score is `A + B`.
3. `(A)`: Where `A` is a balanced parentheses string, the score is `2 * A`.

#### Example:
- Input: `"()"`, Output: `1`
- Input: `"(())"`, Output: `2`
- Input: `"()()"`, Output: `2`
- Input: `"(()(()))"`, Output: `6`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the input string be empty?
   - No, the input will always be a non-empty string.
2. Is the input guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses string?
   - Yes, the input is always a balanced parentheses string.

### Strategy:

We can solve this problem using a stack to help manage the nested structure of the parentheses. 

Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. Initialize a stack to keep track of the scores.
2. Traverse the string character by character.
3. When encountering `(`:
   - Push a marker or 0 onto the stack. This marker indicates the beginning of a new score calculation.
4. When encountering `)`:
   - Pop elements off the stack until encountering a marker.
   - Calculate the score for the current balanced substring based on the rules given.
   - Either `()` which contributes `1` or `(A)` which contributes `2 * A`. 
   - Push this score back to the stack to be added to any outer score.
5. Sum up all values left in the stack to compute the total score.

### Time Complexity:

The algorithm processes each character of the string exactly once. Hence, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int scoreOfParentheses(const std::string& S) {
    std::stack<int> stack;
    for (char c : S) {
        if (c == '(') {
            stack.push(0); // Use 0 as a marker for '('
        } else {
            int currentScore = 0;
            while (stack.top() != 0) {
                currentScore += stack.top();
                stack.pop();
            }
            stack.pop(); // remove the 0 marker
            // If `currentScore` is 0, it means we just closed `()`, score is `1`
            // Otherwise, `(A)` contributes `2 * A`
            stack.push(currentScore == 0 ? 1 : 2 * currentScore);
        }
    }

    int totalScore = 0;
    while (!stack.empty()) {
        totalScore += stack.top();
        stack.pop();
    }

    return totalScore;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "(()(()))";
    std::cout << "Score of Parentheses: " << scoreOfParentheses(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code should correctly compute the score for any balanced parentheses string, following the rules provided.
