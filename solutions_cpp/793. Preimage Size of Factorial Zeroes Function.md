[Leetcode 793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l793)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `k`, find how many non-negative integers `x` have the property that the number of trailing zeroes in `x!` (x factorial) is exactly `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range for `k`?**
   - Typically, `k` is a non-negative integer, but confirming the maximum possible value would help in determining the constraints.
2. **Examples for better understanding?**
   - For `k = 0`, the possible values of `x` are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` since `0!` to `4!` have exactly `0` trailing zeroes.
   - The function should return `5` because there are five integers that satisfy the condition.

### Strategy:
1. **Understanding trailing zeroes in a factorial:**
   - Trailing zeroes are produced by the factors of `10` in the factorial product.
   - Each `10` is formed by a pair of factors `2` and `5`. Since there are usually more `2`s than `5`s, the count of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of `5`s.

2. **Calculating trailing zeroes of `x!`:**
   - To find the number of trailing zeroes in `x!`, we sum the results of `x / 5`, `x / 25`, `x / 125`, etc.
   - This can be done using the function:
     ```cpp
     int trailingZeroes(int n) {
         int count = 0;
         while (n > 0) {
             n /= 5;
             count += n;
         }
         return count;
     }
     ```

3. **Determining preimage size for the given k:**
   - If we're looking for `k` trailing zeroes, we need to determine the interval [L, R] such that the number of trailing zeroes of factorials in this interval is exactly `k`.
   - Utilize binary search to find the lowest integer `L` such that the number of trailing zeroes is `k` and find the highest integer `R` such that the number of trailing zeroes is still `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is very large, there might be ranges where no factorial produces exactly `k` trailing zeroes. The mid-values will help in binary search to determine proper ranges.

### Code:
Here's the implementation of the solution using the above discussed strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

class Solution {
public:
    int preimageSizeFZF(int k) {
        return rightBound(k) - leftBound(k) + 1;
    }
    
private:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            n /= 5;
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    // Binary search for left bound of the range with exactly k trailing zeroes
    int leftBound(int k) {
        long low = 0, high = 5L * (k + 1);
        while (low < high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (trailingZeroes(mid) < k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
    
    // Binary search for right bound of the range with exactly k trailing zeroes
    int rightBound(int k) {
        long low = 0, high = 5L * (k + 1);
        while (low < high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (trailingZeroes(mid) <= k) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return low - 1;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int k = 5;
    std::cout << "Preimage size of FZF(" << k << ") is: " << solution.preimageSizeFZF(k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **`trailingZeroes` function:** O(log n) where n is the input number, due to the division by 5 in each step.
- **Binary Search functions `leftBound` and `rightBound`:** Each takes O(log (5 * (k + 1))) steps.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(log k * log k), since we may need to perform binary search up to log steps and each step involves logarithmic operations. 

This combination ensures that the approach is efficient and able to handle reasonably large values of `k`.
