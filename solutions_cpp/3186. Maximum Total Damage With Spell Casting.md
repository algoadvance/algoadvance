[Leetcode 3186. Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3186)
## Problem Statement

You are given three arrays: `baseDamage`, `spellDuration`, and `spellCastingOut`. 
- `baseDamage[i]` represents the base damage of the `i-th` spell.
- `spellDuration[i]` represents the duration of the `i-th` spell.
- `spellCastingOut[i]` represents the time that the `i-th` spell can't be cast after it has been used once.

Find the maximum total damage you can deal by casting a sequence of spells under the condition that each spell can only be cast once in any interval defined by its `spellCastingOut` value, meaning if you cast spell `i` at time `t`, you can't cast it again until time `t + spellCastingOut[i]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the duration over which we want to maximize the damage?
   - Is there a given total time?
2. Are the arrays always guaranteed to be of the same length?
3. Can damage values be negative?

Assuming the problem is simplified for maximum damage without conflicting with other details:

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. We need to sort spells based on their `spellCastingOut` values to try and fit as many high-damage spells as we can in the available time.
2. We need to manage the sequence of spells ensuring they donâ€™t overlap due to their `spellCastingOut` constraints.

### Steps
1. Combine the three arrays into a list of tuples for easier sorting and manipulation.
2. Sort the list based on the `spellCastingOut` value.
3. Traverse the list and add the `baseDamage` values of the spells to the total damage, ensuring that the `spellCastingOut` constraint is met.

Let's write it out in code:

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct Spell {
    int baseDamage;
    int spellDuration;
    int spellCastingOut;
};

bool compareSpells(const Spell &a, const Spell &b) {
    return a.spellCastingOut < b.spellCastingOut;
}

int maxTotalDamage(vector<int>& baseDamage, vector<int>& spellDuration, vector<int>& spellCastingOut) {
    int n = baseDamage.size();
    // Create a list of spells
    vector<Spell> spells;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        spells.push_back({baseDamage[i], spellDuration[i], spellCastingOut[i]});
    }
    // Sort spells based on spellCastingOut
    sort(spells.begin(), spells.end(), compareSpells);

    // Initialize variables
    int totalDamage = 0;             // Track the total damage dealt
    vector<bool> timeSlot(n, false); // Track spell casting statuses

    // Iterate over spells and calculate maximum damage
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        totalDamage += spells[i].baseDamage;
    }
    
    return totalDamage;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> baseDamage = {10, 20, 30};
    vector<int> spellDuration = {5, 10, 15};
    vector<int> spellCastingOut = {3, 2, 1};
    cout << "Max Damage: " << maxTotalDamage(baseDamage, spellDuration, spellCastingOut) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of spells. The subsequent traversal to calculate the total damage is linear, `O(n)`, thus the overall complexity is `O(n log n)`. This should be efficient for reasonably large values of `n`.

The given approach assumes no specific constraint on the total duration; it sorts the spells by their casting out periods and calculates the supposed maximum damage. Adjusting for specific constraints or intervals would require more details and would involve dynamic programming or greedy approaches to manage overlapping and durations explicitly.
