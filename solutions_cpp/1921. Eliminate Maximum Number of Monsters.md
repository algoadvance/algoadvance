[Leetcode 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1921)
### Problem Statement
You have n monsters and each monster starts moving towards the city at the same time. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `dist` of size `n` which gives the distance of each monster from the city. You are also given an integer array `speed` of size `n` which represents the speed of each monster. 

You can eliminate one monster per minute. The goal is to eliminate the maximum number of monsters before any of them reaches the city.

Write a function:
```cpp
int eliminateMaximum(vector<int>& dist, vector<int>& speed);
```

Return the maximum number of monsters you can eliminate before any of them reaches the city.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `n == dist.length == speed.length`
   - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 10^9`

2. **Output:**
   - An integer representing the maximum number of monsters that can be eliminated.

### Strategy
To maximize the number of monsters you can eliminate:
1. Compute the time it takes for each monster to reach the city.
2. Sort these times in ascending order because we want to prioritize eliminating the monsters that reach the city the earliest.
3. Start eliminating monsters one by one, and stop once you encounter a monster that arrives before or at the same time as you reach your elimination time.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int eliminateMaximum(vector<int>& dist, vector<int>& speed) {
    int n = dist.size();
    vector<double> arrivalTime(n);
    
    // Calculate the arrival time of each monster
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        arrivalTime[i] = static_cast<double>(dist[i]) / speed[i];
    }
    
    // Sort the arrival times
    sort(arrivalTime.begin(), arrivalTime.end());
    
    // Start eliminating monsters
    int eliminatedCount = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // If the next monster arrives before or at the current minute, break the loop
        if (arrivalTime[i] <= i) {
            break;
        }
        eliminatedCount++;
    }
    
    return eliminatedCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Calculating arrival times:** O(n) since we calculate it directly from the given `dist` and `speed` arrays.
- **Sorting the arrival times:** O(n log n) for sorting the array.
- **Eliminating monsters:** O(n) as we iterate through the sorted arrival times array once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sort operation.

This solution should be efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
