[Leetcode 2902. Count of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2902)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers `n` and `k`. Your task is to determine the number of sub-multisets of the set {1, 2, ..., n} whose sum is no greater than `k`.

A sub-multiset of a set is a multiset that can contain multiple instances of each element of the set. The following criteria should be met:
1. Each element in the sub-multiset is taken from the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
2. The sum of the elements in the sub-multiset is no greater than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Definition of a sub-multiset**:
   - A sub-multiset allows repeated elements from the original set, unlike a subset where each element is considered unique.

2. **Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints for `n` and `k`? (This helps to decide the efficiency and viability of the approach.)
   - Are there any specific edge cases to consider, such as very small or very large values for `n` and `k`?

Assuming standard constraints, such as \(1 \leq n, k \leq 1000\), let's move to strategy.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach. We will create a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of sub-multisets using the first `i` natural numbers (1 to i) that sum up to no greater than `j`.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a DP table `dp` of size \((n+1) \times (k+1)\) with all elements initialized to 0.
2. Set `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is one way to form a sum of 0 (using an empty multiset).
3. Iterate over each number from 1 to n.
4. For each number, update the DP table such that for each possible sum `s` (from the current number to k), we account for multiple occurrences of the current number.

Here's the detailed code implementation.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int countSubmultisets(int n, int k) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
    
    dp[0][0] = 1; // Base case: one way to form sum 0 with 0 elements
    
    for (int num = 1; num <= n; ++num) {
        for (int sum = 0; sum <= k; ++sum) {
            dp[num][sum] = dp[num-1][sum]; // Without taking num
            if (sum >= num) {
                dp[num][sum] += dp[num][sum-num]; // Taking num
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    int k = 9;
    cout << "Number of sub-multisets of {1, 2, ..., " << n << "} with sum <= " << k << " is: "
         << countSubmultisets(n, k) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(n \times k)\) because we are filling a DP table of size \((n + 1) \times (k + 1)\). Each cellâ€™s value in the DP table can be computed in constant time \(O(1)\).

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also \(O(n \times k)\) due to the DP table of size \((n + 1) \times (k + 1)\).

This approach efficiently computes the count of sub-multisets whose sum is no greater than `k`. If `n` and `k` are relatively large, say on the order of 1000, this complexity is manageable and should perform well within acceptable limits.
