[Leetcode 324. Wiggle Sort II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l324)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, reorder it such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...`. This is known as the Wiggle Sort. Specifically, we need to rearrange the elements to satisfy the following conditions:
- `nums[0] < nums[1]`
- `nums[1] > nums[2]`
- `nums[2] < nums[3]`
- ...

The resulting array should alternate between peaks and valleys.

### Example
```cpp
Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]
Output: [1, 6, 1, 5, 1, 4]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can we modify the array in place?
   **A:** Yes, in-place modifications are allowed.
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the array?
   **A:** The length of the array can be up to 5000.
3. **Q:** What should be done if the array has multiple correct solutions?
   **A:** Any solution that satisfies the conditions is acceptable.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array. This makes it easier to reorder the elements to achieve the "wiggle" condition.
2. **Split into Two Halves**: Divide the sorted array into two halves.
3. **Interleave Elements**: Interleave elements from the two halves such that elements from the first half are placed in odd indices (0-based) and elements from the second half in even indices. This helps in maintaining the wiggle condition.
4. **Reverse Traversal**: To place larger elements first, we can traverse the two halves in reverse order while interleaving them.

## Code
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

void wiggleSort(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Step 1: Sort the array
    std::vector<int> sorted(nums);
    std::sort(sorted.begin(), sorted.end());
    
    int n = nums.size();
    int left = (n + 1) / 2 - 1; // End of the first half
    int right = n - 1;          // End of the second half
    
    // Step 2: Interleave elements in the original array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            nums[i] = sorted[left--];
        } else {
            nums[i] = sorted[right--];
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Sorting**: The `std::sort` function has a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \).
2. **Interleaving**: This is done in a single pass over the array, which has a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

## Explanation
- First, we sort the array to get the elements in ascending order.
- Then, by splitting the sorted array into two halves and placing the elements from the end of the first half and the end of the second half alternately, we ensure every element at an odd index (0-based) is greater than the elements at the adjacent even indices, thereby achieving the wiggle property.
