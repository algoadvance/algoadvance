[Leetcode 1606. Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1606)
## Problem Statement

You have `k` servers numbered from `1` to `k` that are handling numerous requests on the server. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `arrival`, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `i-th` request, and another **0-indexed** integer array `load` where `load[i]` represents the load or the time it takes for the server to process the `i-th` request. The `i-th` request will be handled by one of the servers with the least current load. If there are several servers with the same least load, then the request will be handled by the server with the smallest index.

Return a list containing the server(s) that handled the most number of requests. 

### Constraints:
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arrival.length, load.length <= 10^5`
- `arrival.length == load.length`
- `1 <= arrival[i], load[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do all servers start off with zero load? 
   - Yes, initially all servers have zero load.
2. Is it guaranteed that requests' arrival times are in non-decreasing order?
   - Yes, the arrival times are given in non-decreasing order.
3. Can more than one request arrive at exactly the same time?
   - Yes, multiple requests can have the same arrival time.
4. Should the server indices be 0-based or 1-based in the result?
   - The server indices should be 0-based in the result.

## Strategy

To address this problem, we need to simulate the process of handling the requests by maintaining the states of the servers dynamically and efficiently managing their loads:

1. **Use a Priority Queue for Available Servers**:
    - Maintain a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the available servers based on their indices.
    - This will allow us to quickly find the server with the smallest index whenever a server becomes available.

2. **Use a Priority Queue for Busy Servers**:
    - Maintain another min-heap to track the servers that are currently busy.
    - The heap will store pairs of `(finish_time, server_id)` where `finish_time` is the time when the server will be free.

3. **Counting Requests**:
    - Use an array to keep count of the number of requests handled by each server.

4. **Processing Requests**:
    - For each incoming request, release the servers from the busy status as needed.
    - Assign the request to the next available server.
    - Update both the available and busy heaps accordingly.

5. **Result Calculation**:
    - After processing all the requests, traverse the count array to find the servers that handled the most requests.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

vector<int> busiestServers(int k, vector<int>& arrival, vector<int>& load) {
    priority_queue<pair<int,int>, vector<pair<int,int>>, greater<pair<int,int>>> busy; // {end_time, server_index}
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> available; // server_index
    
    // Initialize all servers as available
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
        available.push(i);
    
    unordered_map<int, int> requestCount; // server_index -> request count
    
    for (int i = 0; i < arrival.size(); ++i) {
        int time = arrival[i];
        
        // Free up servers that have finished their tasks
        while (!busy.empty() && busy.top().first <= time) {
            available.push(busy.top().second);
            busy.pop();
        }
        
        if (available.empty()) {
            continue; // No available server to handle this request
        }
        
        // Find the next available server
        int assignedServer = (i % k + k) % k; // Starting point
        int idx = -1;
        
        // Linear search for simplicity
        int size = available.size();
        for (int j = 0; j < size; ++j) {
            int server = available.top();
            if (server >= assignedServer) {
                idx = server; // Found a server with smallest index >= assignedServer
                break;
            }
            available.pop();
            available.push(server);
        }
        
        if (idx == -1) {
            idx = available.top(); // If no server was found starting from assignedServer, take the smallest one
        }
        
        available.pop();
        requestCount[idx]++;
        busy.push({time + load[i], idx});
    }
    
    int maxRequests = 0;
    vector<int> result;
    
    for (const auto& [server, count] : requestCount) {
        if (count > maxRequests) {
            maxRequests = count;
            result = {server};
        } else if (count == maxRequests) {
            result.push_back(server);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Building the initial `available` priority queue takes `O(k log k)`.

- **Processing Each Request**: 
    - Releasing servers from `busy` heap takes `O(log k)` each time a server is released.
    - Assigning the request takes `O(k)` for linear search in the worst case.
    - Pushing and popping from the heaps are `O(log k)` operations.

Overall, for `n` requests, the time complexity is approximately `O(n * log k)` assuming a more efficient search mechanism can be applied instead of linear search for available servers. This provides a reasonable complexity given the problem constraints.

Note: Optimizations may be required particularly in finding the available server to take care of the worst-case linear search scenario.
