[Leetcode 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1509)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it to any value.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` after performing at most three moves.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the input and output formats?**
   - The input will be an array of integers.
   - The output will be an integer representing the minimum difference.

2. **Can the array have negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have both negative and positive numbers.

3. **What is the length constraint of the array?**
   - The length of the array can range widely, but we'll address typical constraints seen in LeetCode problems, usually from 1 to \(10^5\) elements.

4. **Is there a constraint on the values within the array?**
   - Each element within the array will be an integer within a reasonable range, typically \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as per common LeetCode constraints.

### Strategy

To minimize the difference between the largest and smallest values after at most three moves:
1. **Sort the array**: Sorting will help us access the smallest and largest elements easily.
2. **Consider different scenarios**: Examine several alterations where we change up to three elements, focusing on modifying extreme values to minimize the difference:
   
   - Change the 3 largest values.
   - Change the 2 largest values and the smallest.
   - Change the largest value and the 2 smallest.
   - Change the 3 smallest values.

By doing this, we check different combinations to ensure we get the minimum possible difference.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int minDifference(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n <= 4) return 0; // If there are 4 elements or less, we can make them all the same with 3 moves
    
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end()); // Sort the array
    
    int result = INT_MAX;
    
    // Evaluate the 4 strategies mentioned
    // - Change 3 largest elements
    result = std::min(result, nums[n-4] - nums[0]);
    // - Change 2 largest and 1 smallest element
    result = std::min(result, nums[n-3] - nums[1]);
    // - Change 1 largest and 2 smallest elements
    result = std::min(result, nums[n-2] - nums[2]);
    // - Change 3 smallest elements
    result = std::min(result, nums[n-1] - nums[3]);
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {5, 3, 2, 4};
    std::cout << "Minimum difference: " << minDifference(nums) << std::endl; // Output: 0
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Calculating the minimum difference**: \(O(1)\)

**Overall time complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\)

This solution is efficient and should perform well within the typical constraints of competitive programming platforms like LeetCode.
