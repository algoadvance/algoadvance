## Problem Statement

1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` of `'('`, `')'`, and lowercase English characters, your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses (either `'('` or `')'`, in any positions) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:
1. It is the empty string, or
2. It can be written as `AB` (A concatenated with B), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
3. It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the string contain characters other than parentheses and lowercase English letters?
   - No, it contains only `'('`, `')'`, and lowercase English characters.

2. Should the relative order of the characters be preserved in the output?
   - Yes, the relative order should be preserved.

3. Are multiple valid outputs possible?
   - Yes, any valid output is acceptable.

## Strategy

1. We will traverse the string and use a stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched `'('`.
2. Simultaneously, we will use a set to keep track of indices of unmatched `')'`.
3. After the first pass, any indices in the stack and the set are unmatched parentheses that need to be removed.
4. We will construct the result string by including characters that are not in the set of indices to be removed.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <unordered_set>

std::string minRemoveToMakeValid(std::string s) {
    std::stack<int> openBrackets;
    std::unordered_set<int> indicesToRemove;
    
    // First pass to identify indices to be removed
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '(') {
            openBrackets.push(i);
        } else if (s[i] == ')') {
            if (openBrackets.empty()) {
                indicesToRemove.insert(i);
            } else {
                openBrackets.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    // Collect any remaining unmatched '(' indices
    while (!openBrackets.empty()) {
        indicesToRemove.insert(openBrackets.top());
        openBrackets.pop();
    }

    // Build the resultant string excluding the indices to be removed
    std::string result;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (indicesToRemove.find(i) == indicesToRemove.end()) {
            result.push_back(s[i]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::string input = "lee(t(c)o)de)";
    std::cout << minRemoveToMakeValid(input) << std::endl; // Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We make a single pass to identify unmatched parentheses and another pass to construct the result string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily due to the space required for the stack, set, and the result string.

This ensures the solution is both optimal and efficient for typical input strings found in problems like these.
