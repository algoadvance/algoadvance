[Leetcode 1463. Cherry Pickup II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1463)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cherries you can collect from the `(i, j)` cell.

You have two robots that start at `(0, 0)` and `(0, cols-1)` respectively. Both robots can move to the cells `(i+1, j-1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)` from cell `(i, j)`:

- Robot 1 moves from `(i, j1)` to `(i+1, j1-1)`, `(i+1, j1)`, and `(i+1, j1+1)`.
- Robot 2 moves from `(i, j2)` to `(i+1, j2-1)`, `(i+1, j2)`, and `(i+1, j2+1)`.

They cannot move outside of the field.

Return the maximum number of cherries the two robots can collect together.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if the robots land on the same cell?**  
   The two robots can land on the same cell, but the cherries collected from that cell are counted only once.
   
2. **Are the coordinates always valid or should extra boundary checks be included?**  
   The coordinates need boundary checks to ensure robots do not move out of the grid.

3. **What are the constraints on rows and cols?**  
   Constraints:
    - `rows == grid.length`
    - `cols == grid[i].length`
    - `2 <= rows, cols <= 70`
    - `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
    
### Strategy

We will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently:

1. Define a DP state `dp[i][j1][j2]` which represents the maximum number of cherries collected starting from both robots at row `i` and columns `j1` and `j2` respectively.
2. The base case is `dp[last_row][j1][j2]` where `last_row` is the last row in the grid.
3. Transition: Calculate the value of `dp[i][j1][j2]` from the possible next states in the `(i+1)` row.
4. Initialize the DP array with `-1` (or a sufficiently small value) to represent uncomputed states.
5. The answer will be in state `dp[0][0][cols-1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int cherryPickup(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int rows = grid.size();
    int cols = grid[0].size();
    
    // 3D dp array initialized with -1
    vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(rows, vector<vector<int>>(cols, vector<int>(cols, -1)));
    
    // Base case for the last row
    for (int j1 = 0; j1 < cols; ++j1) {
        for (int j2 = 0; j2 < cols; ++j2) {
            if (j1 == j2) {
                dp[rows - 1][j1][j2] = grid[rows - 1][j1];
            } else {
                dp[rows - 1][j1][j2] = grid[rows - 1][j1] + grid[rows - 1][j2];
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Fill the dp array from bottom to top
    for (int i = rows - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        for (int j1 = 0; j1 < cols; ++j1) {
            for (int j2 = 0; j2 < cols; ++j2) {
                int max_cherries = 0;
                for (int move1 = -1; move1 <= 1; ++move1) {
                    for (int move2 = -1; move2 <= 1; ++move2) {
                        int nj1 = j1 + move1;
                        int nj2 = j2 + move2;
                        if (nj1 >= 0 && nj1 < cols && nj2 >= 0 && nj2 < cols) {
                            max_cherries = max(max_cherries, dp[i + 1][nj1][nj2]);
                        }
                    }
                }
                if (j1 == j2) {
                    dp[i][j1][j2] = grid[i][j1] + max_cherries;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j1][j2] = grid[i][j1] + grid[i][j2] + max_cherries;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][0][cols - 1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(rows * cols * cols * 9)`, which simplifies to `O(rows * cols^2)`. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(rows * cols * cols)` to store the DP values, which is manageable considering the maximum possible value of `rows` and `cols` is `70`.
