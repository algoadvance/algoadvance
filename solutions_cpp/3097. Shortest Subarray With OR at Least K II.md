[Leetcode 3097. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3097)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `k`. Your task is to determine the length of the shortest subarray such that the bitwise OR of all the elements of the subarray is at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What values can the array `nums` contain?**
   - The array contains positive integers.

2. **What are the constraints on the length of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - This information is not provided in the original problem statement, but we can assume typical interview constraints like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

3. **What should we return if no subarray meets the requirement?**
   - We should return `-1`.

### Strategy

We need to find the shortest subarray such that the bitwise OR of all elements in the subarray is at least `k`. This suggests a sliding window approach where we try to minimize the window size while maintaining the condition.

**Steps:**
1. Use two pointers (`left`, `right`) to represent the current sliding window.
2. Expand the window by moving `right` and compute the bitwise OR of the elements in the current window.
3. If the OR in the current window is at least `k`, try to shrink the window from the left to minimize its size while maintaining the condition.
4. Keep track of the minimum length of such subarrays.
5. If no valid subarray is found, return `-1`.

We need to ensure our implementation processes efficiently, thus focusing on doing operations in linear time relative to the length of the array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

int shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minLength = INT_MAX;
    int currentOR = 0;
    
    int left = 0;
    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        currentOR |= nums[right];
        
        while (left <= right && currentOR >= k) {
            minLength = min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            currentOR &= ~nums[left];
            ++left;
        }
    }
    
    return (minLength == INT_MAX) ? -1 : minLength;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {5, 1, 3, 2, 8};
    int k = 7;
    int result = shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(nums, k);
    cout << "The length of the shortest subarray with OR at least " << k << " is: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, not counting the input array, as we use only a few extra variables to keep track of indices and the current OR.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray meeting the problem's requirements without incurring unnecessary overhead.
