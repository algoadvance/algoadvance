[Leetcode 1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1893)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` represents an inclusive interval `[starti, endi]`.

Return `true` if each integer in the inclusive interval `[left, right]` is covered by at least one interval in `ranges`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the elements in `ranges` always positive integers?
2. Can the ranges overlap?
3. Are `left` and `right` guaranteed to be within the range defined by elements in `ranges`?

However, we'll assume general cases based on the prompt:

1. `ranges` can have any integer ranges, including negative.
2. Yes, ranges can overlap.
3. No such guarantees; we should handle cases where numbers within `[left, right]` may not be covered by any interval in `ranges`.

### Strategy

1. **Create a Covered Integer Set**:
   - Use an array to mark coverage of integers within the `[left, right]` range.
   - This array will track which numbers are covered by any of the ranges in `ranges`.

2. **Mark Coverage**:
   - Iterate through each range in `ranges`.
   - For each range, mark the corresponding elements in the `covered` array as `true`.

3. **Check Coverage**:
   - After marking, check if all values in the `[left, right]` range are covered.
   - Return `true` if all are covered; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isCovered(vector<vector<int>>& ranges, int left, int right) {
        vector<bool> covered(right - left + 1, false);
        
        for (const auto& range : ranges) {
            int start = max(left, range[0]);
            int end = min(right, range[1]);
            
            for (int i = start; i <= end; ++i) {
                covered[i - left] = true;
            }
        }
        
        for (bool isCovered : covered) {
            if (!isCovered) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of the `covered` array**: O(right - left + 1)
- **Filling the `covered` array per range**: O(m * n) where `m` is the number of ranges and `n` is the largest size of the ranges (bounded by `right - left + 1`).
- **Final check of the `covered` array**: O(right - left + 1)

Thus, the total time complexity is O(m * (right - left + 1)).

This ensures effective handling of checking whether all integers within `[left, right]` are covered by any of the intervals in `ranges`.
