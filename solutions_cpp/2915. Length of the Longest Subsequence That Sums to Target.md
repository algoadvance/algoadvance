[Leetcode 2915. Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2915)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the length of the longest subsequence that sums to the target. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarification on Inputs:**
   - What constraints are placed on the values in the `nums` array (e.g., size of the array, range of element values)?
   
   We assume the constraints are:
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
   - `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
   - `-10^6 <= target <= 10^6`

2. **Desired Output:**
   - Should the function return the length of the longest subsequence?
   - Is there a specific desired behavior if no such subsequence exists?

   The function should return the length of the subsequence, and if no such subsequence exists, it should return `0`.

3. **Example:**
   Consider `nums` is `[2,3,7,1,6]` and `target` is `10`.
   - The longest subsequence that sums to 10 would be `[3, 7]` and its length is `2`.

### Strategy
The problem requires finding a subsequence of maximum length such that the sum of its elements equals the `target`. We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently:
- Use a hashmap `dp` where the key is the sum of the subsequence and the value is the length of the longest subsequence that results in that sum.
- Iterate through each element in `nums`.
- For each element, update the hashmap with new possible sums generated by adding the current element to existing sums.

### Code

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int longestSubsequenceSumTarget(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    unordered_map<int, int> dp;  // dp[sum] = length of the longest subsequence with this sum
    dp[0] = 0;  // Base case: sum of 0 with an empty subsequence

    int maxLength = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        // Copy current state of dp to avoid modifying it during iteration
        auto currentDP = dp;

        for (const auto& [sum, length] : currentDP) {
            int newSum = sum + num;
            if (dp.find(newSum) == dp.end() || dp[newSum] < length + 1) {
                dp[newSum] = length + 1;
            }
        }

        // Check if we formed a subsequence that sums to the target
        if (dp.find(target) != dp.end()) {
            maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[target]);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(N * M)` where `N` is the length of the `nums` array and `M` is the range of possible sums (proportional to the sum of absolute values of elements in the worst-case scenario). This ensures the algorithm is manageable given the constraints.
