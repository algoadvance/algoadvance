[Leetcode 2289. Steps to Make Array Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2289)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, you are allowed to perform a set of operations on this array. In one operation, you can remove any one element from the array. The goal is to make the array non-decreasing using the minimum number of operations possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the range of integers?**
   - The constraints typically lie within the typical LeetCode limits. However, confirming this with real constraints can be helpful.

2. **Is the array allowed to contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array may contain duplicates.

3. **Is the array empty to start with?**
   - Given an empty array as an input would make the answer trivially zero, as no operations are needed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the concept of dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the longest non-decreasing subsequence at each step. Here is the strategy:

1. **Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence (LNDS)**: Create a vector `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the smallest possible last element of a non-decreasing subsequence of length `i+1`.

2. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Use binary search to find the position where the current `nums[i]` can either extend an existing subsequence or replace the first element which is larger than it.

3. **Length of LNDS**: The length of the vector `dp` at the end will be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.

4. **Minimum Removals**: The minimum number of removals required would then be `len(nums) - len(dp)` because this is the complement of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperationsToMakeNonDecreasing(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    if (nums.empty()) return 0;
    
    std::vector<int> dp;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        auto it = std::upper_bound(dp.begin(), dp.end(), num);
        if (it == dp.end()) {
            dp.push_back(num);
        } else {
            *it = num;
        }
    }
    
    return nums.size() - dp.size();
}

// Main Function for Testing
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 2, 5, 1, 7};
    std::cout << "Minimum number of operations: " << minOperationsToMakeNonDecreasing(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search within DP**: Each insertion or replacement in the `dp` array takes O(log n) time.
- **Total Complexity**: For each element in `nums`, we do a binary search on `dp`. Thus, the complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), making it efficient for large arrays within typical constraint limits.

### Explanation

1. **Input Loop**: For each element `num` in `nums`, find the correct position in `dp` using binary search to maintain the property of the smallest possible ending element.
2. **Binary Search Handling**: If the correct position (`it`) is at the end of the `dp`, it implies having found a new longest subsequence; otherwise, we update the position with `num` to maintain the smallest end element.
3. **Result Calculation**: Finally, return the difference between the size of the original array and the length of `dp`.

By following this strategy and leveraging binary search for maintaining the `dp` vector, we can efficiently compute the minimum number of operations required to make the array non-decreasing.
