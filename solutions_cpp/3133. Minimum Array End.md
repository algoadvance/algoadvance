[Leetcode 3133. Minimum Array End](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3133)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):

* Pick the element at the end (either the left end or right end) and remove it.

Return the minimum possible length of the remaining array if both the maximum and minimum elements are removed from it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - **A:** Assume that `nums` will contain at least two elements since we need to remove both the maximum and minimum elements.

2. **Q:** Can the maximum and minimum elements be the same?
   - **A:** Yes, it is possible. In that case, by removing the element(s), no elements remain.

3. **Q:** Can the array contain negative numbers and zeros?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain any integer values, including negatives and zeros.

4. **Q:** Is the removal order significant?
   - **A:** No, you can remove them in any order as long as both are removed.

### Strategy

1. Identify the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in the array (`min_index` and `max_index`). 
2. Calculate the possible lengths of the array after removing both elements from each end:
   - Remove both elements from the left.
   - Remove both elements from the right.
   - Remove `min_index` from the left and `max_index` from the right.
   - Remove `max_index` from the left and `min_index` from the right.
3. Compute the minimum length produced by these operations.
4. Return the computed minimum length.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

class Solution {
public:
    int minArrayEndOut(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Determine the indices for the minimum and maximum elements.
        int min_index = 0;
        int max_index = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[min_index]) {
                min_index = i;
            }
            if (nums[i] > nums[max_index]) {
                max_index = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Ensure that min_index is before max_index if they are the same.
        if (min_index > max_index) std::swap(min_index, max_index);
        
        // We calculate the possible lengths:
        // 1. Remove from left up to the max_index.
        int option1 = max_index + 1;
        
        // 2. Remove from right up to the (min_index + 1).
        int option2 = n - min_index;
        
        // 3. Remove min_index from the left + remove max_index from the right.
        int option3 = min_index + 1 + (n - max_index);
        
        // The minimum of these operations will be our result.
        return std::min({option1, option2, option3});
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2, 5};
    
    int result = sol.minArrayEndOut(nums);
    std::cout << "The minimum possible length of the remaining array is: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we traverse the array to find the indices of the minimum and maximum elements.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
