[Leetcode 2974. Minimum Number Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2974)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of 2 * n integers. You need to divide these integers into exactly n pairs such that the maximum minimum pair sum is minimized. A pair sum is defined as the sum of a number from the left half of the list and a number from the right half of the list, where the left half consists of the first n integers and the right half consists of the last n integers.

Return the minimized maximum pair sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints can we assume for the length of the input array?**
   - You can assume that `nums` will always have an even number of elements with the given constraints `2 <= 2 * n <= 10^5`.

2. **What range can we expect for the integers in the array?**
   - The integer values in `nums` are between `1` and `10^6`.

3. **Can the integers in the array be negative?**
   - No, in this problem, the integers are always positive as per the standard constraints.

4. **Should we consider the input array to contain distinct integers or can they be duplicated?**
   - Integers may be duplicated in the array.

### Strategy

To minimize the maximum pair sum, a good approach is:
1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array in ascending order.
2. **Pair the Elements**: After sorting, the most efficient way to achieve our goal is to consider the weakest pairs with the strongest ones:
    - Pair the smallest element from the left half with the largest from the right half,
    - i.e., if the array is `[a1, a2, ..., an, b1, b2, ..., bn]`, pair `ai` with `bn-i+1` for `1 <= i <= n`.
3. **Compute Pair Sums**: Calculate the pair sums and find the maximum pair sum.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minimizeMaximumPairSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    // Sort the array
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int n = nums.size() / 2;
    int max_pair_sum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // Calculate the pair sum
        int pair_sum = nums[i] + nums[nums.size() - 1 - i];
        // Update the maximum pair sum
        max_pair_sum = std::max(max_pair_sum, pair_sum);
    }
    
    return max_pair_sum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 5, 2, 3, 8, 7, 4, 6};
    std::cout << "Minimized Maximum Pair Sum is: " << minimizeMaximumPairSum(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting ensures that you can efficiently pair the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Pair and Calculate Sum**: Iterate through the first half of the sorted array (left half) and pair each element with the corresponding element from the second half (right half).
3. **Update Maximum Pair Sum**: Track the maximum pair sum encountered during the iteration.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Iteration**: Creating pairs and computing maximum pair sum has a linear time complexity of \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
