[Leetcode 2513. Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2513)
### Problem Statement
You are given two positive integers, `x` and `y`, and an integer array, `arr` containing unique positive integers. You are tasked with placing these integers into two separate arrays such that:

1. Each integer is used exactly once.
2. The sum of the integers in the first array should be close to `x`.
3. The sum of the integers in the second array should be close to `y`.

The goal is to minimize the maximum difference between the sum of the integers in the first array and `x`, and the sum of the integers in the second array and `y`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. When you say the sums should be "close to" `x` and `y`, should we assume they should be as close as possible or less than or equal?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of `arr` or on the values of `x` and `y`?
3. Should we return the minimized maximum difference or the arrangement of the arrays themselves?

For the purpose of this solution, let's assume we need to return the minimized maximum difference.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of possible sums that can be achieved for one array, then use these sums to compute the best possible partition.
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: Sort the values and make a greedy choice for keeping the balance between the two sum targets `x` and `y`.

Considering the constraints and usual inputs sizes, the dynamic programming approach would likely lead to better results in typical interview settings.

### Code
Here's a potential implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int minimizeMaxDifference(vector<int>& arr, int x, int y) {
    int n = arr.size();
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

    // The sum of the array, which we'll use to calculate halfway
    int total_sum = accumulate(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);

    // Set of possible sums we can get for the array being close to x or y
    vector<bool> dp(total_sum + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true;

    for(int num : arr) {
        for(int j = total_sum; j >= num; --j) {
            if(dp[j - num])
                dp[j] = true;
        }
    }

    int min_max_diff = INT_MAX;

    for(int i = 0; i <= total_sum; ++i) {
        if(dp[i]) {
            int sum1 = i;
            int sum2 = total_sum - i;
            int diff1 = abs(sum1 - x);
            int diff2 = abs(sum2 - y);
            int current_max_diff = max(diff1, diff2);
            min_max_diff = min(min_max_diff, current_max_diff);
        }
    }

    return min_max_diff;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {2, 3, 5, 7, 8};
    int x = 10;
    int y = 15;

    cout << "Minimized Maximum Difference: " << minimizeMaxDifference(arr, x, y) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
- Filling in the dynamic programming table takes O(n * S), where `S` is the sum of all elements in `arr`.
- Iterating over the sums to determine the minimum maximum difference is O(S).

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n log n + nS)`, where `S` is the sum of `arr`.
