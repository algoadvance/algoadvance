[Leetcode 572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l572)
## Problem Statement

You are given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`. Write a function to determine if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the binary trees?**
   - The trees are given as arrays in level-order format.
  
2. **Can either of the trees be empty?**
   - If `subRoot` is empty, it is trivially a subtree of any tree. If `root` is empty and `subRoot` is not, it is trivially false.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - The function should return a boolean: `true` if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`, otherwise `false`.

## Strategy

1. **Traversal and Comparison**:
   - The problem can be approached by traversing the `root` tree and, at each node, checking if the subtree rooted at this node matches `subRoot`.
   - This requires two main functions:
     1. **isSameTree**: This will determine if two trees are identical.
     2. **isSubtree**: This will recursively traverse the `root` tree and use `isSameTree` to check for subtree matches.

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Traverse every node in the `root` tree using recursion.
   - At each node, call `isSameTree` to check if the subtree rooted at this node matches `subRoot`.
   - If a match is found, return `true`.
   - If no match is found after checking all nodes, return `false`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubtree(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* subRoot) {
        if (!root) return !subRoot;
        if (isSameTree(root, subRoot)) return true;
        return isSubtree(root->left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root->right, subRoot);
    }

    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* s, TreeNode* t) {
        if (!s && !t) return true;
        if (!s || !t) return false;
        if (s->val != t->val) return false;
        return isSameTree(s->left, t->left) && isSameTree(s->right, t->right);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    
    TreeNode* subRoot = new TreeNode(4);
    subRoot->left = new TreeNode(1);
    subRoot->right = new TreeNode(2);
    
    Solution sol;
    std::cout << (sol.isSubtree(root, subRoot) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl; // Output: true
    
    // Clean up
    delete root->left->left;
    delete root->left->right;
    delete root->left;
    delete root->right;
    delete root;
    delete subRoot->left;
    delete subRoot->right;
    delete subRoot;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **isSameTree**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the trees being compared.
- **isSubtree**: O(M * N), where M is the number of nodes in the `root` tree and N is the number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree.
  - In the worst case, `isSameTree` is called M times, and each call to `isSameTree` is O(N).

This strategy ensures that we efficiently traverse and compare subtrees to determine if `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`.
