[Leetcode 1969. Minimum Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1969)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `p`. Consider an array `nums` that consists of the integers in the inclusive range `[1, 2^p - 1]`. You need to find the minimum product of the elements of any non-empty subset of this array, modulo 10^9 + 7.

The subset must contain at least one non-zero integer.

**Example:**
```
Input: p = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The array nums is [1]. The only non-empty subset is [1], so the product is 1.

Input: p = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The array nums is [1, 2, 3]. The minimum non-zero product is obtained by choosing the subset [2, 3]. The product is 2 * 3 = 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions

Before writing the code, let's ask some clarifying questions regarding the problem:

1. **Range of Input:** What is the range of `p`?
   - It's generally a positive integer. Let's assume `1 ≤ p ≤ 50`, which is typical for such problems.

2. **Modulo Requirement:** The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7, correct?
   - Yes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Identify Range:** The array `nums` will include all the integers from `1` to `2^p - 1`.
2. **Optimal Subset:** We need to identify a subset that produces the minimum non-zero product. To identify this subset intuitively, notice:
   - The array is essentially the set of all positive integers below `2^p`.
   - The extremes of the set (`1` and `2^p - 1`) usually result in smaller products when combined intelligently.
3. **Mathematical Insight:** For larger subsets, we need to pair elements to minimize the product. Observing patterns, the minimal product involves the highest and lowest values (excluding 1).

The minimal non-zero product for such a problem leverages mathematical insights where:
- The `2^p - 2` element multiplied many times (`p-1` times) gives us a significant insight.
- The result modulo `10^9 + 7` must be calculated carefully using modular arithmetic.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation to achieve the task:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

#define MOD 1000000007

using namespace std;

// Helper function to perform modular exponentiation
long long modExp(long long base, long long exp, long long mod) {
    long long result = 1;
    base = base % mod;
    while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2 == 1)
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        exp = exp >> 1;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
    }
    return result;
}

int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
    if (p == 1) return 1;
    
    long long maxVal = (1LL << p) - 1;
    long long secondMaxVal = maxVal - 1;
    
    long long part1 = modExp(secondMaxVal, ((maxVal - 1) / 2), MOD);
    
    return (part1 * maxVal) % MOD;
}

// Test example usage
int main() {
    cout << minNonZeroProduct(1) << endl; // Output: 1
    cout << minNonZeroProduct(2) << endl; // Output: 6
    cout << minNonZeroProduct(3) << endl; // Output: 1512
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Exponentiation by Squaring:** To compute powers under a modulus efficiently.
2. **Optimal Pairing:** Leverage the insight that the product involving the largest elements more frequently leads to minimal product.
3. **Modulo Arithmetic:** Ensure results are computed under \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\) due to the modular exponentiation which works in logarithmic time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we use constant extra space.

This algorithm efficiently handles the input ranges as specified and computes the minimal non-zero product modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
