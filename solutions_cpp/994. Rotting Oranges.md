[Leetcode 994. Rotting Oranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l994)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange,
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: grid = [
  [2,1,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]
Output: 4
```

### Constraints
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid have no oranges at all?**
   Yes, it is possible for the grid to have no oranges. If there are no fresh oranges to start with, the output should be `0`.

2. **Is it guaranteed that we will always have at least one rotten or fresh orange in the grid?**
   No, the grid could potentially have only empty cells.

3. **Can we assume that the grid is always rectangular in shape?**
   Yes, based on the constraints provided, `m` and `n` define a rectangular grid.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. This is because BFS spreads in waves, which is a natural fit to model the rotting process.

### Steps
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a queue to track all initially rotten oranges.
   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.

2. **BFS Propagation**:
   - For each step (minute), process all rotten oranges from the queue, and subsequently rot any fresh orange adjacent to it.
   - Increment the time counter after processing the queue.

3. **Completion**:
   - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the time counter.
   - If there are still fresh oranges left after BFS completes, return `-1`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int orangesRotting(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        int freshCount = 0;
        queue<pair<int, int>> rottenQueue;
        
        // Directions for 4-connected neighbors (up, down, left, right)
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = { {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0} };
        
        // Initialize the queue with all initial rotten oranges
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
                    rottenQueue.push({i, j});
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    ++freshCount;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If there are no fresh oranges to start with, return 0
        if (freshCount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int minutes = 0;
        
        // BFS
        while (!rottenQueue.empty()) {
            int size = rottenQueue.size();
            bool freshRotted = false;
            
            // Process all rotten oranges at this level (current minute)
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                pair<int, int> current = rottenQueue.front();
                rottenQueue.pop();
                
                // Check all 4-directionally connected cells
                for (auto dir : directions) {
                    int newRow = current.first + dir.first;
                    int newCol = current.second + dir.second;
                    
                    if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && grid[newRow][newCol] == 1) {
                        grid[newRow][newCol] = 2;
                        --freshCount;
                        freshRotted = true;
                        rottenQueue.push({newRow, newCol});
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Only increment minutes if we rotted any fresh oranges
            if (freshRotted) {
                ++minutes;
            }
        }
        
        return freshCount == 0 ? minutes : -1;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) because each cell in the grid is processed at most once.

The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the queue used for BFS.

This ensures the solution is optimal given the constraints.
