[Leetcode 1202. Smallest String With Swaps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1202)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`, and an array of pairs of indices in the string `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [a, b]` indicates you can swap the characters at index `a` and index `b` of the string. You can swap characters any number of times, but only among the indices specified in the pairs.

Return the lexicographically smallest string that `s` can be after using the swaps.

### Example

```text
Input: s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2]]
Output: "bacd"
```

You can swap `index 0` with `index 3` and `index 1` with `index 2`, resulting in `bacd`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any restrictions on the length of the string `s` or the array `pairs`?**
   - The length of the string `s` is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
   - The number of pairs is in the range `[0, 10^5]`.

2. **Can `pairs` contain duplicate pairs or self-loops (e.g., `[1,1]`)?**
   - No. Each pair `[a, b]` should have `a != b`.

3. **Is the input guaranteed to be valid (indices within the string length)?**
   - Yes, all indices in `pairs` are within the valid range `[0, len(s) - 1]`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of disjoint set (or union-find). The idea is to group all characters that can be swapped together into connected components. Once we have these components, we only need to sort these components individually to get the smallest lexicographical string.

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We need to create a union-find data structure to group connected indices.
2. **Group Characters by Connectivity**: Using the union-find structure, we'll group all characters that are connected.
3. **Sort and Reassign Characters**: For each group, extract the characters, sort them, and then reassign them to their positions in the string.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        rank.resize(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    void unite(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;
};

string smallestStringWithSwaps(string s, vector<pair<int, int>>& pairs) {
    int n = s.size();
    UnionFind uf(n);

    // Unite the indices in the pairs
    for (auto& pair : pairs) {
        uf.unite(pair.first, pair.second);
    }

    // Group all characters by their root parent
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> groups;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int root = uf.find(i);
        groups[root].push_back(i);
    }

    // For each group, sort the characters and place them back in the string
    for (auto& group : groups) {
        vector<int>& indices = group.second;
        // Extract characters from these indices
        vector<char> chars;
        for (int index : indices) {
            chars.push_back(s[index]);
        }
        // Sort the characters
        sort(chars.begin(), chars.end());
        // Place them back in the original string
        for (int i = 0; i < indices.size(); ++i) {
            s[indices[i]] = chars[i];
        }
    }

    return s;
}

int main() {
    string s = "dcab";
    vector<pair<int, int>> pairs = {{0, 3}, {1, 2}};
    cout << smallestStringWithSwaps(s, pairs) << endl; // Output: "bacd"
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations**: Both `find` and `unite` operations have an almost constant time complexity, `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Grouping Characters**: This involves iterating over the string, which is `O(n)`.
- **Sorting Characters**: Each component sorting takes `O(k log k)`, where `k` is the size of the component.
  
Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step, as the other operations are near-linear in terms of complexity.
