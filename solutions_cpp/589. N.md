[Leetcode 589. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l589)
## Problem Statement
Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has at most N children.

For example, given a 3-ary tree:
```
    1
   /|\
  3 2 4
 / \
5   6
```

You should return `[1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 4]` in preorder traversal.

### Note:
- Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Type**: What does the node structure look like?
   - The Node structure for a tree is defined as:
     ```cpp
     class Node {
     public:
         int val;
         vector<Node*> children;

         Node() {}

         Node(int _val) {
             val = _val;
         }

         Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
             val = _val;
             children = _children;
         }
     };
     ```

2. **Tree Properties**: Can the tree have nodes with no children?
   - Yes, nodes can have zero children.

3. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned for an empty tree?
   - Return an empty list `[]`.

4. **Duplicates**: Can there be duplicate values in the tree?
   - Yes, nodes can have duplicate values.

## Strategy
The preorder traversal visits nodes in the following order:
1. Visit the root node.
2. Recursively traverse each of the root's children.

To implement this iteratively, use a stack:
1. Start by pushing the root node onto the stack.
2. While the stack is not empty:
   - Pop the top node.
   - Add its value to the result list.
   - Push its children onto the stack in reverse order (so that the leftmost child is processed first).

This approach ensures that nodes are processed in the correct preorder sequence.

## Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> children;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> preorder(Node* root) {
        vector<int> result;
        if (root == nullptr) return result;

        stack<Node*> s;
        s.push(root);

        while (!s.empty()) {
            Node* node = s.top();
            s.pop();
            result.push_back(node->val);
            // Push nodes in reverse order of their appearance.
            for (int i = node->children.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
                s.push(node->children[i]);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
   - Where `N` is the total number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.

2. **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
   - In the worst case, especially for a tree similar to a linked list (a degenerate tree), the stack can hold all nodes, which gives us `O(N)` space complexity.

This completes both the recursive and non-recursive (iterative) approaches to solving the problem of N-ary tree preorder traversal.
