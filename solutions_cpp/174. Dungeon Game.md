[Leetcode 174. Dungeon Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l174)
## Problem Statement

The problem "Dungeon Game" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health. The knight can only move right or down through the dungeon.

Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the dungeon grid?**
   The grid size can be as large as 200 by 200 (i.e., M, N â‰¤ 200).

2. **What are the constraints on the values within the grid?**
   Each cell can contain an integer value between -1000 and 1000.

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming Approach

Since the knight cares about his minimum health at each step, we can use dynamic programming in a bottom-up manner. We will work backwards from the destination (princess cell) to determine the minimum health required to safely reach that cell from the starting position.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a DP table (`dp`) of the same dimensions as the dungeon, where `dp[i][j]` denotes the minimum health needed to reach the bottom-right corner ([(M-1),(N-1)]) from cell (i, j).
   - Initialize the bottom-right cell's value in the DP table based on the health value required to remain positive upon reaching the bottom-right corner.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - Loop through the cells in reverse order, and for each cell (i, j), calculate the minimum health required to enter either the right (`dp[i][j+1]`) or down (`dp[i+1][j]`) cell. 
   - Determine the minimum health required to survive entering the current cell and update the DP table.

3. **Calculate the Result:**
   - The value in the DP table at the starting cell (0, 0) will provide the minimum initial health required for the knight to rescue the princess.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(M * N) since we need to fill the DP table for an M x N grid. The space complexity is also O(M * N) due to the storage of the DP table.

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int calculateMinimumHP(vector<vector<int>>& dungeon) {
        int M = dungeon.size();
        int N = dungeon[0].size();
        
        // Create and initialize the DP table
        vector<vector<int>> dp(M, vector<int>(N, INT_MAX));
        
        // Bottom-right corner
        dp[M - 1][N - 1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[M - 1][N - 1]);
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = M - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = N - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                if (i == M - 1 && j == N - 1) continue;
                
                int min_health = INT_MAX;
                if (i < M - 1) {
                    min_health = min(min_health, dp[i + 1][j]);
                }
                if (j < N - 1) {
                    min_health = min(min_health, dp[i][j + 1]);
                }
                
                dp[i][j] = max(1, min_health - dungeon[i][j]);
            }
        }
        
        // The result is the minimum health needed to start at (0, 0)
        return dp[0][0];
    }
};
```

The code correctly accesses each cell, calculates the minimum required health for that cell, and ultimately determines the knight's minimum initial health.
