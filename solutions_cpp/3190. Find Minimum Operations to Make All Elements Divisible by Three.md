[Leetcode 3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3190)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of size `n`. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

- Pick two different indices `i` and `j`, and set `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + nums[j]`.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array divisible by 3.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums`? (e.g., range of values)
2. What should we assume about the size of the array `n`?
3. Can the values in `nums` be negative or zero?
4. In the output, if it's not possible to make all elements divisible by 3, what should be returned?

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minOperationsToMakeDivisibleByThree(vector<int>& nums) {
    int count_mod1 = 0, count_mod2 = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num % 3 == 1) {
            count_mod1++;
        } else if (num % 3 == 2) {
            count_mod2++;
        }
    }

    if (count_mod1 == 0 && count_mod2 == 0) {
        return 0; // All numbers are already divisible by 3
    }

    if (count_mod1 == count_mod2) {
        return count_mod1;
    }

    return max(count_mod1, count_mod2);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {2, 2, 5, 8};
    cout << minOperationsToMakeDivisibleByThree(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Count Remainders**: First, iterate through the array and count how many numbers leave a remainder of `1` or `2` when divided by 3.
2. **Identify the Problem Scope**:
   - If there are no numbers with a remainder of `1` and no numbers with a remainder of `2`, the array is already in the desired state.
   - If the counts of numbers with remainders `1` and `2` are equal, each pair can solve each other.
   - Otherwise, the maximum number of either count will tell you the minimum operations needed, as one will be larger than the other.

## Time Complexity

- The solution involves a single pass through the array to count how many numbers have remainders of 1 and 2. Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the array.
- Space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space.
