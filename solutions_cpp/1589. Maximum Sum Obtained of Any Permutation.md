[Leetcode 1589. Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1589)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` (0-indexed) and an array of integer pairs `requests` where `requests[i] = [start_i, end_i]`. The `i-th` request asks for the sum of the subarray `nums[start_i] + nums[start_i+1] + ... + nums[end_i]`. 

You need to maximize the total sum obtained by summing up the requested subarrays. You are allowed to permute the array `nums` (i.e., rearrange its elements).

Return the maximum total sum you can obtain from all the requests.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]
Output: 19
Explanation: 
One permutation of nums is [2,1,3,4,5] with the following result: 
requests[0]: [2,1,3,4] -> sum: 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10
requests[1]: [2,1] -> sum: 2 + 1 = 3
Total sum: 10 + 3 = 13
Another permutation of nums is [1,2,3,4,5] with the following result:
requests[0]: [2,1,3,4] -> sum: 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 10
requests[1]: [1,2] -> sum: 1 + 2 = 3
Total sum: 10 + 3 = 13
Another permutation of nums is [1,2,3,4,5] with the following result:
requests[0]: [3,1,2,4] -> sum: 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 10
requests[1]: [2,1] -> sum: 2 + 1 = 3
Total sum: 10 + 3 = 13
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 10^5`
- `requests[i].length == 2`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the requests arrays overlap?
   - Yes, subarray requests can overlap.
   
2. Is the result expected to be modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - Yes, the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Array**: To determine which elements in `nums` are used more frequently in the requests, we can use a frequency array.
2. **Range Addition**: Use a difference array to efficiently count the frequency of each index in `nums`.
3. **Sorting**: To get the maximum sum, first sort the `nums` array and the frequency array.
4. **Calculate the Sum**: Multiply corresponding elements from both sorted arrays to get the maximum sum.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting `nums` and the frequency array will take `O(n log n)`.
- Building the frequency array using queries will take `O(m + n)`, where `m` is the length of `requests`.

The overall time complexity is `O(n log n + m + n)`, which simplifies to `O(n log n + m)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumRangeQuery(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& requests) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = nums.size();
        int m = requests.size();
        
        // Initialize frequency array
        vector<int> frequency(n, 0);
        
        // Apply range addition
        for (const auto& req : requests) {
            frequency[req[0]]++;
            if (req[1] + 1 < n) {
                frequency[req[1] + 1]--;
            }
        }
        
        // Convert frequency array to actual count frequencies
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            frequency[i] += frequency[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Sort both arrays in descending order
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
        sort(frequency.begin(), frequency.end(), greater<int>());
        
        // Calculate max sum
        long long max_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            max_sum = (max_sum + static_cast<long long>(nums[i]) * frequency[i]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return static_cast<int>(max_sum);
    }
};
```
