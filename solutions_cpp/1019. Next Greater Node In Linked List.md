[Leetcode 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1019)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list with `n` nodes where each node contains an integer value. You need to return an array of integers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the next greater node of node i. If there is no such greater element, set `answer[i]` to 0.

### Example

Input: [2, 1, 5]
Output: [5, 5, 0]

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed with the code, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. Are there negative numbers in the linked list?
   - No, as per the problem description, each node contains non-negative integers.
2. What is the maximum number of nodes in the linked list?
   - The problem doesn’t specify a limit, but typical constraints might involve up to \(10^4\) nodes.
3. How is the linked list represented?
   - Usually, in C++, it’s represented using `ListNode` structure.

### Strategy

1. **Convert Linked List to Array**: First, convert the linked list into an array format to facilitate easier access by indices.
2. **Monotonic Stack**: Use a stack to keep track of indices of the elements. This stack helps to find the next greater element efficiently.
   - Traverse the array and use the stack to keep track of the indices where we need to find the next greater element.
   - If the current element is higher than the element in the array indexed by the top of the stack, it means we've found the next greater for the elements indexed by the top of the stack.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) as we traverse each element and each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the array and the stack.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

// Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

vector<int> nextLargerNodes(ListNode* head) {
    // Step 1: Convert linked list to array
    vector<int> values;
    ListNode* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        values.push_back(current->val);
        current = current->next;
    }
    
    // Result array initialized to 0
    vector<int> result(values.size(), 0);
    stack<int> indexStack; // Stack to store indices
    
    // Step 2: Use monotonic stack to find the next greater elements
    for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); ++i) {
        // While stack is not empty and the current value is greater than
        // value at index stored at the top of the stack
        while (!indexStack.empty() && values[i] > values[indexStack.top()]) {
            // Update the result for the index at the top of the stack
            result[indexStack.top()] = values[i];
            indexStack.pop();
        }
        // Push the current index to the stack
        indexStack.push(i);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This code should work correctly given the constraints provided and it follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem efficiently. If you have more specific constraints or requirements, let me know!
