[Leetcode 45. Jump Game II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l45)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers `nums` of length `n`. Initially, you are positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index `i`.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

#### Example:

1. **Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
   **Output:** `2`

   **Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

2. **Input:** `nums = [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]`
   **Output:** `2`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:** How large can the array be?
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
   - `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

2. **Edge cases:** Should I consider arrays of length 1?
   - Yes, but in such cases, the result is trivially `0` since you're already at the last index.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a greedy approach:
1. Track the farthest index we can reach from the current index.
2. Maintain a count of the number of jumps used.
3. Keep a `currentEnd` variable to represent the end of the range for the current jump.
4. Iterate through the array and, for each index, update the `farthest` index that can be reached.
5. If we reach the `currentEnd`, increment the jump count and update `currentEnd` to `farthest`.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int jump(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n <= 1) return 0;
    
    int jumps = 0, currentEnd = 0, farthest = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        farthest = std::max(farthest, i + nums[i]);
        
        if (i == currentEnd) {
            jumps++;
            currentEnd = farthest;
            
            if (currentEnd >= n - 1) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return jumps;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 1, 1, 4};
    std::cout << "Minimum number of jumps: " << jump(nums) << std::endl; // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. We only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we use a constant amount of additional space.

This implementation ensures that we find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index in an efficient manner.
