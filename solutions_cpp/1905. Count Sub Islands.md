[Leetcode 1905. Count Sub Islands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1905)
### Problem Statement
You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only `0`s (representing water) and `1`s (representing land). An island is a group of `1`s connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). 

A **sub-island** is an island in `grid2` that is entirely contained in `grid1`.

Return the number of **sub-islands** in `grid2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What does "entirely contained" mean?**
    - It means every cell of the island in `grid2` must be a corresponding land cell (`1`) in `grid1`.
2. **Are the matrices guaranteed to be of the same size?**
    - Yes, `grid1` and `grid2` are of the same size `m x n`.
3. **Can the input grids be empty?**
    - No, both grids will have at least one element.

### Strategy
1. **Traverse through `grid2`**: Identify all the potential islands (groups of connected `1`s) in `grid2`.
2. **Validate the islands in `grid2` against `grid1`**: Ensure each identified island in `grid2` adheres to the land structure of `grid1`.
3. **DFS/BFS Approach**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each island and determine if it is a valid sub-island.
    
### Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Direction vectors for moving up, down, left, right
int dir[4][2] = {{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid1, vector<vector<int>>& grid2, int x, int y, bool& isSubIsland) {
    int m = grid1.size();
    int n = grid2[0].size();
    
    // Are we out of bounds or on a cell that is water in grid2?
    if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || grid2[x][y] == 0) {
        return;
    }
    
    // If the current cell in grid2 is not a 1 in grid1, it's not fully contained
    if (grid1[x][y] != 1) {
        isSubIsland = false;
    }
    
    // Mark as visited by setting it to 0
    grid2[x][y] = 0;
    
    // Explore all 4 directions
    for (int d = 0; d < 4; ++d) {
        int newX = x + dir[d][0];
        int newY = y + dir[d][1];
        dfs(grid1, grid2, newX, newY, isSubIsland);
    }
}

int countSubIslands(vector<vector<int>>& grid1, vector<vector<int>>& grid2) {
    int m = grid1.size();
    int n = grid2[0].size();
    int subIslandsCount = 0;
    
    // Iterate through each cell in grid2
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            // Explore the island if it's a land cell in grid2
            if (grid2[i][j] == 1) {
                bool isSubIsland = true;
                dfs(grid1, grid2, i, j, isSubIsland);
                if (isSubIsland) {
                    subIslandsCount++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return subIslandsCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because each cell of the grid is visited at most once in the DFS traversal.

### Explanation
- We initiate a DFS search from each cell in `grid2` that contains a `1`.
- During the DFS traversal, each connected `1` in `grid2` is checked correspondingly in `grid1`.
- If any part of the island in `grid2` does not overlap with an island in `grid1`, it's marked as not a sub-island.
- Mark visited cells in `grid2` to avoid redundant work during further iterations.
