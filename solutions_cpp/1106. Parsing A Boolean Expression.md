[Leetcode 1106. Parsing A Boolean Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1106)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `expression` representing a boolean expression containing the characters `'0'`, `'1'`, `'&'`, `'!'`, and `'|'`. Each `'0'` or `'1'` represents a Boolean value, and the characters `'&'`, `'!'`, and `'|'` represent the logical operators AND, NOT, and OR respectively. The operators work according to the following rules:

- `'!'` will have exactly one boolean operand.
- `'&'` and `'|'` will have at least two boolean operands.

The boolean expression will always be valid. Your task is to parse the expression and return the boolean result of the expression.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the length of the expression:**
   - How long can the expression be? This gives insight into computational limits and efficiency requirements.

2. **Nested expressions:**
   - Can the boolean expression be nested arbitrarily deep?

3. **Input validation:**
   - Are we guaranteed that the input expression is always valid?

### Code

```cpp
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool parseBoolExpr(string expression) {
    stack<char> operators;
    stack<vector<bool>> operands;
    
    for (char c : expression) {
        if (c == '|' || c == '&' || c == '!') {
            operators.push(c);
            operands.push(vector<bool>());
        } else if (c == '0') {
            operands.top().push_back(false);
        } else if (c == '1') {
            operands.top().push_back(true);
        } else if (c == ')') {
            vector<bool> currentOperands = operands.top(); operands.pop();
            char op = operators.top(); operators.pop();
            bool result;
            if (op == '|') {
                result = false;
                for (bool val : currentOperands) {
                    result = result || val;
                    if (result) break;  // Short-circuit for OR
                }
            } else if (op == '&') {
                result = true;
                for (bool val : currentOperands) {
                    result = result && val;
                    if (!result) break;  // Short-circuit for AND
                }
            } else if (op == '!') {
                result = !currentOperands[0];  // NOT has exactly one operand
            }
            if (operands.empty()) {
                operands.push(vector<bool>());
            }
            operands.top().push_back(result);
        }
    }
    
    return operands.top()[0];
}

int main() {
    string expression = "!(&(!(0))";
    cout << (parseBoolExpr(expression) ? "true" : "false") << endl; // Output will be true
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Stacks for Operators and Operands:**
   - Use one stack to keep track of operators (`'&'`, `'!'`, `'|'`).
   - Use another stack to keep track of operands. Each element in this stack is a vector of boolean values that correspond to the operands of the currently unresolved operator.

2. **Iterating Through the Expression:**
   - Parse the expression character by character.
   - Push new operators onto the operator stack.
   - Push boolean values (`'0'` -> `false`, `'1'` -> `true`) onto the current operand vector.
   - When encountering a closing parenthesis `')'`, resolve the current expression by popping the top operator and its operand vector, then push the result back.

3. **Evaluate the Operators:**
   - `'|'`: Logical OR over all operands.
   - `'&'`: Logical AND over all operands.
   - `'!'`: Logical NOT on a single operand (first in the vector).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the expression. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the stacks used to store operators and operands which in the worst-case scenario can grow to the size of the expression.

This strategy ensures that the expression is evaluated correctly in linear time while maintaining clarity and correctness through the use of stacks.
