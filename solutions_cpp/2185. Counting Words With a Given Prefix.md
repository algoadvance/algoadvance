[Leetcode 2185. Counting Words With a Given Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2185)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `prefix`. You need to return the number of strings in `words` that contain the `prefix`.

### Example:
```
Input: words = ["pay", "attention", "practice", "attend"], prefix = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two words that start with "at": "attention" and "attend".
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Should the matching be case-sensitive?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, the matching is case-sensitive unless otherwise specified.

2. **Prefix Definition:**
   - Is the prefix guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, the prefix is non-empty.

3. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the lengths of the input arrays and strings?
   - **Assumption:**
     - `1 <= words.length <= 100`
     - `1 <= words[i].length, prefix.length <= 100`

## Strategy
1. **Iterate Through Array:**
   - We will iterate through each word in the `words` array.
   
2. **Check Prefix:**
   - For each word, check if it starts with the given `prefix` using the `std::string` member function `substr`.

3. **Count Matching Words:**
   - Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of words that start with the `prefix`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int countWordsWithPrefix(const std::vector<std::string>& words, const std::string& prefix) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const std::string& word : words) {
        if (word.substr(0, prefix.size()) == prefix) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> words = {"pay", "attention", "practice", "attend"};
    std::string prefix = "at";
    std::cout << "Number of words with the given prefix: " << countWordsWithPrefix(words, prefix) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Iterating through each word:** O(n) where `n` is the number of words.
- **Checking prefix for each word:** O(m) where `m` is the maximum length of a word or the prefix.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n * m).

This solution is efficient given the constraints provided. If the constraints were larger, optimization techniques such as Trie data structures could be considered.
