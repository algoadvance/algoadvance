[Leetcode 960. Delete Columns to Make Sorted III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l960)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of `n` strings `strs`, each of the same length `m`, you can choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, remove the characters corresponding to those indices. The goal is to delete the fewest columns such that the remaining columns are in lexicographical order for each row.

Return the minimum number of deletion indices needed to achieve this goal.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: strs = ["babca","dafcb","ghiij"]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the strings become ["bc","fc","ij"]. The remaining columns are in lexicographical order. 
```

### Constraints:

- `n == strs.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are all characters in the array of strings lowercase English letters? 
   - Yes, as per the constraints provided.
2. Can we have duplicate strings in the array?
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed, but that doesn't alter the overall strategy.
3. Is the order of strings in the input fixed, and do we need to maintain that order?
   - Yes, the order of strings in the input is fixed and should be maintained.

## Strategy

We need to figure out the minimum number of columns to delete such that the remaining columns are in lexicographical order vertically. This can be approached using dynamic programming (DP).

### Approach:

1. **Define DP State:**
   - Let `dp[j]` represent the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of columns ending at column `j`.

2. **Transition:**
   - For each pair of columns `i` and `j` (`0 <= i < j < m`), compare columns `i` and `j` to check if the characters in column `j` are lexicographically greater than or equal to the characters in column `i` for all rows. If so, update `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)`.

3. **Result:**
   - The minimum number of deletable columns will be `m - max(dp)`, where `m` is the number of columns.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        int m = strs[0].size();
        
        vector<int> dp(m, 1); // Initialize DP array with 1, as each column itself is an increasing subsequence
        
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            for (int i = 0; i < j; ++i) {
                bool valid = true;
                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (strs[k][i] > strs[k][j]) {
                        valid = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (valid) {
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int longest = *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
        return m - longest;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(m^2 * n)`, where `m` is the number of columns and `n` is the number of rows.
  - The nested loops in columns contribute `O(m^2)`.
  - The inner loop that checks lexicographical order for each string contributes `O(n)` for each pair of columns.
- The space complexity is `O(m)` for the DP array.
