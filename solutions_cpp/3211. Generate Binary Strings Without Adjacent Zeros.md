[Leetcode 3211. Generate Binary Strings Without Adjacent Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3211)
### Problem Statement

Given a number `n`, generate all binary strings of length `n` such that no two adjacent zeros are present in the string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`? (e.g., `1 <= n <= 20`)
   - Can `n` be zero?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the binary strings be returned in a specific order?
   - Should the binary strings be printed or returned as a list/array?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should happen if `n` is zero?

### Strategy
To generate all binary strings of length `n` with no two adjacent zeros, we can employ a backtracking approach:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If the length of the current string is `n`, add it to the result list.
   
2. **Recursive Case:**
   - If the last character in the current string is '0', the next character must be '1'.
   - If the last character in the current string is '1' or if the string is empty, the next character can be either '0' or '1'.
   
3. **Backtracking:**
   - Construct the string by adding either '0' or '1' to the current string and recursively generate the rest.
   - Use a helper function to handle the recursion.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void generate_strings(string current, int n, vector<string>& result) {
    if (current.length() == n) {
        result.push_back(current);
        return;
    }
    
    // If the last character is '0', only add '1'
    if (!current.empty() && current.back() == '0') {
        generate_strings(current + '1', n, result);
    } else {
        // If empty or last character is '1', add both '0' and '1'
        generate_strings(current + '0', n, result);
        generate_strings(current + '1', n, result);
    }
}

vector<string> generate_binary_strings(int n) {
    vector<string> result;
    generate_strings("", n, result);
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n = 3; // example input
    vector<string> result = generate_binary_strings(n);
    
    for (const string& str : result) {
        cout << str << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n). This is because in the worst case, we generate every possible combination of binary strings of length `n`, and backtracking helps to avoid invalid strings early. The number of valid combinations is significantly fewer than 2^n, especially for larger n, but in the worst case, we might need to consider every possibility initially.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n) for the call stack in the worst-case scenario where the call stack might grow up to the length `n` due to recursion, and O(2^n) space to store the valid binary strings generated.

### Edge Cases
1. If `n` is zero, the expected result would be a single binary string of zero length. It can be handled accordingly.
2. If n is 1, the valid strings are `0` and `1`.
