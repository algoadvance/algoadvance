[Leetcode 546. Remove Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l546)
### Problem Statement
Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers. You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there are no boxes left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (say `k` boxes), remove them and get `k*k` points. Find the maximum points you can get.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the number of boxes or the range of colors?
   - Constraints: The number of boxes will be between 1 and 100.
2. Are all box colors guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, all box colors are positive integers.
   
If there aren't further questions, let's move to the strategy.

### Strategy
1. **Definition of the Problem**:
   - This is a typical dynamic programming problem where the state of the solution depends on smaller subproblems.

2. **State Representation**:
   - We will use a 3D DP array `dp` where `dp[l][r][k]` represents the maximum points we can get from the subarray `boxes[l..r]` with `k` extra boxes of the same color as `boxes[l]` appended at the beginning.

3. **State Transition/DP Relation**:
   - There are two primary cases to consider:
     1. Remove `boxes[l]` together with `k` additional boxes of the same color connected to it (i.e., remove the subarray `[l, l]` and get `(k+1)*(k+1)` points).
     2. Try to merge `boxes[l]` with a box of the same color somewhere in the right subarray to get more points.

4. **Initialization**:
   - The base state would be `dp[l][r][k] = 0` when `l > r` (invalid subarray).

5. **Optimal Value**:
   - The desired result will be found in `dp[0][n-1][0]` where `n` is the length of boxes.

### Code

Here's the C++ code to solve this problem using the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int removeBoxes(vector<int>& boxes) {
        int n = boxes.size();
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> dp(n, vector<vector<int>>(n, vector<int>(n, 0)));
        
        return calculatePoints(boxes, dp, 0, n - 1, 0);
    }
    
private:
    int calculatePoints(vector<int>& boxes, vector<vector<vector<int>>>& dp, int l, int r, int k) {
        if (l > r) return 0;
        if (dp[l][r][k] != 0) return dp[l][r][k];
        
        // Increase `l` and `k` while there are boxes of the same color as `boxes[l]`
        while (l < r && boxes[l] == boxes[l + 1]) {
            l++;
            k++;
        }

        // Case 1: Remove the series of boxes[l] and its preceding boxes
        int res = (k + 1) * (k + 1) + calculatePoints(boxes, dp, l + 1, r, 0);
        
        // Case 2: Try to merge boxes[l] with some other boxes of the same color in the future
        for (int i = l + 1; i <= r; ++i) {
            if (boxes[i] == boxes[l]) {
                res = max(res, calculatePoints(boxes, dp, l + 1, i - 1, 0) + calculatePoints(boxes, dp, i, r, k + 1));
            }
        }

        dp[l][r][k] = res;
        return res;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^4)`. This is because for each sub-range `[l, r]`, there can be at most `n` different states for `k`, and there are `O(n^2)` sub-ranges. Each state computation involves looping through the range, giving it another `O(n)` factor. Hence, `O(n^4)` in worst case.

If there are no further questions or requirements, this would be an approach to solve the problem efficiently within given constraints.
