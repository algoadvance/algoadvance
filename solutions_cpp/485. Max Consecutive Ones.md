[Leetcode 485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l485)
### Problem Statement:

Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints on `nums`**:
   - What is the length range of the array? 
     - **Answer:** The length of `nums` can be between 0 and 10^5.
   - Will it only contain `0` and `1`? 
     - **Answer:** Yes, `nums` is a binary array.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be the output if the array is empty?
     - **Answer:** If the array is empty, the output should be `0` since there are no `1`s.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two counters: one to keep track of the current count of consecutive `1`s (`currentCount`), and another to store the maximum count encountered so far (`maxCount`).

2. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate through the array:
     - If the current element is `1`, increment the `currentCount`.
     - If the current element is `0`, compare `currentCount` with `maxCount` and update `maxCount` if necessary. Then, reset `currentCount` to zero since the sequence of consecutive `1`s is broken.

3. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, ensure to check and update `maxCount` one last time as the longest streak might be at the end of the array.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are performing a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for the std::max function

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;

        for(int num : nums) {
            if(num == 1) {
                currentCount++;
            } else {
                maxCount = std::max(maxCount, currentCount);
                currentCount = 0;
            }
        }

        // Final comparison in case the array ends with a sequence of 1s
        maxCount = std::max(maxCount, currentCount);

        return maxCount;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `maxCount` and `currentCount` are initialized to `0`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element in the array `nums`, we check if it is `1`. If it is, `currentCount` is incremented.
   - If the element is `0`, this means the sequence of consecutive `1`s has ended. We then update `maxCount` if `currentCount` (the length of the recent sequence) is greater than `maxCount`, and reset `currentCount` to `0`.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the final `maxCount` is compared with `currentCount` once more, in case the array ended with a sequence of `1`s.

This ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive `1`s in the binary array `nums`.
