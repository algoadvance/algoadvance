[Leetcode 376. Wiggle Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l376)
## Problem Statement

A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example: `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences, the second being not alternating and the third containing equal elements.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the elements of the array be negative or zero?
   **A:** Yes. The elements of the array can be any integers, including negative and zero.
   
2. **Q:** What is the constraint on the size of the array?
   **A:** The size of the array can be up to 1000 elements.

3. **Q:** Is an array with a single element considered a wiggle sequence?
   **A:** Yes, an array with a single element or an empty array is trivially a wiggle sequence.

## Strategy

The idea is to track the lengths of subsequences that end in a peak or a valley for every element in the array. We can do this with two state variables:

- `up[i]` which stores the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending in an increase at index `i`.
- `down[i]` which stores the length of the longest wiggle subsequence ending in a decrease at index `i`.

Initialize `up[0]` and `down[0]` to 1 since a single element is already a wiggle sequence. Then, as we iterate through the array from the second element, we update these states:

1. If `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`, it forms a peak, so `up[i] = down[i-1] + 1`.
2. If `nums[i] < nums[i-1]`, it forms a valley, so `down[i] = up[i-1] + 1`.
3. If `nums[i] == nums[i-1]`, it doesn't contribute to a wiggle therefore, `up[i] = up[i-1]` and `down[i] = down[i-1]`.

The result will be the maximum of the final `up` and `down`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n < 2) return n;

        std::vector<int> up(n, 1), down(n, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up[i] = down[i - 1] + 1;
                down[i] = down[i - 1];
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down[i] = up[i - 1] + 1;
                up[i] = up[i - 1];
            } else {
                up[i] = up[i - 1];
                down[i] = down[i - 1];
            }
        }

        return std::max(up[n - 1], down[n - 1]);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
  - We iterate through the array once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), for storing the `up` and `down` vectors.

An optimization is possible to reduce space complexity to \(O(1)\) by using two variables instead of arrays to keep the lengths. Here's the optimized version:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n < 2) return n;

        int up = 1, down = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up = down + 1;
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down = up + 1;
            }
        }

        return std::max(up, down);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity for Optimized Version

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), constant space for the `up` and `down` variables.
