[Leetcode 516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l516)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Example
- Input: `s = "bbbab"`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the string length (`n`)? 
     - (Typically, this will be something manageable, e.g., \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \))
   - Can the string contain special characters, or is it limited to lowercase/uppercase letters?
   - (Assume it contains only lowercase English letters for simplicity here.)

2. **Output:**
   - Should we return the length of the subsequence, or the subsequence itself?
   - (We need to return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.)

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the string is empty?
   - (Assume the length will be zero in this case.)
   - What if the string length is 1?
   - (A single character is a palindrome of length 1.)

## Strategy
We need to find the longest palindromic subsequence. This can be achieved using dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s the approach:

1. **Define a DP Table:**
   Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `i == j`, the length is `1` because a single character is a palindrome.
   - If `i > j`, this doesn't make sense in our context since it represents an invalid range.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]`.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

4. **Filling the Table:**
   - We will fill this table diagonally (from the base case upwards).

5. **Extract Result:**
   - The result will be in `dp[0][n-1]` which includes the entire string.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));
    
    // Base cases: A single character is a palindrome of length 1
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;
    }
    
    // Fill the table
    for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) { // starting from length 2 to n
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The result is in dp[0][n-1]
    return dp[0][n-1];
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
  - We fill up an \(n \times n\) table where each cell takes \(O(1)\) time to compute.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
  - We use an \(n \times n\) table to store intermediate results.

This solution is optimal for the constraints typically provided in competitive programming and interviews.
