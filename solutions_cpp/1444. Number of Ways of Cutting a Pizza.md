[Leetcode 1444. Number of Ways of Cutting a Pizza](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1444)
## Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular pizza represented by a `rows x cols` matrix containing the following characters:
- 'A' (an apple) representing an apple pizza topping
- '.' (no apple) representing an empty pizza part

You need to cut the pizza into `k` pieces using `k-1` cuts, and each piece should contain at least one apple. A cut can be made either horizontally or vertically, and it must be a straight line that goes from one side of the pizza to the other.

Return the number of ways to cut the pizza. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example

```
Input: pizza = ["A..","AAA","..."], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The ways to cut the pizza are:
1. Horizontal cut between row 1 and 2, and then vertical cuts between column 1 and 2.
2. Vertical cut between column 0 and 1, and then horizontal cuts between row 1 and 2.
3. Vertical cut between column 1 and 2, and then horizontal cuts between row 1 and 2.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= rows, cols <= 50`
- `1 <= k <= rows * cols`
- The sum of elements of pizza always contains at least `k` apples.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the pizza contain rows or columns without apples?
   - Yes, but each piece after the cuts must have at least one apple.
2. Is there an upper limit on k?
   - Yes, \(k\) is limited by the number of cells in the grid (i.e., \(rows \times cols\)).

## Strategy

1. **Pre-computation**: Use a prefix sum array to store the number of apples in any sub-section of the pizza, which will help in quick calculation of apples in any rectangular section.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a 3D DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where:
   - `i` and `j` represent the starting row and column of the current sub-pizza.
   - `k` represents the number of remaining cuts.
   - `dp[i][j][k]` will store the number of ways to partition the sub-pizza starting from `(i, j)` with `k` cuts left.

3. **Recursion with Memoization**: Implement the DP table using a top-down recursive approach with memoization to eliminate redundant computations.

4. **Base Case**: When k equals 0, check if the remaining section has at least one apple. If yes, return 1 (one way to achieve it), otherwise return 0.

5. **Transition**: Consider all possible horizontal and vertical cuts for each state and sum up the ways.

## Code

Here is the C++ code using the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>> dp;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> prefix;

    int numWays(std::vector<std::string>& pizza, int k) {
        int rows = pizza.size();
        int cols = pizza[0].size();
        
        // Initialize dp with -1 (indicating uncalculated states)
        dp = std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>>(rows, std::vector<std::vector<int>>(cols, std::vector<int>(k, -1)));
        
        // Prefix sum to calculate the number of apples in any sub-section [i...rows-1][j...cols-1]
        prefix = std::vector<std::vector<int>>(rows + 1, std::vector<int>(cols + 1, 0));

        for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = cols - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                prefix[i][j] = prefix[i+1][j] + prefix[i][j+1] - prefix[i+1][j+1] + (pizza[i][j] == 'A' ? 1 : 0);
            }
        }

        return dfs(0, 0, k - 1, rows, cols);
    }

    int dfs(int i, int j, int k, int rows, int cols) {
        if (prefix[i][j] == 0) return 0; // No apples
        if (k == 0) return 1; // No cuts left, valid if there's at least one apple

        if (dp[i][j][k] != -1) return dp[i][j][k]; // Already calculated

        int ways = 0;

        // Horizontal cuts
        for (int x = i + 1; x < rows; ++x) {
            if (prefix[i][j] > prefix[x][j]) { // There are apples in the above part
                ways = (ways + dfs(x, j, k - 1, rows, cols)) % mod;
            }
        }

        // Vertical cuts
        for (int y = j + 1; y < cols; ++y) {
            if (prefix[i][j] > prefix[i][y]) { // There are apples in the left part
                ways = (ways + dfs(i, y, k - 1, rows, cols)) % mod;
            }
        }

        return dp[i][j][k] = ways;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(rows * cols * (k-1) * max(rows, cols))`. In the worst-case scenario, for each state represented by the starting (i, j) position and the number of remaining cuts (k), we explore all potential cuts which can go up to the size of rows or cols.

The space complexity is `O(rows * cols * k)` due to the DP table and prefix array.
