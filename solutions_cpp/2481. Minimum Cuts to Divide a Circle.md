[Leetcode 2481. Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2481)
### Problem Statement

Given a circle, you need to determine the minimum number of cuts required to divide it into exactly `n` equal parts.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`? 
   - Are there any special values for `n` we need to consider (e.g., `n = 1`)?

**Clarifications:**
- The value of `n` will be a positive integer.
- For `n = 1`, no cuts are needed since the circle is already in one piece.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        return n;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - If `n` is 1, no cuts are required.
   - For any `n > 1`, we simply need `n` radial cuts to divide the circle into `n` parts. 

2. **Implementation Details:**
   - For `n = 1`, the answer is `0`.
   - For any other `n`, the minimum number of radial cuts needed to divide a circle into `n` equal parts is straightforwardly `n`.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - `n = 1`: No cuts required.
   - `n = 2`: One radial cut divides the circle into 2 equal parts.
   - `n = 3`: Two radial cuts originating from the center divide the circle into 3 equal parts.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this function is **O(1)**, since it involves a simple conditional check and constant time operations.

This solution provides the minimum number of cuts directly for any given `n`, adhering to the principles of simplicity and efficiency.
