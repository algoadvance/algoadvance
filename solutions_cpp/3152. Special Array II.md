[Leetcode 3152. Special Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3152)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the count of elements that satisfy the following properties:

1. The element should be greater than the count of unique elements in the given array.
2. The element, itself, must be unique in the given array.

Given an array `nums`, return the count of such elements.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The unique elements in the array are [2, 3, 4], and their count is 3. Only the number 4 is greater than 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be integers?
   - Yes.

2. Can the array contain negative integers?
   - Yes.

3. What should we return if no elements satisfy the condition?
   - Return 0.

4. Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

5. Is there a constraint on the size of the array `nums`?
   - Not explicitly mentioned, but assume typical constraints for array problems in LeetCode, possibly up to 10^5 elements.

## Strategy

1. Use a set to find all unique elements in the array.
2. Count the number of unique elements.
3. Initialize a counter to count the number of special elements.
4. Iterate over the set of unique elements and check if each element is greater than the count of unique elements.
5. Return the count of such elements.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int specialArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> uniqueElements(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int uniqueCount = uniqueElements.size();
        int specialCount = 0;
        
        unordered_map<int, int> freqCounter;
        for (int num : nums) {
            freqCounter[num]++;
        }
        
        for (int num : uniqueElements) {
            if (num > uniqueCount && freqCounter[num] == 1) {
                specialCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return specialCount;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the `uniqueElements` set:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Counting unique elements:** O(1), as the size() method has O(1) time complexity.
- **Building the frequency counter:** O(n), as we traverse the entire array.
- **Iterating through the unique elements:** O(m), where m is the count of unique elements. In the worst case, m == n.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** 
    - The space required for the `uniqueElements` set and frequency counter is O(n) in the worst case.
    - Thus, overall space complexity is O(n).

This ensures we have an efficient solution both in terms of time and space.
