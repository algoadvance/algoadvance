[Leetcode 2029. Stone Game IX](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2029)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated number with it. The stones are numbered from 1 to n where `n` is the total number of stones. They play a game that goes as follows:

1. Alice gets to go first, and they take turns alternately.
2. In each turn, a player must remove any one stone from either end of the remaining row of stones.
3. The game ends when there is no stone left.
4. The score of a player is calculated as the sum of the numbers on the stones they have taken.

Alice and Bob are both very good at the game and will play optimally to maximize their own scores.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n`, representing the numbers on the stones, Alice and Bob want to know if Alice can win the game assuming both play optimally. Return `true` if Alice can win, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a "win" for Alice?**
   - A: Alice wins if her score is greater than Bob's by the end of the game.

2. **What is the range of values for `n` and for the numbers on the stones?**
   - A: Typically, for such problems, `n` can go up to \(10^5\) and the numbers on the stones can be any integer within standard constraints for typical competitive programming problems.

3. **Are negative numbers allowed on the stones?**
   - A: Yes, negative numbers could be allowed, impacting the strategy for optimal play.

4. **Is the sum of the numbers on the stones important or is it just the relative scores between Alice and Bob?**
   - A: The win condition depends on the relative scores between Alice and Bob.

### Strategy

To approach the problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Alice starts first, so she has the initial advantage of choosing the first stone optimally.
   - The last stone to be removed matters since the game ends when there are no stones left.

2. **Game Tree and Dynamic Programming:**
   - We can use dynamic programming or a recursive approach with memoization to decide the winner by exploring all possible turns and calculating the resulting scores for both players.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players will choose the stones in a manner that maximizes their own score or minimizes the opponent's score for future turns.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy using recursion with memoization to determine if Alice can win. 

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

class Solution {
public:
    bool stoneGameIX(std::vector<int>& stones) {
        int count[3] = {0, 0, 0}; // count[i] for number of stones with remainder i when divided by 3
        for (int stone : stones) {
            count[stone % 3]++;
        }

        if (count[0] % 2 == 0) {
            return count[1] >= 1 && count[2] >= 1;
        } else {
            return abs(count[1] - count[2]) >= 3;
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Counting Remainders:** 
   - Count the number of stones falling into remainder categories when divided by 3.
   - Stones with remainder 0 are neutral and can influence player turn parity.

2. **Optimal Moves Based on Remainders:**
   - If the count of neutral stones (remainder 0) is even, the game becomes simpler, and Alice can win if there is at least one stone with remainder 1 and one with remainder 2.
   - If the count of neutral stones is odd, the difference between counts of stones with remainder 1 and 2 should be significant enough (â‰¥ 3) to grant Alice a favorable initial condition.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to single pass for classifying stones into their respective remainder groups.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since only a few integer variables are used for counting.

This efficient solution ensures that we determine if Alice can win based on the optimal play strategy dynamically derived from stone remainders.
