[Leetcode 2786. Visit Array Positions to Maximize Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2786)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array of `n` integers and an integer `k`. The array comprises both positive and negative values, and you are allowed to make exactly `k` transformations to maximize your score.

In each transformation, you can choose an index `i` and add or subtract the value of any other index `j` to `i`. Your goal is to maximize the score by the sum of elements in the array after exactly `k` transformations.

Write code to achieve this in C++.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range for the array (n)?**
   - Clarifying this helps in understanding potential computational limits and performance concerns.
  
2. **What are the constraints on the values of `k`?**
   - Knowing this ensures we understand the number of operations we are allowed to perform on the array.
  
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Does the array contain only positive/negative numbers?
   - What if all elements are zero?

Let's proceed with the assumption that the array size is reasonable (e.g., up to thousands) and `k` is also within a manageable range.

### Strategy

Our goal is to maximize the total score by selectively adding or subtracting array elements. Given the constraints, a greedy approach could be instrumental in achieving the optimal result.

1. **Sort the array**: This helps us easily identify the largest and smallest elements.
2. **Calculate Possible Outcomes**: We need to consider scenarios where we add and subtract elements to maximize the score.
3. **Greedy Approach**: Utilize the top `k` elements that can maximize the score due to their high values. If there's an opportunity to flip negative impacts to positive, we'll do so.

### Code

Hereâ€™s one potential approach to solve the problem in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maximizeScore(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
    
    int score = 0;
    int n = nums.size();

    // Sum the k largest values directly, which should give us a maximum initial score
    for (int i = 0; i < k && i < n; ++i) {
        score += nums[i];
    }

    // Consider rest elements for maximum optimization if k < n
    for (int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] > 0) {
            score += nums[i];
        }
    }

    return score;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {3, -1, 4, 1, 5};
    int k = 3;
    int result = maximizeScore(nums, k);
    cout << "Maximized Score: " << result << endl; // Output should show the maximum score with given constraints.
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Summing Top K Elements**: This operation is `O(k)`, but usually, `k` is much smaller than `n`.
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, hence `O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures that we are computing the maximum score efficiently while handling both positive and negative integers with a greedy algorithm.
