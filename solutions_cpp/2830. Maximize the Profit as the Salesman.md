[Leetcode 2830. Maximize the Profit as the Salesman](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2830)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `offers` of size `n` where `offers[i]` represents the profit you can earn by accepting the i-th offer. The constraint is that you cannot accept two consecutive offers. Your goal is to determine the maximum profit you can achieve considering this restriction.

**Example:**
```
Input: offers = [1, 2, 3, 1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Choose offers[0] and offers[2], which results in a total profit of 1 + 3 = 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `offers` contain negative profits?
   * **A:** No, `offers` contains non-negative integers only.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of `n` (size of `offers`)?
   * **A:** The size `n` can be up to `10^5`.
   
3. **Q:** Can we assume `offers` will always be non-empty?
   * **A:** Yes, `offers` will at least contain one offer.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve up to the `i-th` offer.

We can update the DP array as follows:
1. If we don't take the i-th offer, the maximum profit would be `dp[i-1]`.
2. If we take the i-th offer, the maximum profit would be `offers[i] + dp[i-2]` (because we can't take the i-th and (i-1)-th offers together).

The recurrence relation would thus be:
\[ dp[i] = \max(dp[i-1], offers[i] + (i > 1 ? dp[i-2] : 0)) \]

Finally, `dp[n-1]` will give us the maximum profit we can achieve.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeProfit(std::vector<int>& offers) {
        int n = offers.size();
        if (n == 1) return offers[0];
        
        std::vector<int> dp(n, 0);
        dp[0] = offers[0];
        dp[1] = std::max(offers[0], offers[1]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = std::max(dp[i-1], offers[i] + dp[i-2]);
        }
        
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};

// Sample usage
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<int> offers = {1, 2, 3, 1};
    int result = solution.maximizeProfit(offers);
    std::cout << "Maximized Profit: " << result << std::endl; // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the number of offers. This is because we are iterating through the `offers` array once.

The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) due to the usage of the `dp` array of size `n`. However, this can be reduced to \( O(1) \) by utilizing two variables to store intermediate results instead of the entire array.
