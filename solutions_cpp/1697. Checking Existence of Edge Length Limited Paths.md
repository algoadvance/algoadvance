[Leetcode 1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1697)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph of `n` nodes, represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, disi]` denotes a bidirectional edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with distance `disi`.

You are also given a list of queries, where `queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj]`, and the answer to the `jth` query is `true` if there is a path from `pj` to `qj` such that the distance of the maximum edge in the path is less than `limitj`, and `false` otherwise.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[j]` is the answer to the `jth` query.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - What are the constraints on `n` and the number of edges?
   - Are there any self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   - What values can `disi` and `limitj` take?

2. **Graph Characteristics:**
   - Will the graph be connected, or can it be disconnected?

3. **Query Characteristics:**
   - How many queries can there be?
   - Can `pj` and `qj` be the same?

### Constraints
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= edges.length, queries.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= disi, limitj <= 10^9`

## Strategy

This problem is a classic "distance-limited path" problem which can efficiently be solved using Disjoint Set Union (DSU) aka Union-Find data structure combined with sorting.

### Steps:
1. **Sort Edges**: Sort the edges based on their weights.
2. **Sort Queries**: Sort the queries based on their distance limits.
3. **Process Queries & Edges**: Use a modified Kruskal's algorithm:
   - Iterate through the sorted queries.
   - For each query, add edges to the union-find structure as long as their weights are less than `limitj` of the current query.
   - After adding all applicable edges, check if the `pj` and `qj` belong to the same connected component using the Union-Find structure.

### Union-Find Data Structure:
- We use union by rank and path compression to make union-find operations efficient.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class UnionFind {
public:
    UnionFind(int size) : parent(size), rank(size, 1) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
    
    int find(int u) {
        if (u != parent[u]) {
            parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
        }
        return parent[u];
    }
    
    void unite(int u, int v) {
        int rootU = find(u);
        int rootV = find(v);
        if (rootU != rootV) {
            if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;
            } else if (rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootU] = rootV;
            } else {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;
                rank[rootU]++;
            }
        }
    }

private:
    vector<int> parent;
    vector<int> rank;
};

vector<bool> distanceLimitedPathsExist(
    int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
    
    // Sort the edges based on their distance
    sort(edges.begin(), edges.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[2] < b[2];
    });
    
    // Save the original indices of the queries so we can put the results in the right order
    for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
        queries[i].push_back(i);
    }
    
    // Sort the queries based on their limit
    sort(queries.begin(), queries.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
        return a[2] < b[2];
    });
    
    UnionFind uf(n);
    vector<bool> result(queries.size());
    int edgeIndex = 0;
    
    // Process each query
    for (const vector<int>& query : queries) {
        int p = query[0];
        int q = query[1];
        int limit = query[2];
        int queryIndex = query[3];
        
        // Add all edges with distance < limit to the union-find structure
        while (edgeIndex < edges.size() && edges[edgeIndex][2] < limit) {
            uf.unite(edges[edgeIndex][0], edges[edgeIndex][1]);
            edgeIndex++;
        }
        
        // Check if p and q are connected
        result[queryIndex] = (uf.find(p) == uf.find(q));
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Edges**: `O(E log E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **Sorting Queries**: `O(Q log Q)`, where `Q` is the number of queries.
- **Union-Find Operations**: Amortized `O(1)` per operation due to path compression and union by rank.

Hence, the total time complexity is `O(E log E + Q log Q + (E + Q) α(n))`, where `α(n)` is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly and can be considered almost constant for practical purposes. Thus, it is approximately `O(E log E + Q log Q)`.

This approach is efficient and works within the given constraints.
