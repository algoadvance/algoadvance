[Leetcode 1630. Arithmetic Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1630)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers, and you are given an array of queries where each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, you need to determine if the subarray `nums[l] ... nums[r]` can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.

An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers that have the same difference between consecutive elements.

Return a list of boolean values where each boolean value corresponds to a query and indicates whether the subarray can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.

---

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** Are there any constraints on the size of the `nums` array and the number of queries?
2. **Range of Values:** What is the range of possible values for the elements in the `nums` array?
3. **Edge Cases:** How should we handle cases where the subarray length is less than or equal to 1? (Since any single element or empty array is trivially arithmetic)
4. **Duplicates:** Can the `nums` array contain duplicate values, and if so, should they be treated normally in determining the arithmetic sequence?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> checkArithmeticSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, vector<int>& l, vector<int>& r) {
        vector<bool> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < l.size(); ++i) {
            int start = l[i], end = r[i];
            vector<int> subarray(nums.begin() + start, nums.begin() + end + 1);
            
            if (isArithmetic(subarray)) {
                result.push_back(true);
            } else {
                result.push_back(false);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    bool isArithmetic(const vector<int>& arr) {
        if (arr.size() <= 1) return true;
        
        vector<int> sortedArr = arr;
        sort(sortedArr.begin(), sortedArr.end());
        
        int diff = sortedArr[1] - sortedArr[0];
        for (int i = 2; i < sortedArr.size(); ++i) {
            if (sortedArr[i] - sortedArr[i-1] != diff) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through Queries:** For each query defined by `l[i]` and `r[i]`, extract the subarray `nums[l[i]] ... nums[r[i]]`.
2. **Check Subarray:** Verify if the subarray can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.
3. **Helper Function:** Use a helper function `isArithmetic` to determine if a given subarray can be rearranged into an arithmetic sequence.
   - First, sort the subarray.
   - Then, check if the differences between consecutive elements are the same.
   - If the difference is consistent, the subarray can be rearranged to an arithmetic sequence; otherwise, it cannot.
4. **Result Storage:** Store the result for each query in a vector of boolean values and return this vector after processing all queries.

---

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting each subarray has a time complexity of \(O(m \log m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the subarray.
- **Overall Complexity:** For each query, we do sorting and a linear check of the subarray. If `k` is the number of queries and `n` is the size of the input array, the total worst-case time complexity would be \(O(k \cdot m \log m)\), where \(m\) is the average subarray size.

This solution is efficient given typical problem constraints on competitive programming platforms like LeetCode.
