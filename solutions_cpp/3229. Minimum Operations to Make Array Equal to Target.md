[Leetcode 3229. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3229)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of positive integers, `target` and `arr`. In one operation, you can insert any positive integer at any position of the array `arr`. The task is to return the minimum number of operations required to make `arr` equal to `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of `target` and `arr` the same initially?**
   - No, the lengths can be different.
   
2. **Can we replace existing elements in `arr`?**
   - No, only insertion operations are allowed.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the arrays?**
   - The lengths of the arrays can be reasonably large, e.g., up to 10,000 elements.

4. **Can there be duplicate elements in `target` or `arr`?**
   - Yes, both arrays can contain duplicate elements.

### Strategy

The problem can be rephrased as finding the longest subsequence of `target` that appears in `arr`. The minimum number of insertions required would then be the difference between the length of `target` and the length of this subsequence because every element in `target` that is not part of this subsequence needs to be individually inserted into `arr`.

1. **Create a position map for `target`:**
   - Use a hashmap or dictionary to store the positions of elements in `target`.

2. **Find the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**
   - Collect the positions of elements from `arr` as they appear in `target`.
   - Use patience sorting (or similar) to find the LIS of these positions.

3. **Calculate the number of insertions needed:**
   - Subtract the length of the LIS from the length of `target`.

### Code

Here's a C++ implementation to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

int minOperations(std::vector<int>& target, std::vector<int>& arr) {
    // Create a map for easy lookup of target positions
    std::unordered_map<int, int> targetPos;
    for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); ++i) {
        targetPos[target[i]] = i;
    }

    // Collect the positions of arr elements from target
    std::vector<int> positions;
    for (int num : arr) {
        if (targetPos.find(num) != targetPos.end()) {
            positions.push_back(targetPos[num]);
        }
    }

    // Find the Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) in positions
    std::vector<int> lis;
    for (int pos : positions) {
        auto it = std::lower_bound(lis.begin(), lis.end(), pos);
        if (it == lis.end()) {
            lis.push_back(pos);
        } else {
            *it = pos;
        }
    }

    // Return the minimum number of insertions needed
    return target.size() - lis.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> target = {5, 1, 3};
    std::vector<int> arr = {9, 4, 2, 3, 4};

    std::cout << "Minimum operations: " << minOperations(target, arr) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Creating the position map for `target`: O(n), where n is the length of `target`.
- Collecting positions: O(m), where m is the length of `arr`.
- Finding the LIS: O(m log m) since patience sorting and `std::lower_bound` are used.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m log m), which is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
