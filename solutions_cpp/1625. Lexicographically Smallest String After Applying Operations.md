[Leetcode 1625. Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1625)
## Problem Statement:

Given a string `s` of even length consisting of digits from 0 to 9, you can apply either of the following operations any number of times:

1. Add a `a` to all odd indices of the string (0-indexed). Digits wrap around, so adding `a` to a digit would result in `(digit + a) % 10`.
2. Rotate the string to the right by `b` positions.

Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after applying the above operations any number of times.

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "5525", a = 9, b = 2`
   Output: `"2050"`
2. Input: `s = "74", a = 5, b = 1`
   Output: `"24"`

### Clarifying Questions:
- Can `a` and `b` be zero? 
  - For the scope of this problem, it's unlikely but especially in the case where `b = 0`, the string rotation has no effect.

- Can we assume the string always consists of digits from 0 to 9?
  - Yes, based on the problem statement.

## Strategy:

The main strategy for this problem is to explore all possible combinations of strings after applying the given operations a reasonable number of times. We will utilize a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible strings, starting from the given string `s`. 

### Steps:
1. Use BFS to explore all possible transformations of the string `s`.
2. Enqueue the initial string along with its transformations by applying operation 1 and rotation by `b` positions respectively.
3. Keep a set to track visited strings to avoid redundant processing.
4. At the end, return the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the BFS.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

string addA(string s, int a) {
    for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i += 2) {
        s[i] = (s[i] - '0' + a) % 10 + '0';
    }
    return s;
}

string rotateB(string s, int b) {
    int n = s.size();
    return s.substr(n - b) + s.substr(0, n - b);
}

string findLexSmallestString(string s, int a, int b) {
    queue<string> q;
    unordered_set<string> visited;
    string result = s;

    q.push(s);
    visited.insert(s);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        string curr = q.front();
        q.pop();

        if (curr < result) {
            result = curr;
        }

        // Apply operation 1
        string added = addA(curr, a);
        if (visited.find(added) == visited.end()) {
            visited.insert(added);
            q.push(added);
        }

        // Apply operation 2
        string rotated = rotateB(curr, b);
        if (visited.find(rotated) == visited.end()) {
            visited.insert(rotated);
            q.push(rotated);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "5525";
    int a = 9;
    int b = 2;
    cout << findLexSmallestString(s, a, b) << endl; // Output: "2050"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- The size of the state space in the worst case is `O(10^n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` (because each digit can take one of 10 values).
- For each state, we perform constant time operations ensured by string transformations and queue operations.
  
Thus, the time complexity could be considered as `O(10^n)`, which is practically feasible for small values of `n` (usual constraints in competitive programming).

This solution performs BFS ensuring optimal and controlled exploration of possible string transformations.
