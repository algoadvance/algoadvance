[Leetcode 2768. Number of Black Blocks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2768)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of integers `m x n`, filled with values `0` (white blocks) and `1` (black blocks). Your task is to find the number of 2x2 sub-grids (squares) in the grid that contain:
1. Exactly 0 black blocks.
2. Exactly 1 black block.
3. Exactly 2 black blocks.
4. Exactly 3 black blocks.
5. Exactly 4 black blocks.

You need to return an array of 5 integers, where the i-th integer represents the number of 2x2 sub-grids containing exactly i black blocks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - What are the limits for `m` and `n`?
   - Can `m` or `n` be less than 2?

2. **Dimensions and Values:**
   - Is the grid filled only with 0s and 1s?

### Strategy

1. **Grid Traversal:**
   - We need to evaluate each possible 2x2 sub-grid within the given `m x n` grid.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through rows and columns in such a way that each position `(i, j)` represents the top-left corner of a 2x2 sub-grid.

2. **Counting Black Blocks:**
   - For each 2x2 sub-grid identified, we check the number of black blocks (`1`s) within the sub-grid.
   - Based on the count of `1`s in each 2x2 sub-grid, we update our results.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that the grid dimensions are valid (both `m` and `n` should be at least 2).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> countBlackBlocks(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    std::vector<int> result(5, 0); // result[0] to result[4] will store counts for 0 to 4 black blocks
    
    if (m < 2 || n < 2) {
        return result;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; ++j) {
            int blackBlockCount = grid[i][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i+1][j+1];
            result[blackBlockCount]++;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The code iterates through each possible 2x2 sub-grid in the given `m x n` grid.
- We have to check `(m-1) * (n-1)` sub-grids.
- Each sub-grid examination is done in constant time (4 checks and summation).
  
Thus, the time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**.

### Example

Consider the grid:
```
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
```

- 2x2 sub-grids:
  - Top-left: [1, 0; 0, 1]
  - Top-right: [0, 0; 1, 0]
  - Bottom-left: [0, 1; 0, 0]
  - Bottom-right: [1, 0; 0, 1]

The result is `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`:
- 1 sub-grid with 0 black blocks.
- 2 sub-grids with 1 black block.
- 1 sub-grid with 2 black blocks.
- 0 sub-grids with 3 black blocks.
- 0 sub-grids with 4 black blocks.
