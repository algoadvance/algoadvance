[Leetcode 2641. Cousins in Binary Tree II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2641)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of all its cousins' values. Two nodes of a binary tree are considered cousins if they have the same depth but different parents.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of integer values that a node can have?
   - Can the tree nodes hold negative values?
   - Can the tree have only one node?

2. **Output**: 
   - Should we return the modified tree as an output?

3. **Special Case Handling**: 
   - How should we handle the root node since it has no cousins?
   - Are the node values unique in the tree?

### Example to Understand
Given the binary tree:

```
      1
    /   \
   2     3
  / \   / \
 4   5 6   7
```

The resulting tree should be:

```
       0   (root has no cousins)
    /     \
  18       15
 /  \     /  \
0    0   0    0
```

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
   - We will move through the tree in levels.
   - At each level, we need to calculate the sum of nodes and then update each node's value based on its cousins.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a queue to facilitate the BFS.

3. **Handling Each Level Separately**:
   - For each level in the tree, compute the total sum of node values.
   - Subtract the node’s value to get the combined value of its cousins.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - We traverse each node exactly once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* replaceValueInTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        std::queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int level_size = q.size();
            long long sum = 0;

            // Calculate the sum of the values of all nodes at the current level.
            std::vector<TreeNode*> level_nodes;
            for (int i = 0; i < level_size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                level_nodes.push_back(node);
                sum += node->val;
            }

            // Set each node's new value as the sum of cousins' values.
            for (auto node : level_nodes) {
                int parent_sum = sum - node->val;
                node->val = parent_sum - (node->left ? node->left->val : 0) - (node->right ? node->right->val : 0);

                // Push children to the queue.
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
        }

        return root;
    }
};

// Function to print Inorder traversal (for debugging)
void printInorder(TreeNode* node) {
    if (node == nullptr) return;
    printInorder(node->left);
    std::cout << node->val << " ";
    printInorder(node->right);
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(6);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);

    Solution sol;
    TreeNode* newRoot = sol.replaceValueInTree(root);

    printInorder(newRoot); // Expected output will follow the logic explained above

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Queue**: We use a queue to visit each level of the tree.
2. **Level Processing**: For each node at a level, we calculate the sum of all node values at that level.
3. **Node Update**: Each node’s value is replaced with the sum of all values at that level, subtracting the node’s own value and also its direct children’s values (to leave only cousins’ values).

### Time Complexity
The solution traverses the tree once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(w) where w is the maximum width of the tree (the maximum number of nodes at any level).
