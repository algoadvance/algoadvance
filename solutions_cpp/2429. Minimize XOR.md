[Leetcode 2429. Minimize XOR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2429)
## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers num1 and num2, return the minimum XOR value obtained when you swap any number of set** (1) bits in num1 with any number of set bits in num2.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the inputs?**
   - Two positive integers, num1 and num2.

2. **What is the range of the inputs?**
   - As they are positive integers, typically they could be within the range of 1 to \(2^{31} - 1\) based on typical constraints, but we need to handle large integers within 32-bit limit.

3. **What is the expected output?**
   - A single integer which is the minimized XOR value after swapping bits to get minimum XOR value.

4. **Are there any constraints or edge cases to consider?**
   - Both numbers will have at least one set bit.
   - The goal is to find the minimal XOR value achievable by swapping any number of set bits.

## Strategy

1. **Count and Compare Set Bits**: 
   - Count the number of set bits (1s) in both `num1` and `num2`.
   
2. **Balance the Set Bits**:
   - Depending on the counts, we balance the number of set bits in such a way that the difference between the number of set bits between `num1` and `num2` is minimized.
   - This could lead to direct swapping if the counts match, or adjusting the bits optimally.
   
3. **Construct the Minimized XOR Value**:
   - Adjust the binary representation of `num1` based on the required set bit count to match `num2`.
   - Construct a new number with the required set bits to minimize the XOR.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <bitset>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        // Count the number of set bits (1s) in num1 and num2
        int count1 = __builtin_popcount(num1);
        int count2 = __builtin_popcount(num2);
        
        // Determine the target number of set bits for the minimized XOR number
        int targetSetBits = count2;
        
        // Create a number with the exact targetSetBits set bits
        int result = 0;
        
        // First, try to set same positions where `num1` has set bits
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0 && targetSetBits > 0; --i) {
            if (num1 & (1 << i)) {
                result |= (1 << i);
                --targetSetBits;
            }
        }
        
        // If there are still set bits needed, set the lowest possible bits
        for (int i = 0; i < 32 && targetSetBits > 0; ++i) {
            if (!(result & (1 << i))) {
                result |= (1 << i);
                --targetSetBits;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting Set Bits**: O(1) because it involves calling a built-in function on integers with a fixed bit width (32 bits).
- **Setting Result Bits**: O(32), which is constant time as the range is bound by the bit width of the integer.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(1).
