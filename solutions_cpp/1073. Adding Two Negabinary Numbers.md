[Leetcode 1073. Adding Two Negabinary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1073)
### Problem Statement

Given two numbers `arr1` and `arr2` in negabinary, return the sum of these two numbers in the same negabinary representation. The numbers are given in the form of arrays of 0s and 1s. They start with the most significant bit at the head and each list will not contain leading zeroes, except if the number is zero itself.

For example:
- Input: `arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1]`, `arr2 = [1,0,1]`
- Output: `[1,0,0,0,0]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is negabinary?**
   - Negabinary (base -2) is a non-standard positional numeral system where each bit represents a power of -2.
   
2. **Can the numbers be negative?**
   - No, the input arrays represent unsigned integers in negabinary form.

3. **Are the input arrays guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, they are guaranteed to be non-empty.

### Strategy

To add two numbers represented in negabinary:

1. **Initialize the Indices:**
   - Use indices to traverse from the least significant bit (from the rightmost bit) to the most significant bit of both arrays.
   
2. **Simulate Addition:**
   - Add corresponding bits and keep track of the carry. Negabinary uses base `-2`, hence carries might differ from binary.
   
3. **Handle the Carry:**
   - After processing all elements, ensure carry is propagated appropriately.

### Code

Here's the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> addNegabinary(std::vector<int>& arr1, std::vector<int>& arr2) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    int carry = 0;
    int i = arr1.size() - 1;
    int j = arr2.size() - 1;

    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry != 0) {
        int a = i >= 0 ? arr1[i--] : 0;
        int b = j >= 0 ? arr2[j--] : 0;
        int sum = a + b + carry;

        // For negabinary, we need to handle carries
        result.push_back(sum & 1);
        carry = -(sum >> 1);
    }

    // Remove leading zeros, if present
    while (result.size() > 1 && result.back() == 0) {
        result.pop_back();
    }

    std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through both arrays once, hence it's O(max(N, M)), where `N` and `M` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
- **Space Complexity:** The space used is primarily for the result vector, which is O(max(N, M)).

This should help in solving the given problem efficiently.
