[Leetcode 2027. Minimum Moves to Convert String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2027)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of `n` characters where each character is either `'X'` or `'.'`. A move consists of changing three consecutive characters from `'X'` to `'.'`. Your task is to return the minimum number of moves required to convert the string such that there are no characters `'X'` in the string.

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few points:

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
2. **Contiguous `'X'`**: Are the `'X'` characters always contiguous or can they be scattered throughout the string?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should we return if the string is already composed entirely of `'.'`?
4. **Changes to Non-contiguous `'X'`**: Can the moves overlap? Would changing three `X`s affect adjacent characters?

We will assume:
- The string `s` can be of any length up to a reasonably large constraint.
- `'X'` characters can appear anywhere intermittently and the moves do not overlap; each move affects a distinct set of 3 characters.

### Strategy
- We will iterate through the string from left to right.
- Whenever we encounter an `'X'`, we will make a move that changes the current and the next two characters to `'.'`.
- We will then skip the next two characters as they have been taken care of by the current move.
- Repeat until we reach the end of the string.

### Code
Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minimumMoves(std::string s) {
    int n = s.size();
    int moves = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s[i] == 'X') {
            // We found an 'X', hence we make a move to turn this and next two characters into '.'
            moves++;
            // Skip the next two characters since this move will already convert them
            i += 2;
        }
    }

    return moves;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "XX.XX..XXX";
    std::cout << "Minimum moves to convert the string: " << minimumMoves(s) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with `moves = 0` and iterate through each character of `s`.
2. **Handling 'X'**: 
   - If we encounter an 'X', increment the `moves` counter.
   - Skip the next two characters since they are also converted to `'.'` by this move.
3. **Iteration**: Continue till the end of the string.
4. **Returning Result**: The `moves` variable will contain the minimal number of moves required.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables and the space required does not depend on the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal number of moves required to convert all `'X'` characters in the string to `'.'`.
