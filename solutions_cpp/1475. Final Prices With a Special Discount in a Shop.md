[Leetcode 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1475)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of prices for a shop, you need to compute the final prices after applying a special discount. The discount on the price of a particular item is equal to the price of the next item in the list which has a price less than or equal to the current item's price. If there is no such item, then no discount is applied to the current item's price.

Write a function `vector<int> finalPrices(vector<int>& prices)` that takes a list of integers `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `i-th` item, and returns a list of integers representing the final prices after the discounts have been applied.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the prices non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, prices are guaranteed to be non-negative integers.
2. **What should be the return type?**
   - The return type should be a vector of integers.
3. **Can there be repeated prices in the list?**
   - Yes, there can be repeated prices.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the List:** We will iterate through the list of prices.
2. **Find the Discount:** For each item, find the first subsequent item whose price is less than or equal to the current item's price.
3. **Apply the Discount:** Subtract this value from the current item’s price.
4. **Build the Result:** Store the final prices in a new list and return it.

We can use a stack to efficiently find the next smaller or equal price to the right for each item. This allows us to solve the problem in linear time complexity.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>

std::vector<int> finalPrices(std::vector<int>& prices) {
    int n = prices.size();
    std::vector<int> result(prices);
    std::stack<int> st;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        while (!st.empty() && prices[st.top()] >= prices[i]) {
            int idx = st.top();
            st.pop();
            result[idx] = prices[idx] - prices[i];
        }
        st.push(i);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result` vector is initialized with the same elements as `prices`.
   - A stack `st` is used to keep track of indices where we are looking for a discount.

2. **Traversal and Discount Application:**
   - We iterate over each element in the `prices` vector.
   - For each price, we check if the stack is not empty and the price at the top index of the stack is greater than or equal to the current price (`prices[i]`).
   - If true, it means we found a discount for the price at the index stored in the stack. We pop that index, and then reduce the `result` at that index by `prices[i]`.
   - Push the current index `i` onto the stack.

3. **Return the `result` vector as the final prices after discount application.**

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – Each element is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once, resulting in linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) – In the worst case, the stack could hold all n elements (e.g., if the prices are in strictly increasing order).

This approach efficiently computes the final prices after applying the described discounts.
