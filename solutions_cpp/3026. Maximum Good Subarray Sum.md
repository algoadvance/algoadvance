[Leetcode 3026. Maximum Good Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3026)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A subarray of nums is called good if:

1. There is at least one element in the subarray.
2. The sum of all the elements of the subarray is a positive integer.
3. The product of all the elements of the subarray is a positive odd integer.

Return the maximum sum of the good subarrays of nums. If no such subarrays exist, return 0.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the `nums` array?**
   - The length of the array will be within the range of `[1, 10^5]`.

2. **What are the constraints on the values of `nums` elements?**
   - The values of the elements in the `nums` array will be within the range of `[-10^6, 10^6]`.

3. **Do we need to consider zero as a positive number?**
   - No, zero is neither positive nor negative, and it will not be considered as part of the sum of the good subarrays.

4. **Can we have a brief explanation for the odd integer condition?**
   - For the subarray product to be a positive odd integer, each number in the subarray must be positive, and the count of even numbers must be exactly zero (as any even number would make the product even).

## Strategy

1. **Identifying good subarrays:**
   - All elements must be positive (to maintain a positive product).
   - All elements must be odd (to maintain an odd product).

2. **Calculating subarray sums:**
   - We can utilize a sliding window or a variation of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to track the maximum sum of good subarrays.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The array has only negative or zero values.
   - No subarray meets the criteria.

## C++ Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxGoodSubarraySum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int max_sum = 0;
    int current_sum = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (num > 0 && num % 2 != 0) {
            current_sum += num;
            max_sum = std::max(max_sum, current_sum);
        } else {
            current_sum = 0; // reset if num is not a positive odd number
        }
    }

    return max_sum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 2, 5, 1, 7}; // Example input
    std::cout << maxGoodSubarraySum(nums) << std::endl; // Expected output is the maximum sum of the good subarray
    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Loop through the array:**
   - Check each number to see if it is a positive odd integer.
   
2. **Calculate sums for good subarrays:**
   - Maintain a running sum (`current_sum`) of consecutive positive odd integers.
   - If a number breaks the constraint (is not a positive odd integer), reset the `current_sum`.

3. **Track the maximum sum:**
   - Update `max_sum` whenever a new `current_sum` exceeds it.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the array once, thus the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of elements.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for variables (`max_sum` and `current_sum`).

This approach is efficient given the constraints and will work well within the provided limits.
