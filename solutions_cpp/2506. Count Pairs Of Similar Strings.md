[Leetcode 2506. Count Pairs Of Similar Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2506)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed string array `words`. Two strings are similar if they consist of the same characters.

- For example, "abca" and "cba" are similar since both consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- However, "abca" and "cbad" are not similar since they contain different characters.

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i < j < n` and the two strings `words[i]` and `words[j]` are similar.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the strings case-sensitive?
   - **A**: The problem appears to focus on characters, assuming lowercase. Unless otherwise specified, we'll assume the strings are case-sensitive.

2. **Q**: What is the maximum length of the `words` array?
   - **A**: The constraints are not specified, but typically LeetCode problems handle arrays up to a few thousands in length.

3. **Q**: If two words have the same characters but different frequencies, are they similar?
   - **A**: Yes, the frequency of characters does not matter, only the set of characters does.

### Strategy

1. **Set Representation:** Convert each word into a set of characters. If two words have the same sets of characters, they are similar.

2. **Map for Counting Sets:** Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each unique set of characters.

3. **Count Pairs:** For each unique set, count the pairs using the formula for combinations. Specifically, for a set appearing \( k \) times, the number of ways to pick 2 out of \( k \) is \( \binom{k}{2} = \frac{k (k - 1)}{2} \).

### Plan to Implement

1. Initialize a hashmap to store the frequency of each unique set.
2. Convert each word into a set of characters and update the hashmap.
3. Iterate over the hashmap to compute the number of pairs for each set that appears more than once.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countPairs(vector<string>& words) {
        // Map to store the frequency of each unique set of characters
        unordered_map<string, int> charsetCount;

        // Helper function to get the sorted string representation of a set of characters
        auto getCharSet = [](const string& word) {
            set<char> charSet(word.begin(), word.end());
            string sortedSet(charSet.begin(), charSet.end());
            return sortedSet;
        };
        
        // Populate the charsetCount map
        for (const string& word : words) {
            string charSet = getCharSet(word);
            charsetCount[charSet]++;
        }
        
        // Calculate the number of similar pairs
        int count = 0;
        for (const auto& [charSet, freq] : charsetCount) {
            if (freq > 1) {
                count += (freq * (freq - 1)) / 2; // Combination nC2
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing each word:** Converting a word into a set and then into a string takes \( O(L \log L) \), where \( L \) is the length of the word (set insertion cost).
- **HashMap Operations:** Inserting and looking up each set in the hash map takes \( O(1) \) (amortized average).
- **Total Complexity:** Let \( n \) be the number of words and \( L \) be the average length of the words. We do \( O(n \cdot L \log L) \) for preprocessing and \( O(n) \) for the hashmap operations, making the overall time complexity \( O(n \cdot L \log L) \).

This solution efficiently counts pairs of similar strings by leveraging the power of sets and hashmaps to group and count the unique character sets.
