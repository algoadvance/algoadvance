[Leetcode 2129. Capitalize the Title](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2129)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `title` consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, with each word containing English letters. Your task is to capitalize each word such that:
1. If the length of the word is exactly 1 character, it remains lowercase.
2. If the length of the word is exactly 2 characters, it remains lowercase.
3. If the length of the word is more than 2 characters, capitalize the first character and convert the rest to lowercase.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:**
   - What is the format of `title`? -- The input string `title` will contain one or more words separated by single spaces.
   
2. **Output:**
   - What is the format of the output? -- A single string where each word in the `title` is capitalized according to the given rules.

### Code
Here is the C++ solution for the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <cctype>

std::string capitalizeTitle(std::string title) {
    std::istringstream iss(title);
    std::string result;
    std::string word;
    
    while (iss >> word) {
        if (word.length() > 2) {
            word[0] = std::toupper(word[0]);
            for (size_t i = 1; i < word.length(); ++i) {
                word[i] = std::tolower(word[i]);
            }
        } else {
            for (char &c : word) {
                c = std::tolower(c);
            }
        }
        
        if (!result.empty()) {
            result += " ";
        }
        result += word;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string title = "this is a test title for Capitalize the Title";
    std::string capitalizedTitle = capitalizeTitle(title);

    std::cout << capitalizedTitle << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Reading Words:** Use `std::istringstream` to split the input `title` into individual words.
2. **Capitalizing Words:** For each word:
    - If its length is greater than 2, capitalize the first character and convert the remaining characters to lowercase.
    - If its length is 2 or less, convert all characters to lowercase.
3. **Constructing the Result:** Append each processed word to the result string with spaces in between.
4. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the input string is empty or contains multiple spaces. The `std::istringstream` takes care of extra spaces by default.

### Time Complexity
- Splitting the string and iterating over each word is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- Converting characters within each word to the appropriate case is another `O(m)` operation where `m` is the length of each word.

Combining both, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient for this problem as each character in the input string is processed a constant number of times.
