[Leetcode 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l102)
### Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if the tree is empty (i.e., the `root` is `NULL`)?**
   - The function should return an empty vector.

2. **Can we assume the tree nodes contain only integer values?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, we can assume the nodes contain integer values.

### Strategy
1. **Use a queue to facilitate level order traversal**:
    - We will use a `queue` to keep track of nodes at each level.
    - Start by pushing the root node into the queue.
    - Iterate while the queue is not empty, processing nodes level by level.

2. **Process nodes level by level**:
    - For each level, determine the number of nodes at that level (i.e., the size of the queue).
    - Process nodes one by one, adding their children to the queue.
    - Collect the node values for the current level in a temporary vector and then add this vector to the result vector.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

 // Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (!root) {
            return result;  // Return an empty result if the tree is empty.
        }
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;  // Queue for storing nodes at each level.
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int level_size = q.size();  // Number of nodes at the current level.
            vector<int> current_level;  // To store node values at the current level.
            
            for (int i = 0; i < level_size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                current_level.push_back(node->val);
                if (node->left) {
                    q.push(node->left);
                }
                if (node->right) {
                    q.push(node->right);
                }
            }
            result.push_back(current_level);  // Add the current level to the result.
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, the queue (and the resulting vector) will store all nodes of the tree. This happens when the tree is completely unbalanced (e.g., a linked list). In the case of a balanced tree, the space complexity would be less but still proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.
