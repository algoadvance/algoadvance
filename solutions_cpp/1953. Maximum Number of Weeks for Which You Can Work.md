[Leetcode 1953. Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1953)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `milestones` where each `milestones[i]` denotes the number of milestones completed by the ith project. You can work on the projects following these rules:
1. You cannot work on two different projects for two consecutive weeks. In other words, after working on project `i` in a given week, you cannot work on project `i` in the following week.
2. You can work on any project any number of weeks, in any order (i.e., you can rearrange the work schedule as needed).

Your task is to calculate the maximum number of weeks you can work on the projects following the aforementioned rules.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - What is the range of the length of the array?
    - What is the range of the values inside the array?

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single project in the array.
    - All project milestones having the same number of milestones.
    - A project with significantly higher milestones as compared to others.

### Strategy

1. **Sum of Milestones**:
   - Calculate the total sum of all milestones, `totalSum = sum(milestones)`.

2. **Maximum Milestones**:
   - Identify the project `maxMilestone` with the maximum number of milestones.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - If `maxMilestone` is not greater than half of `totalSum + 1`, then it's possible to rearrange the projects such that no project is repeated on consecutive weeks. Thus, the total number of weeks will be `totalSum`.
   - If `maxMilestone` is greater than half of `totalSum + 1`, it won't be possible to avoid consecutive weeks for the project with the largest milestones. Hence, the maximum number of weeks will be `2 * (totalSum - maxMilestone) + 1`.

### Time Complexity
- Finding the sum of milestones: O(n)
- Finding the maximum number of milestones in the array: O(n)
- Overall time complexity: O(n)

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric> // for std::accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    long long numberOfWeeks(std::vector<int>& milestones) {
        long long totalSum = std::accumulate(milestones.begin(), milestones.end(), 0LL);
        int maxMilestone = *std::max_element(milestones.begin(), milestones.end());
        
        if (maxMilestone <= totalSum - maxMilestone + 1)
            return totalSum;
        else
            return 2 * (totalSum - maxMilestone) + 1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Calculate Total Sum**: Using `std::accumulate` to get the sum of all milestones.
2. **Find Maximum Milestone**: Using `std::max_element` to identify the project with the highest number of milestones.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `maxMilestone` is less than or equal to `totalSum - maxMilestone + 1`, the maximum number of weeks is `totalSum` since it is possible to distribute the work among different projects without breaking rules.
   - Otherwise, we adjust the maximum number of weeks considering the excess milestones.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum number of weeks while adhering to the rule of not working on the same project in consecutive weeks.
