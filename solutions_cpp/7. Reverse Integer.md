[Leetcode 7. Reverse Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l7)
### Problem Statement

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** How should the function behave when encountering a value outside the 32-bit integer range after reversing?
   **A:** The function should return 0 if the reversed integer overflows outside of the 32-bit signed integer range [−2^31, 2^31 − 1].
   
2. **Q:** Are there any special characters or spaces in the input?
   **A:** No, the input would be a standard 32-bit signed integer.

3. **Q:** Should we consider leading zeros in the input?
   **A:** No, leading zeros should be stripped in the output.

### Strategy

1. We will initialize a variable (`reversed`) to store the reversed number.
2. We will process the given integer digit by digit using modulo and division operations.
3. Before adding each digit to `reversed`, we will check if `reversed` might overflow when updated. This requires checking against `INT_MAX / 10` and `INT_MIN / 10`.
4. If it is safe to add the digit, we proceed. Otherwise, we should return 0 to indicate an overflow.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <limits.h>

class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        int reversed = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            int pop = x % 10;
            x /= 10;
            // Check for overflow before actually performing the multiplication and addition
            if (reversed > INT_MAX/10 || (reversed == INT_MAX / 10 && pop > 7)) return 0;
            if (reversed < INT_MIN/10 || (reversed == INT_MIN / 10 && pop < -8)) return 0;
            reversed = reversed * 10 + pop;
        }
        return reversed;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::cout << solution.reverse(123) << std::endl;  // Output: 321
    std::cout << solution.reverse(-123) << std::endl; // Output: -321
    std::cout << solution.reverse(120) << std::endl;  // Output: 21
    std::cout << solution.reverse(0) << std::endl;    // Output: 0
    // Overflow cases
    std::cout << solution.reverse(1534236469) << std::endl; // Output: 0
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(log10(n))**, where `n` is the input number. This is because we are processing each digit of the number once.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the size of `n`.
