[Leetcode 1002. Find Common Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1002)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the `words` (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of each string?
   - What is the maximum number of strings in the array?
2. **Character Set:**
   - Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?
   - Should we consider case-sensitivity?
3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the characters in the output array be in a specific order?

Assumptions based on typical constraints:
- Each string consists of lowercase English letters (`a`-`z`).
- The strings can vary in length and total number of strings is reasonably large but within typical constraints for such problems.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Use an array to count the frequency of each character ('a' to 'z') for all the strings.
   - Initialize a minimum frequency array with high values (e.g., `INT_MAX`).

2. **Calculate Minimum Frequencies:**
   - For each string, calculate the frequency of each character.
   - Update the minimum frequency array to keep track of the smallest frequency for each character across all strings.

3. **Collect Common Characters:**
   - Iterate over the frequency array, and for each character that has a non-zero minimum frequency, append that character to the result array the number of times indicated by the minimum frequency.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

vector<string> commonChars(vector<string>& words) {
    vector<int> minFreq(26, INT_MAX); // To store the minimum frequency of each character

    for (const string& word : words) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0); // Frequency of characters in the current word
        for (char c : word) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        // Update the minFreq array
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            minFreq[i] = min(minFreq[i], freq[i]);
        }
    }

    vector<string> result;
    // Collect the common characters
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < minFreq[i]; j++) {
            result.push_back(string(1, 'a' + i));
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Calculation:** O(N * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the maximum length of each string.
  
- **Result Collection:** O(26 * k), where k is the maximum possible frequency of any character (which is bounded by the string length and number of strings).

Thus, the overall time complexity is effectively O(N * M), dominated by the frequency calculation step.
