[Leetcode 2272. Substring With Largest Variance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2272)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2272: **Substring With Largest Variance**

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters only, create and return the substring with the largest variance. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

The variance of a substring is the absolute difference between the frequency of the most frequent and the least frequent letter in that substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the string length?**
   - The length of the string `s` will be between 1 and 10,000.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the string contains at least two different characters?**
   - No explicit constraint is given, but it's reasonable to assume typical strings might contain varied characters.

3. **If there is more than one substring with the same largest variance, what should be returned?**
   - The problem typically asks for the largest variance value rather than the actual substring.

4. **Do substrings need to be valid in terms of producing variance, i.e., containing at least two different characters?**
   - Yes, a single-character substring can't have any variance.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider:

1. **Iterate over all possible pairs of characters in the string** to measure variance between pairs of characters.
2. **Track the frequencies** of these characters for a substring.
3. **Use an algorithm equivalent to Kadane's algorithm** to efficiently compute the "maximum subarray" kind of variance.

For each pair of characters `(a, b)`, compute the maximum difference in counts within any substring. Iterate over the string to calculate a kind of "net gain" when adding or removing characters from the substring, keeping track of imbalances.

### Code

Here is a C++ implementation of the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int largestVariance(string s) {
    unordered_set<char> uniqueChars(s.begin(), s.end());
    int maxVariance = 0;

    for (char a : uniqueChars) {
        for (char b : uniqueChars) {
            if (a == b) continue;

            int aCount = 0, bCount = 0;
            bool has_b = false;
            int currentVariance = 0;

            for (char c : s) {
                if (c == a) aCount++;
                if (c == b) {
                    bCount++;
                    has_b = true;
                }

                if (has_b) {
                    currentVariance = max(currentVariance, aCount - bCount);
                }

                if (aCount < bCount) {
                    aCount = 0;
                    bCount = 0;
                    has_b = false;
                }
            }

            swap(a, b);
        }
    }

    return maxVariance;
}

int main() {
    string s = "aababbb";
    cout << "Largest Variance: " << largestVariance(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Gather all unique characters in the string using an unordered_set.
2. **Nested Loops**: For each pair of unique characters `(a, b)`, track the frequency difference as you iterate through the string.
3. **Tracking Frequencies**: Use variables `aCount` and `bCount` to track counts of `a` and `b` as you iterate.
4. **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm**: Adapted to reset frequency tracking when `aCount` becomes lower than `bCount`, as we aim to find contiguous subarrays with the highest variance.

### Time Complexity

The algorithm has a **time complexity of O(N*K^2)**, where `N` is the length of the string and `K` is the number of unique characters in the string. As `K` grows, there are `K*(K-1)` pairs to consider, but given the constraints, this approach should be performant enough.

- `N` iterations per string traversal.
- `K^2` pairs of characters to consider.
