[Leetcode 1765. Map of Highest Peak](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1765)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix isWater where `isWater[i][j] = 1` means cell `(i, j)` is water and `isWater[i][j] = 0` means cell `(i, j)` is land. You must assign each cell a height in a way that:

1. The height of each cell is non-negative integer.
2. If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
3. Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. Adjacent cells are those cells that share one of their four sides.

Return an `m x n` integer matrix heightMap where `heightMap[i][j]` is the height of cell `(i, j)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the dimensions of the matrix `isWater`?
   - Are there multiple water cells in the matrix, or could there be no water cells at all?
   - Will there always be at least one water cell in the matrix?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output matrix have the same dimensions as the input matrix?
   - Should the solution ensure that the height difference condition strictly follows for all cells?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach which ensures that we assign the height in a level-wise manner:
1. Any cell marked as water is initialized with a height of 0 and added to the BFS queue.
2. Unvisited land cells are initialized with a special marker (say `-1`).
3. From the initial water cells, we start BFS, where each cell processes its neighboring cells. If a neighboring cell is unvisited (`-1`), we set its height to the current cell's height + 1 and then add it to the BFS queue.
4. Continue this process until the queue is empty.

This way, we ensure that each land cell is assigned the minimum possible height while satisfying the adjacency constraint.

## Code Implementation

Here's the C++ code for the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> highestPeak(vector<vector<int>>& isWater) {
    int m = isWater.size();
    int n = isWater[0].size();
    vector<vector<int>> heightMap(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
    queue<pair<int, int>> q;

    // Initialize the BFS queue with all water cells
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (isWater[i][j] == 1) {
                heightMap[i][j] = 0;
                q.push({i, j});
            }
        }
    }

    // Directions for moving up, right, down, and left
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};

    // BFS to propagate the heights
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto [x, y] = q.front();
        q.pop();

        for (const auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = x + dir.first;
            int ny = y + dir.second;

            // If new cell is within bounds and unvisited
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && heightMap[nx][ny] == -1) {
                heightMap[nx][ny] = heightMap[x][y] + 1;
                q.push({nx, ny});
            }
        }
    }

    return heightMap;
}
```

## Time Complexity

Analyzing the time complexity:
- The BFS traversal ensures that every cell is visited once.
- Initialization takes `O(m*n)` time if we are scanning through the entire matrix.
- Each cell enqueues and dequeues from the queue once, resulting in `O(m*n)` operations for BFS traversal.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(m*n)`. The space complexity is also `O(m*n)` due to the storage requirements for both the queue and the heightMap.
