[Leetcode 1220. Count Vowels Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1220)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, your task is to count all possible strings of length `n` made up of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) following these rules:

1. Each character is a vowel.
2. Each vowel `a` may only be followed by an `e`.
3. Each vowel `e` may only be followed by an `a` or an `i`.
4. Each vowel `i` may not be followed by another `i`.
5. Each vowel `o` may only be followed by `i` or `u`.
6. Each vowel `u` may only be followed by `a`.

Return the number of strings of length `n` that consist of vowels only following the given rules. The answer may be too large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on `n`?
   - The problem does not specify, but normally for such problems `n` can be assumed to be in the range [1, 2000] or so.
2. What is the expected output if `n = 1`?
   - If `n = 1`, the output would be 5 since any single vowel is a valid string.
3. Do we need to handle any cases of invalid input?
   - Given the nature of the problem on a platform like LeetCode, we assume that the input is always valid.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will use a dynamic programming table, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid strings of length `i` that end with the `j-th` vowel.
   - Vowels index: `a = 0`, `e = 1`, `i = 2`, `o = 3`, `u = 4`.

2. **Transition Rules**:
   - `a` can only be followed by `e`: `dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][1]`
   - `e` can be followed by `a` or `i`: `dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][2]`
   - `i` can be followed by `a`, `e`, `o`, `u`: `dp[i][2] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1] + dp[i-1][3] + dp[i-1][4]`
   - `o` can be followed by `i` or `u`: `dp[i][3] = dp[i-1][2] + dp[i-1][4]`
   - `u` can only be followed by `a`: `dp[i][4] = dp[i-1][0]`

3. Initialize `dp[1][...]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to have a string of length 1 for each vowel.

4. Calculate values for every `dp[i][...]` up to `n` and then sum up the last set of values `dp[n][...]`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) since we are only going through the lengths up to `n` and performing a constant amount of work for each length.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

class Solution {
public:
    int countVowelPermutation(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        std::vector<long long> dp(5, 1), prev(5);
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            prev = dp;
            dp[0] = prev[1] % MOD;                   // a -> e
            dp[1] = (prev[0] + prev[2]) % MOD;       // e -> a, i
            dp[2] = (prev[0] + prev[1] + prev[3] + prev[4]) % MOD; // i -> a, e, o, u
            dp[3] = (prev[2] + prev[4]) % MOD;       // o -> i, u
            dp[4] = prev[0] % MOD;                   // u -> a
        }
        
        long long result = 0;
        for (long long count : dp) {
            result = (result + count) % MOD;
        }
        
        return static_cast<int>(result);
    }
};
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of valid strings of length `n`. Each state represents a possible ending vowel and transitions are handled according to the given rules.
