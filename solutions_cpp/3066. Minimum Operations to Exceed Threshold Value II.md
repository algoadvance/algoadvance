[Leetcode 3066. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3066)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a number `threshold`. Your task is to find the minimum number of elements from `nums` whose sum is greater than or equal to `threshold`. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to have at least one element?**
   - Yes, the array will contain at least one element.
   
2. **Are the elements in the array sorted?**
   - No, the elements in the array are not sorted.
   
3. **Can the threshold be zero or negative?**
   - No, the threshold will always be a positive integer.

4. **Do duplicate values exist in the array?**
   - Yes, duplicate values can exist in the array.
   
5. **What is the maximum length of the array?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but it is safe to assume it could be large considering typical constraints in LeetCode problems.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** 
   - Start by sorting the array in descending order. This way, the largest elements will be prioritized to reach or exceed the threshold more quickly.

2. **Iterate and Sum Elements:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array, summing the elements until the sum is greater than or equal to the threshold.

3. **Count the Number of Elements:**
   - Keep track of the number of elements added to the sum.

4. **Check the Result:**
   - If the sum reaches or exceeds the threshold, return the count. If we go through all elements and do not reach the threshold, return `-1`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minElementsToExceedThreshold(vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
    // Sort the array in descending order
    sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend());
    
    int sum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        sum += num;
        count++;
        if (sum >= threshold) {
            return count;
        }
    }
    
    // If we finish the loop without reaching the threshold
    return -1;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {4, 3, 1, 2, 5};
    int threshold = 9;
    int result = minElementsToExceedThreshold(nums, threshold);
    cout << "Minimum number of elements to exceed threshold: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The time complexity of sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Iteration:** Iterating through the array to sum the elements is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\).

### Conclusion

Sorting the array and then summing the largest elements until the threshold is exceeded or reached ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of elements needed. The code handles edge cases and provides a clear pathway to the solution.
