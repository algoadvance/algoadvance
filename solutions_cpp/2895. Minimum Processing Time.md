[Leetcode 2895. Minimum Processing Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2895)
Certainly! Let's break down the solution to the given problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement:
You are given a list of lists of integers `rows` where `rows[i]` represents the processing times of the `i-th` processor. You need to ensure that each processor completes their tasks within the given `time_limit`. If it is not possible for any processor to complete the tasks within the `time_limit`, return `-1`.

#### Input:
- `rows`: List of lists of integers where `rows[i][j]` is the processing time for the j-th task of the i-th processor.
- `time_limit`: An integer that represents the maximum processing time allowed for any processor.

#### Output:
- Return the minimum processing time required such that no processor exceeds the `time_limit`. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the processing times for tasks be negative or zero?
2. Is `time_limit` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?
3. Are there any constraints on the number of processors and the number of tasks per processor?

Given these questions, I will assume here:
1. Processing times are non-negative integers.
2. `time_limit` is a non-negative integer.
3. There are no explicit bounds provided, but we will handle typical constraints efficiently.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Checks**: Check if any processor's sum of task times exceeds `time_limit`, in which case return `-1`.
2. **Binary Search**: We will use a binary search to find the minimum processing time across all processors such that no processor's total processing time exceeds `time_limit`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minProcessingTime(vector<vector<int>>& rows, int time_limit) {
        int low = 0, high = 0;

        // Calculate the high to be the largest possible single task or total of all tasks for edge cases
        for (const auto& processor : rows) {
            int sum = accumulate(processor.begin(), processor.end(), 0);
            high = max(high, sum);
        }

        if (high <= time_limit) {
            return *max_element(high.begin(), high.end());
        }

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            if (canCompleteWithinTime(rows, mid, time_limit)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return low == time_limit ? low : -1;
    }

private:
    bool canCompleteWithinTime(const vector<vector<int>>& rows, int current_time, int time_limit) {
        for (const auto& processor : rows) {
            int total_time = 0;
            for (int task : processor) {
                if (task > current_time) return false;
                total_time += task;
                if (total_time > time_limit) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<vector<int>> rows = { {5, 3, 2}, {10, 1}, {5, 7, 3} };
    int time_limit = 15;
    cout << "Minimum processing time: " << sol.minProcessingTime(rows, time_limit) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The `low` starts at 0 (no processing time).
   - The `high` is set to the sum of the processor with the maximum total task time.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We check the midpoint (`mid`) of `low` and `high`.
   - We adjust our binary search bounds based on whether the midpoint can allow all processors to complete their tasks within the `time_limit`.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - `canCompleteWithinTime` checks if all tasks for each processor can be processed within the given `current_time` without exceeding the `time_limit`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Binary Search**: O(log(max_total_time))
- **Checking All Processors**: O(n * m) where n is the number of processors and m is the average number of tasks per processor.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(log(max_total_time) * n * m).

I hope this helps! If you have more constraints or a different approach you'd like to explore, please let me know.
