[Leetcode 2404. Most Frequent Even Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2404)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the most frequent even element. If there is a tie, return the smallest one. If there is no such element, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,4,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The even elements are [0,2,2,4,4]. The most frequent even element is 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,4,4,9,2,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The even elements are [4,4,4,2,4]. The most frequent even element is 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [29,47,21,41,13,37,25,7]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no even element.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What if the input array is empty?
   **A:** If `nums` is empty, we should return `-1`.

2. **Q:** What is the range of values in the array?
   **A:** The array can contain any integer values within the limits of `int` in C++.

3. **Q:** What should be returned in case of multiple elements having the same highest frequency?
   **A:** If there is a tie, the smallest even element should be returned.

## Strategy

1. **Traverse the array to collect frequencies:** We will use an unordered_map to count the frequencies of even elements.
2. **Identify the most frequent even element:** Track the most frequent even element and resolve ties by selecting the smallest value.
3. **Edge case handling:** Return `-1` if there are no even elements.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int mostFrequentEven(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        int maxFreq = 0;
        int result = -1;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                freq[num]++;
                if (freq[num] > maxFreq || (freq[num] == maxFreq && num < result)) {
                    maxFreq = freq[num];
                    result = num;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We traverse the array once, and each map operation (insertion and lookup) has O(1) average time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, for the map to store the frequency of each even element.

This approach efficiently handles the problem requirements within acceptable time complexity.
