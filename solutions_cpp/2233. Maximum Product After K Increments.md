[Leetcode 2233. Maximum Product After K Increments](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2233)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Apply `k` increments to the elements of `nums`, where you increment any element by 1 in each operation. Return the maximum possible product of the elements in `nums` after performing these operations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size and Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums`?

2. **Output Format**:
   - What should be the output format? Just a single integer representing the maximum product?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be done if `k` is zero?
   - What if all elements in `nums` are zero? 

Answering these questions:

1. The typical constraints might be:
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= k <= 10^9`

2. The output is a single integer representing the maximum possible product.

3. If `k` is zero, the product of the elements of `nums` should be returned without any increment. If all elements are zero and `k > 0`, incrementing any element by `k` should give the maximum product.

## Strategy

The goal is to maximize the product of the array `nums` after `k` increments. The strategy should be to always increment the smallest element of `nums` since this will yield a greater increase in the overall product.

1. **Use a Min-Heap**:
    - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently get the smallest element and increment it.
    - Push the incremented value back to the min-heap.

2. **Apply Increment Operations**:
    - Perform this operation `k` times.

3. **Calculate the Final Product**:
    - After all increments are done, calculate the product of all elements in `nums`.

This approach ensures that each increment operation is optimal with respect to maximizing the product.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumProduct(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        // Use a min-heap to efficiently get the smallest element.
        std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        // Perform k increments.
        while (k > 0) {
            int smallest = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            smallest += 1;
            minHeap.push(smallest);
            k--;
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum product modulo 1e9+7 to prevent overflow.
        long long product = 1;
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            product = (product * minHeap.top()) % mod;
            minHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return static_cast<int>(product);
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3};
    int k = 3;
    std::cout << sol.maximumProduct(nums, k) << std::endl; // Output: 27
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Min-Heap Operations**: Each increment involves a pop and push operation on the heap. These operations both take `O(log n)` time.
2. **Total Increments**: `k` increments.
   
Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(k log n)`. 

Given the constraints, this approach is efficient enough. If `k` is extremely large compared to `n`, the iterative increment method might not be optimal, but generally, the above solution is good for practical constraints.
