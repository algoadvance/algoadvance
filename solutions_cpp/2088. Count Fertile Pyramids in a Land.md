[Leetcode 2088. Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2088)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of ones and zeroes, representing a plot of land where `1` represents fertile land and `0` represents barren land. A fertile pyramid is defined as a structure built using these fertile grids in the following way:
- A pyramid of height 1 is simply a `1`.
- A pyramid of height 2 has a base of 3 ones and has the next level of `1` centering on the base, like this:
  ```
    1
   111
  ```
- A pyramid of height 3 has a base of 5 ones, with a 3 ones centered on the next level, and a single `1` at the top level, and so on.

Given the grid, count the total number of fertile pyramids of any possible height that can be formed within the given grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. How should overlapping pyramids be handled? Should they be counted multiple times?
2. Are pyramids confined within the bounds of the grid?
3. Should pyramids be only upward-facing or should downward-facing pyramids also be considered?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use dynamic programming due to overlapping subproblems. The idea is to count pyramids with the base centered at each cell and extend it upwards. We will use two dynamic programming tables to track the height of pyramids that can be built from the bottom up and top down.

### Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countPyramids(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp_up(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> dp_down(m, vector<int>(n, 0));

        int totalPyramids = 0;
        
        // Fill dp_up with height of pyramids upwards
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (i == 0 || j == 0 || j == n-1) {
                        dp_up[i][j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        dp_up[i][j] = min({dp_up[i-1][j], dp_up[i-1][j-1], dp_up[i-1][j+1]}) + 1;
                    }
                    totalPyramids += dp_up[i][j] - 1; // subtract 1 because height == 1 is not considered a pyramid
                }
            }
        }

        // Fill dp_down with height of pyramids downwards
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (i == m-1 || j == 0 || j == n-1) {
                        dp_down[i][j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        dp_down[i][j] = min({dp_down[i+1][j], dp_down[i+1][j-1], dp_down[i+1][j+1]}) + 1;
                    }
                    totalPyramids += dp_down[i][j] - 1; // subtract 1 because height == 1 is not considered a pyramid
                }
            }
        }

        return totalPyramids;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is processed twice, once from the top and once from the bottom.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the dp arrays to keep track of pyramid heights.

This algorithm efficiently counts all possible pyramids by using dynamic programming to handle overlapping subproblems and ensures an optimal solution within reasonable time and space constraints.
