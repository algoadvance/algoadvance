[Leetcode 2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2138)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to divide the string into groups of size `k`. If the string is not of size multiple of `k`, the final group will have fewer characters. However, for this problem, you should fill the remaining characters of the last group with the `fill` character to make its length equal to `k`.

You need to return a list of strings, each of the length `k`, except perhaps for the last group which may be padded if needed.

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "abcdefghi"`, `k = 3`, `fill = 'x'`
- Output: `["abc", "def", "ghi"]`

- Input: `s = "abcdefgh"`, `k = 3`, `fill = 'x'`
- Output: `["abc", "def", "ghx"]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for `s` and `k`?**
   - `s` is any string (a sequence of alphanumeric characters).
   - `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= len(s)`.

2. **What should be done if `s` is already a multiple of `k`?**
   - Simply split `s` into groups of `k`.

3. **Is it guaranteed that `s` and `fill` will contain only ASCII characters?**
   - Yes.

4. **Can `fill` character be the same as characters already present in the string?**
   - Yes, `fill` can be any character, including ones that are present in `s`.

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty vector of strings to store the result.
2. Iterate over the input string `s` in steps of `k`.
3. For each step, extract a substring of length `k` and add it to the result.
4. After the loop, check if the last substring added has length less than `k`. If so, pad it with the `fill` character until it reaches length `k`.
5. Return the result vector of strings.

### Code

Here is the C++ implementation for the described strategy:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::vector<std::string> divideString(std::string s, int k, char fill) {
    std::vector<std::string> result;
    int n = s.length();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
        std::string part = s.substr(i, k);
        if (part.length() < k) {
            part.append(k - part.length(), fill);
        }
        result.push_back(part);
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::string s = "abcdefgh";
    int k = 3;
    char fill = 'x';
    std::vector<std::string> result = divideString(s, k, fill);
    
    for (const std::string& str : result) {
        std::cout << "\"" << str << "\" ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate over each character in the input string exactly once. Substring operations and padding require a split and append which also run in linear time relative to the size of the substring being processed, thus keeping the overall complexity linear.
