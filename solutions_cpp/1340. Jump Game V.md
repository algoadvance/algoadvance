[Leetcode 1340. Jump Game V](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1340)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step, you can jump from index `i` to index:

- `i + j` where `i + 1 <= j <= d` and `arr[i] > arr[i + j]`, or
- `i - j` where `i - 1 >= j <= d` and `arr[i] > arr[i - j]`.

Return the maximum number of indices you can visit.

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [6, 4, 14, 6, 8, 13, 9, 7, 10, 6, 12], d = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 -> 8 -> 6 -> 7.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3], d = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], d = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: Start at index 0. You can visit all the indices.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of values for the elements in `arr` and `d`?
   - Answer: `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`, `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`, and `1 <= d <= arr.length`.
   
2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If the array has only one element, should we return 1 as the answer?
   - Answer: Yes, because you can only visit the single index available.

3. **Multiple Valid Paths**:
   - If there are multiple equally optimal paths, does it matter which one is chosen?
   - Answer: No, we just need the maximum number of indices that can be visited.

## Strategy

The goal is to determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index in `arr`. This calls for a Dynamic Programming approach to store results of subproblems and optimize our solution.

Here's our plan:

1. **Memoization**: Use a memoization table where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`.
2. **Recursive Helper Function**:
   - Define a recursive function that calculates the maximum jumps starting from a given index.
   - For each starting index, explore both the left and right direction within the jump limit `d`.
   - Only consider jumps where the destination index has a lower value than the starting index.
3. **Iterate Over All Indices**:
   - Initiate the recursive calls from all indices and find the maximum value in the `dp` table.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxJumps(vector<int>& arr, int d) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> dp(n, -1);  // -1 indicates uncomputed state
        
        // Helper function to solve the problem for a particular index
        function<int(int)> dfs = [&](int i) {
            if (dp[i] != -1) return dp[i];
            
            int maxJ = 1;  // At minimum, you can stay in the same position
            // Explore to the right within the limit `d`
            for (int j = 1; j <= d && i + j < n && arr[i] > arr[i + j]; ++j) {
                maxJ = max(maxJ, 1 + dfs(i + j));
            }
            
            // Explore to the left within the limit `d`
            for (int j = 1; j <= d && i - j >= 0 && arr[i] > arr[i - j]; ++j) {
                maxJ = max(maxJ, 1 + dfs(i - j));
            }
            
            return dp[i] = maxJ;
        };
        
        int result = 0;
        // Compute result for each starting index
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            result = max(result, dfs(i));
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be reasoned as follows:
- Each index is processed once, and for each index, we explore up to `d` positions to the left and right.
- In total, this results in an O(n*d) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the array and `d` is the jump limit.
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the memoization table.

This ensures that our solution efficiently handles the given constraints.
