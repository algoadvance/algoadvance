[Leetcode 3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3160)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `balls` where each element in the array represents the color of the ball. You need to find out the number of distinct colors among the balls.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the maximum size of the `balls` array?
   - What is the range of values that each element in `balls` can take?

2. **Output**:
   - Is the expected output an integer representing the number of distinct colors?
   
3. **Special Cases**:
   - Can the `balls` array be empty? If yes, what should the output be in that case?

## Strategy

1. **Use of Data Structures**:
   - Utilize a `std::unordered_set` to store the distinct colors as we traverse through the `balls` array. The unordered set inherently handles uniqueness.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an empty `unordered_set`.
   - Iterate through each ball in the `balls` array and insert its color into the set.
   - The size of the set at the end of the iteration represents the number of distinct colors.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input array is empty, return 0 as there are no colors.

## Time Complexity

- Insertion and lookup operations for `unordered_set` have an average time complexity of O(1).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `balls` array.

## Code

Here's the C++ code implementing the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>

int findNumberOfDistinctColors(const std::vector<int>& balls) {
    std::unordered_set<int> distinctColors;
    for (int color : balls) {
        distinctColors.insert(color);
    }
    return distinctColors.size();
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> balls = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1};
    std::cout << "Number of distinct colors: " << findNumberOfDistinctColors(balls) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`unordered_set<int> distinctColors`**:
   - This set stores unique colors extracted from the `balls` array.

2. **Inserting each color**:
   - As we iterate over the `balls`, each color is inserted into the `unordered_set`. If a color already exists, the set ignores it, maintaining only unique entries.

3. **Returning the size**:
   - The size of the set indicates the number of distinct colors among the balls.

### Example

For `balls = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}`, the distinct colors are `{1, 2, 3}`. Thus, the function returns `3`.
