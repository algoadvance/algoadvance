[Leetcode 2407. Longest Increasing Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2407)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the longest subsequence of `nums` that meets the following conditions:

1. The subsequence is strictly increasing and
2. The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most `k`.

Return the length of the longest subsequence meeting the conditions. A subsequence is derived from `nums` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example:**
```text
Input: nums = [4,2,1,4,3,4,5,8,15], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence is [1, 3, 4, 5, 8].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the elements in `nums` guaranteed to be within a specific range?
   **A:** The elements are within the typical range of integer values.

2. **Q:** Is there a constraint on the length of `nums`?
   **A:** The problem typically follows standard constraints, where input sizes can be reasonably large but fit within the constraints of competitive programming environments.

3. **Q:** Can the subsequences contain duplicate values?
   **A:** The subsequences themselves should be strictly increasing, though the original array can contain duplicates.

## Strategy

The task is to find the longest increasing subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is no more than `k`. 

A dynamic programming approach with a segment tree or Fenwick Tree can be useful here to maintain and query the lengths efficiently because finding and updating subsequence lengths would be optimal with such data structures. We will:

1. Sort the elements by value while tracking their original indices.
2. Use dynamic programming to maintain the length of the longest subsequence up to each element.
3. Utilize a Fenwick tree (or segment tree) to efficiently update and retrieve the maximum length of valid subsequences.

## Code

Here's a potential implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) Class Template
class FenwickTree {
public:
    FenwickTree(int n) : data(n + 1, 0) {}

    void update(int index, int value) {
        for (++index; index < data.size(); index += index & -index) {
            data[index] = max(data[index], value);
        }
    }

    int query(int index) const {
        int max_val = 0;
        for (++index; index > 0; index -= index & -index) {
            max_val = max(max_val, data[index]);
        }
        return max_val;
    }

private:
    vector<int> data;
};

int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    vector<pair<int, int>> arr;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        arr.push_back({nums[i], i});
    }

    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    
    FenwickTree fenwick_tree(n);
    vector<int> dp(n, 1);

    for (const auto& [num, idx] : arr) {
        int max_len = 1;
        if (num - k > 0) {
            // Find the maximum length of a subsequence ending before the current number num
            max_len = fenwick_tree.query(idx - 1) + 1;
        }
        dp[idx] = max_len;
        fenwick_tree.update(idx, max_len);
    }
    
    return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15};
    int k = 3;
    
    cout << lengthOfLIS(nums, k) << endl; // Outputs: 5
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` for the sorting step.
- **Updating and querying the Fenwick Tree:** `O(n log n)` since each update and query operation in the Fenwick Tree takes `O(log n)` time and we perform these operations for each element.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which is efficient for large input sizes within typical competitive programming constraints.
