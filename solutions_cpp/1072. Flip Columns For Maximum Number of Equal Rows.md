[Leetcode 1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1072)
## Problem Statement
Given a `m x n` binary matrix `matrix`, you can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., change the value of the cell from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.

### Example
```
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.
```
```
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.
```
```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the third column, the last two rows have equal values.
```

### Constraints:
- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the entire matrix be considered filled with the same number?
   - Yes, if flipping columns result in all rows containing either all 0s or all 1s.
2. Are we allowed to flip the columns multiple times?
   - The problem implies you perform any number of flips, not multiple flips on the same column.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

int maxEqualRowsAfterFlips(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
    unordered_map<string, int> pattern_count;

    for (const auto& row : matrix) {
        string pattern1, pattern2;
        for (auto val : row) {
            if (val == 0) {
                pattern1.push_back('0');
                pattern2.push_back('1');
            } else {
                pattern1.push_back('1');
                pattern2.push_back('0');
            }
        }
        pattern_count[pattern1]++;
        pattern_count[pattern2]++;
    }

    int max_count = 0;
    for (const auto& p : pattern_count) {
        if (p.second > max_count) {
            max_count = p.second;
        }
    }
    return max_count;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Row Patterns**: Recognize that each row can either be left as it is or flipped entirely. If a row `[0, 1, 1]` is picked, it translates to flipping every column resulting in `[1, 0, 0]`.
2. **Map Storage**: Store the occurrence count of each row pattern and its corresponding flipped pattern as keys in a hashmap. This approach helps in leveraging the symmetry of the problem.
3. **Calculate Maximum**: Iterate over the hashmap to determine the maximum frequency of any row pattern, which is our answer.

## Time Complexity
- **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m*n) for storing the strings in the hashmap. This calculation considers all possible rows and their flipped versions.
