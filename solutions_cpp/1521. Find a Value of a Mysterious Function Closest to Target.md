[Leetcode 1521. Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1521)
### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer array `arr` and an integer `target`, the mysterious function `func` is defined for two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as `func(a, b) = a & b`, where `&` is the bitwise AND operation.

You are tasked to find the value of `func(arr[i], arr[i+1], ..., arr[j])` that is closest to the target where `0 <= i <= j < arr.length`.

Return the absolute difference between the result of the function and the target.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the array's length and element values?**
   - Typical value ranges for such problems could be around length up to 10^5 and elements up to 10^6.
2. **Should we consider adjacent subarrays only or any subarray?**
   - We need to consider all possible subarrays from index `i` to `j` where `0 <= i <= j < arr.length`.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the properties of bitwise AND:**
   - The result of the AND operation is always less than or equal to the smaller of the two operands.
   - This property significantly reduces the number of operations as expanding the subarray tends to lower or stabilize the AND value.

2. **Optimization through sliding window and subsets:**
   - For every starting index `i`, we can continuously track the AND value with subsequent elements to check how close the resultant value gets to the target.
   - A backward tracking can help terminate early if the AND result drops to a very low value quickly.
   
3. **Approach:**
   - Iterate over the array with two nested loops. For each subarray, calculate the AND result and track the minimum absolute difference from the target.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <climits>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    int closestToTarget(std::vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int result = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int andValue = arr[i];
            
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                andValue &= arr[j];
                result = std::min(result, std::abs(andValue - target));
                
                // Early termination if we reach zero since it won't get any closer to the target
                if (andValue == 0) break;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- Initializing and iterating through the array of length `n` gives a worst-case time complexity of `O(n^2)`. This means it is quadratic in the worst case.
- For each position `i`, it performs a series of bitwise AND operations thus iterating over potential subarray ends `j`.

This solution might need optimization for larger arrays to avoid `O(n^2)` computational overhead. Optimizations can be explored including advanced data structures or bit-level manipulations.
