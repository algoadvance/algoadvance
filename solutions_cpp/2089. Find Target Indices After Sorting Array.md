[Leetcode 2089. Find Target Indices After Sorting Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2089)
### Problem Statement
You are given a `0-indexed` integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You need to return the `indices` of the target in nums after sorting nums in `non-decreasing` order. If there are no target indices, return an empty array. The returned array must be sorted in increasing order.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5]. The indices where 2 is present in nums are 1 and 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 3
Output: [3]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5]. The index where 3 is present in nums is 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 5
Output: [4]
Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5]. The index where 5 is present in nums is 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What are the constraints on the array size and the values within the array?**
   - A: `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
   - A: `1 <= nums[i], target <= 100`

2. **Q: Can the array contain duplicate values?**
   - A: Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

3. **Q: Is there any specific requirement on the complexity of the solution?**
   - A: Given the constraints, a simple solution leveraging sorting and iteration would be efficient.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the array nums.**
2. **Find the indices of the target value in the sorted array.**
   - Iterate through the sorted array and collect indices where the elements match the target value.
3. **Return the collection of indices.**

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> targetIndices(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    // Step 1: Sort the array in non-decreasing order
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    
    // Step 2: Iterate through the sorted array and collect indices where value equals target
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums[i] == target) {
            result.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The time complexity of sorting the array is O(n log n).
- **Iteration:** The time complexity of iterating through the array is O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n).
