[Leetcode 2931. Maximum Spending After Buying Items](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2931)
## Problem Statement
You are given a list of prices of items and a list of discounts where each discount can be applied to only one item. The problem requires you to maximize your total spending after applying the discounts optimally.

Given `prices` and `discounts` arrays, apply the discounts in such a way that the sum of the discounted prices is maximum.

**Example:**
- Input: prices = [10, 20, 30, 40], discounts = [5, 4]
- Output: 90
- Explanation: The optimal way is to apply 5 discount to 40 (remaining price 35) and 4 discount to 30 (remaining price 26). The total spending will be 10 + 20 + 26 + 35 = 91.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the same discount be applied to multiple items?
    - No, each discount can be applied to only one item.
2. What happens if there are more items than discounts or vice versa?
    - Apply the available discounts optimally. If there are more items than discounts, some items will remain without discounts. If there are more discounts than items, some discounts will not be used.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the items and discounts**: Since you want to maximize on the total spending, it is optimal to apply the highest discounts to the most expensive items.
2. **Calculation**:
    - Sort the `prices` in ascending order.
    - Sort the `discounts` in descending order.
    - Apply the highest discount to the highest price, the second highest discount to the second highest price, and so on.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maximumSpending(std::vector<int>& prices, std::vector<int>& discounts) {
    // Sort prices in ascending order
    std::sort(prices.begin(), prices.end());
    
    // Sort discounts in descending order
    std::sort(discounts.begin(), discounts.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    int n = prices.size();
    int m = discounts.size();
    
    int totalSpending = 0;
    
    // Apply discounts
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (i < m) {
            totalSpending += (prices[n - 1 - i] - discounts[i]); // Applying discount to the most expensive items
        } else {
            totalSpending += prices[n - 1 - i]; // No discount available
        }
    }
    
    return totalSpending;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> prices = {10, 20, 30, 40};
    std::vector<int> discounts = {5, 4};
    
    int result = maximumSpending(prices, discounts);
    std::cout << "Maximum Spending: " << result << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the prices takes `O(n log n)`.
- Sorting the discounts takes `O(m log m)`.
- The loop to calculate total spending is `O(n)`.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n + m log m)`, where `n` is the number of prices and `m` is the number of discounts.

By following this strategy, you ensure the maximum total spending after applying the given discounts optimally.
