[Leetcode 2560. House Robber IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2560)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers representing the amount of money hidden behind each house along a street. Your task is to rob houses such that you maximize the amount sacked, but under a constraint: you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Additionally, you need to ensure you rob no more than `k` houses. Return the maximum amount of money you can rob.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the list always non-negative integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **What should be returned if the list is empty or if `k` is zero?**
   - If the list is empty or `k` is zero, the maximum amount of money robbed should be zero.
3. **Can `k` be larger than or equal to the length of the list?**
   - Yes, but in that case, we should handle it gracefully, perhaps by adjusting our approach to consider the maximum number of selectable non-adjacent houses.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to house `i`.
   - Iterate over the list and populate the `dp` array considering the constraint that no two adjacent houses can be robbed.
   - To accommodate the constraint of robbing no more than `k` houses, we can use a sliding window or provide a condition to check and count the number of houses robbed so far.
   - The final solution will be the maximum value found in the `dp` array observing the constraint on `k`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0 || k == 0) return 0;
        
        // Early exit if k is larger than the number of houses
        if (k >= (n + 1) / 2) {
            int prev2 = 0, prev1 = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                int curr = max(prev1, prev2 + num);
                prev2 = prev1;
                prev1 = curr;
            }
            return prev1;
        }
        
        // Initialize a 2D DP table
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(k + 1, 0));
        
        // Base case
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
                // If we rob the current house
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 2 >= 0 ? i - 2 : 0][j - 1] + nums[i - 1]);
                // If we do not rob the current house
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\) because we have a nested loop iterating over each house and each possible number of houses to be robbed up to `k`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n \cdot k)\) due to the DP table used to store intermediate results.

This approach ensures that we respect the constraint of robbing no more than `k` houses while also considering the constraint of not robbing two adjacent houses.
