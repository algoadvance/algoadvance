[Leetcode 2126. Destroying Asteroids](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2126)
## Problem Statement

You are given a floating point number `mass`, which represents the mass of a planet and an integer array `asteroids` where each asteroid represents the mass of an asteroid.

You can destroy an asteroid if your planet has a mass greater than or equal to the asteroid's mass. When you destroy an asteroid, your planet's mass increases by the mass of the asteroid.

Return `true` if you can destroy all the asteroids, otherwise `false`.

### Examples

1. **Input:** `mass = 10`, `asteroids = [3, 9, 19, 5, 21]`
   **Output:** `true`

2. **Input:** `mass = 5`, `asteroids = [4, 9, 23, 4]`
   **Output:** `false`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of values for `mass` and `asteroids`?
   **A:** The `mass` is a floating point number between 1 and \(10^5\). The `asteroids` array contains integers with values between 1 and \(10^5\) and length between 1 and \(10^5\).

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the order of destruction of asteroids?
   **A:** The asteroids can be destroyed in any order, but choosing the smallest mass asteroid first is a good strategy.

3. **Q:** Is it possible to process the asteroids as they are or do they need sorting?
   **A:** Sorting the asteroids array allows for an optimal strategy where the smallest asteroids are destroyed first to incrementally increase the planet's mass.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Asteroids:** Start by sorting the `asteroids` array in ascending order.
2. **Iterate and Destroy:**
   - Iterate through the sorted `asteroids` array.
   - For each asteroid, check if the current `mass` is greater than or equal to the asteroid's mass.
   - If true, destroy the asteroid and increase the planet's mass by the asteroid's mass.
   - If false, return `false` as it's impossible to destroy all asteroids.

3. **Return Result:** If the loop completes, it means all asteroids were successfully destroyed, return `true`.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `asteroids` array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Iterating through the `asteroids` array takes \(O(n)\).
- Therefore, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

bool canDestroyAllAsteroids(double mass, std::vector<int>& asteroids) {
    std::sort(asteroids.begin(), asteroids.end());

    for (int asteroid : asteroids) {
        if (mass >= asteroid) {
            mass += asteroid;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

In this code:
1. We sort the `asteroids` array.
2. We iterate through each asteroid and check if we can destroy it. If yes, we add its mass to the planet's mass. If not, we immediately return `false`.
3. If we manage to destroy all asteroids, we return `true`.
