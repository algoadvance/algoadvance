[Leetcode 223. Rectangle Area](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l223)
## Problem Statement
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles. 

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner and top-right corner as `(A, B)` and `(C, D)` for the first rectangle, and `(E, F)` and `(G, H)` for the second rectangle.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the input always represent valid rectangles (i.e., \( A < C \) and \( B < D \) for the first rectangle and \( E < G \) and \( F < H \) for the second rectangle)?
2. Do the coordinates lie within a specific range (e.g., all inputs are within the 32-bit signed integer range)?
3. Is overlap always possible, or can the rectangles be completely separate or touching but not overlapping?

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        // Calculate the area of both the rectangles separately
        int area1 = (C - A) * (D - B);
        int area2 = (G - E) * (H - F);
        
        // Calculate the overlapping area
        int overlapWidth = max(0, min(C, G) - max(A, E));
        int overlapHeight = max(0, min(D, H) - max(B, F));
        int overlapArea = overlapWidth * overlapHeight;
        
        // Total area covered by both rectangles
        int totalArea = area1 + area2 - overlapArea;
        
        return totalArea;
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Individual Areas**: Compute the areas of the two rectangles independently.
2. **Determine Overlap Dimensions**: Calculate the overlapping width and height. 
   - The width of the overlapping area is the difference between the smallest of the top-right corners and the largest of the bottom-left corners along the x-axis.
   - The height follows a similar calculation along the y-axis.
3. **Compute Overlap Area**: Multiply the overlap dimensions to get the overlap area. Ensure that if the rectangles do not overlap, the overlap area should be zero.
4. **Total Coverage Area**: Calculate the total area by adding the areas of both rectangles and subtracting the overlap area.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \( O(1) \) because it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations and comparisons regardless of the actual input values.

### Example
For the rectangles defined by `(A, B, C, D)` as (0, 0, 2, 2) and `(E, F, G, H)` as (1, 1, 3, 3):
1. Calculate individual areas: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) for the first rectangle, and \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) for the second.
2. Determine overlap: The overlap has width \( \min(2, 3) - \max(0, 1) = 1 \) and height \( \min(2, 3) - \max(0, 1) = 1 \), thus an overlap area of \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).
3. Total area: \( 4 + 4 - 1 = 7 \).

This approach ensures accurate calculation of the total area covered by the two rectangles, accounting correctly for any overlaps.
