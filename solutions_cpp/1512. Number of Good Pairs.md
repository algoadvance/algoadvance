[Leetcode 1512. Number of Good Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1512)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the number of good pairs.

A pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the array?**
   - The array size can range from 1 to 100.

2. **What is the range of the integers in the array?**
   - The integers can range from 1 to 100.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the given array will have integers only?**
   - Yes, the array will consist of integers only.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate through the array with two loops to check each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j` and count the number of good pairs.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is feasible given the constraints.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Use a hashmap to keep track of the counts of each number as we iterate through the array.
   - For each number, if it has been seen before, the number of good pairs involving this number is simply the count of its previous occurrences.
   - This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is more efficient.

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force Approach:** O(n^2)
- **Optimized Approach:** O(n)

### Code

Here is the C++ solution for the optimized approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int numIdenticalPairs(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> countMap;
    int goodPairs = 0;
    
    for(int num : nums) {
        if(countMap.find(num) != countMap.end()) {
            goodPairs += countMap[num]; // Increase by the count of previous occurrences of `num`
        }
        // Update the count of the current number
        countMap[num]++;
    }
    
    return goodPairs;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3};
    std::cout << "Number of good pairs: " << numIdenticalPairs(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - We use an unordered_map `countMap` to store the count of each number.
   - We initialize `goodPairs` to 0.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each number in the array `nums`, we check if it is already in the map.
   - If it is, we add the count of this number (i.e., all previous occurrences) to `goodPairs`.
   - We then increment the count of this number in the map.

3. **Output:**
   - Finally, we return the total count of good pairs.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the good pairs with a single pass through the array, achieving O(n) time complexity.
