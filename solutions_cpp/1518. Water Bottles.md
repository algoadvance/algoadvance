[Leetcode 1518. Water Bottles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1518)
## Problem Statement

You have `numBottles` full water bottles and you can exchange `numExchange` empty water bottles for one full water bottle.

The task is to write a function that returns the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens once I don't have enough empty bottles to exchange for a full one?**
   - You stop getting new water bottles and the process ends.

2. **Is the focus purely on the count of bottles we can drink, not worrying about fractional exchanges?**
   - Correct, no fractional exchanges are allowed.

3. **Is this a continuous process until exchanges can't be made?**
   - Yes, you continue drinking and exchanging until it is no longer possible.

4. **Are `numBottles` and `numExchange` always positive integers?**
   - Yes, for the purpose of this problem, assume they are positive integers.

## Strategy
  
To solve the problem, follow these steps:
- Initialize the total count of bottles drunk to `numBottles`.
- Use a loop to simulate the process of drinking and exchanging:
  - While there are enough empty bottles to perform an exchange:
    - Calculate the number of full bottles you can get by exchanging.
    - Add this number to your total count of bottles drunk.
    - Update the total number of empty bottles which will be the bottles just drank plus any remaining from previous exchanges.
- Return the total count of bottles drunk.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
    int totalDrunk = numBottles;
    int emptyBottles = numBottles;

    while (emptyBottles >= numExchange) {
        int newBottles = emptyBottles / numExchange;
        totalDrunk += newBottles;
        emptyBottles = newBottles + (emptyBottles % numExchange);
    }

    return totalDrunk;
}

int main() {
    // Test cases
    std::cout << numWaterBottles(9, 3) << std::endl; // should output 13
    std::cout << numWaterBottles(15, 4) << std::endl; // should output 19

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(log(numBottles))** because, in each iteration, the number of empty bottles is divided by at least `numExchange`, reducing the number of empty bottles logarithmically. This makes the approach efficient even for larger values of `numBottles`.
