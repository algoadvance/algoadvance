[Leetcode 2207. Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2207)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `text` and another string `pattern` consisting of exactly two distinct characters. Your task is to maximize the number of times the `pattern` appears as a subsequence in the `text` by inserting exactly one character anywhere in the `text`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the `text` string?**
   - The length of the `text` could be as large as 10^5.
   
2. **Can `pattern` be any two distinct characters?**
   - Yes, `pattern` will always be exactly two distinct characters.
   
3. **Can we only insert one character?**
   - Yes, you can only insert one character anywhere in the `text`.

### Strategy
1. **Determine Initial Frequency of Pattern**: Compute how many times the `pattern` appears as a subsequence in the initial `text`.
2. **Consider Insertion Effects**: Evaluate the effect of inserting each of the two pattern characters at each position in the `text`.
3. **Iterate and Maximize**: Track the maximum number of times the `pattern` occurs as a subsequence among all possible single-character insertions.

### Steps in the Algorithm
1. Create variables to track the count of the first and second characters of the `pattern` while traversing the string.
2. Calculate the initial number of the pattern as a subsequence in the given `text`.
3. For each possible position in `text`, simulate the insertion of both characters of `pattern` and recalculate the subsequence count.
4. Track the highest count encountered and return that as the result.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumSubsequenceCount(string text, string pattern) {
        // Getting characters from pattern
        char x = pattern[0], y = pattern[1];
        long long count_x = 0, count_xy = 0;
        
        // Initial calculation of the pattern as a subsequence in Text
        for (char c : text) {
            if (c == y) {
                count_xy += count_x;
            }
            if (c == x) {
                count_x++;
            }
        }
        
        // Now calculate the maximum by simulating insertion of x or y
        long long result = count_xy;  // Initial result without any insertions
        
        long long prefix_x = 0, prefix_y = 0, max_insert = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= text.size(); ++i) {
            // Insert x before/into text
            max_insert = max(max_insert, count_xy + (count_x - prefix_x));
            // Insert y before/into text
            max_insert = max(max_insert, count_xy + (prefix_x));
            
            // Keep track of prefix counts
            if (i < text.size()) {
                if (text[i] == x) {
                    prefix_x++;
                }
                if (text[i] == y) {
                    prefix_y++;
                    count_xy -= count_x - prefix_x;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max_insert;
    }
};

// Example Usage
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    string text = "abdcdbc";
    string pattern = "ac";
    cout << sol.maximumSubsequenceCount(text, pattern) << endl; // Output based on the provided example in the problem statement
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm involves a single pass through the `text` string for calculating the initial number of subsequences, resulting in O(n).
- It then involves another pass through the `text` string for simulating the insertion at various positions, also resulting in O(n).
- Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the `text`. This is efficient and suitable given the constraints.
