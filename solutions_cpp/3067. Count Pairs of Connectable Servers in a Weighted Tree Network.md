[Leetcode 3067. Count Pairs of Connectable Servers in a Weighted Tree Network](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3067)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with `n` servers labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an integer `maxDistance`. Each edge in the tree has a positive weight, representing the distance between two connected servers. The task is to count the number of pairs of distinct servers `(i, j)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `maxDistance`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the weights of the edges guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. Can `maxDistance` be zero or negative?
3. Should the pairs `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` be considered the same?

### Code

In order to solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance between all pairs of nodes. Since the tree is undirected and connected, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm (from each node) can be used, but a more efficient method leveraging the tree's structure and properties would be employed.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cstring>

using namespace std;

// Function to perform DFS and obtain the distance to all nodes from a given source
void dfs(int node, int parent, vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj, vector<int>& distances, int distance) {
    distances[node] = distance;
    for (const auto& neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (neighbor.first != parent) {
            dfs(neighbor.first, node, adj, distances, distance + neighbor.second);
        }
    }
}

int countPairs(vector<vector<pair<int, int>>>& adj, int n, int maxDistance) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        vector<int> distances(n, 0);
        dfs(i, -1, adj, distances, 0);
        
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if (distances[j] <= maxDistance) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

int main() {
    int n, maxDistance;
    cin >> n >> maxDistance;
    
    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n);
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w;
        adj[u].emplace_back(v, w);
        adj[v].emplace_back(u, w);
    }
    
    int result = countPairs(adj, n, maxDistance);
    cout << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Read Input:**
   - First, read the number of nodes `n` and the `maxDistance`.
   - Then, read the edges of the tree. Each edge has three components: two nodes `u` and `v` and the weight `w`.

2. **DFS Implementation:**
   - For each node, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine the distances to all other nodes.
   - Track the distances in a vector `distances` during the DFS traversal.

3. **Pair Counting:**
   - While performing DFS from each node `i`, count the number of nodes `j` such that the distance between nodes `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `maxDistance`.
   - Since the tree is undirected and pairs `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` are considered the same, only count each pair once.

### Time Complexity

- Performing DFS from each node will take \(O(n + n-1) = O(n)\) because it's a tree.
- The nested loop to count valid pairs performs \(O(n^2)\) checks in total.

Thus, the time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\).
