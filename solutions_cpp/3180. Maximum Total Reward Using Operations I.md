[Leetcode 3180. Maximum Total Reward Using Operations I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3180)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `rewards1` and `rewards2` both of length `n`. You have to choose `d` elements from the `n` elements such that:

- You must take exactly `i` elements from `rewards1`
- You must take exactly `d - i` elements from `rewards2`

The goal is to maximize the sum of the chosen elements. Write a function `maxReward` to accomplish this.

```cpp
int maxReward(vector<int>& rewards1, vector<int>& rewards2, int i, int d);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will `i` always be less than or equal to `d`?
2. Is it guaranteed that the lengths of the `rewards1` and `rewards2` arrays will always be equal?
3. Can `d` be greater than the length of the arrays?

## Strategy

1. **Selection Criteria**: Given that `i` elements are to be chosen from `rewards1` and `d - i` elements from `rewards2`, we will use a combination of sorting and selection.
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort both `rewards1` and `rewards2` in descending order.
3. **Selection**:
   - Select the top `i` elements from the sorted `rewards1`.
   - Select the top `d - i` elements from the sorted `rewards2`.
4. **Summation**: Calculate the sum of these selected elements.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>

int maxReward(std::vector<int>& rewards1, std::vector<int>& rewards2, int i, int d) {
    // Sort both rewards arrays in descending order
    std::sort(rewards1.begin(), rewards1.end(), std::greater<int>());
    std::sort(rewards2.begin(), rewards2.end(), std::greater<int>());
    
    // Select top i elements from rewards1
    std::vector<int> selectedFromRewards1(rewards1.begin(), rewards1.begin() + std::min(i, (int)rewards1.size()));
    
    // Select top d - i elements from rewards2
    std::vector<int> selectedFromRewards2(rewards2.begin(), rewards2.begin() + std::min(d - i, (int)rewards2.size()));
    
    // Sum the selected elements from rewards1 and rewards2
    int sumFromRewards1 = std::accumulate(selectedFromRewards1.begin(), selectedFromRewards1.end(), 0);
    int sumFromRewards2 = std::accumulate(selectedFromRewards2.begin(), selectedFromRewards2.end(), 0);

    // Return the total maximum reward
    return sumFromRewards1 + sumFromRewards2;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> rewards1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> rewards2 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
    int i = 3;
    int d = 5;
    std::cout << "Max Reward: " << maxReward(rewards1, rewards2, i, d) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. Sorting `rewards1` and `rewards2`, both of which take O(n log n) in the worst case.
2. Selecting the top `i` elements from `rewards1` and top `d-i` elements from `rewards2`, which takes O(i + (d-i)) = O(d).
3. Summing the selected elements takes O(i + (d-i)) = O(d).

The overall time complexity is `O(n log n + d)`.

If `d` is relatively smaller than `n`, the predominant term is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
