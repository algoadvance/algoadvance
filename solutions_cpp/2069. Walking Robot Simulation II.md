[Leetcode 2069. Walking Robot Simulation II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2069)
### Problem Statement

You are given a robot that is located on a grid, which is of size `width x height`. The robot can move in four directions (`up`, `right`, `down`, `left`) but cannot move outside the boundaries of the grid. Initially, the robot is at the position `(0, 0)` facing east. Implement a class `Robot` with the following functionalities:

1. `Robot(int width, int height)`
   - Initializes the object with the width and height of the grid.

2. `void move(int num)`
   - Moves the robot forward `num` steps.
  
3. `vector<int> getPos()`
   - Returns the current position of the robot as a list `[x, y]`.

4. `string getDir()`
   - Returns the current direction of the robot as `"East"`, `"West"`, `"North"`, or `"South"`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundaries**: Can the robot move out of the given grid?
   - No, the robot can't move outside the given grid.

2. **Initial Position and Direction**: Where does the robot start, and what is its initial facing direction?
   - The robot starts at (0, 0) facing East.

3. **Wrapping**: When moving steps exceed the grid perimeter, what happens?
   - The robot wraps around the grid.

4. **Edge Cases**: Should we care for moves with zero steps or multiple full perimeter loops?
   - Yes, handle moves with step `0` correctly and multiple full loops efficiently.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Robot {
public:
    Robot(int width, int height) : width(width), height(height), x(0), y(0), direction(0) {
        perimeter = 2 * (width + height - 2);
    }
    
    void move(int num) {
        num = num % perimeter;
        while (num > 0) {
            if (direction == 0) { // Moving East
                int step = min(num, width - 1 - x);
                x += step;
                if (x == width - 1 && num >= step) direction = 1;
                num -= step;
            } else if (direction == 1) { // Moving North
                int step = min(num, height - 1 - y);
                y += step;
                if (y == height - 1 && num >= step) direction = 2;
                num -= step;
            } else if (direction == 2) { // Moving West
                int step = min(num, x);
                x -= step;
                if (x == 0 && num >= step) direction = 3;
                num -= step;
            } else if (direction == 3) { // Moving South
                int step = min(num, y);
                y -= step;
                if (y == 0 && num >= step) direction = 0;
                num -= step;
            }
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> getPos() {
        return {x, y};
    }
    
    string getDir() {
        if (direction == 0) return "East";
        if (direction == 1) return "North";
        if (direction == 2) return "West";
        if (direction == 3) return "South";
        return "";
    }

private:
    int width;
    int height;
    int x, y;
    int direction;
    int perimeter;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the grid dimensions and initial position `(0, 0)`.
   - Set the initial direction to `East`.
   - Calculate the perimeter of the grid for efficient wrapping.

2. **Move Function**:
   - Normalize the number of steps considering wrapping around the grid using `num % perimeter`.
   - Implement loop logic to handle movement in the respective direction and update the direction when reaching grid boundaries.

3. **Position and Direction Functions**:
   - Simply return the current position and convert the direction to the readable string format.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1) - initial computation and setup.
- **Move Function**: O(1) amortized per step - since we optimize the num by taking modulo with the perimeter.
- **Get Position and Direction**: O(1) - straightforward retrievals.

This ensures the solution is efficient and meets the problem constraints.
