[Leetcode 3022. Minimize OR of Remaining Elements Using Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3022)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you can do the following operation any number of times:
1. Choose any two elements `x` and `y` from the array.
2. Remove both `x` and `y` from the array.
3. Append `x | y` to the array. 

You need to find the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of all the remaining elements after any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

To understand the problem better, consider these questions:

1. **Input Validity:** 
   - What is the range of the length of the array `nums`?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return the minimized OR value of the remaining elements?
   - Do special conditions apply to the output format?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to focus on one core concept: the bitwise OR operation. The key property of the bitwise OR is that it can only turn bits on (i.e., change 0s to 1s but not the other way around). Therefore, irrespective of how many operations you perform, the final result will be determined by the set of bits that are turned on in the array.

Here's a concise strategy:
1. You perform the OR operation on the entire array and compute the result.
2. The final value will be a single number which is the OR of all elements because the OR operation can only accumulate more 1s.

### Solution in C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int minimizeOR(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int result = 0;
    for (int num : nums) {
        result |= num;
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3}; // Sample input
    std::cout << "Minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of remaining elements: " 
              << minimizeOR(nums) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution has a linear time complexity \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we iterate through the array once to compute the final OR value. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a single variable to store the result.

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** Start with a result initialized to 0.
- **Iteration:** For each element in the array, perform a bitwise OR operation with the current result.
- **Final Result:** The value of `result` will be the OR value of all the elements in the array, which is the minimum possible value after any number of operations.

This approach ensures that we are considering all the bits that are turned on across all array elements, which is exactly what determines the minimum possible OR value we can achieve.
