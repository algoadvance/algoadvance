[Leetcode 2145. Count the Hidden Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2145)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `differences` where `differences[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]` and two integers `lower` and `upper`. You need to count the number of possible hidden sequences that can be derived from the array `differences` and that are within the inclusive range `[lower, upper]`.

The hidden sequence is constructed such that `a[0] + differences[0] = a[1]` and so on, for all valid indices.

## Example
- Input: `differences = [1, -3, 4]`, `lower = 1`, `upper = 6`
- Output: `2`

## Clarifying Questions 

1. Can `differences` array be empty?
2. What are the constraints on the input values?
3. Should the hidden sequence consist only of integers?

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through `differences` to construct the sequence:** Start with an initial value (let's call it `a[0]`). Each subsequent value is derived from the previous value and the corresponding element in `differences`.
2. **Track the minimum and maximum of the sequence:** As we build the sequence, we should keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered. This will help in determining the valid range for the initial value.
3. **Compute valid range for initial value:** Calculate the permissible range for `a[0]` such that every element in the hidden sequence falls within `[lower, upper]`.
4. **Count valid initial values:** The number of valid sequences is the count of valid initial values `a[0]` that fit in the derived permissible range.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

int countHiddenSequences(std::vector<int>& differences, int lower, int upper) {
    long long minPrefixSum = 0, maxPrefixSum = 0, currentPrefixSum = 0;

    for (int diff : differences) {
        currentPrefixSum += diff;
        minPrefixSum = std::min(minPrefixSum, currentPrefixSum);
        maxPrefixSum = std::max(maxPrefixSum, currentPrefixSum);
    }

    // The range of valid starting values for a[0]
    long long validLower = lower - minPrefixSum;
    long long validUpper = upper - maxPrefixSum;

    if (validLower > validUpper) {
        return 0;
    }

    return validUpper - validLower + 1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `differences` array. This is because we only need a single pass through the array to compute the prefix sums and determine the minimum and maximum prefix sums.
