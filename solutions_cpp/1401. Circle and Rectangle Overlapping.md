[Leetcode 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1401)
### Problem Statement

You are given a circle represented as `(radius, x_center, y_center)` and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as its bottom-left corner `(x1, y1)` and top-right corner `(x2, y2)`.

Return `true` if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Coordinate Precision**: Should we assume the coordinates are accurate to some decimal places, or should we consider them as integers for simplicity in this problem?
   - We can assume coordinates are floating-point numbers with sufficient precision for comparison.

2. **Overlap Definition**: Does touching at a single point count as overlapping?
   - Yes, if the circle and the rectangle touch at any point, it should count as an overlap.

### Strategy

To determine if the circle overlaps with the rectangle, we can simplify the problem:

1. **Finding the Nearest Point on Rectangle to Circle Center**:
   - For any point `(x, y)` on the rectangle:
     - The nearest x-coordinate to `x_center` within the rectangle is `clamp(x_center, x1, x2)`.
     - The nearest y-coordinate to `y_center` within the rectangle is `clamp(y_center, y1, y2)`.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance between the circle's center and this nearest point.
   - If this distance is less than or equal to the circle's radius, then the circle overlaps with the rectangle.

3. **Clamping Function**:
   - Define a helper function `clamp(value, min, max)`:
     ```cpp
     float clamp(float val, float min, float max) {
         return fmax(min, fmin(val, max));
     }
     ```

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    float clamp(float val, float min, float max) {
        return std::max(min, std::min(val, max));
    }
    
    bool checkOverlap(int radius, int x_center, int y_center, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        // Finding the nearest point on the rectangle to the circle's center
        float nearestX = clamp(x_center, x1, x2);
        float nearestY = clamp(y_center, y1, y2);
        
        // Calculating the distance from the circle's center to the nearest point
        float dx = x_center - nearestX;
        float dy = y_center - nearestY;
        
        // Return true if this distance is less than or equal to the circle's radius
        return (dx * dx + dy * dy) <= (radius * radius);
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because:
- The clamp function and the distance calculation both run in constant time.

This method ensures that we efficiently determine whether the circle and the rectangle overlap.
