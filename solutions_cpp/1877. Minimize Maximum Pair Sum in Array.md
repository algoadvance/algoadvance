[Leetcode 1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1877)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of even length `n`. Pair up the elements of `nums` into `n / 2` pairs such that:

- Each element of `nums` is in exactly one pair, and
- The maximum pair sum is minimized.

Return the minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the values of `n` (the length of the array)?
     - `n` is even and `2 <= n <= 10^5`.
   - What are the constraints on the values within the array?
     - Each element of `nums` is a positive integer, and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
2. **Output:**
   - We need to return a single integer representing the minimized maximum pair sum.

### Strategy

To minimize the maximum pair sum, we should:
1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the array, the smallest elements will be at the beginning and the largest elements at the end.
2. **Pair the Elements**: Pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This strategy ensures that the maximum pair sum is minimized because it balances the pair sums. 

For example:
- Given a sorted array `nums = [a1, a2, ..., an]`, pair `a1` with `an`, `a2` with `an-1`, etc.
- Calculate the pair sums and find the maximum among them.

**Steps**:
1. Sort the array.
2. Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning (`i = 0`) and one at the end (`j = n-1`).
3. Form pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` and calculate their sum.
4. Track the maximum of these pair sums.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int minPairSum(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        // Sort the array
        std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        int maxPairSum = 0;
        int n = nums.size();

        // Pair smallest with largest, second smallest with second largest, etc.
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
            int pairSum = nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i];
            maxPairSum = std::max(maxPairSum, pairSum);
        }
        
        return maxPairSum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::vector<int> nums = {3, 5, 2, 3};
    std::cout << sol.minPairSum(nums) << std::endl;  // Output should be 7
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the sorting step:

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The subsequent pairing and finding the maximum pair sum take \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
