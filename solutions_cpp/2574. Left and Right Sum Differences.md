[Leetcode 2574. Left and Right Sum Differences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2574)
## Problem Statement
Given a 1-indexed integer array `nums`, you are asked to return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the absolute difference between the sum of elements to the left of index `i` and the sum of elements to the right of index `i`.

More formally, `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|`.

Where:
- `leftSum[i]` is the sum of the elements to the left of index `i`.
- `rightSum[i]` is the sum of the elements to the right of index `i`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Indexing**: The problem states the array is 1-indexed, but typical C++ arrays are 0-indexed. Should the solution follow usual 0-indexing for ease?
   - Yes, the problem will be solved using 0-indexed arrays for simplicity and converted if necessary.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: What are the constraints on the input array size and element values?
   - Constraints are typically provided in the problem statement. We will assume reasonable constraints (e.g., up to \(10^5\) elements in the array).

## Strategy
1. **Initialize Prefix and Suffix Sums**:
   - Compute prefix sum as we iterate through the array to get the left sum for each index.
   - Compute the total sum of the array beforehand.
   
2. **Compute Right Sums Efficiently**:
   - As we are computing answer while iterating, compute the right sum by subtracting the prefix sum from the total sum for each index.

Given `leftSum[i]` and `rightSum[i]`, compute the absolute difference \( |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]| \).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

std::vector<int> leftRightDifference(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> answer(n);
    std::vector<int> prefixSum(n, 0);
    
    // Compute prefix sum
    prefixSum[0] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }
    
    // Compute the total sum of the array
    int totalSum = prefixSum[n - 1];
    
    // Compute the result
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int leftSum = (i == 0) ? 0 : prefixSum[i - 1];
        int rightSum = totalSum - prefixSum[i];
        answer[i] = std::abs(leftSum - rightSum);
    }
    
    return answer;
}

// Helper function to print the vector
void printVector(const std::vector<int>& vec) {
    std::cout << "[ ";
    for (const int& value : vec) {
        std::cout << value << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "]" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> result = leftRightDifference(nums);
    printVector(result);
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(n)
- **Total Sum Calculation**: O(1) (as it is derived from the last prefix sum)
- **Result Calculation**: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array.

This solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.
