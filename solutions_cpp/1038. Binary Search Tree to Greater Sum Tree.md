[Leetcode 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1038)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), transform it into a Greater Sum Tree (GST) where every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we return?**  
Return the root of the transformed tree.

2. **Should the transformation be done in place?**  
Yes, we need to transform the tree in place.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?**
Typically, BST node values are unique integers.

### Strategy
To transform a BST into a GST, we need to understand the property of BSTs where the in-order traversal produces values in ascending order. For the Greater Sum Tree, we need to alter this traversal in a way that visits nodes in descending order.

A viable approach:
- Use a reverse in-order traversal (right -> root -> left).
- Keep a running sum and accumulate values as you traverse nodes.
- Update each node's value with the running sum.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    void reverseInOrderTraversal(TreeNode* node, int &sum) {
        if (!node) return;
        
        // Traverse right subtree
        reverseInOrderTraversal(node->right, sum);
        
        // Process current node
        sum += node->val;
        node->val = sum;
        
        // Traverse left subtree
        reverseInOrderTraversal(node->left, sum);
    }
    
    TreeNode* bstToGst(TreeNode* root) {
        int sum = 0;
        reverseInOrderTraversal(root, sum);
        return root;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Example usage:
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left = new TreeNode(1);
    root->right = new TreeNode(6);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(0);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(2);
    root->left->right->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->right->left = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(7);
    root->right->right->right = new TreeNode(8);

    Solution solution;
    TreeNode* result = solution.bstToGst(root);

    // Here you should include a function to print the tree if needed

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the reverse in-order traversal.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity mainly depends on the recursion depth, which is equal to the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the space complexity is O(n). For a balanced BST, the space complexity is O(log n) due to the call stack.
