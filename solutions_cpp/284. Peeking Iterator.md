[Leetcode 284. Peeking Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l284)
### Problem Statement

Given an Iterator class interface with methods: `next()` and `hasNext()`, design and implement a PeekingIterator that supports the `peek()` operation. The `peek()` method should return the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator. The `PeekingIterator` should still support the standard operations of advancing the iterator with `next()` and checking if there are elements remaining using `hasNext()`.

**Example:**
```cpp
Input:
[1, 2, 3]
Output:
[null, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, false]
Explanation:
PeekingIterator peekIterator = new PeekingIterator([1, 2, 3]);
peekIterator.next();    // return 1
peekIterator.peek();    // return 2
peekIterator.next();    // return 2
peekIterator.next();    // return 3
peekIterator.hasNext(); // return false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input a continuous stream or a fixed list of elements?**
   - The input is a fixed list of elements.

2. **What should `peek()` return when the iterator is at the end?**
   - The expected behavior for `peek()` when no elements are left to iterate should be addressed explicitly, but typically if `hasNext()` is `false`, calling `peek()` would likely be undefined or might throw an exception.

3. **Can the iterator contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the iterator can contain duplicate elements, as `peek()` and `next()` operations should be based on their positions, not the element values.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

// Below is the Iterator interface implementation. Do not change it.
class Iterator {
    struct Data;
    Data* data;
public:
    Iterator(const std::vector<int>& nums);
    Iterator(const Iterator& iter);
    virtual ~Iterator();
    // Returns the next element in the iteration.
    int next();
    // Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
    bool hasNext() const;
};

class PeekingIterator : public Iterator {
private:
    int nextElement;
    bool hasNextElement;
public:
    PeekingIterator(const std::vector<int>& nums) : Iterator(nums) {
        hasNextElement = Iterator::hasNext();
        if (hasNextElement) {
            nextElement = Iterator::next();
        }
    }

    // Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
    int peek() {
        return nextElement;
    }

    // Override next() to use the cached element.
    int next() {
        int toReturn = nextElement;
        hasNextElement = Iterator::hasNext();
        if (hasNextElement) {
            nextElement = Iterator::next();
        }
        return toReturn;
    }

    // Override hasNext() to include the logic for the cached element.
    bool hasNext() const {
        return hasNextElement;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: The `PeekingIterator` is initialized with a given list of elements. It uses the base `Iterator` constructor to initialize the iterator.
2. **Caching Next Element**: During initialization, the first element is fetched and stored in `nextElement`. A boolean `hasNextElement` is used to keep track of whether any elements are left to iterate.
3. **peek() Method**: This method simply returns the cached `nextElement` without advancing the iterator.
4. **next() Method**: This method returns the cached `nextElement` and advances the iterator by fetching the next element into the cache.
5. **hasNext() Method**: This method checks the boolean `hasNextElement` to determine if there are more elements to iterate.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: The initialization takes O(1) as it only sets up internal structures and fetches the first element if available.
- **peek()**: This operation runs in O(1) as it only returns the cached element.
- **next()**: Fetching the next element (if available) also runs in O(1) time.
- **hasNext()**: Checking if there is a next element is O(1) due to the precomputed boolean `hasNextElement`.

This design ensures that all operations (`peek`, `next`, `hasNext`) perform efficiently with constant time complexity.
