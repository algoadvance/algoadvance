[Leetcode 967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l967)
### Problem Statement

This problem is from LeetCode and is titled "Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences."

**Description**: 

Return all non-negative integers of length `n` such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`.

Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros except the number 0 itself. 

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 7
Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `n` guaranteed to be at least 1?**
   - Yes, by constraint, `n` is always at least 1.

2. **Can `k` be 0?**
   - Yes, `k` can be 0, which means consecutive digits are the same.

3. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, `n` can range from 1 to 9 and `k` can range from 0 to 9.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to construct each valid number recursively. We'll start building numbers of length `n` by considering each number from 1 to 9 as a possible starting digit (leading zeros are not allowed except for the number 0 itself).

Here’s the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Define a DFS Function**: This function will take the current number, current depth, and the target length `n`.
2. **Base Case**: If the current length is `n`, add the current number to the results list.
3. **Recursive Case**: Append the next digit that maintains the difference `k` with the last digit. There are two possible next digits: `last_digit + k` and `last_digit - k`. Ensure these digits are within the valid range [0, 9].
4. **Initial Step**: Start the DFS from each digit from 1 to 9 and handle the special case where `n = 1` explicitly.

By this method, every valid number will be explored.

### Code

Here’s the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> numsSameConsecDiff(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> result;
        // Handle the special case where the number length is 1.
        if (n == 1) {
            result.push_back(0);
        }
        
        // Try starting the number with every digit from 1 to 9.
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; ++i) {
            dfs(i, n - 1, k, result);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

private:
    void dfs(int current_num, int remaining_digits, int k, vector<int>& result) {
        // When no more digits are remaining, add the number to the result.
        if (remaining_digits == 0) {
            result.push_back(current_num);
            return;
        }

        int last_digit = current_num % 10;

        // Find possible next digits based on the difference `k`.
        int next_digit_up = last_digit + k;
        int next_digit_down = last_digit - k;

        // Ensure next digit is within the range [0, 9] and perform DFS.
        if (next_digit_up <= 9) {
            dfs(current_num * 10 + next_digit_up, remaining_digits - 1, k, result);
        }

        // Carefully handle the case where k == 0, to avoid duplicate numbers.
        if (k > 0 && next_digit_down >= 0) {
            dfs(current_num * 10 + next_digit_down, remaining_digits - 1, k, result);
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 3;
    int k = 7;
    vector<int> result = sol.numsSameConsecDiff(n, k);
    
    for (int num : result) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(2^n), where n is the length of the number. This is because each digit can potentially split into two branches (one for `last_digit + k` and one for `last_digit - k`), leading to a binary tree-like structure.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), which is the depth of the recursion stack.


This solution ensures that all potential numbers are explored while avoiding invalid ones and duplicates efficiently.
