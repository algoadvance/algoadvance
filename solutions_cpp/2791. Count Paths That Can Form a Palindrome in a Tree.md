[Leetcode 2791. Count Paths That Can Form a Palindrome in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2791)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. Each node `i` has a value `val[i]`.

Two nodes `u` and `v` form a path from `u` to `v` and vice versa. We call this path a **palindrome path** if the sequence of values from `u` to `v` (following the path) reads the same forward and backward.

Your task is to count all distinct palindrome paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input format:** Will the tree and values be provided in any specific format? 
   * **Answer:** Yes, typically the tree will be given as an adjacency list or direct edge list, and the values will likely be given in an array form where the index corresponds to the node number.
2. **Output format:** Should the count include both paths `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` as separate or just one of them?
   * **Answer:** Only one, since the path itself is considered the same regardless of direction.

### Strategy
To efficiently solve this problem, below is a high-level strategy:

1. **Tree Traversal:** Use DFS or BFS to traverse all paths in the tree.
2. **Frequency Count using Trie**: Use a Trie (prefix tree) to store and check the frequency of sequences. This is because tries can efficiently handle prefix checks and can help manage combinations.
3. **Palindrome Check:** As we traverse, maintain an in-progress sequence and check if adding the next node's value forms a palindrome.
4. **DFS/BFS Implementation:** Utilize DFS for the traversal and maintain a set or map to record visited paths to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code

The implementation involves building the graph, performing DFS to explore all paths, and checking for palindrome properties using a map data structure for efficiency.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Helper function to check if a sequence is palindrome
bool isPalindrome(const vector<int>& sequence) {
    int left = 0, right = sequence.size() - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (sequence[left++] != sequence[right--]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

void dfs(int node, int parent, vector<int>& path, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& values, int& count) {
    // Add current node's value to the path
    path.push_back(values[node]);
    
    // Check all paths ending at current node
    for (int i = 0; i < path.size(); ++i) {
        if (isPalindrome(vector<int>(path.begin() + i, path.end()))) {
            ++count;
        }
    }
    
    // Explore the subtree
    for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
        if (neighbor != parent) {
            dfs(neighbor, node, path, graph, values, count);
        }
    }
    // Backtrack
    path.pop_back();
}

int countPalindromePaths(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<int>& values) {
    // Build graph from edges
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
        graph[u].push_back(v);
        graph[v].push_back(u);
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    vector<int> path;
    dfs(0, -1, path, graph, values, count);
    
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the tree and DFS traversal will take `O(n)` time where `n` is the number of nodes.
- Checking if the sequence is palindrome for each path will take `O(L)` where `L` is the length of the current path (could be `n` in the worst case).

Overall, the time complexity is approximately `O(n^2)` due to the nested DFS and palindrome checks. This should be efficient enough for a typical constraint range in a problem like this.

Feel free to run this conceptual solution with actual constraints for performance validation!
