[Leetcode 3123. Find Edges in Shortest Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3123)
### Problem Statement

Given a weighted, directed graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges, your task is to determine which edges are part of the shortest path between any pair of nodes. Output a list of edges that belong to some shortest path.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: What are the constraints on the input?
   - **Answer**: The input consists of `n` nodes and `m` edges in the graph, where the edges are directed and have weights.

2. **Output**: What should the output format be?
   - **Answer**: The output should be a list of edges that belong to any shortest path between any pair of nodes.

3. **Constraints**:
   - **Answer**: The graph can contain up to `n = 1000` nodes and `m = 10000` edges.

4. **Edge Weight**: Are the weights of the edges always non-negative?
   - **Answer**: Itâ€™s important to clarify whether we can use Dijkstra's algorithm (which requires non-negative weights) or if we should use an algorithm like Floyd-Warshall that can handle negative weights (but no negative cycles).

### Strategy

Given the constraints and requirements, we can adopt the following strategy:

1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find all-pairs shortest paths. This algorithm is suitable for dense graphs with up to around 1000 nodes. The algorithm will also help us track shortest paths, even if negative weights are present, as long as there are no negative weight cycles.

2. **Edge Classification**:
   - After computing the shortest paths, iterate through each edge and check if it lies on the shortest path from any node `u` to any node `v`.

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize a distance matrix and set the distances based on edge weights.
   - Update the distance matrix using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
   - Iterate through the edges to find and output those that lie on any shortest path.

### Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>
using namespace std;

const int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();

void floydWarshall(int n, vector<vector<int>> &dist, vector<vector<int>> &next) {
    for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (dist[i][k] != INF && dist[k][j] != INF && dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                    next[i][j] = k;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

vector<pair<int, int>> findAllShortestPathEdges(int n, int m, vector<tuple<int, int, int>> &edges) {
    vector<vector<int>> dist(n, vector<int>(n, INF));
    vector<vector<int>> next(n, vector<int>(n, -1));
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        dist[i][i] = 0;
    }

    for (auto &[u, v, w] : edges) {
        dist[u][v] = w;
    }

    floydWarshall(n, dist, next);
    
    vector<pair<int, int>> result;
    for (auto &[u, v, w] : edges) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (dist[i][u] != INF && dist[u][v] != INF && dist[v][j] != INF && dist[i][j] == dist[i][u] + w + dist[v][j]) {
                    result.emplace_back(u, v);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<tuple<int, int, int>> edges(m);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int u, v, w;
        cin >> u >> v >> w;
        edges[i] = make_tuple(u, v, w);
    }

    vector<pair<int, int>> shortestPathEdges = findAllShortestPathEdges(n, m, edges);
    for (auto &[u, v] : shortestPathEdges) {
        cout << "(" << u << ", " << v << ")" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: \(O(n^3)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes.
- **Edge Check**: \(O(n^2 \times m)\), where \(m\) is the number of edges.

Given these complexities, the algorithm should be efficient enough for \(n \leq 1000\) and \(m \leq 10000\).
