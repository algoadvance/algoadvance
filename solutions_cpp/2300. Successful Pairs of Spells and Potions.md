[Leetcode 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2300)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m` respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the `i-th` spell and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the `j-th` potion.

You are also given an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair `(spell, potion)` is considered successful if the product `spell * potion` is greater than or equal to `success`.

Return an array of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the `i-th` spell.

### clarifying questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the lengths of the `spells` and `potions` arrays, and the limits of their respective elements and `success`?
   - `1 <= spells.length, potions.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= spells[i], potions[j] <= 10^9`
   - `1 <= success <= 10^18`
   
2. **Result Format**: Should the resulting array be in any particular order?
   - Yes, the resulting array should be of length `n`, with `answer[i]` at index `i` representing the number of successful pairs for the `i-th` spell.

3. **Execution Time**: What is the acceptable time complexity for this problem?
   - Given the constraints, an optimal solution should operate within O(n log m + m log m) time complexity.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `potions` array. This allows for efficient binary search operations.
   
2. **Binary Search**: For each spell in the `spells` array, use binary search to find the smallest potion value that, when multiplied by the spell, meets or exceeds the `success` threshold.
   
3. **Counting Successful Pairs**: The number of successful potions for a given spell can be determined by the count of all potions from the found position to the end of the potions array.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> successfulPairs(std::vector<int>& spells, std::vector<int>& potions, long long success) {
    // Sort the potions array for binary search
    std::sort(potions.begin(), potions.end());
    int m = potions.size();
    std::vector<int> result;
    
    // For each spell, determine the number of successful pairs
    for (long long spell : spells) {
        long long target = (success + spell - 1) / spell; // Minimum potion strength needed
        
        // Use binary search to find the first potion that meets or exceeds the target
        auto it = std::lower_bound(potions.begin(), potions.end(), target);
        int count = potions.end() - it; // Count of potions from it to end
        result.push_back(count);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Potions**: `O(m log m)`
- **Binary Search for Each Spell**: `O(n log m)`
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(m log m + n log m)`

This ensures the solution is efficient and can handle the upper limits of the constraints.
