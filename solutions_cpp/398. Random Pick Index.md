[Leetcode 398. Random Pick Index](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l398)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` with possible duplicates. You want to design an algorithm that randomly picks an index of a given target number. Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the array `nums`.
- `int pick(int target)` Picks a random index `i` from `nums` where `nums[i] == target`. If there are multiple valid i's, each index should have an equal probability of being returned.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the `nums` array?**
   - The array `nums` will have a length of up to 50,000.
   - Each element in `nums` can be between -1,000,000 and 1,000,000.

2. **How often will the `pick` function be called relative to the initialization?**
   - The `pick` function may be called multiple times after the `Solution` object is initialized.

3. **Is there any restriction on the runtime and space complexity of the solution?**
   - The initialization can take some time (ideally linear), but the `pick` function should be optimized for efficiency, ideally constant time.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use **Reservoir Sampling**, a technique used to randomly choose k samples from a list of n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number.

1. **Initialization (`Solution` constructor)**:
   - Simply store the array `nums`.

2. **Random index selection (`pick` function)**:
   - Use Reservoir Sampling to randomly pick one index from the potential candidates.

Explanation of Reservoir Sampling for this problem:
- Traverse through the array `nums`. For each index `i` where `nums[i]` equals the `target`, choose that index with a certain probability.
- The probability is 1/count where count is the number of valid indices seen so far.

This ensures that each valid index has an equal probability of being chosen.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

class Solution {
private:
    std::vector<int> nums;

public:
    Solution(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        this->nums = nums;
        std::srand(std::time(0)); // Initialize random number generator
    }
    
    int pick(int target) {
        int chosen_index = -1;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == target) {
                ++count;
                if (std::rand() % count == 0) { // Probability of 1/count
                    chosen_index = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return chosen_index;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
   - This is only to store the array, so it's efficient.

2. **Pick Function**:
   - The `pick` function runs in `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
   - Despite this, Reservoir Sampling is efficient in choosing the index by traversing the array only once.

### Summary

- Used Reservoir Sampling to ensure an equal probability for each valid index.
- Initialization is efficient and the `pick` function, although it has linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input array, is optimized for scenarios with multiple valid targets.
