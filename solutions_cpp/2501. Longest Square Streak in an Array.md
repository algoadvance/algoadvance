[Leetcode 2501. Longest Square Streak in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2501)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest square streak in `nums`. A square streak is a sequence of numbers where each number sequentially squares the previous one in the sequence.

Example:
- Input: nums = [2, 4, 16, 256, 65536]
- Output: 3

Explanation: The squares sequence is [2, 4, 16]. The sequence length is 3.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the input array will always contain at least one element.
   
2. **Are the numbers in the array unique?**
   - The array can contain duplicate numbers.
   
3. **What should be the output if no square streak is found?**
   - Return 0 if no valid streak is found.

### Strategy

We need to find the longest sequence where each number is the square of the previous number. To achieve this efficiently:
1. **Sort** the input array `nums`.
2. **Use a hash set** to facilitate constant-time lookups.
3. **Iterate** over the sorted array and for each number, keep squaring it to check if the resulting number exists in the set.
4. Keep track of the longest sequence found.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

int longestSquareStreak(const std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    int maxStreak = 0;

    for(int num : nums) {
        int streak = 1;
        long long current = num;

        while(numSet.find(current * current) != numSet.end()) {
            current *= current;
            ++streak;
        }

        maxStreak = std::max(maxStreak, streak);
    }

    return (maxStreak > 1 ? maxStreak : 0);
}

// Testing the function
int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums = {2, 4, 16, 256, 65536};
    std::cout << longestSquareStreak(nums) << std::endl;  // Output should be 3

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: Sorting is not necessary for the solution, but helps in optimizing the search range by skipping smaller elements once considered.
2. **HashSet**: `numSet` is used to allow for quick lookup to check if the square of a number exists.
3. **Tracking Streaks**: For each number in `nums`, initialize it as the start of a streak and keep squaring it while checking its presence in the set, counting the length of the streak.
4. **Maximum Streak**: Update the `maxStreak` whenever a longer streak is found.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N log N)** due to the sorting step, and the hash set operations (lookup and insertion) are average **O(1)**. Therefore, the overall time complexity is:
- Sorting: **O(N log N)**
- Iterating and checking: **O(N)**

So the dominant term is **O(N log N)**, which makes the solution quite efficient.
