[Leetcode 1416. Restore The Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1416)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` that consists only of digits and an integer `k`, you can split `s` into some number of non-empty substrings. The following conditions must be met:

1. The value of each substring must be between `1` and `k`, inclusive.
2. No substring can have leading zeros, except for the single digit `0` which is not allowed since it can't be between `1` and `k`.

Return the number of ways to split the string so that every substring has a value between `1` and `k`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "1000", k = 10000
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to split "1000" (i.e. "1000").
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "1000", k = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no valid way to split "1000" as none of its substrings has a value between 1 and 10.
```

### Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: s = "1317", k = 2000
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 ways to split "1317".
"1", "3", "1", "7"
"1", "3", "17"
"1", "31", "7"
"1", "317"
"13", "1", "7"
"13", "17"
"131", "7"
"1317"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - The length of `s` is up to `10^5`.
2. Can `k` be greater than the length of `s`?
   - Yes, `k` can be up to `10^9`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will represent the number of ways to split the substring `s[0...i-1]` such that all parts have values between `1` and `k`.

1. Initialize `dp` such that `dp[0] = 1` because there's exactly one way to split an empty string.
2. For each character in the string, check all possible substrings ending at that character and starting from some valid starting point, making sure the substrings are within the given constraints.
3. For each valid substring, update `dp` based on the substrings before its starting point.
4. Sum up the ways from `dp` to get the answer.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArrays(std::string s, int k) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int n = s.size();
        std::vector<int> dp(n + 1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i; j > 0; --j) {
                if (s[j - 1] == '0') continue;      // Skip substrings with leading zeros
                std::string sub = s.substr(j - 1, i - j + 1);
                long value = stol(sub);
                if (value > k) break;               // The value is out of bound, break.
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD;  // Update dp[i] based on previous splits
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \)
  - This is because, for each character in the string, we might have to look back at every possible starting point for that character, resulting in a quadratic time algorithm.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
  - We use an auxiliary array `dp` of size `n + 1`.

This approach efficiently computes the number of valid ways to split the string into substrings that meet the given criteria, leveraging dynamic programming to manage overlapping subproblems.
