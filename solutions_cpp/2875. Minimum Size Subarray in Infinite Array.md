[Leetcode 2875. Minimum Size Subarray in Infinite Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2875)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **2D array** (`int** matrix`) representing an infinite grid and two integers, `target` and `k`. Your goal is to find the smallest size of a contiguous subarray in row `k` that has a sum greater than or equal to `target`. The array is infinite, meaning that any finite section of the grid can be conceptually repeated infinitely.

**Function Signature:**
```cpp
int minSizeSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums, int k, int target);
```

**Example:**
```cpp
std::vector<int> nums = {2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3}; 
int k = 19; 
int target = 7;
int result = minSizeSubarray(nums, k, target);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Infinite Row Repetition**: The given array `nums` can be considered to repeat indefinitely. This means that after the last element of `nums`, the first element appears again infinitely.
2. **Single Row Concern**: We are only concerned with one particular row index `k`.
3. **Contiguous Subarray**: We're looking for a contiguous subarray that can "wrap around" due to the infinite nature of the array.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window**: Utilize a sliding window approach to determine the smallest subarray whose sum is at least `target`.
2. **Prefix Sum**: Use a prefix sum array to speed up sum calculations for subarrays.
3. **Handling Infinity**: Simulate the "infinity" by repeating the prefix sum for sufficient length to cover the need for a wrap-around.
4. **Optimizing Length**: If we find a window with the sum >= target, adjust the window to see if it can be minimized.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <climits>

int minSizeSubarray(std::vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int n = nums.size();
    std::vector<int> prefixSum(2 * n + 1, 0);

    // Create prefix sum array to simulate "infinite" repetition by doubling the array
    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i % n];
    }

    int minLength = INT_MAX;

    // Use sliding window to find minimum subarray length
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j <= 2 * n; ++j) {
            if (prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i] >= target) {
                minLength = std::min(minLength, j - i);
                break;  // No need to look further as we're looking for the minimal length
            }
        }
    }

    return (minLength == INT_MAX) ? -1 : minLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The creation of the prefix sum array is `O(n)`.
  - The nested loops for sliding window check should theoretically be `O(n^2)`, but in practice, due to early breaking conditions and a doubling constraint, the complexity is closer to `O(n)` under expected conditions.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the prefix sum array.
