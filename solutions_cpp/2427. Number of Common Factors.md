[Leetcode 2427. Number of Common Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2427)
## Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers `a` and `b`. Return the number of common factors of `a` and `b`.

A factor of a number `x` is defined as an integer `i` where `x % i == 0`.

### Example 1
```
Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the values of `a` and `b`?
   - Both `a` and `b` are positive integers.
   
2. Could `a` and `b` be equal?
   - Yes, `a` and `b` could be equal.

3. What is the maximum possible value for `a` and `b`?
   - The problem does not explicitly mention the maximum limits, but they are typically within a reasonable range for computation within the context of common interview problems.

4. How should input be handled?
   - Assume the function will be called with two integer parameters, `a` and `b`.

## Strategy

1. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The common factors of `a` and `b` are the factors of the GCD of `a` and `b`.
   
2. **Count factors of the GCD**: Iterate through numbers from 1 to `gcd(a, b)`, counting the numbers that divide `gcd(a, b)` without a remainder.

3. **Return the count**: The result is the count of such divisors.

The GCD can be efficiently calculated using Euclid's algorithm.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to calculate the GCD using Euclid's algorithm
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

// Function to count the number of common factors
int commonFactors(int a, int b) {
    int gcdValue = gcd(a, b);
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= gcdValue; ++i) {
        if (gcdValue % i == 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Main function for testing
int main() {
    int a = 12, b = 6;
    std::cout << "Number of common factors: " << commonFactors(a, b) << std::endl;

    a = 25, b = 30;
    std::cout << "Number of common factors: " << commonFactors(a, b) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **GCD Calculation**: The time complexity is `O(log(min(a, b)))` due to Euclid's algorithm, which efficiently calculates the GCD.
2. **Counting Factors**: We iterate from 1 to `gcd(a, b)`, which gives a time complexity of `O(gcd(a, b))`.

### Overall Time Complexity
The overall time complexity can be approximated as `O(log(min(a, b)) + gcd(a, b))`. Given typical constraints, this method is efficient for computing the number of common factors for reasonable input sizes.
