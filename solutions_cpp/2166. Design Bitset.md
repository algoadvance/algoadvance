[Leetcode 2166. Design Bitset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2166)
Sure, let's go through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement:
The task is to design a Bitset data structure that supports the following operations:

1. **fix(idx)**: Fixes the bit at index idx to 1.
2. **unfix(idx)**: Fixes the bit at index idx to 0.
3. **flip()**: Flips all the bits (converts 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).
4. **all()**: Returns true if all the bits are 1, false otherwise.
5. **one()**: Returns true if at least one bit is 1, false otherwise.
6. **count()**: Returns the total number of bits that are set to 1.
7. **toString()**: Returns the current bitset as a string.

The initial bitset consists of all 0s, and you are required to keep track of these bits efficiently.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the size range of the bitset?
2. Are there any constraints on the operations (like the maximum number of operations)?

Assuming standard constraints where the size can be as big as 10^6 and operations can be up to 10^6, let's move on to the solution.

### Strategy:
1. **Internal Storage**: Use a string and an integer to keep track of the current bitset and the count of 1s.
2. **Fix and Unfix Operations**: Adjust the bits at the specified index and update the count.
3. **Flip Operation**: Maintain a flip state which indicates whether the entire bitset has been flipped or not.
4. **All and One Queries**: Use the count of 1s to determine the results.
5. **toString Method**: Generate the string representation considering the flip state.

### Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

class Bitset {
private:
    std::string bits;
    int count_ones;
    bool is_flipped;

public:
    Bitset(int size) : bits(size, '0'), count_ones(0), is_flipped(false) {}

    void fix(int idx) {
        if ((!is_flipped && bits[idx] == '0') || (is_flipped && bits[idx] == '1')) {
            bits[idx] = is_flipped ? '0' : '1';
            count_ones++;
        }
    }

    void unfix(int idx) {
        if ((!is_flipped && bits[idx] == '1') || (is_flipped && bits[idx] == '0')) {
            bits[idx] = is_flipped ? '1' : '0';
            count_ones--;
        }
    }

    void flip() {
        is_flipped = !is_flipped;
        count_ones = bits.size() - count_ones;
    }

    bool all() const {
        return count_ones == bits.size();
    }

    bool one() const {
        return count_ones > 0;
    }

    int count() const {
        return count_ones;
    }

    std::string toString() const {
        std::string result = bits;
        if (is_flipped) {
            for (char &ch : result) {
                ch = (ch == '0') ? '1' : '0';
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};

// Sample usage
// int main() {
//     Bitset *bitset = new Bitset(5);
//     bitset->fix(3);
//     bitset->fix(1);
//     assert(bitset->count() == 2);
//     assert(bitset->toString() == "01001");
//     bitset->flip();
//     assert(bitset->all() == false);
//     bitset->unfix(0);
//     assert(bitset->count() == 3);
//     assert(bitset->toString() == "10110");
//     delete bitset;
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Time Complexity:
- The `fix`, `unfix`, `flip`, `all`, `one`, and `count` operations all have O(1) time complexity.
- The `toString` operation has O(n) time complexity, where n is the size of the bitset.

By maintaining a flip state and a count of 1s, we ensure that the operations are efficient and straightforward to implement.
