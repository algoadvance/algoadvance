[Leetcode 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1657)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

1. Swap any two existing characters.
2. Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

Return `true` if you can transform `word1` into `word2`, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are both strings `word1` and `word2` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - What is the maximum length of each string?
   - Are all characters in the strings lowercase English letters?

2. **Output:**
   - Should we return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating whether the strings `word1` and `word2` can be transformed into each other?

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

bool closeStrings(std::string word1, std::string word2) {
    if (word1.length() != word2.length()) return false;

    std::vector<int> freq1(26, 0), freq2(26, 0);
    std::vector<bool> exist1(26, false), exist2(26, false);
    
    for (char c : word1) {
        freq1[c - 'a']++;
        exist1[c - 'a'] = true;
    }
    
    for (char c : word2) {
        freq2[c - 'a']++;
        exist2[c - 'a'] = true;
    }
    
    std::sort(freq1.begin(), freq1.end());
    std::sort(freq2.begin(), freq2.end());
    
    return freq1 == freq2 && exist1 == exist2;
}

int main() {
    std::string word1, word2;
    std::cin >> word1 >> word2;
    std::cout << (closeStrings(word1, word2) ? "true" : "false") << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Length Check:**
   - First, check if the lengths of both strings are equal. If not, return `false`.

2. **Frequency and Existence Arrays:**
   - Create two vectors, `freq1` and `freq2`, to keep track of the frequency of each character in both strings.
   - Create two more vectors, `exist1` and `exist2`, to track the existence of characters in both strings.

3. **Fill Vectors:**
   - Traverse `word1` and `word2` to fill the frequency and existence vectors.

4. **Comparison:**
   - Sort both frequency vectors (`freq1` and `freq2`) and compare them.
   - Also compare the existence vectors (`exist1` and `exist2`).

5. **Return Result:**
   - If both the frequency and existence vectors are identical, the strings are close, so return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity is `O(n + 26log26) = O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because:
    - Filling the frequency and existence vectors takes `O(n)`.
    - Sorting vectors of fixed size 26 (number of letters in the English alphabet) takes `O(26log26) = O(1)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(1)` for the 26-sized vectors used for frequency and existence tracking. Thus, it effectively remains `O(1)`.
