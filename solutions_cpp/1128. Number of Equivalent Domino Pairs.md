[Leetcode 1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1128)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of dominoes, each represented as a pair of integers `[a, b]`, determine the number of pairs `(i, j)` for which `dominoes[i]` is equivalent to `dominoes[j]`. Two dominoes `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` are considered equivalent if either `(a == c and b == d)` or `(a == d and b == c)`.

In other words, domino `[1, 2]` is equivalent to domino `[2, 1]`.

### Example
- Input: `[[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]`
- Output: `1`

## Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** Are the integers in the dominoes always positive?
  - **A:** Yes, they are positive integers.
- **Q:** Is there any constraint on the size of the input list?
  - **A:** Yes, the input list can have up to 40000 dominoes.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash map to record the frequency of each equivalent domino representation. For each domino, we can sort the pair `(a, b)` to make sure that `[a, b]` and `[b, a]` are always mapped to the same key in the hash map. Here's the plan:

1. Convert each domino to a normalized tuple `(min(a, b), max(a, b))` to ensure the same representation for equivalent pairs.
2. Use a hash map to count the frequency of each normalized domino.
3. For each domino count in the hash map, calculate the number of pairs using the combination formula `n * (n - 1) / 2` where `n` is the number of occurrences of a particular domino.
4. Sum all these values to get the total number of equivalent domino pairs.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int numEquivDominoPairs(std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& dominoes) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int result = 0;
        
        for (auto &domino : dominoes) {
            int a = domino.first;
            int b = domino.second;
            // Normalize the domino representation by ensuring a <= b
            int key = (std::min(a, b) * 10) + std::max(a, b);
            count[key]++;
        }
        
        for (auto &entry : count) {
            int n = entry.second;
            result += (n * (n - 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> dominoes = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};
//     int result = sol.numEquivDominoPairs(dominoes);
//     std::cout << "Number of equivalent domino pairs: " << result << std::endl; // Output: 1
//     return 0;
// }
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the list of dominoes once to populate the hash map (O(n)).
  - Then, we traverse the hash map to calculate the number of pairs, which takes O(1) per entry in the hash map, and the total number of distinct domino keys is much smaller than the input size `n`. 
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The space required for the hash map is limited to the number of distinct dominoes, which fits within a small constant range since each domino pair maps to an integer between 0 to 99 (10 * 10 possible keys).

This solution is efficient for the given constraints and will handle the maximum input size comfortably.
