[Leetcode 60. Permutation Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l60)
## Problem Statement

Given the set of `n` numbers as {1, 2, 3, ..., n} and a positive integer `k`, return the `k`th permutation sequence of the set. 
The permutations are lexicographically ordered, and you are asked to find the `k`th such permutation directly without generating all permutations. 

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - `n` is between 1 and 9 inclusive. `k` is a valid permutation index within the range from 1 to n! (factorial of `n`).

2. **Which data types should be used for inputs and output?**
   - Both `n` and `k` are integers. The output will be a string representing the `k`th permutation sequence.

3. **Are there any constraints on time complexity or auxiliary space?**
   - Optimal time complexity is appreciated, considering typical constraints in competitive programming.

## Strategy

1. **Factorial Calculation:** 
   - Calculate the factorial for numbers up to `n-1`. This helps in determining the appropriate block in the sequence where the `k`th permutation falls.

2. **Identify the k-th Permutation:**
   - Use `k` to iteratively determine which digits to pick. Each choice reduces the problem size by fixing one more digit, and this process involves:
     - Calculating the index of the selected digit.
     - Adjusting `k` to the position within the current block.

3. **Remaining Elements:** 
   - Keep track of the unused elements to form the permutation sequence dynamically.

4. **Iterate Through Choices:** 
   - Continue the above steps iteratively until the permutation is fully constructed.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n^2) due to list operations within nested loops processing each digit of the permutation.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> factorial(n);
        vector<int> numbers;
        
        // Initialize factorial[] and numbers list
        factorial[0] = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i;
            numbers.push_back(i);
        }
        numbers.push_back(n);
        
        string result;
        --k;  // convert k from 1-based to 0-based index
        
        for(int i = n; i > 0; --i) {
            int idx = k / factorial[i - 1];
            result += to_string(numbers[idx]);
            numbers.erase(numbers.begin() + idx);
            k %= factorial[i - 1];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    cout << sol.getPermutation(3, 3) << endl;  // Output: "213"
    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
1. **Factorial Array:** Compute the factorial values up to `n-1`.
2. **Number Pool:** Create a list `numbers` from 1 to `n`.
3. **Iterative Selection:**
   - Use the factorial representation to determine the index of the next digit.
   - Adjust `k` accordingly by using modulo operation.
   - Remove the selected number from the list and continue till the permutation is fully built.
4. The main function demonstrates usage and prints the resulting permutation for provided sample input.

This method ensures direct computation of the `k`th permutation without generating all possible permutations, making it efficient and suitable for the given constraint.
