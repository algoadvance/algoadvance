[Leetcode 2976. Minimum Cost to Convert String I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2976)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `s1` and `s2`, both of the same length. The cost to convert a character `s1[i]` to `s2[i]` is 1 if the characters are different; otherwise, the cost is 0 if they are the same. You need to determine the minimum cost required to convert `s1` to `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of Strings**: Are the strings `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to be of the same length?
   - *Yes.*
2. **Character Set**: Are the strings composed of any specific character set (e.g., ASCII, lowercase, etc.)?
   - *Assume they consist of lowercase English letters.*
3. **Empty Strings**: Can the input strings be empty?
   - *For this problem, no, you can assume the strings have non-zero length.*

### Strategy

The problem is straightforward since for each character position `i`, you need to compare the characters `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`. If they differ, the cost is 1; otherwise, the cost is 0. Sum these costs over all character positions to get the total minimum cost.

1. Initialize a variable `total_cost` to 0.
2. Iterate through each character position in the strings.
3. For each position `i`, compare `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`:
   - If they are different, add 1 to `total_cost`.
4. Return `total_cost` after the iteration.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int minCostToConvertString(const std::string& s1, const std::string& s2) {
    // Strings must be of the same length
    int total_cost = 0;
    int n = s1.size();
    
    // Iterate through each character of the strings
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
            // Cost is 1 if characters are different
            total_cost += 1;
        }
    }
    
    return total_cost;
}

int main() {
    std::string s1 = "abc";
    std::string s2 = "bca";
    
    int cost = minCostToConvertString(s1, s2);
    std::cout << "Minimum cost to convert: " << cost << std::endl; // Output: 3
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings. This is because the algorithm involves iterating once through each character in the strings.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, irrespective of the input size.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum cost required to convert one string to another by character-wise comparison.
