[Leetcode 2839. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2839)
### Problem Statement:
Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, check if they can be made equal by performing some number of operations. In one operation, you can swap any two adjacent characters of `s1`. Return `true` if you can make `s1` equal to `s2`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the lengths of the strings `s1` and `s2`?**
   - The lengths of `s1` and `s2` will be in the range `[1, 1000]` and they are the same length.

2. **Are the strings case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, the strings are case-sensitive.

3. **Are there any special characters in the strings?**
   - The problem does not restrict characters, so we can assume both lowercase and uppercase letters as well as any character that the language considers valid.

### Strategy:
To determine if you can make `s1` equal to `s2` through adjacent swaps, it is equivalent to asking if `s1` can be rearranged to become `s2`. This is a fundamental property of permutations.

Our approach will involve:
1. Check if strings `s1` and `s2` have the same characters with the same frequency; this would confirm that one can be rearranged to be the other.

2. If they do, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting each string has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings.
- Comparing the two sorted strings has a complexity of \(O(n)\).
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code:
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

bool canBeEqualWithOperations(std::string s1, std::string s2) {
    // If lengths of s1 and s2 are different, they cannot be made equal
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) return false;
    
    // Sort the strings
    std::sort(s1.begin(), s1.end());
    std::sort(s2.begin(), s2.end());
    
    // Compare the sorted strings
    return s1 == s2;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Check:** We first check if the lengths of `s1` and `s2` are different. If they are, they cannot be made equal, and the function returns `false`.

2. **Sorting:** The strings `s1` and `s2` are sorted. Sorting rearranges the characters in a specific order (usually lexicographical).

3. **Comparison:** After sorting, if `s1` is identical to `s2`, it means `s1` can be rearranged to become `s2`, so we return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This solution ensures that we can determine the equality possibility of `s1` and `s2` through adjacent swaps efficiently.
