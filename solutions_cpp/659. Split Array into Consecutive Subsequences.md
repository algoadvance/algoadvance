[Leetcode 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l659)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

You need to determine if it is possible to split `nums` into one or more subsequences such that:

1. Each subsequence consists of consecutive integers.
2. Each subsequence has a length of at least 3.

Return `true` if it is possible to split `nums` according to the above conditions, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any specific constraints on the length of the array?**
   - Typically, the problem doesn't specify constraints, but it is safe to consider that the array size could be large (up to `10^4` or higher).
   
2. **Can the same element be part of multiple subsequences?**
   - No, each element can be part of only one subsequence.

3. **What happens if the input array has less than 3 elements?**
   - If the array has less than 3 elements, it is not possible to form a subsequence of at least 3 consecutive integers, so the answer should be false for such inputs.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm with the help of two hash maps:

1. **Frequency Map (`freq`)**: This map keeps track of the remaining frequency of each integer in `nums`.
2. **Hypothetical End Map (`end_map`)**: This map keeps track of subsequences that end at a particular integer value.

**Steps to solve the problem:**
1. Populate the `freq` map with the frequency of each number in `nums`.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums` to check if it can be placed in an existing subsequence or if a new subsequence can be started.
3. For each number:
    - If its frequency is 0, continue to the next number.
    - If an existing subsequence ending at `num-1` can be extended, do so.
    - If a subsequence cannot be extended, check if we can start a new subsequence with `num`, `num+1`, and `num+2`.
    - If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, return `false`.
4. After processing all numbers, if all operations are valid, return `true`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq, end_map;
        
        // Fill the frequency map
        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (freq[num] == 0) {
                continue; // If current number is already used, skip it
            }
            
            // Try to add this number to an existing subsequence ending with num - 1
            if (end_map[num - 1] > 0) {
                end_map[num - 1]--;
                end_map[num]++;
            } 
            // If can't extend a previous subsequence, try to start a new one with num, num + 1, num + 2
            else if (freq[num + 1] > 0 && freq[num + 2] > 0) {
                freq[num + 1]--;
                freq[num + 2]--;
                end_map[num + 2]++;
            } 
            // If neither, return false
            else {
                return false;
            }
            
            // Decrease the frequency of the current number
            freq[num]--;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate through the array a constant number of times, performing constant-time operations at each step through the use of hash maps.
