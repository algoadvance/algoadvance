[Leetcode 1093. Statistics from a Large Sample](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1093)
## Problem Statement

You are given a large sample of integers represented by an integer array `count` where `count[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in the sample. The mode of the sample is the integer that appears most frequently. The median of the sample is calculated as follows:

- If the sample has an odd number of elements, then its median is the middle element of the sorted sample.
- If the sample has an even number of elements, then its median is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted sample.

The mean of the sample is the average of all the elements. The range of the sample is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Return the mode, median, mean, and range of the sample in the following format: `[mean, median, mode, range]`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [3.00000, 3.00000, 3, 4]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the size constraints for the `count` array?
   - The size of the `count` array is fixed at 256 as per the problem constraints.

2. Are there any constraints on the values within the `count` array?
   - Every element of the `count` array is a non-negative integer.

3. What precision will be required for the floating-point results?
   - The floating-point numbers (mean and median) will be accurate to 5 decimal places.

## Strategy

1. **Calculating Mean**:
   - Sum all the values (considering their frequency) and divide by the total number of elements.

2. **Finding Median**:
   - Traverse the array and keep a running total until you reach the midpoint of the total count. Depending on whether the total count is odd or even, find the middle element(s).

3. **Finding Mode**:
   - Track the index with the highest count (frequency).

4. **Calculating Range**:
   - Identify the minimum and maximum indices where the `count` is greater than zero.

## Time Complexity

- **Calculating Mean**: O(256) = O(1) - Constant time due to fixed array size.
- **Calculating Median**: O(256) = O(1)
- **Finding Mode**: O(256) = O(1)
- **Calculating Range**: O(256) = O(1)

Overall: O(1), since operations are constant time given the fixed array size.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cfloat>

std::vector<double> sampleStats(std::vector<int>& count) {
    double mean = 0.0;
    double median = 0.0;
    int mode = 0;
    int range = 0;
    
    int totalCount = 0;
    long long totalSum = 0;
    int maxCount = 0;
    int minVal = -1;
    int maxVal = -1;
    
    // 1. Calculating mean and mode, and identifying min/max values
    for (int i = 0; i < count.size(); ++i) {
        if (count[i] > 0) {
            if (minVal == -1) minVal = i;
            maxVal = i;
            
            totalCount += count[i];
            totalSum += (long long)count[i] * i;
            
            if (count[i] > maxCount) {
                maxCount = count[i];
                mode = i;
            }
        }
    }
    
    mean = (double)totalSum / totalCount;
    range = maxVal - minVal;
    
    // 2. Calculating median
    int mid1 = (totalCount - 1) / 2;
    int mid2 = totalCount / 2;
    int currentCount = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < count.size(); ++i) {
        currentCount += count[i];
        
        if (currentCount > mid1 && median == 0.0) {
            median += i;
        }
        if (currentCount > mid2) {
            median += i;
            median /= 2.0;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return {mean, median, (double)mode, (double)range};
}
```

This code accurately calculates the mean, median, mode, and range of the sample in O(1) time complexity due to the fixed size of the array. The logic ensures that each metric is computed as per the problem requirements.
