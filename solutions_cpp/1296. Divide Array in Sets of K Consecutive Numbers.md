[Leetcode 1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1296)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, your task is to determine whether it's possible to divide the array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers. If possible, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Examples:
1. **Example 1:**
    - Input: `nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6]`, `k = 4`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: The array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].

2. **Example 2:**
    - Input: `nums = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11]`, `k = 3`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: The array can be divided into [1,2,3], [2,3,4], [3,4,5], [9,10,11].

3. **Example 3:**
    - Input: `nums = [3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]`, `k = 3`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: The array cannot be divided into sets of 3 consecutive numbers.

### Note:
1. The frequency of each integer in the array will be in the range [1, 10^4].
2. The length of `nums` will be in the range [1, 10^5].
3. `1 <= k <= len(nums)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in the array always positive?**
   - Yes, integers are always positive.

2. **Can we use sorting as a part of our strategy?**
   - Yes, sorting can be a part of our strategy.

3. **Should we consider the time complexity of the solution?**
   - Yes, ideally we should aim for an efficient solution considering time complexity.

## Strategy
1. **Check Array Length**: The total number of elements in the array must be divisible by `k` for it to be possible to divide the array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers. If `len(nums) % k != 0`, return `false` immediately.
2. **Sort Array**: Sort the `nums` array to handle the smallest numbers first. This helps in ensuring that we can easily form consecutive sequences.
3. **Use a Map for Frequencies**: Use an ordered map (like `map<int, int>`) to store the frequency of each number. This helps in quickly determining the count of each number.
4. **Form Consecutive Groups**: Iterate through the map and try to form consecutive groups starting from the smallest number available. Decrease the frequency count appropriately as you form groups.
5. **Check Frequencies**: If at any point, the frequency of any required number is insufficient to form a group, return `false`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <map>
#include <algorithm>

bool isPossibleDivide(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // If the array length is not divisible by k, return false.
    if (nums.size() % k != 0) return false;

    // Frequency map to store the occurrence of each number.
    std::map<int, int> numCount;
    for (int num : nums) {
        numCount[num]++;
    }

    // Iterate through the sorted map.
    for (auto it = numCount.begin(); it != numCount.end(); ++it) {
        int start = it->first;
        int count = it->second;

        if (count > 0) {
            // Try to form a consecutive subsequence starting from `start`.
            for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
                if (numCount[start + i] < count) {
                    return false;
                }
                // Decrease the frequency.
                numCount[start + i] -= count;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Map Operations**: Inserting all elements into the map takes `O(n log m)`, where `m` is the number of unique elements (which can be considered `O(n)` in the worst case).
- **Total Complexity**: The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step being dominant.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the map and array.
