[Leetcode 506. Relative Ranks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l506)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` represents the score of the i-th athlete. The ranks are assigned as follows:

- The first place gets a gold medal: "Gold Medal".
- The second place gets a silver medal: "Silver Medal".
- The third place gets a bronze medal: "Bronze Medal".
- For the rest athletes, they get their rank number (starting from 4th place).

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the rank of the i-th athlete.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: score = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]

Input: score = [10, 3, 8, 9, 4]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "5", "Bronze Medal", "Silver Medal", "4"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Should the relative ranks be returned as strings?
   **A:** Yes, the ranks should be returned as strings, with the top three being specific labels ("Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal") and the rest as numeric strings.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the input array size?
   **A:** The problem does not specify constraints, but typically for such problems, you can expect `n` to be within the range of \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

3. **Q:** Can scores be repeated?
   **A:** The problem statement does not specify unique scores, so we can assume they can be repeated.

4. **Q:** Is the input array `score` guaranteed to have at least 1 element?
   **A:** Considering standard constraints and examples, yes, the array will have at least one element.

## Strategy

1. Create a vector of pairs, where each pair consists of a score and its original index.
2. Sort the vector of pairs in descending order based on the score values.
3. Traverse the sorted vector and assign appropriate ranks/mendals based on their positions.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the vector of scores will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- Creating and traversing the result will take \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

Here's the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& score) {
    int n = score.size();
    vector<pair<int, int>> score_with_index;
    
    // Store scores with their original indices
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        score_with_index.push_back({score[i], i});
    }
    
    // Sort scores in descending order
    sort(score_with_index.begin(), score_with_index.end(), [](pair<int, int>& a, pair<int, int>& b) {
        return b.first < a.first;
    });
    
    vector<string> result(n);
    
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int index = score_with_index[i].second;
        if (i == 0) {
            result[index] = "Gold Medal";
        } else if (i == 1) {
            result[index] = "Silver Medal";
        } else if (i == 2) {
            result[index] = "Bronze Medal";
        } else {
            result[index] = to_string(i + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

This solution leverages sorting and indexing to ensure the relative ranks are assigned accurately and efficiently.
