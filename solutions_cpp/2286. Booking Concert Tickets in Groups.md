[Leetcode 2286. Booking Concert Tickets in Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2286)
## Problem Statement
You have a concert ticketing system where you manage the bookings for a concert hall. The concert hall has `n` rows of seats, and each row has a certain number of seats. You need to implement the following functionalities:

1. Book seats for a group in the same row if possible.
2. Find rows that have at least a certain number of consecutive free seats.

The exact operations and their expected behavior are defined below:

- `bool gather(int k, int maxRow)`: Tries to book `k` consecutive seats in any single row from row `0` to `maxRow` (inclusive). Returns `true` if the booking is successful, otherwise returns `false`.
- `int[] scatter(int k, int maxRow)`: Tries to book `k` seats across rows from `0` to `maxRow` (inclusive), but seats do not have to be consecutive within a single row. If the booking is successful, returns an array containing the row counts where seats are booked. If not successful, returns an empty array.

Your task is to design the `BookMyShow` class to perform these operations.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Initialization Details**: How do we initialize the system? Specifically, how do we provide rows and seats per row information?
2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `n`, the number of rows, and the number of seats per row?
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What happens if `k` is larger than the total number of seats available in the specified rows?
   - Can `k` be zero? What should we return in that case?

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a 2D array or vector of vectors to represent the seating arrangement.
   - Maintain an array of integers representing the number of available seats in each row.

2. **Implementation of `gather`**:
   - Iterate through rows from `0` to `maxRow`.
   - For each row, check if there are `k` consecutive seats available.
   - If found, mark these seats as booked and return `true`.
   - If not found after reaching `maxRow`, return `false`.

3. **Implementation of `scatter`**:
   - Keep a count of seats to book.
   - Iterate through rows from `0` to `maxRow`.
   - For each row, book as many seats as possible until `k` seats are booked.
   - If successfully book `k` seats across rows, return the array with counts.
   - If not possible, return an empty array.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - Handle cases where `k` is zero by returning appropriate values.

## Code

Here is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class BookMyShow {
private:
    int n;
    vector<int> seatsPerRow;
    vector<int> availableSeats;

public:
    BookMyShow(int n, int m) {
        this->n = n;
        seatsPerRow.assign(n, m);
        availableSeats.assign(n, m);
    }

    bool gather(int k, int maxRow) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= maxRow && i < n; ++i) {
            if (availableSeats[i] >= k) {
                // Check for consecutive seats
                int start = -1;
                for (int j = 0; j <= seatsPerRow[i] - k; ++j) {
                    bool allFree = true;
                    for (int l = j; l < j + k; ++l) {
                        if (seatsPerRow[i] - availableSeats[i] + l < seatsPerRow[i]) {
                            continue;
                        }
                        allFree = false;
                        break;
                    }
                    if (allFree) {
                        start = j;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (start != -1) {
                    availableSeats[i] -= k;
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    vector<int> scatter(int k, int maxRow) {
        int remaining = k;
        vector<int> result;

        for (int i = 0; i <= maxRow && i < n; ++i) {
            int bookableSeats = min(remaining, availableSeats[i]);
            remaining -= bookableSeats;
            availableSeats[i] -= bookableSeats;
            if (bookableSeats > 0) {
                result.push_back(bookableSeats);
            }

            if (remaining == 0) {
                return result;
            }
        }
        
        // If we can't book all required seats
        return {};
    }
};

```

## Time Complexity
- `gather(int k, int maxRow)`: **O(n * m)** where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the seats per row. This considers the worst-case scenario where every seat must be checked.
- `scatter(int k, int maxRow)`: **O(n)** where `n` is the number of rows. This is because each row is checked and booked until the required seats are booked.

Please note depending on the actual constraints from LeetCode, performance optimizations might be necessary.
