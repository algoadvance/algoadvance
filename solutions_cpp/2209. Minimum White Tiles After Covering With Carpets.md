[Leetcode 2209. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2209)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a string `floor` representing a floor with '0' and '1', where '0' represents a black tile and '1' represents a white tile. You are also given an integer `numCarpets` and `carpetLen`. You have `numCarpets` carpets, each of length `carpetLen`, and you must place them onto the floor to minimize the number of white tiles remaining visible. 

Return the minimum number of white tiles remaining visible after covering the floor optimally with the carpets.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can carpets overlap each other?**
   - Yes, carpets can be placed on top of each other.
2. **Are the carpets placed contiguously on the floor?**
   - Yes, each carpet will cover a contiguous segment of the floor.
3. **Is there any constraint on the length of the floor or the number of carpets?**
   - The typical limit for length (`n`) is `10^4`, and typical constraint for `numCarpets` is within what can reasonably fit those lengths.

### Strategy:
This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Let's define the state `dp[i][j]` as the minimum number of white tiles visible from the first `i` tiles using `j` carpets.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - If there are no carpets, the number of white tiles visible from the first `i` tiles is simply the count of '1's in those tiles.

2. **DP Transition**:
   We have two choices for each tile position:
   - Not placing a carpet at position `i` which means `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (1 if floor[i-1] == '1' else 0)`.
   - Placing a carpet ending at position `i`, which means `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-carpetLen][j-1])`.
   - The final DP relationship will be built by choosing the minimum across these choices.

### Code:
Here's the C++ implementation of the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

int minimumWhiteTiles(string floor, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
    int n = floor.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(numCarpets + 1, 0));
    vector<int> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);

    // Calculate prefix sum of white tiles
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + (floor[i - 1] == '1');
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= numCarpets; ++j) {
            if (j == 0) {
                dp[i][j] = prefixSum[i]; // if no carpets are used, all white tiles up to i are visible
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + (floor[i - 1] == '1'); // without using a new carpet

                if (i >= carpetLen) {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i - carpetLen][j - 1]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], 0);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][numCarpets];
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times numCarpets)\)
  - The DP table has dimensions `n x numCarpets`, and filling each entry takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \times numCarpets)\)
  - The DP table uses this much space.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of visible white tiles using dynamic programming, balancing between using carpets and not using them at each position.
