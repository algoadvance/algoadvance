[Leetcode 3093. Longest Common Suffix Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3093)
# Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, and an array of queries `[[i1, j1], [i2, j2], ...]`. Each query `[i, j]` requires you to determine the length of the longest common suffix of the substrings `word1[0:i]` and `word2[0:j]`.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size and Constraint**: What is the maximum length for `word1` and `word2`, and how many queries can there be?
2. **Characters in Words**: Can the strings contain any character or just lowercase/uppercase alphabets?

# Strategy

1. **Suffix Array**: Instead of using suffix arrays (which might be overkill), we can directly compute the longest common suffix for each query.
2. **Suffix Comparison**: For each query, extract the substrings up to the given indices and then compare from the end towards the beginning to find the longest common suffix.
3. **Efficiency**: Given `Q` queries, each will be linear with respect to the length of the substrings specified, ensuring we have an efficient solution.

# Time Complexity

- For each query, the worst case is iterating through the length of the substrings (`min(i, j)` where `i`, `j` are indices from queries).
- If `L` is the maximum length of the words and `Q` is the number of queries, the time complexity is `O(Q * L)`.

# Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> longestCommonSuffixQueries(const std::string& word1, const std::string& word2, const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& queries) {
    std::vector<int> results;
    for (const auto& query : queries) {
        int i = query.first;
        int j = query.second;

        // Get the relevant substrings
        std::string substr1 = word1.substr(0, i);
        std::string substr2 = word2.substr(0, j);

        // Find the longest common suffix
        int length = 0;
        int p1 = substr1.size() - 1;
        int p2 = substr2.size() - 1;
        while (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0 && substr1[p1] == substr2[p2]) {
            length++;
            p1--;
            p2--;
        }
        results.push_back(length);
    }
    return results;
}

int main() {
    std::string word1 = "backtrack";
    std::string word2 = "hijack";
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> queries = \{\{5, 3}, {9, 7}, {5, 2}};

    std::vector<int> results = longestCommonSuffixQueries(word1, word2, queries);
    for (int result : results) {
        std::cout << result << std::endl;  // Outputs: 0, 3, 0
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this code:

1. We iterate over each query, extracting the specified substrings.
2. We then compare the two substrings from the end to find the longest common suffix.
3. We store the results in a vector and print them.
