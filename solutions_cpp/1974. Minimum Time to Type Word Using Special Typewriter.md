[Leetcode 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1974)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode problem 1974: "Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter"

There is a special typewriter with a single row of 26 lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'. Initially, the pointer is at the letter 'a'. The typewriter has two special functions:

1. Move the pointer to the right or left by one slot.
2. Type the character it is currently at.

Given a string `word`, return the minimum time to type the entire string. The time to move one slot to the left or right is 1, and the time to type a character is also 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should we consider both lowercase and uppercase letters?
   - No, only lowercase letters are involved in this problem.
   
2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of `word`?
   - `1 <= word.length <= 100`.

3. **Allowed Operations**: Can we move the pointer in both directions and how are the movements counted?
   - Yes, we can move the pointer both left and right. The time for each movement is counted as 1.

### Strategy

- Start from the initial position 'a'.
- For each character in `word`, calculate the shortest distance the pointer must move to reach the target character.
- We can move clockwise or counterclockwise, so we should take the minimum of these two distances.
- Sum up all the move times and add the time taken to type each character (which is equal to the length of the word since each character typing takes 1 unit of time).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int minTimeToType(std::string word) {
    int totalTime = 0;
    char currentPos = 'a';

    for (char c : word) {
        int clockwiseDist = abs(c - currentPos);
        int counterClockwiseDist = 26 - clockwiseDist;
        totalTime += std::min(clockwiseDist, counterClockwiseDist) + 1;
        currentPos = c;
    }

    return totalTime;
}

int main() {
    std::string word = "cba";
    std::cout << "Minimum time to type word \"" << word << "\": " << minTimeToType(word) << " units." << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the word. We iterate through each character in the word exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum time required to type the given word using a single-row typewriter by evaluating both clockwise and counterclockwise distances and selecting the minimum at each step.
