[Leetcode 1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1672)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the i-th customer has in the j-th bank account. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the sum of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Example 1:
```
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
- 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
- 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 5 = 6
- 2nd customer has wealth = 7 + 3 = 10
- 3rd customer has wealth = 3 + 5 = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum size of the `accounts` array?
    - The size constraints are not specified here, but typically for LeetCode problems, let's assume a manageable size for computations within a typical online judge.

2. Can there be negative values in the `accounts` array?
    - The problem does not specify the presence of negative values, so we will assume all values are non-negative.

3. Should the solution handle empty subarrays?
    - We assume that the input will always contain proper subarrays with at least one integer.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a variable `max_wealth` to keep track of the maximum wealth found.
2. Iterate over each customer in the `accounts` array.
3. For each customer, calculate their total wealth by summing the values in their subarray.
4. Update `max_wealth` if the current customer's wealth is greater than the previously found maximum wealth.
5. Return the `max_wealth` after iterating through all customers.

## Code

We will implement the strategy in C++ as follows:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumWealth(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int max_wealth = 0;
        
        for (const auto& customer : accounts) {
            int current_wealth = 0;
            for (int money : customer) {
                current_wealth += money;
            }
            max_wealth = std::max(max_wealth, current_wealth);
        }
        
        return max_wealth;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of customers and `n` is the number of bank accounts per customer. This is because we need to iterate through each element in the `accounts` grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used. Only a constant amount of extra space is required for variables like `max_wealth` and `current_wealth`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum wealth with optimal space and time complexities.
