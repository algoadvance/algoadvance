[Leetcode 2290. Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2290)
## Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` grid with each cell containing either a `0` or `1`, representing either an empty cell or an obstacle, respectively. You are initially positioned at the top-left corner (0, 0) and want to reach the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1). In this problem, you can move up, down, left, or right. Your goal is to find the minimum number of obstacles you need to remove to be able to reach the bottom-right corner.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Bounds**: What are the typical values for `m` and `n`?
2. **Edges**: What should we assume if the grid is already such that it's impossible to reach the destination (e.g., surrounded by obstacles)?
3. **Initial State**: Is there any obstacle at (0, 0) or (m-1, n-1)?

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

int minObstacleRemoval(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    vector<vector<int>> dist(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    deque<pair<int, int>> dq;
    
    // Position and cost of removal
    dq.emplace_back(0, 0);
    dist[0][0] = (grid[0][0] == 1) ? 1 : 0;
    
    // 4 possible movements: right, down, left, up
    vector<pair<int, int>> directions\{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    while (!dq.empty()) {
        int x, y;
        tie(x, y) = dq.front();
        dq.pop_front();
        
        for (auto& dir : directions) {
            int dx = dir.first, dy = dir.second;
            int nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
            
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                int newCost = dist[x][y] + grid[nx][ny];
                if (newCost < dist[nx][ny]) {
                    dist[nx][ny] = newCost;
                    if (grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                        dq.emplace_back(nx, ny);
                    } else {
                        dq.emplace_front(nx, ny);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dist[m-1][n-1];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = \{\{0, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0}};
    cout << "Minimum obstacles removed: " << minObstacleRemoval(grid) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Grid Representation and Distance Initialization**:
   - The grid represents our map where `0` is passable and `1` is an obstacle.
   - We use a `dist` matrix to keep track of the minimum number of obstacles removed to reach each cell.
   - Initialize a deque as a double-ended queue to implement a bidirectional BFS/0-1 BFS because consistent with BFS, it provides the shortest path by removing minimum obstacles instead of a single-ended priority queue.

2. **Bidirectional BFS/0-1 BFS**:
   - Process each cell, where moving to an obstacle increments the obstacle removal count.
   - Prefer moves that don't increase the count by adding such moves to the front of the deque, while moves that do increase the count go to the back.

3. **Direction and Movement**:
   - Define all possible movements (up, down, left, and right) and iterate through possible destinations.

4. **Deque Usage**:
   - If moving to a cell doesn't incur any obstacle removal (`grid[nx][ny] == 0`), push the new position to the front. Otherwise, push it to the back.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- Each cell can be processed and revisited in a `0-1 BFS` manner in linear time relative to the number of cells in the grid.
