[Leetcode 1017. Convert to Base ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1017)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return a string representation of its (base -2) negabinary representation. The returned string must have no leading zeroes unless the string is "0".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input:** What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - Generally, in LeetCode problems, the input is constrained by the limits of a 32-bit signed integer, so `n` would be in the range of `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.

2. **Output:** Is the output expected to be in lowercase or is it case-insensitive?
   - The output for such problems is typically a string of digits, so case sensitivity is not a concern.

3. **Edge Case Handling:** How should zero be handled?
   - Based on problem constraints, if `n = 0`, the output should be `"0"`.

## Strategy
1. **Conversion Algorithm:**
   - We will use repeated division and modulus operation, as we do in base 10 to base 2 conversion.
   - Instead of base 2, we use base -2.
   - When performing division by -2, if the remainder is negative, adjust the quotient and the remainder to ensure both remain non-negative.

2. **Process:**
   - While `n` is not zero:
     - Compute `remainder = n % (-2)`.
     - If `remainder < 0`:
       - Adjust `remainder` and increase `n` by dividing `n` by -2.
     - Append the `remainder` to the result string.
     - Divide `n` by -2 and continue the process.
   - Reverse the result string to get the correct negabinary representation.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is O(log|n|) as in each step we divide `n` by -2, reducing the problem size logarithmically.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    std::string baseNeg2(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return "0";
        
        std::string result;
        while (n != 0) {
            int remainder = n % (-2);
            n /= -2;
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += 2;
                n += 1;
            }
            result.push_back('0' + remainder);
        }
        
        std::reverse(result.begin(), result.end());
        return result;
    }
};

// Example usage:
int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::cout << sol.baseNeg2(2) << std::endl; // should output "110"
    std::cout << sol.baseNeg2(3) << std::endl; // should output "111"
    std::cout << sol.baseNeg2(4) << std::endl; // should output "100"
    return 0;
}
```

In this code:
- We handle the conversion within a loop.
- Adjusting the remainder and quotient as needed ensures we get correct digits for the -2 base.
- Finally, the resulting string is reversed to give the correct representation.
