[Leetcode 2607. Make K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2607)
### Problem Statement

You are given a circular array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. The circular array means the elements at the end of the array wrap around to the beginning. Your goal is to make the sum of every k-length subarray in the circular array equal.

To achieve this, you can update any elements in `nums`. You need to perform these updates such that the sum of every k-length subarray is the same and minimize the total number of changes made to the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the values of `k`?**
   - Should `k` be a divisor of `n` or can it take any value between `1` and `n`?

2. **What are the ranges for the input values in `nums`?**
   - This helps in understanding the constraints on the possible values in the array.

3. **Do operations have any specific cost or limitations?**
   - Is there any constraint on the number of operations or the maximum value that any element can have after modification?

### Strategy

1. **Understand the periodicity of the circular array with respect to k:**
   - Since the array is circular, modifying the sum of any k-length subarray affects the sum of other k-length subarrays.

2. **Compute the required sum for each k-length subarray:**
   - The target sum for each k-length subarray should be the same.

3. **Identify patterns and perform minimal changes:**
   - Since modifying one element affects all overlapping subarrays which include this element, we can iteratively balance all k-length subarrays by adjusting their elements systematically.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    int makeSubKSumEqual(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        std::vector<int> targetSums(k);
        
        // Calculate the sums for each block of k elements
        // The sum of block i, where i = 0 to k-1 is calculated
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            targetSums[i % k] += nums[i];
        }
        
        // Find the average sum for these blocks
        int avgSum = std::accumulate(targetSums.begin(), targetSums.end(), 0) / k;

        // We want every targetSum[i] to be avgSum, so we can compute the minimal changes needed
        int changes = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            changes += std::abs(targetSums[i] - avgSum);
        }

        // Each adjustment will be counted twice, once from increment and once from decrement hence we divide by 2
        return changes / 2;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n + k):**
  - Calculating the target sums will take O(n) since we traverse the circular array once.
  - Calculating changes to match target sums (which involves summing the target sums and averaging) will take O(k).
  - Overall, the time complexity is O(n + k), which should be manageable given the constraints.

### Explanation

1. **Target Sums Calculation:** We use modular arithmetic to compute sums of k-length subarrays in the circular array, breaking the array into k segments.
2. **Adjustment Calculation:** We compute the average target sum that we want for each of these segments and calculate the cost to equalize all k-length subarrays.
3. **Adjustment Counting:** Adjustments are divided by 2 as each change affects multiple k-length subarrays.

This implementation should help in uniformly distributing the sum among all k-length subarrays while minimizing the changes needed to the array.
