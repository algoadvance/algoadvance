[Leetcode 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l380)
## Problem Statement

Your task is to design a data structure that supports all the following operations in average **O(1)** time complexity.

1. `insert(val)`: Inserts an item `val` into the set if not present.
2. `remove(val)`: Removes an item `val` from the set if present.
3. `getRandom()`: Returns a random element from the current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

Implement the `RandomizedSet` class:

- `bool insert(int val)` - Inserts the item `val` if it is not present. Returns true if the item was not present and false otherwise.
- `bool remove(int val)` - Removes the item `val` if it is present. Returns true if the item was present and false otherwise.
- `int getRandom()` - Returns a random element from the current set of elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the set unique?**
   - Yes, the values are unique.
   
2. **Is there any restriction on the range of input values?**
   - The problem statement does not specify restrictions; we can assume typical integer ranges.

3. **Should the set allow duplicate elements?**
   - No, the set should only contain unique elements.

4. **What should happen if `getRandom()` is called on an empty set?**
   - Assuming it will not be called on an empty set based on typical problem constraints, or we can handle it with an assertion or exception if necessary.

## Strategy

To achieve O(1) time complexity for all operations, we can use a combination of a **hashmap** (`unordered_map`) and a **dynamic array** (`vector`):

1. **HashMap (unordered_map):**
   - Store the element as the key, and its index in the vector as the value.

2. **Vector:**
   - Store all elements to facilitate O(1) access to a random element via `getRandom`.

### Inserting an Element
- Check if the element exists in the hashmap; if not, insert it into the vector.
- Add the element and its index to the hashmap.

### Removing an Element
- Check if the element exists in the hashmap.
- If it does, swap the element with the last element in the vector and then remove the last element to achieve O(1) deletion.
- Update the hashmap with the new index of the swapped element and erase the entry of the removed element.

### Getting a Random Element
- Simply use the C++ standard library's `rand()` function along with the size of the vector.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <cstdlib>

class RandomizedSet {
private:
    std::vector<int> nums;
    std::unordered_map<int, int> positions;
    
public:
    RandomizedSet() {
    }
    
    bool insert(int val) {
        if (positions.find(val) != positions.end()) return false;
        nums.push_back(val);
        positions[val] = nums.size() - 1;
        return true;
    }
    
    bool remove(int val) {
        if (positions.find(val) == positions.end()) return false;
        int lastElement = nums.back();
        int idx = positions[val];
        nums[idx] = lastElement;
        positions[lastElement] = idx;
        nums.pop_back();
        positions.erase(val);
        return true;
    }
    
    int getRandom() {
        int randomIdx = rand() % nums.size();
        return nums[randomIdx];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insert Operation**: Average O(1) - Hashmap insert is O(1) in average case.
- **Remove Operation**: Average O(1) - Dynamic array allows removal in O(1) when combined with hashmap updates.
- **GetRandom Operation**: O(1) - Accessing a random element from a vector using an index is O(1).

This data structure effectively combines both a hashmap and a vector to ensure that all operations meet the required average O(1) time complexity.
