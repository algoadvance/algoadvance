[Leetcode 2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2180)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `num`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `num` whose digit sums are even.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `num` be zero?
   - **A**: No, `num` is a positive integer.
2. **Q**: Should the numbers be inclusive of `num`?
   - **A**: Yes, we need to consider integers from 1 to `num` inclusive.
3. **Q**: What would be a large value for `num`?
   - **A**: The value of `num` is within the constraints as specified in the problem, typically meaning it can be up to \(10^6\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to count how many integers between 1 and `num` have an even digit sum. We will do the following:

1. Iterate from 1 to `num`.
2. For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits.
3. Check if the sum is even.
4. Increment a counter if the digit sum is even.
5. Return the counter at the end.

We'll need a helper function to compute the sum of digits of a number. Our main function can then use this helper function to determine if the digit sum is even and keep track of the count of such integers.

### Code

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int countEven(int num) {
        int evenCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            if (isEvenDigitSum(i)) {
                ++evenCount;
            }
        }
        return evenCount;
    }

private:
    bool isEvenDigitSum(int number) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (number > 0) {
            sum += number % 10;
            number /= 10;
        }
        return sum % 2 == 0;
    }
};

// Example usage:
// int main() {
//     Solution sol;
//     int num = 30;
//     std::cout << "Count of integers with even digit sum up to " << num << " is: " << sol.countEven(num) << std::endl;
//     return 0;
// }
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\):

- We iterate over numbers from 1 to `num`, which takes \(O(n)\).
- For each number, we compute the sum of its digits, which takes \(O(\log n)\) because the number has at most \(\log_{10}(n)\) digits.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). This solution is efficient enough for the typical constraint \(1 \leq num \leq 10^6\).
