[Leetcode 1646. Get Maximum in Generated Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1646)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, you need to create an array named `nums` where `nums[0] = 0` and `nums[1] = 1`. For each subsequent index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n`), the value of `nums[i]` is defined as follows:
- If `i` is even, `nums[i] = nums[i / 2]`
- If `i` is odd, `nums[i] = nums[i // 2] + nums[(i // 2) + 1]`

The task is to return the maximum integer in the array `nums` generated based on the rules mentioned above.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned if `n` is 0? 
   - Per the problem, `nums[0] = 0`, so the maximum value is `0`.
2. What is the upper limit of `n`?
   - Typically, the constraints are provided, for example, `0 <= n <= 100`. We'll assume the typical constraints unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy

1. Create an array `nums` of size `n+1`.
2. Initialize the first two elements: `nums[0] = 0` and `nums[1] = 1`.
3. Iterate from 2 through `n` and fill the array based on whether the index is even or odd:
   - If `i` is even, set `nums[i] = nums[i / 2]`.
   - If `i` is odd, set `nums[i] = nums[i // 2] + nums[(i // 2) + 1]`.
4. Track the maximum value while generating the array.
5. Return the maximum value found.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, since we only need to iterate through the array once to generate it and find the maximum value. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage required for the `nums` array.

### Code

Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>  // for std::max

class Solution {
public:
    int getMaximumGenerated(int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return 0;
        if (n == 1)
            return 1;
        
        std::vector<int> nums(n + 1);
        nums[0] = 0;
        nums[1] = 1;
        int maxVal = 1;  // since nums[1] is maximum at the start
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                nums[i] = nums[i / 2];
            } else {
                nums[i] = nums[i / 2] + nums[i / 2 + 1];
            }
            maxVal = std::max(maxVal, nums[i]);
        }
        
        return maxVal;
    }
};
```

This solution follows the problem constraints and efficiently computes the desired result using a simple iterative approach.
