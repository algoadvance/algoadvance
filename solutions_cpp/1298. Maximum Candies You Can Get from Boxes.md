[Leetcode 1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1298)
## Problem Statement:
You have `n` boxes in front of you, labeled from 0 to `n - 1`. Each box `i` has some candies `candies[i]` (you can take all candies from this box `i`), and might need a key `keys[i]` to open it. Additionally, each box `i` might contain some other boxes `containedBoxes[i]` (you can take all boxes in `containedBoxes[i]` and use them later to open more boxes).

You start with `initialBoxes` that you can open without any keys. Return the maximum number of candies you can collect.

## Input:
1. `candies`: Array of integers where `candies[i]` is the number of candies in the `i-th` box.
2. `keys`: Array of arrays where `keys[i]` is the array of keys in the `i-th` box.
3. `containedBoxes`: Array of arrays where `containedBoxes[i]` is the array of boxes in the `i-th` box.
4. `initialBoxes`: Array of integers which are initially accessible to open.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the same key open multiple boxes? 
   - Yes, a key can be used multiple times.
2. Can the boxes contain duplicate keys?
   - Yes, boxes can contain duplicate keys.
3. Are there any constraints on the values of `candies`?
   - The values of `candies` will be non-negative integers.

## Strategy:
- Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to manage the boxes you can open.
- Start with the `initialBoxes` and initialize collections to track:
  - `availableCandies`: Total number of candies collected.
  - `availableKeys`: Set of keys you currently have.
  - `availableBoxes`: Set of boxes that can be opened because you have keys for them or they're directly accessible.
  - `queue`: To manage the BFS process.
- For each box in the queue:
  1. Collect its candies.
  2. Add its keys to `availableKeys`.
  3. Add its contained boxes to `availableBoxes`.
  4. Add any newly accessible boxes to the queue.
- Continue until there are no more accessible boxes to process.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity will be `O(n + m)` where `n` is the number of boxes and `m` is the total number of the contained boxes and keys.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxCandies(vector<int>& candies, vector<vector<int>>& keys, vector<vector<int>>& containedBoxes, vector<int>& initialBoxes) {
        unordered_set<int> availableKeys;
        unordered_set<int> availableBoxes;
        unordered_set<int> processedBoxes;
        queue<int> queue;

        for (int box : initialBoxes) {
            availableBoxes.insert(box);
            queue.push(box);
        }

        int availableCandies = 0;
        
        while (!queue.empty()) {
            int currentBox = queue.front();
            queue.pop();
            if (processedBoxes.find(currentBox) != processedBoxes.end()) {
                continue;
            }
            processedBoxes.insert(currentBox);
            availableCandies += candies[currentBox];
            
            for (int key : keys[currentBox]) {
                if (availableKeys.find(key) == availableKeys.end()) {
                    availableKeys.insert(key);
                }
            }

            for (int newBox : containedBoxes[currentBox]) {
                if (availableKeys.find(newBox) != availableKeys.end() || availableBoxes.find(newBox) != availableBoxes.end()) {
                    availableBoxes.insert(newBox);
                    queue.push(newBox);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return availableCandies;
    }
};
```

- **Explanation:**
  1. **Initialization**: Copies `initialBoxes` to the `queue` and `availableBoxes`.
  2. **BFS Iteration**:
     - Pops a box from the queue.
     - Skips if already processed.
     - Collects candies from the current box.
     - Adds contained keys to the `availableKeys`.
     - Adds contained boxes to `availableBoxes` and pushes them to the queue if they can be opened.
  3. **Termination**: Ends when no more boxes are available to process.
