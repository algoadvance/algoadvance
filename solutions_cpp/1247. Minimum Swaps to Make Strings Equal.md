[Leetcode 1247. Minimum Swaps to Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1247)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length consisting of characters `'x'` and `'y'`, you are allowed to swap any two characters that belong to different strings. Your goal is to make both strings equal using the minimum number of swaps.

## Example:
```
Input: s1 = "xx", s2 = "yy"
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the first character of s1 with the first character of s2 to make the strings equal.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints?**
   - Both `s1` and `s2` have the same length and contain only characters `'x'` and `'y'`.
   - The length of strings can be assumed to be reasonable for typical competitive programming constraints (length <= 1000).

2. **What should be returned in case equating them is impossible?**
   - The problem guarantees that both strings can be made equal.

3. **Case Sensitivity?**
   - No; both strings strictly contain lowercase `'x'` and `'y'`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSwap(string s1, string s2) {
        // If the total number of 'x' and 'y' in both strings combined is odd, return -1 
        // since it would be impossible to make them equal.
        int x1 = 0, y1 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.size(); ++i) {
            if (s1[i] != s2[i]) {
                if (s1[i] == 'x') {
                    x1++;
                } else {
                    y1++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If the combined count of misaligned 'x' and 'y' are odd, then it is impossible
        // to make the strings equal by any number of swaps
        if ((x1 + y1) % 2 != 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Each pair of 'x' and 'y' mismatches can be solved with a single swap
        // `x1 / 2` swaps for (x, x)
        // `y1 / 2` swaps for (y, y)
        // Additionally, 2 swaps for any remaining single x and y
        return x1 / 2 + y1 / 2 + (x1 % 2) * 2;
    }
};

int main(){
    Solution sol;
    string s1 = "xx";
    string s2 = "yy";
    cout << sol.minimumSwap(s1, s2) << endl; // Output: 1
    return 0;
}
```

## Strategy

1. Traverse both strings and calculate how many mismatched positions have 'x' in `s1` and 'y' in `s2` (x1), and how many have 'y' in `s1` and 'x' in `s2` (y1).
2. If the sum of x1 and y1 is odd, return `-1` since it is impossible to balance two strings with an odd number of characters.
3. Calculate the swaps needed:
   - For each pair of mismatched 'x' and 'y' (`x1/2` or `y1/2`), one swap is sufficient.
   - If there is one remaining mismatched x and y (both `x1%2` and `y1%2`), two more swaps are needed to fix the last pair (since one swap inside the pair and another swap with elements of the opposite).

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution involves traversing the strings once, which is O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for counting mismatched characters.
