[Leetcode 2380. Time Needed to Rearrange a Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2380)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` (a string containing only '0's and '1's). In one operation, you can swap two adjacent characters if one is '0' and the other is '1'. You need to find the minimum number of operations required to make all the '1's become consecutive in `s`.

**Example:**

- Input: `s = "0110101"`
- Output: `3`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string be empty?**
   - No, the string will have at least one character.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   - You can assume the length of the string can be up to \(10^5\) characters.
   
3. **Can there be only '0's or '1's in the string?**
   - Yes, if the string consists of only '0's or only '1's, it should be considered already sorted, and no operations are needed.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Our goal is to make all '1's consecutive with the minimum swaps.
2. **Simulate the Process:** Realize that each '1' should only move through '0's to reach the position where they should be consecutive.
3. **Count Needed Operations:**
   - Iterate through the string and calculate how many '0's each '1' needs to jump over until all '1's are together.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int minSwapsToMakeConsecutive(string s) {
    int zeroCount = 0;
    int swapCount = 0;
    
    for (char c : s) {
        if (c == '0') {
            zeroCount++;
        } else if (c == '1') {
            swapCount += zeroCount;
        }
    }
    
    return swapCount;
}

int main() {
    string s = "0110101";
    cout << minSwapsToMakeConsecutive(s) << endl; // Output: 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string. We only need a single traversal to count the required operations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since we only use a few variables for counting and do not use additional space proportional to the input size.
