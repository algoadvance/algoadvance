[Leetcode 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l209)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`. Return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray `[nums[l], nums[l+1], ..., nums[r-1], nums[r]]` of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

### Example
- Input: `target = 7`, `nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** Are all elements in the array positive integers?
  - **A:** Yes, all elements in `nums` are positive integers.
  
- **Q:** Can `nums` contain zero elements?
  - **A:** Yes, `nums` can be empty, in which case the answer should be 0.

- **Q:** Is there a guaranteed solution to the problem with the given constraints?
  - **A:** No, itâ€™s possible that no subarray meets the target sum, in which case you should return 0.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window.
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to include more elements and calculate the running sum.
   - Once the sum is equal to or greater than `target`, record the length of the subarray.
   - Move the `left` pointer to see if we can find a smaller subarray that still meets the sum requirement.
   - Track the minimum length encountered.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize `minLength` to a large value to store the minimum subarray length found.
2. Use `left` pointer starting at 0, and iterate with `right` pointer through the array.
3. Add `nums[right]` to the running sum.
4. While the running sum is greater than or equal to `target`:
   - Update `minLength` with the smaller value between `minLength` and the current window size (`right - left + 1`).
   - Subtract `nums[left]` from the running sum and increment `left` pointer.
5. If `minLength` is unchanged (meaning no valid subarray was found), return 0.
6. Return `minLength`.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int minSubArrayLen(int target, std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int minLength = INT_MAX;
    int left = 0, sum = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
        sum += nums[right];
        while (sum >= target) {
            minLength = std::min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            sum -= nums[left++];
        }
    }

    return (minLength == INT_MAX) ? 0 : minLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- Both `left` and `right` pointers traverse the array at most once, resulting in a linear pass through the array.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as it uses only a constant amount of extra space.
