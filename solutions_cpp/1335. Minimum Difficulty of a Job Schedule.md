[Leetcode 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1335)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The array consists of `n` integers where `jobDifficulty[i]` indicates the difficulty of the `i-th` job. You want to split this job schedule into `d` days where each day should have at least one job and the difficulty of a schedule is the sum of the hardest job on each day. The task is to minimize the difficulty of the job schedule. If you can't find a way to split the jobs into `d` days, return -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, via difficulties 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2. 
The hardest job out of these is 6. 
Second day you can finish the last job, which is 1. 
The hardest job out of these is 1. 
Thus the schedule's difficulty is 6 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If we have more days than jobs, it is impossible.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule's difficulty is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can a job appear in more than one day?
   - No, each job can only be scheduled once and must be completed on exactly one day.

2. What is the range of the input sizes?
   - The length of the `jobDifficulty` array (`n`) can be up to 300, and `d` can be up to 10.

3. What should we return if given inputs where it is not possible to schedule the jobs within the given days (`d`)?
   - Return `-1` if it is not possible to schedule the jobs within the given days.

### Strategy
This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP). We'll define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum difficulty of scheduling the first `i` jobs in `j` days. The transition will involve choosing a segment of the jobs for the last day, and then combining the hardest job from that last day with the DP result for the previous days.

1. **Base Case:** If `d > n`, immediately return `-1` because we can't have more days than jobs.
2. **Recurrence Relation:** For a given `i` and `j`, iterate over possible positions `k` where the k-th job is the first job of the last day. The difficulty of the last segment is from `jobDifficulty[k]` to `jobDifficulty[i-1]`.
   ```
   dp[i][j] = min(dp[k][j-1] + max(jobDifficulty[k:i-1])) for k in range(j-1, i)
   ```

### Code
Here is the implemented solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minDifficulty(vector<int>& jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.size();
        if (d > n) return -1;

        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(d + 1, INT_MAX));
        dp[0][0] = 0;

        for (int days = 1; days <= d; ++days) {
            for (int job = days; job <= n; ++job) {
                int maxDifficulty = 0;
                for (int k = job; k >= days; --k) {
                    maxDifficulty = max(maxDifficulty, jobDifficulty[k - 1]);
                    dp[job][days] = min(dp[job][days], dp[k - 1][days - 1] + maxDifficulty);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][d];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2 * d)`:
- 2 nested loops for days and jobs, i.e., `O(n * d)`.
- An inner loop iterating up to `n` times, i.e., `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n^2 * d)`, which is efficient given the constraints (`n` up to 300 and `d` up to 10).
