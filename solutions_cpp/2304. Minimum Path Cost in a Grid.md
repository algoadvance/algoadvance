[Leetcode 2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2304)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D grid of integers with `m` rows and `n` columns, and a 2D cost matrix of integers with the same dimensions. The cost matrix represents the cost of moving from one cell to another in the grid. You can move to the cell directly below or directly to the right of your current position.

You need to find the minimum path cost from the top-left cell (0,0) to the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1).

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the grid and cost matrix will always have the same dimensions?
2. Are negative values allowed in the grid or cost matrix?
3. Should we consider diagonal moves or only right and down?

#### Assumptions:
- We will assume that the grid and cost matrix have non-negative integers for simplicity.
- We will assume only down and right movements are allowed.
- The dimensions of the grid and cost matrix are always the same.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem by using a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach. The main idea is to build a 2D array, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` stores the minimum path cost to reach cell `(i, j)` from the top-left cell `(0, 0)`.

1. **Initialize** the `dp` array where `dp[0][0]` is the cost of the starting position.
2. **Update** the first row and the first column based on the initial conditions because there are no alternatives for these cells.
3. **Populate** the rest of the `dp` table:
    - The cost to reach each cell `(i, j)` will be the minimum of coming from the left cell or from the top cell plus the cost associated with the current cell `(i, j)`.
  
### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int minPathCost(vector<vector<int>>& grid, vector<vector<int>>& cost) {
    int m = grid.size();
    int n = grid[0].size();
    
    // DP table to store the minimum cost to reach each cell
    vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));

    // Initialize the DP table with the starting point
    dp[0][0] = cost[0][0];

    // Fill the first row
    for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + cost[0][j];
    }

    // Fill the first column
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + cost[i][0];
    }

    // Fill the rest of the DP table
    for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + cost[i][j];
        }
    }

    // The minimum path cost will be in the bottom-right cell
    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> grid = \{\{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    vector<vector<int>> cost = \{\{1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1}};

    cout << "Minimum Path Cost: " << minPathCost(grid, cost) << endl;  // Output should be 5 (example case)
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we are iterating through every cell exactly once to build the `dp` table.
- The space complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) due to the additional `dp` table of the same size as the grid being used.
