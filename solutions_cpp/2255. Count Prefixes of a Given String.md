[Leetcode 2255. Count Prefixes of a Given String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2255)
### Problem Statement
The problem you are asked to solve is:
Given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`, return the number of strings in `words` that are prefixes of `s`.

A string `word` is a prefix of `s` if `s` starts with `word`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start writing the code, let's clarify the problem:
1. **Can the words list be empty?** Yes, if it is empty, the result should be 0.
2. **Can the string `s` be empty?** Yes, if `s` is empty, no string can be a prefix of it, so the result should be 0.
3. **What is the range of lengths for `words` and `s`?** Assume the length of `words` and the length of any string within it (including `s`) can be up to 100.
4. **Are there any constraints on the type of characters in `words` and `s`?** No, they can contain any valid lower-case English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a counter to 0.**
2. **Iterate through each string in the `words` list.**
3. **Check if the current string is a prefix of `s` using the `substr` method or the `compare` function.**
4. **If it is a prefix, increment the counter.**
5. **Return the counter after the loop finishes.**

### Code
Here is the C++ code implementing the above strategy:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int countPrefixes(std::vector<std::string>& words, std::string s) {
    int count = 0;
    for (const std::string& word : words) {
        if (s.substr(0, word.size()) == word) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
1. Let `n` be the number of strings in `words`.
2. Let `m` be the average length of the strings in `words`.
3. The `substr` method operates in O(m) time, where m is the length of the prefix being checked.
4. The outer loop runs `n` times.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n * m), where `n` is the size of the `words` list, and `m` is the average length of the strings in `words`.

This solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
