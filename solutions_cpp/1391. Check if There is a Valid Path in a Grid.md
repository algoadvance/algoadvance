[Leetcode 1391. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1391)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an `m x n` grid. Each cell of the grid represents a street. The grid has six types of streets:

- Street Type 1: Horizontal street connecting the left and right cells.
- Street Type 2: Vertical street connecting the upper and lower cells.
- Street Type 3: Corner street connecting the left and upper cells.
- Street Type 4: Corner street connecting the right and upper cells.
- Street Type 5: Corner street connecting the left and lower cells.
- Street Type 6: Corner street connecting the right and lower cells.

You start at the upper-left cell (0, 0) and you are required to reach the bottom-right cell (m−1, n−1). The input is a 2D integer grid, where `grid[i][j]` is the type of street at cell (i, j).

Return `true` if there is a valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell, otherwise `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the dimensions of the grid guaranteed to be at least 1x1?**
   - Yes.

2. **What should be returned if the grid is just 1x1?**
   - Return `true` since the starting point is also the ending point.

3. **Are diagonal movements allowed?**
   - No, only the movements defined by the street types are permitted.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the grid from the start to the end. We need to ensure that we only move to cells that are connected by valid streets.

For each cell, depending on its type, check the connectivity with adjacent cells and move accordingly. We also need to ensure that we don't revisit cells or move out of bounds.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <utility>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasValidPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();
        
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({0, 0});
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        const vector<vector<int>> directions[] = {
            \{\{0, -1}, {0, 1}},  // Type 1
            \{\{-1, 0}, {1, 0}},  // Type 2
            \{\{0, -1}, {-1, 0}}, // Type 3
            \{\{0, 1}, {-1, 0}},  // Type 4
            \{\{0, -1}, {1, 0}},  // Type 5
            \{\{0, 1}, {1, 0}}    // Type 6
        };
        
        const vector<vector<int>> opposite = {
            {0, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1},  // if coming from left
            {1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 1}   // if coming from top
        };
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1) {
                return true;
            }
            
            int type = grid[x][y] - 1;
            for (const auto& dir : directions[type]) {
                int nx = x + dir[0];
                int ny = y + dir[1];
                
                if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                    int nextType = grid[nx][ny] - 1;
                    if ((dir[0] == 0 && dir[1] == 1 && opposite[0][nextType]) ||
                        (dir[0] == 0 && dir[1] == -1 && opposite[0][nextType] == -1) ||
                        (dir[0] == -1 && dir[1] == 0 && opposite[1][nextType]) ||
                        (dir[0] == 1 && dir[1] == 0 && opposite[1][nextType] == -1)) {
                        visited[nx][ny] = true;
                        q.push({nx, ny});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- The above implementation has a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because, in the worst case, we need to visit each cell once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) for the `visited` array and the BFS queue in the worst case.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible valid paths while efficiently determining if a path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell exists.
