[Leetcode 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1344)
### Problem Statement
Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hands on a clock.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Inputs:**
   - `hour`: 1 <= hour <= 12
   - `minutes`: 0 <= minutes <= 59

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a floating-point number representing the smaller angle in degrees.

3. **Considerations:**
   - The angle should be the smaller one between the two possible angles.
   - Consider edge cases such as the exact hour (e.g., 3:00, 6:00).

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Minute Hand Position:**
   - Each minute moves the minute hand by `6` degrees (`360 / 60`).

2. **Calculate Hour Hand Position:**
   - Each hour moves the hour hand by `30` degrees (`360 / 12`).
   - Each minute also slightly moves the hour hand by `0.5` degrees (`30 / 60`).

3. **Calculate the Angle:**
   - Compute the absolute difference between the two angles.
   - Determine the smaller angle by considering both the calculated difference and `360` minus that difference.

### Time Complexity
The solution involves basic arithmetic calculations, which execute in constant time, O(1).

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
    // Calculate the angle moved by the minute hand from the 12 o'clock position.
    double minute_angle = minutes * 6;
    
    // Calculate the angle moved by the hour hand from the 12 o'clock position.
    double hour_angle = (hour % 12) * 30 + minutes * 0.5;
    
    // Calculate the difference between the two angles.
    double angle = fabs(hour_angle - minute_angle);

    // The smaller angle between the two possible angles
    return fmin(angle, 360 - angle);
}

int main() {
    int hour = 3;
    int minutes = 30;
    std::cout << "Angle: " << angleClock(hour, minutes) << " degrees\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Minute Angle Calculation:**
   - The minute hand's position is straightforward: `minutes * 6`.

2. **Hour Angle Calculation:**
   - The hour hand's position is `hour * 30` adjusted for the extra movement due to minutes: `hour * 30 + minutes * 0.5`.

3. **Angle Calculation:**
   - Take the absolute difference between the two positional angles.
   - Determine the smaller angle by checking `angle` and `360 - angle`.

This method ensures that the computation is both efficient and straightforward.
