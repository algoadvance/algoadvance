[Leetcode 318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l318)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each word consists of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum value of `length(word[i]) * length(word[j])` where the two words do not share common letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size of the `words` array, and what is the maximum length of an individual word?
   - Typically for LeetCode problems, the assumption can be hundreds to thousands of words, each up to 100 characters long.
  
2. **Character Set**: Do the words contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, each word consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Empty Array**: Should we consider the case when the input array is empty?
   - Usually, yes. In this case, the maximum product should be `0`.

4. **Output**: Should the function return an integer representing the maximum product?
   - Yes, the function should return the maximum product as an integer.

### Strategy

1. **Bitmask Representation**:
   - Use a bitmask to represent each word's unique character set. Each bit in an integer (32-bit) can represent if a letter 'a' to 'z' is present (`1`) or not (`0`).
  
2. **Precomputation**:
   - Precompute a bitmask for each word.
  
3. **Pairwise Comparison**:
   - Compare each pair of words to ensure they do not share common letters using the bitmask.

4. **Calculate Product**:
   - Calculate the product of the lengths of two words if they do not share common letters and keep track of the maximum product.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

int maxProduct(std::vector<std::string>& words) {
    int n = words.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    
    // Step 1: Convert words to bitmasks
    std::vector<int> bitmasks(n, 0);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (char c : words[i]) {
            bitmasks[i] |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        }
    }
    
    // Step 2: Find max product of lengths of pairs of different words without common letters
    int max_prod = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (size_t j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            if ((bitmasks[i] & bitmasks[j]) == 0) {
                int prod = words[i].length() * words[j].length();
                max_prod = std::max(max_prod, prod);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return max_prod;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Bitmask Computation**: Calculating bitmask takes O(L) for each word, where `L` is the average length of a word. Hence, O(N * L) for all words.
- **Pairwise Comparison**: Comparing each pair of words takes O(N^2).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(N^2 + N * L), which simplifies to O(N^2) for pairs comparison in practice, as L is relatively small compared to N.
