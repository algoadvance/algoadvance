[Leetcode 1785. Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1785)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `limit` and `goal`. The array `nums` can contain both positive and negative elements. Your task is to return the minimum number of elements you need to add to `nums` such that the sum of the elements in the resultant array equals `goal`. Each element you add should be between `-limit` and `limit` inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the added elements only be integers?**
   A: Yes, the elements added should be integers within the given range.

2. **Q: Is there any restriction on the size of the given array `nums`?**
   A: No, there is no restriction specified on the size of the array.

3. **Q: Can the `limit` be zero or negative?**
   A: Based on the problem description, the limit is a positive integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the elements in `nums`.
2. **Calculate the Difference `diff`**: Find the absolute difference between the goal and the current sum.
3. **Determine Minimum Number of Elements**:
   - You can add elements ranging between `-limit` to `limit` inclusive. Hence, the maximum value any single number can contribute is `limit`.
   - To minimize the number of additions, use the highest possible value, which is `limit`.
   - Calculate the minimum number of elements needed to make up the difference `diff` by dividing `diff` by `limit` and considering any remainder.

### Code

Here is how you can implement this in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <numeric> // for accumulate

class Solution {
public:
    int minElements(std::vector<int>& nums, int limit, long long goal) {
        // Calculate the current sum of the array nums
        long long currentSum = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0LL);
        
        // Calculate the absolute difference between the goal and the current sum
        long long diff = std::abs(goal - currentSum);

        // Calculate the minimum number of elements needed
        // Divide the difference by the limit and take the ceiling of the result
        return (diff + limit - 1) / limit;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This complexity arises from the use of `std::accumulate` to compute the sum of the array elements.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution effectively computes the required values and optimally calculates the minimum number of elements needed to achieve the goal sum.
