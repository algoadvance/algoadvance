[Leetcode 500. Keyboard Row](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l500)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode problem 500, "Keyboard Row", asks you to determine if a given word can be typed using letters from only one row of a keyboard. The common QWERTY keyboard layout has the following rows:

1. "QWERTYUIOP" (or "qwertyuiop")
2. "ASDFGHJKL" (or "asdfghjkl")
3. "ZXCVBNM" (or "zxcvbnm")

You are given a list of words, and you need to return the words that can be typed using letters from only one row of this keyboard.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the function handle both upper and lower case letters?
   - Yes, the function should handle both upper and lower case letters.
   
2. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the length or number of words?
   - Typical constraints: 1 <= words.length <= 20, and each word length is 1 <= word.length <= 100, only containing letters.

3. **Output Format**: What should the output be?
   - The output should be a list of words that can be typed using letters from only one keyboard row.

### Strategy

1. **Map Rows to Sets**: Create a mapping of the rows to sets containing their respective letters for quick lookup.
2. **Check Each Word**: For each word, determine the set of rows it can belong to:
   - If all characters of the word belong to one of these sets, add the word to the result.
3. **Use Lowercase For Comparison**: Convert each character to lowercase to simplify checks.

### Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_set<char> row1 = {'q', 'w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'y', 'u', 'i', 'o', 'p'};
        unordered_set<char> row2 = {'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l'};
        unordered_set<char> row3 = {'z', 'x', 'c', 'v', 'b', 'n', 'm'};
        
        vector<string> result;
        
        for (const string& word : words) {
            if (isValid(word, row1) || isValid(word, row2) || isValid(word, row3)) {
                result.push_back(word);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
private:
    bool isValid(const string& word, const unordered_set<char>& row) {
        for (char c : word) {
            if (row.find(tolower(c)) == row.end()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the sets for rows takes constant time, O(1).
- **Processing Each Word**:
  - For each word, checking if all characters belong to a single row takes O(m) where m is the length of the word.
  - Since checking each character involves set lookup, which is O(1), the overall complexity for a word is O(m).

Given n words and assuming the average length of a word is m:
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(n * m)

This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
