[Leetcode 1784. Check if Binary String Has at Most One Segment of Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1784)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` which contains only characters `'0'` and `'1'`. A segment is a contiguous substring of the binary string. The problem asks to determine if the binary string has at most one segment of ones, meaning that all the `1`s in the string are grouped together in one contiguous segment, without being separated by any `0`s. If the string meets this condition, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length range of the input string?
   
     *The length of the binary string can range from 1 to 1000.*

2. **Output**:
   - Should we return a boolean value indicating if the string meets the condition?
   
     *Yes, return `true` if the string meets the condition, otherwise return `false`.*

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should the function handle strings that consist entirely of `0`s or `1`s?
     
     *If the string consists entirely of `0`s or `1`s, it should return `true`.*

4. **Assumptions**:
   - Can the string contain characters other than '0' and '1'?
   
     *No, the string will only contain '0' and '1'.*

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure there is at most one contiguous segment of `1`s in the string `s`.

1. **Identify the first occurrence of '1'**: Traverse the string until finding the first '1'.
2. **Check for a contiguous segment**: After finding the first '1', ensure no '0' is found followed by another '1'.
3. **Validation**: If we encounter '0' after the first segment of '1's, the string should not have any further '1's. If it does, return `false`.

### Code

Here is an implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

bool checkOnesSegment(const std::string& s) {
    bool foundOneSegment = false;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        if (s[i] == '1') {
            if (foundOneSegment && s[i - 1] == '0') {
                // A new '1' segment is found after '0', hence return false
                return false;
            }
            foundOneSegment = true;  // Mark that we have found a '1' segment
        }
    }
    return true;  // No disjoint segments of '1' found
}

int main() {
    std::string test1 = "10001";
    std::string test2 = "1001";
    std::string test3 = "110";
    std::string test4 = "1111";
    
    std::cout << checkOnesSegment(test1) << std::endl;  // Output: false
    std::cout << checkOnesSegment(test2) << std::endl;  // Output: false
    std::cout << checkOnesSegment(test3) << std::endl;  // Output: true
    std::cout << checkOnesSegment(test4) << std::endl;  // Output: true
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we make a single pass through the string to check for contiguous segments of '1's.

The space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
