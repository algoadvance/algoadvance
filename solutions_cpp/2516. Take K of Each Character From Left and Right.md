[Leetcode 2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2516)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' and an integer `k`, you need to find the length of the smallest substring that contains at least `k` occurrences of each character from both the leftmost and rightmost `k` characters of the string `s`.

If it is not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can `s` contain other characters apart from 'a', 'b', and 'c'?**
    - No, `s` will only contain 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

2. **What guarantees are given regarding the length of `s` or the value of `k`?**
    - `k` will be a positive integer less than the length of `s`.

3. **What should be returned in case it's not possible to find such a substring?**
    - Return -1.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Verification:**
   - Check if the length of `s` is at least `2 * k`, because only then can you potentially take `k` characters from both the left and right.

2. **Prefix and Suffix Examination:**
   - Extract prefixes and suffixes of length `k` from the string `s`.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window technique to find the minimum length substring that includes all characters from both the prefix and suffix.

### Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int takeCharacters(string s, int k) {
    int n = s.size();
    if (k == 0) return 0;
    if (n < 2 * k) return -1;

    // Prefix for the first k chars
    unordered_map<char, int> prefix_count;
    // Suffix for the last k chars
    unordered_map<char, int> suffix_count;

    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        prefix_count[s[i]]++;
    }
    for (int i = n - k; i < n; ++i) {
        suffix_count[s[i]]++;
    }

    // Check if initial prefix and suffix satisfy the condition
    for (char c : {'a', 'b', 'c'}) {
        if (prefix_count[c] < k || suffix_count[c] < k) return -1;
    }

    // Sliding window variables
    int min_len = n;
    int left = 0, right = 2 * k - 1;

    while (right < n) {
        // Validate current window
        unordered_map<char, int> window_count;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            window_count[s[left + i]]++;
        }
        for (int i = n - k; i < n; ++i) {
            window_count[s[i]]++;
        }

        bool valid = true;
        for (char c : {'a', 'b', 'c'}) {
            if (window_count[c] < k) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (valid) {
            min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        } else {
            left++;
            if (right - left + 1 < 2 * k) {
                right = left + 2 * k - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return min_len;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    string s = "abacabc";
    int k = 2;
    cout << takeCharacters(s, k) << endl; // Output should be length of the substring which meets the conditions
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Preprocessing:** O(k) to count characters in the prefix and suffix.
- **Sliding Window:** O(n) for the sliding window process, since each character is processed at most twice.
- **Total Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

This code is designed to handle the given constraints and check for the required conditions in an efficient manner.
