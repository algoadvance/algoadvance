[Leetcode 2679. Sum in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2679)
### Problem Statement
You are given a `n x m` integer matrix `mat` and a positive integer `k`. Your task is to calculate the sum of the `k` largest elements in `mat`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the ranges for `n`, `m`, and `k`?
     - Typically, for matrix-related problems, `n` and `m` could range from `1` to `500`, and `k` will be a positive integer less than or equal to `n * m`.

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a single integer representing the sum of the `k` largest elements in the matrix.

3. **Duplicate Elements:**
   - Can the matrix contain duplicate elements? (Assuming yes unless stated otherwise.)

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Flatten the Matrix:**
   - Convert the 2D matrix into a 1D array so we can work more easily with sorting and heap operations.

2. **Sort the List/Use a Max-Heap:**
   - Sort the flattened list in descending order and take the first `k` elements.
   - Alternatively, use a max-heap (priority queue) to extract the `k` largest elements without sorting the entire array.

3. **Sum the Largest Elements:**
   - Calculate the sum of the first `k` largest elements obtained from either approach.

We will use the sorting method for simplicity and readability.

### Time Complexity
- **Flattening the Matrix:** O(n*m)
- **Sorting the Flattened Array:** O((n*m) log (n*m))
- **Summing the Largest Elements:** O(k)

**Overall Time Complexity:** O((n*m) log (n*m))

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm> // for sort

int sumKLargestElements(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
    std::vector<int> flatList;

    // Flatten the matrix into a list
    for (const auto& row : mat) {
        flatList.insert(flatList.end(), row.begin(), row.end());
    }

    // Sort the list in descending order to get the k largest elements
    std::sort(flatList.begin(), flatList.end(), std::greater<int>());

    // Sum the k largest elements
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        sum += flatList[i];
    }

    return sum;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> mat = {
        {1, 3, 5},
        {2, 8, 7},
        {4, 6, 9}
    };
    int k = 4;
    
    std::cout << "Sum of " << k << " largest elements: " << sumKLargestElements(mat, k) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this implementation, we:
1. Flatten the matrix into a single list.
2. Sort the list in descending order.
3. Sum the first `k` elements from the sorted list.
4. Print the result.

This approach ensures we correctly and efficiently find the sum of the `k` largest elements in the matrix.
