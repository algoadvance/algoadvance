[Leetcode 2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2918)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of integers, `nums1` and `nums2`, of the same length `n`. The task is to replace every `0` in both arrays with any integer from 1 to 9 (inclusive) such that the sums of the two resulting arrays are as close to each other as possible. Return the minimum absolute difference of the sums of the two arrays possible after replacing zeros.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length `n` of the arrays? Is it always equal for both arrays?
   - Are there constraints on the initial values of `nums1` and `nums2` apart from containing zeros?

2. **Distinct Elements:**
   - Can either `nums1` or `nums2` have negative numbers, or is it guaranteed to be non-negative from the start?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if both `nums1` and `nums2` have no zeros? Should we simply return the absolute difference of their sums?
   - How should we handle the case where there are multiple zeros?

Let's proceed with creating a solution based on the assumptions that:
1. The arrays can be of any length `n`.
2. Both arrays are non-negative initially.
3. If there are no zeros, return the absolute difference of the sums of the arrays.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Sums Calculation:**
   - Calculate the initial sums of both arrays, ignoring the zeros.
   
2. **Difference Calculation:**
   - Calculate the initial difference between the two sums.

3. **Minimize Difference:**
   - To minimize the absolute difference, try to balance the sums by considering possible values (1 to 9) for each zero in both arrays.
   - Check the effect of each replacement on the sum difference.

### Code Implementation

Hereâ€™s the possible code implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

int minimumEqualSumAfterReplacingZeros(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
    int sum1 = std::accumulate(nums1.begin(), nums1.end(), 0);
    int sum2 = std::accumulate(nums2.begin(), nums2.end(), 0);

    std::vector<int> zeroIndices1, zeroIndices2;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums1.size(); ++i) {
        if (nums1[i] == 0) zeroIndices1.push_back(i);
        if (nums2[i] == 0) zeroIndices2.push_back(i);
    }

    int initialDifference = std::abs(sum1 - sum2);
    if (zeroIndices1.empty() && zeroIndices2.empty()) return initialDifference;

    int minDiff = initialDifference;

    // Iterate through all combinations of possible replacements
    for (int num1 : {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}) {
        for (int num2 : {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}) {
            int newSum1 = sum1;
            int newSum2 = sum2;
            
            for (int index : zeroIndices1) {
                newSum1 += (num1 - 0);
            }

            for (int index : zeroIndices2) {
                newSum2 += (num2 - 0);
            }
            
            minDiff = std::min(minDiff, std::abs(newSum1 - newSum2));
        }
    }

    return minDiff;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> nums1 = {1, 0, 0, 4};
    std::vector<int> nums2 = {2, 0, 3, 0};
    std::cout << "Minimum Absolute Difference: " << minimumEqualSumAfterReplacingZeros(nums1, nums2) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Sum Calculation:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the arrays.
- **Brute Force Replacement:** There are at most 18 iterations (9 numbers for each zero in `nums1` and `nums2`), making the time complexity \(O(9 \times 9) = O(1)\).

Overall, the primary bottleneck is iterating through all possible combinations of replacements. Since we're bounded by a constant factor (1 to 9 replacements), the time complexity remains manageable.
