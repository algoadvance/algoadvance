[Leetcode 2227. Encrypt and Decrypt Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2227)
### Problem Statement

You are given a class `Encrypter` which performs encryption and decryption of strings using two sets of mappings. The class should be initialized with:

- `keys`: a list of `m` characters.
- `values`: a list of `m` strings where each string represents the encrypted version of the corresponding `keys` character.
- `dictionary`: a list of strings representing the valid words dictionary.

The class should support the following operations:

1. `encrypt(word)`: This method takes a string `word` and returns the encrypted string by replacing each character in `word` with its corresponding string in `values`.
2. `decrypt(word)`: This method takes an encrypted string `word` and returns the count of how many possible original strings from the `dictionary` can create the encrypted `word` through decryption.

#### Example:
```cpp
Encrypter encrypter = Encrypter(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], ["ei", "zf", "ei", "am"], ["abcd", "acbd", "adbc", "badc", "dacb"]);
encrypter.encrypt("abcd"); // returns "eizfeiam"
encrypter.decrypt("eizfeiam"); // returns 1
encrypter.decrypt("eiamzf"); // returns 0
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the mappings between keys and values one-to-one or can they be one-to-many?**

   - Specific to the problem, the keys to values mapping is one-to-one.

2. **Can the keys have the same encrypted values?**

   - Yes, different keys can have the same encrypted values (as seen in example).

3. **What constraints are there on the input sizes for keys, values, and the dictionary?**

   - Constraints would generally align with typical competitive programming standards unless explicitly mentioned in the problem.

### Code

Let's write the `Encrypter` class based on the functionality described.

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>

class Encrypter {
private:
    std::unordered_map<char, std::string> encryption_map;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::vector<char>> decryption_map;
    std::unordered_set<std::string> dictionary_set;

public:
    Encrypter(std::vector<char>& keys, std::vector<std::string>& values, std::vector<std::string>& dictionary) {
        for (int i = 0; i < keys.size(); ++i) {
            encryption_map[keys[i]] = values[i];
            decryption_map[values[i]].push_back(keys[i]);
        }
        for (const std::string& word : dictionary) {
            dictionary_set.insert(word);
        }
    }

    std::string encrypt(std::string word) {
        std::string encrypted_word;
        for (char ch : word) {
            encrypted_word += encryption_map[ch];
        }
        return encrypted_word;
    }

    int decrypt(std::string word) {
        return countDecryptions(word, 0, "");
    }

    int countDecryptions(const std::string& word, int index, std::string current_decrypt) {
        if (index == word.length()) {
            return dictionary_set.count(current_decrypt) ? 1 : 0;
        }

        std::string current_segment = word.substr(index, 2);
        int count = 0;

        for (char ch : decryption_map[current_segment]) {
            count += countDecryptions(word, index + 2, current_decrypt + ch);
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Map each key to its corresponding encrypted value.
   - Create a reverse mapping from values to keys to facilitate decryption.
   - Store the dictionary words in a set for quick lookup.

2. **Encryption**:
   - For each character in the input word, append its encrypted string to the result using the `encryption_map`.

3. **Decryption**:
   - Perform a recursive search to count all possible decryption paths that lead to valid dictionary words.
   - For each two-character segment in the encrypted string, explore all possible original characters from the decryption mapping.

### Time Complexity

1. **Encryption**:
   - O(n), where n is the length of the input word.

2. **Decryption**:
   - The decryption function has an exponential complexity in the worst case due to the recursive exploration of all possible paths (with a branching factor based on the decryption map). 

Optimizations like memoization can be applied to reduce redundant calculations, depending on constraints and typical input sizes.
