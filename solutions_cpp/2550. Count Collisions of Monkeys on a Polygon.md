[Leetcode 2550. Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2550)
### Problem Statement

In this problem, there is a regular polygon with a certain number of vertices, and each vertex has a monkey initially. Each monkey starts moving along the edges of the polygon to the next vertex in a clockwise direction. The goal is to determine how many collisions occur when all monkeys start moving simultaneously.

**Constraints:**
- The number of vertices of the polygon, `n`, is given where \(3 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do all monkeys start moving at the exact same time?**
    - Yes, all monkeys start moving simultaneously.

2. **What constitutes a collision?**
    - A collision occurs when two monkeys arrive at the same vertex after an integer number of steps.

3. **Is there any direction change for monkeys?**
    - No, all monkeys move in a clockwise direction and do not change direction.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, observe that when all monkeys start moving along the edges of the polygon simultaneously and in the same direction, there won't be any collisions within one complete cycle (i.e., when each monkey reaches the next vertex).

However, let's take into consideration possible scenarios:

- If all monkeys move to the next vertex simultaneously in a clockwise direction, they will never meet at any vertex since they are moving in synchronization.
  
- Given that all paths are synchronized and no monkey changes direction, a direct collision scenario does not exist within a single cycle until one cycle completes.

Upon completing the examination and logic reasoning, the strategy here follows that:

- Since the pattern is completely synchronized, in an uninterrupted sequence, each monkey will move to the next position exactly like the previous one, leading to zero collisions in the simplified deterministic model.

### Solution

Given the theoretical analysis, the expected output will be straightforward - zero collisions due to complete synchronization in the movements of monkeys on a polygonal path.

### Code

Here's a simple implementation in C++ that outputs the number of collisions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    long long countCollisions(int n) {
        return 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of vertices in the polygon: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Number of collisions: " << solution.countCollisions(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because the determination and computation of the number of collisions is done in constant time, irrespective of the input size. Thus, it is highly efficient.

### Explanation

Here, we conclude that because all monkeys move simultaneously in perfect synchronization in one direction, there will be no intermediate collisions throughout their movement. Hence, the function always returns zero, indicating no collisions.
