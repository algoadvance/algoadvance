[Leetcode 827. Making A Large Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l827)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change **at most one** `0` to be `1`.

Return the size of the largest island in `grid` after applying this operation. An island is a 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`s.

### Example:
- `Input:` grid = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
- `Output:` 3

- `Input:` grid = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
- `Output:` 4

### Constraints:
- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we handle cases where `n` is very small, say n=1? 
    - Yes, handle all sizes within the constraints.
2. How should we handle the scenario if the grid is already filled with 1s?
    - If the grid is fully filled with 1s, then the output should be `n * n` since changing a `0` is irrelevant.

## Strategy

1. **Identify all islands**: Perform a DFS to mark each island and calculate its size. Assign each island a unique index.
2. **Change `0` to `1` and check new possible island sizes**: For each `0`, check its neighboring islands, sum their sizes, and track the maximum size.
3. **Return maximum island size**: Determine the maximum possible island size after converting one `0` to `1`.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Use DFS or BFS starting from each unvisited `1` to mark all connected `1`s and calculate the island size. Use a map to store the sizes with island identifiers.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid. For cells containing `0`, examine the sizes of distinct neighboring islands.
3. Calculate potential island size if this `0` is converted to `1` and update the maximum size found.

## Code

Here is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int largestIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        // Stores the size of each island,
        // island id is the key and size is the value
        unordered_map<int, int> island_size;
        int island_id = 2; // Start island ids from 2 because grid contains 0 and 1 already

        // Function to perform DFS and mark islands
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int x, int y) -> int {
            if (x < 0 || x >= n || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] != 1) return 0;
            grid[x][y] = island_id; // Mark the island with a unique id
            return 1 + dfs(x - 1, y) + dfs(x + 1, y) + dfs(x, y - 1) + dfs(x, y + 1);
        };

        // Mark all islands and calculate their sizes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int size = dfs(i, j);
                    island_size[island_id] = size;
                    island_id++;
                }
            }
        }

        int max_size = 0;
        for (const auto& [id, size] : island_size) {
            max_size = max(max_size, size);
        }
        
        // Check each 0 to see potential size of island if converted to 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    unordered_set<int> seen;
                    int potential_size = 1; // Convert this 0 to 1
                    for (auto [dx, dy] : vector<pair<int, int>>{{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}}) {
                        int nx = i + dx, ny = j + dy;
                        if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] > 1) {
                            int id = grid[nx][ny];
                            if (seen.insert(id).second) {
                                potential_size += island_size[id];
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    max_size = max(max_size, potential_size);
                }
            }
        }

        return max_size;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **DFS/BFS for identifying islands**: O(n^2), as we visit each cell once.
- **Checking each 0's neighbors**: O(n^2), for each cell we check at most 4 neighbors.
- Overall time complexity: **O(n^2)**, which is efficient for `n` up to 500.
