[Leetcode 2242. Maximum Score of a Node Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2242)
### Problem Statement

Let's consider a graph where each node is associated with a value given by a list of integers. You are given the following:

- An integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` is the value associated with the i-th node.
- A 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an undirected edge connecting node `ui` and node `vi`.

Your task is to determine the maximum score of a node sequence which consists of exactly four nodes such that the sequence forms an alternating pattern: `A-B-C-D` where there are edges between `A-B`, `B-C`, and `C-D`.

The score of such a sequence is calculated as `nums[A] + nums[B] + nums[C] + nums[D]`.

**Return the maximum score of such a node sequence. If no such sequence exists, return -1.**

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Can `nums` be an empty list?
    - What is the maximum number of edges and nodes?
    - Are there any duplicate edges, and can the list of edges have self-loops?

2. **Output Expectations:**
    - What should be returned if no valid node sequence is found? (Generally, it should return `-1` if no sequence exists).

### Strategy

1. **Graph Construction:**
    - Represent the graph using adjacency lists for efficient traversal.

2. **Node Sequence Search:**
    - For each node pair connected by an edge, explore their neighbors to form valid sequences of four nodes.
    - For each triplet `A-B-C`, check the neighbors of node `C` to form a valid sequence `A-B-C-D`.

3. **Valid Sequence and Score Calculation:**
    - Maintain the maximum score among all valid sequences found.

### Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxScoreNodeSequence(vector<int>& nums, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    int n = nums.size();

    // Construct adjacency list
    unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> adj;

    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];
        adj[u].insert(v);
        adj[v].insert(u);
    }

    int maxScore = -1;

    // Traverse each node pair to form A-B-C-D sequence
    for (const auto& edge : edges) {
        int u = edge[0];
        int v = edge[1];

        // Neighbors of u
        for (int x : adj[u]) {
            if (x == v) continue; // Skip if neighbor is the same as v

            // Neighbors of v
            for (int y : adj[v]) {
                if (y == u || y == x) continue; // Skip if neighbor is the same as u or x

                // Now we have a potential sequence u-x-v-y
                int score = nums[u] + nums[x] + nums[v] + nums[y];
                maxScore = max(maxScore, score);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxScore;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {5, 2, 9, 8, 4};
    vector<vector<int>> edges = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}};
    
    int result = maxScoreNodeSequence(nums, edges);
    cout << "Maximum Score of a Node Sequence: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the adjacency list takes `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- Checking each node pair and its neighbors involves iterating through edges and neighboring nodes, yielding a complexity approximately `O(E * d^2)`,` where `d` is the maximum degree of a node in the graph.
- The overall complexity thus is `O(E * d^2)`, where `d` can go up to `O(V)` in the worst case.

This solution seeks to balance between efficient adjacency traversal and ensuring all potential sequences are considered, making it suitable for competitive programming constraints.
