[Leetcode 2317. Maximum XOR After Operations ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2317)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, select any non-negative integer `x` and an index `i`, then update `nums[i]` to be equal to the bitwise `AND` of `nums[i]` and `x`. Note that the result of this operation could result in reducing the number of bits `1` in `nums[i]`.

Return the maximum possible bitwise `XOR` of all elements of `nums` after applying the operation any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array `nums` mutable outside the given operations?**
   - No, we can only change the elements of `nums` using the described operations.

2. **What is the range of numbers within `nums`?**
   - Typically, `nums` will contain non-negative integers.

3. **Is there a limit to the number of operations we can perform?**
   - No, there is no limit mentioned, so we can perform as many operations as needed to achieve the maximum XOR.

4. **What is the length range of the array `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to \(10^5\).

## Strategy

To maximize the XOR of the entire array, we need to make sure that each bit of the resulting XOR is set to `1` as much as possible. The bitwise `AND` operation can only turn bits `0`, but with strategic selection of `x`, we can retain the essential bits in `nums[i]` while maximizing the final XOR.

To achieve the maximum XOR, consider:
- Every bit position independently since XOR is bit-wise.
- To maximize the resultant XOR, we should ensure that at least one number in `nums` contributes a `1` at each bit position where possible.

### Steps:
1. Traverse through all numbers to find the maximum XOR.
2. For each possible bit position, if it is not initially set, minimize the changes needed while updating `nums[i]`.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maximumXOR(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxXor = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxXor |= num;
        }
        return maxXor;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    cout << "Maximum XOR: " << sol.maximumXOR(nums) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- Initialize `maxXor` to `0`.
- Traverse through each element in `nums`, performing the OR operation between `maxXor` and each number `num`.
- The OR operation is used because it ensures that any bit set in `num` is retained in `maxXor` without losing any bits.
- Return the resultant `maxXor` after the loop.

## Time Complexity

The solution has a linear time complexity of \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is efficient and manageable within the problem constraints.
