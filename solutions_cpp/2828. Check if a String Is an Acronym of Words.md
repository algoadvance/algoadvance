[Leetcode 2828. Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2828)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`. The task is to determine if `s` is an acronym of the strings in `words`. A string `s` is considered an acronym of `words` if it is equal to the concatenation of the first letter of each word in `words` in order.

Example:
- words = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
- s = "abc"

Output: True
- words = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
- s = "ab"
Output: False

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should we consider the case while comparing the acronym?
   - Assume that the comparison is case-sensitive as the problem statement does not specify otherwise.

2. **Input Constraints**: Are `words` and `s` always non-empty and contain only alphabetical characters?
   - Assume `words` and `s` are non-empty, and each string in `words` contains at least one character.

3. **Length of Strings**: What is the maximum length for `words` and `s`?
   - Assume reasonable constraints such as `1 <= words.length <= 1000` and the length of each word and `s` being <= 1000 characters.

## Strategy
1. Initialize an empty string to store the generated acronym.
2. Iterate through each word in `words` and concatenate the first letter of each word to the acronym string.
3. Compare the generated acronym string with `s`.
4. Return True if they are equal, otherwise return False.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the total number of characters in `words`. This is because we iterate through each word once and concatenate a single character to form the acronym.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>

bool isAcronym(std::vector<std::string>& words, std::string s) {
    std::string acronym = "";
    for (const std::string& word : words) {
        acronym += word[0];
    }
    return acronym == s;
}
```

This code correctly follows the strategy and checks if `s` is an acronym of the `words` list.
