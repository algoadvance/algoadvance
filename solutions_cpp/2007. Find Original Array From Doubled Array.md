[Leetcode 2007. Find Original Array From Doubled Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2007)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an array `changed`, which is a doubled array, meaning the array is formed by taking an original array `original` and appending twice its values to it, in any order. If the array `changed` is derived in this manner, return the original array `original`. If `changed` doesn't represent a doubled array, return an empty array. The elements in `changed` are integer values.

### Example:
- Input: `changed = [1,3,4,2,6,8]`
- Output: `[1,3,4]`

- Input: `changed = [6,3,0,1]`
- Output: `[]` (It's not possible to form the original array)

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Will the input array always be even-numbered?**
   - Yes, since it contains both original and their doubled values.
   
2. **Are there any limits on the values within the array?**
   - No specific constraints mentioned, assume typical integer value range.

3. **Can elements in the original array be zero?**
   - Yes, and its doubled value would also be zero.

### Strategy:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the size of `changed` is odd, return an empty array. The doubled array should have an even number of elements.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the `changed` array to handle the smallest elements first. This simplifies matching elements with their double values.
   
3. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a hash map to count the occurrences of each element.
   
4. **Restoring the Original Array**:
   - Iterate through the sorted array. For each element, check if the double exists in the hashmap and has a positive count.
   - If it exists, decrement the counts of both the element and its double.
   - If it doesn't fit the criteria, return an empty array.
   
5. **Result Compilation**:
   - The remaining elements, after proper pairing, should form the original array.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting takes `O(n log n)`.
- The iteration and frequency adjustments take `O(n)`.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>

std::vector<int> findOriginalArray(std::vector<int>& changed) {
    if (changed.size() % 2 != 0)
        return {}; // Cannot be a doubled array if the size is odd.

    std::sort(changed.begin(), changed.end());
    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequency;

    for (int num : changed) {
        ++frequency[num];
    }

    std::vector<int> original;

    for (int num : changed) {
        if (frequency[num] == 0) {
            continue; // Already used this number
        }
        
        if (frequency[num * 2] == 0) {
            return {}; // Cannot form a valid doubled array
        }

        // Add to original array
        original.push_back(num);
        // Decrease frequency
        --frequency[num];
        --frequency[num * 2];
    }

    return original;
}
```

This code ensures that every element in the `changed` array can be paired up successfully with its double. If at any step it's not possible to do so, the function immediately returns an empty array, indicating that the input doesn't represent a valid doubled array structure.
