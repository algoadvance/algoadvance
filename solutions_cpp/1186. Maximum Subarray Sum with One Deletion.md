[Leetcode 1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1186)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, you can remove exactly one element from the array. Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the subarray obtained after the removal of exactly one element.

**Example:**
```
Input: arr = [1,-2,0,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: Because we can remove -2. So the maximum sum is 1 + 0 + 3 = 4.
```
**Note:**
- The length of the array is between 1 and 10^5.
- The array will have integer values between -10^4 and 10^4.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can we remove only one element or zero elements as well?
   - **A:** The problem statement mentions we must remove exactly one element.
   
2. **Q:** What should we return if the input array has only one element?
   - **A:** The problem constraints imply that we would not encounter arrays of length less than 2. If such a case arises (e.g., removal of the only element), the problem definition might need re-evaluation or edge case handling, typically returning a sum of 0 after removal if considered valid input.

3. **Q:** Are the elements all integers, including possible negative values?
   - **A:** Yes, according to the problem statement.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming to track the maximum subarray sum with and without removing an element. We will maintain two arrays:
1. `noDelete[i]`: Maximum subarray sum ending at index `i` without any deletion.
2. `oneDelete[i]`: Maximum subarray sum ending at index `i` with one deletion performed.

Our approach will involve iterating through the array elements and updating these two arrays based on the previous values and current element.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize `noDelete` and `oneDelete` arrays.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element, update `noDelete` based on the maximum subarray sum without any deletion.
4. Update `oneDelete` based on either extending a subarray by deleting the current element, or extending an existing subarray that has already performed a deletion.
5. Keep track of the maximum values in both `noDelete` and `oneDelete` arrays.
6. Return the maximum value of `oneDelete`.

## Code
Here's the C++ implementation of our solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maximumSum(vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    if (n == 1) return arr[0]; // Edge case for single element

    // Initialization
    vector<int> noDelete(n, 0);
    vector<int> oneDelete(n, 0);

    noDelete[0] = arr[0];
    oneDelete[0] = 0; // we opt to delete the first element considered

    int maxSum = arr[0]; // Initial maximum sum

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        noDelete[i] = max(noDelete[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
        oneDelete[i] = max(oneDelete[i-1] + arr[i], noDelete[i-1]);
        
        maxSum = max({maxSum, noDelete[i], oneDelete[i]});
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) as it involves a single pass through the array using a loop which updates the `noDelete` and `oneDelete` arrays. The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional storage required by these two arrays.
