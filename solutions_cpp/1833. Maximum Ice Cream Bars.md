[Leetcode 1833. Maximum Ice Cream Bars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1833)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of the ith ice cream bar. You have an initial amount of coins. You can buy as many ice cream bars as possible with your coins. Return the maximum number of ice cream bars you can buy with the given coins.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: You can buy the ice cream bars at indices 0, 2, 4, and 1 for a total cost of 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot buy any ice cream bar because you don't have enough coins.
```

**Example 3:**
```plaintext
Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: You can buy all the ice cream bars at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for a total cost of 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 18.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the approach when the costs array is empty?**
    - If the costs array is empty, logically you cannot buy any ice cream bars, so the output should be 0.

2. **Are costs and coins guaranteed to be positive integers?**
    - Yes, the problem assumes that both costs and coins are positive integers.

3. **Do we need to handle extremely large inputs?**
    - Since this is a typical LeetCode problem, we can assume the solution should handle typical competitive programming constraints, within reasonable bounds.

4. **Does the order of selection matter?**
    - No, the order of selection doesn't matter. We only care about maximizing the number of ice cream bars.

### Strategy
Given the need to maximize the number of ice cream bars, an efficient strategy is:
1. Sort the `costs` array.
2. Iterate through the sorted `costs` array, purchasing the cheapest bars first until we run out of coins.
3. Track the number of bars purchased.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maxIceCream(std::vector<int>& costs, int coins) {
    // Sort the costs array to buy cheaper ice creams first.
    std::sort(costs.begin(), costs.end());
    
    int count = 0;
    for (int cost : costs) {
        if (coins >= cost) {
            count++;
            coins -= cost;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the `costs` array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of ice cream bars.
- Iterating through the sorted `costs` array takes \(O(n)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Example Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> costs1 = {1, 3, 2, 4, 1};
    int coins1 = 7;
    std::cout << maxIceCream(costs1, coins1) << std::endl; // Output: 4
    
    std::vector<int> costs2 = {10, 6, 8, 7, 7, 8};
    int coins2 = 5;
    std::cout << maxIceCream(costs2, coins2) << std::endl; // Output: 0

    std::vector<int> costs3 = {1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 5};
    int coins3 = 20;
    std::cout << maxIceCream(costs3, coins3) << std::endl; // Output: 6

    return 0;
}
```
