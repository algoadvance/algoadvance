[Leetcode 472. Concatenated Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l472)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of `words`.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

### Example
```cpp
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]

Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of each word? (Assume up to 1000 characters)
   - What is the maximum number of words in the list? (Assume up to 10^4 words)
   
2. **Are all words lowercase?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, we assume all words are lowercase English letters.
   
3. **Can a word form itself?**
   - No, a concatenated word should be formed using at least two other words from the list.

### Strategy

1. **Use Dynamic Programming**:
   - Utilize a set to store words for fast look-up.
   - For each word, use dynamic programming (DP) to check if the word can be formed by concatenating other words in the set.

2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty result list.
   - Insert all words into a set.
   - For each word in the list:
     - Use DP to check if the word can be segmented into two or more words present in the set.
     - If it can, add it to the result list.
     - **DP Array**: `dp[i]` will be `true` if the length `i` prefix of the word can be formed by concatenating other words from the set.

### Code Implementation

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

bool canForm(const string& word, const unordered_set<string>& wordSet) {
    int n = word.size();
    vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);
    dp[0] = true; // Empty string can always be segmented
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
            if (dp[j] && wordSet.count(word.substr(j, i - j))) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

vector<string> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(vector<string>& words) {
    unordered_set<string> wordSet(words.begin(), words.end());
    vector<string> result;
    
    for (const string& word : words) {
        wordSet.erase(word); // Remove word to avoid using itself to form concatenation
        if (canForm(word, wordSet)) {
            result.push_back(word);
        }
        wordSet.insert(word); // Re-insert word for the next iteration
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<string> words = {"cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"};
    vector<string> result = findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(words);
    
    for (const string& word : result) {
        cout << word << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Look-up in Unordered Set**: O(1) on average.
- **DP Checking for Each Word**:
  - For each word of length `L`, it takes O(L^2) in the worst case to check if it can be formed using other words.
  
- **Overall Complexity**:
  - Let `N` be the number of words and `L` be the average length of words.
  - The total complexity is O(N * L^2).

This solution should efficiently handle the constraints provided.
