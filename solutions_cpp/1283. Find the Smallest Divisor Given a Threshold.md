[Leetcode 1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1283)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we need to find the smallest positive integer `divisor` such that the sum of the result of `nums[i]` divided by `divisor` is less than or equal to `threshold`. Each result of the division should be rounded up to the nearest integer. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
   - What are the constraints on the elements in the `nums` array? (Typical bounds for each element in `nums` and the size of the array?)
   - What are the constraints on the `threshold`?

2. **Rounding Operation**:
   - For division, do we always round the result up? For instance, for `7 / 4`, would the result be `2`?

3. **Output**:
   - Should the smallest divisor always be a positive integer?
   
Assuming the following constraints based on typical LeetCode problems:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
- nums is a non-empty array.

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestDivisor(std::vector<int>& nums, int threshold) {
        int left = 1, right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (left - left) / 2;
            if (calculateSum(nums, mid) > threshold) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
private:
    int calculateSum(const std::vector<int>& nums, int divisor) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (const int& num : nums) {
            sum += std::ceil(static_cast<double>(num) / divisor);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Efficiency**:
   - Since we are looking for the smallest divisor, a binary search between `1` and the maximum element in `nums` is efficient.

2. **Checking if a Potential Divisor Satisfies the Threshold**:
   - For a potential middle value `mid` during the binary search, calculate the sum of the division results using `calculateSum`.
   - If `calculateSum` with `mid` exceeds `threshold`, then move the left boundary to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, move the right boundary to `mid`.

3. **Ceiling of the Division**:
   - The division result should always be rounded up, which can be achieved using `std::ceil`.

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: Takes `O(log(max_element))`, where `max_element` is the maximum value in the `nums` array.
- **Sum Calculation per Step**: For each potential divisor, we need to iterate through all elements of `nums` to compute the sum, which takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the size of the `nums`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(max_element))`.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and should perform well within the typical input limits.
