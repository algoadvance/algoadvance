[Leetcode 1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1851)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i] and an array of queries where queries[j] is the j-th query.

To answer the j-th query, you need to find the minimum length of any interval which includes queries[j]. The length of an interval [start, end] is defined as (end - start + 1).

Return an array containing the answers to the queries. If there is no interval that includes queries[j], the j-th query's answer should be -1.

### Example:
```cpp
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6]], queries = [2,3,4]
Output: [3,3,3]

Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8]], queries = [2,4,6]
Output: [2,4,8]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= intervals.length, queries.length <= 10^5
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 1 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^7
- 1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the queries and intervals already sorted?**
   - No, the queries and intervals are provided in any order.
2. **Can the queries array contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, queries can have duplicate values.
3. **Can the intervals overlap each other?**
   - Yes, intervals can overlap each other.

### Strategy:
1. **Sort Intervals and Queries:** Sort intervals by their start time. Create a sorted array of queries but maintain a way to map the result back to the original query indices.
2. **Use a Min-Heap:** As we process each query in the sorted order, maintain a min-heap of intervals that can include the query value. This helps in quickly finding the minimum length interval for each query.
3. **Add Intervals to Heap:** As we move through each query, add all intervals starting before or exactly at the queryâ€™s value into the min-heap.
4. **Remove Intervals from Heap:** Remove those intervals from the heap whose end is before the current query as they cannot include the query.
5. **Store Results:** For each query, after maintaining our heap, the top of the heap will give us the minimum interval length that includes the query. If the heap is empty, it means no such interval exists.
6. **Efficiency:** By sorting and using a heap, we can ensure that each query is processed in logarithmic time with respect to the number of intervals.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting intervals: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Sorting queries: \(O(q \log q)\)
- Processing each query with heap operations: \(O(q \log n)\)
- Total: \(O((n+q) \log n)\) assuming \(n\) and \(q\) are of similar scale.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
#include <tuple>

using namespace std;

vector<int> minInterval(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& queries) {
    // Sort intervals based on their start time
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
    
    // Create a vector of pairs to keep track of original query indices
    vector<pair<int, int>> sortedQueries;
    for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); ++i) {
        sortedQueries.push_back({queries[i], i});
    }
    
    // Sort queries based on the query value
    sort(sortedQueries.begin(), sortedQueries.end());
    
    // Min-heap to keep track of intervals sorted by their length
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> minHeap;
    
    vector<int> result(queries.size(), -1);
    int intervalIndex = 0;
    
    // Process each query in sorted order
    for (const auto& [query, originalIndex] : sortedQueries) {
        // Add all applicable intervals to the heap
        while (intervalIndex < intervals.size() && intervals[intervalIndex][0] <= query) {
            int start = intervals[intervalIndex][0];
            int end = intervals[intervalIndex][1];
            minHeap.push({end - start + 1, end});
            ++intervalIndex;
        }
        
        // Remove intervals from the heap that can't include the query
        while (!minHeap.empty() && minHeap.top().second < query) {
            minHeap.pop();
        }
        
        // The top of the heap is the smallest interval that includes the query
        if (!minHeap.empty()) {
            result[originalIndex] = minHeap.top().first;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> intervals = \{\{1,4}, {2,4}, {3,6}};
    vector<int> queries = {2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> result = minInterval(intervals, queries);
    
    for (int res : result) {
        cout << res << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code effectively solves the problem by leveraging sorting and a priority queue to ensure efficient query resolution, maintaining the balance between preprocessing through sorting and dynamically updating interval candidates using a min-heap.
