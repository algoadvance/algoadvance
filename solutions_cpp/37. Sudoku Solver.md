[Leetcode 37. Sudoku Solver](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l37)
### Problem Statement

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A Sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:
1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
    
The '.' character indicates empty cells.

You are given a 9x9 board representing a partially filled Sudoku board.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, it's important to clarify a few things:
1. Will the given board always be valid, or do we need to handle invalid boards?
2. Do we need to return the board in place, or can we return a new one?
3. Are there any performance constraints we should be aware of?

Assuming standard constraints for a LeetCode problem:
- The input board will always be valid according to the problem description.
- Modify the board in place.
- Performance should be optimized, but given the 9x9 nature, it falls within acceptable limits for backtracking solutions.

### Strategy

We'll use a backtracking algorithm to solve this problem. Here are the key steps:

1. **Backtracking Approach:** 
    - Iterate through each cell in the board.
    - If an empty cell ('.') is found, try placing numbers from '1' to '9'.
    - After placing a number, recursively attempt to solve the rest of the board.
    - If placing a number leads to a solution, we are done.
    - If placing a number does not lead to a solution, backtrack by removing the number and trying the next possible number.
    - Continue this process until the board is completely filled.

2. **Validation Function:**
    - Check if placing a number in a given cell is valid (i.e., complies with Sudoku rules).

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        solve(board);
    }

private:
    bool solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        for (int row = 0; row < 9; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < 9; ++col) {
                if (board[row][col] == '.') {
                    for (char num = '1'; num <= '9'; ++num) {
                        if (isValid(board, row, col, num)) {
                            board[row][col] = num;
                            if (solve(board)) {
                                return true;
                            }
                            board[row][col] = '.'; // backtrack
                        }
                    }
                    return false; // no valid number found, trigger backtracking
                }
            }
        }
        return true; // all cells filled correctly
    }

    bool isValid(const vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col, char num) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 9; ++i) {
            // Check the row
            if (board[row][i] == num) return false;
            // Check the column
            if (board[i][col] == num) return false;
            // Check the 3x3 sub-box
            if (board[(row / 3) * 3 + i / 3][(col / 3) * 3 + i % 3] == num) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the backtracking algorithm is difficult to analyze precisely due to the variable pruning as part of the backtrack. However, in the worst case, the complexity can be approximated as:

- **O(9^m)** where m is the number of empty cells. 
- For each empty cell, we try up to 9 possibilities, leading to this exponential complexity.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is:

- **O(1)** for the board itself if we modify it in place.
- **O(m)** stack space for recursion, where m is the number of empty cells due to recursive backtracking calls.

This solution effectively uses backtracking to fill the Sudoku board while validating placements using straightforward constraints checks.
