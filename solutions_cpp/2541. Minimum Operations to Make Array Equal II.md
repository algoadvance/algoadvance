[Leetcode 2541. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2541)
### Problem Statement
2541. **Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal II**

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length, we want to make these arrays equal. In one operation, you can decrease or increase the value of any element by 1. Return the minimum number of operations required to make `nums1` equal to `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraint on the values in the array:** Are there any constraints on the values (like non-negative integers)?
2. **Array Length:** Is the length of `nums1` and `nums2` guaranteed to be the same?

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(std::vector<int>& nums1, std::vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        int operations = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            operations += std::abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
        }

        return operations;
    }
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Difference Calculation:** The main idea is to calculate the total difference between corresponding elements of `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. **Absolute Difference:** For each element pair `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`, calculate the absolute difference.
3. **Sum of Differences:** Sum all the absolute differences. Each absolute difference represents the number of operations needed to make `nums1[i]` equal to `nums2[i]`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the arrays \(nums1\) and \(nums2\). This is because we simply iterate through the arrays once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as no extra space is used beyond a few variables for storage.
