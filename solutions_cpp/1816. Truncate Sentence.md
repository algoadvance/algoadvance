[Leetcode 1816. Truncate Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1816)
## Problem Statement
Given a sentence `s` and an integer `k`, you need to return the sentence formed by the first `k` words of `s`.

### Example:
- **Input**: `s = "Hello how are you Contestant"`, `k = 4`
- **Output**: `"Hello how are you"`

- **Input**: `s = "What is the solution to this problem"`, `k = 4`
- **Output**: `"What is the solution to"`

- **Input**: `s = "chopper is not a tanuki"`, `k = 5`
- **Output**: `"chopper is not a tanuki"`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a word?**
   - A word is any sequence of non-space characters.
2. **What is the range of values for `k` and the length of `s`?**
   - The number of words `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer â‰¤ the number of words in `s`.
   - The length of `s` will be at most 1000 characters.
3. **Are there any constraints on characters in `s`?**
   - The sentence `s` consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.

## Strategy
To solve this, we need to split the sentence `s` into words and then reconstruct the sentence using the first `k` words. Here are the steps:

1. **Split the input string `s` into words.** - This can be done via string manipulation techniques.
2. **Construct the resulting string from the first `k` words.**
3. **Return the constructed string.**

## Code
Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>

std::string truncateSentence(const std::string& s, int k) {
    std::istringstream iss(s);
    std::string word;
    std::vector<std::string> words;

    while (iss >> word) {
        words.push_back(word);
    }

    std::string result;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        if (i != 0) result += " ";
        result += words[i];
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
int main() {
    std::cout << truncateSentence("Hello how are you Contestant", 4) << std::endl; // Output: "Hello how are you"
    std::cout << truncateSentence("What is the solution to this problem", 4) << std::endl; // Output: "What is the solution to"
    std::cout << truncateSentence("chopper is not a tanuki", 5) << std::endl; // Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are reading through the string once to split it into words and then another pass to construct the output string from the first `k` words. In the worst case, each character of the string `s` is visited twice.
