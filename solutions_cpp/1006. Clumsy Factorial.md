[Leetcode 1006. Clumsy Factorial](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1006)
## Problem Statement
The problem is to calculate a "clumsy" factorial of a given integer `N`.

The clumsy factorial is defined using the operations in the following pattern:
- The first number is multiplied by the second, divided by the third, and then added to the fourth. This entire sequence is then repeated every four numbers, but with each new group of four numbers starting the operations after a subtraction instead of an addition.

Clumsily, the factorial for `N = 10` would be:  
`10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Handling divisions**: Should the division always result in integer division (i.e., truncation towards zero)?  
   **Answer**: Yes, according to the problem statement, the division is integer division.

2. **Value of N**: What is the range of `N`?  
   **Answer**: Based on typical constraints for such problems, `N` is likely to be a positive integer that would fit within typical integer range limits, i.e., `1 <= N <= 10000`.

3. **Zero and negative values**: Should we consider any special cases for values like `N = 0` (though stated as positive usually)?  
   **Answer**: The problem description implies `N` is always positive. So weâ€™ll proceed assuming `N >= 1`.

## Strategy
1. Start from `N` and iterate backwards, using a counter to track the operations `(multiplication, division, addition, subtraction)` in sequence.
2. Use integer division where needed.
3. Record the results accordingly, initiating with the first operation as multiplication, and applying the subsequent operations in the specified clumsy pattern.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int clumsy(int N) {
    if (N <= 0) return 0;
    if (N == 1) return 1;
    if (N == 2) return 2 * 1;
    if (N == 3) return 3 * 2 / 1;

    int result = N * (N - 1) / (N - 2) + (N - 3);
    N -= 4;
    
    while (N >= 4) {
        result -= N * (N - 1) / (N - 2);
        result += (N - 3);
        N -= 4;
    }
    
    if (N == 3) {
        result -= N * (N - 1) / (N - 2);
    } else if (N == 2) {
        result -= N * (N - 1);
    } else if (N == 1) {
        result -= N;
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int N = 10;  // Example usage
    cout << "Clumsy factorial of " << N << " is: " << clumsy(N) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(N)**, where `N` is the input number. The operations inside the loop are constant time operations, and the loop itself only halves the number of terms processed at each step for each iteration. Thus, it runs efficiently for typical constraints.
