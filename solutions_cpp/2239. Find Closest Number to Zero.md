[Leetcode 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2239)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the number with the value closest to zero. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of values that can be in `nums`?
   **A:** Values can be within the range of standard 32-bit integers, i.e., `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.
   
2. **Q:** What is the size range for the array `nums`?
   **A:** The size of the array `nums` can vary from 1 to `10^4`.

3. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate values?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

4. **Q:** Is the array always non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, according to the problem constraints, the array will always contain at least one number.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a variable to track the closest number to zero. Set it initially to the maximum possible integer value.
   
2. **Iteration through Array**: Iterate through the array, and for each element:
   - Compare its absolute value to the current closest absolute value.
   - If it is closer to zero, update the closest value.
   - If it is equally close but positive, prefer the positive value.

3. **Return Result**: At the end of the iteration, return the number stored in the closest value.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), because we need to iterate through the entire array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <climits>

int findClosestNumber(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    int closest = INT_MAX;

    for (int num : nums) {
        if (std::abs(num) < std::abs(closest) || 
           (std::abs(num) == std::abs(closest) && num > closest)) {
            closest = num;
        }
    }

    return closest;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   ```cpp
   int closest = INT_MAX;
   ```
   This ensures we have a starting comparison point that any number in the array will be closer to zero than.

2. **Iteration**:
   ```cpp
   for (int num : nums) {
       if (std::abs(num) < std::abs(closest) || 
          (std::abs(num) == std::abs(closest) && num > closest)) {
           closest = num;
       }
   }
   ```
   - We use `std::abs(num)` to get the absolute value of the current number.
   - We check if this absolute value is less than the absolute value of the current closest number.
   - If they are equal, we then check if the current number is greater than the closest number (to prefer positives).

3. **Return**:
   ```cpp
   return closest;
   ```
   This returns the number in the array that is closest to zero based on the criteria defined.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the desired number using a single pass through the array.
