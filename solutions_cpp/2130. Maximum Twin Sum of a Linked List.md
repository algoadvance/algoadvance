[Leetcode 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2130)
## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list containing an even number of nodes. For example, if the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4. A twin sum is defined for each node \(i\) as \( \text{node}(i) + \text{node}(n-i-1) \), where \(n\) is the total number of nodes and \(i\) ranges from 0 to \( \frac{n}{2} - 1 \). The goal is to find the maximum twin sum in this linked list.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- Nodes are (4, 2, 2, 3)
- Twin sums are: (4 + 3) and (2 + 2)
- Maximum twin sum is: 7
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints?**
    - The number of nodes is even.
    - The length of the linked list is in the range [2, 10^5].
    - Values of nodes are in the range [1, 10^5].

2. **Can the linked list be modified?**
    - If necessary, but preferably not.

3. **Any edge cases to consider?**
    - Minimum number of nodes is 2.

## Strategy

1. **Find the Middle of the Linked List:**
   - Use the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle node.

2. **Reverse the Second Half:**
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list to facilitate pairing from the ends.

3. **Calculate the Twin Sum:**
   - Iterate from the start of the linked list and the start of the reversed half to calculate the twin sums.

4. **Find the Maximum Twin Sum:**
   - Track the maximum sum encountered during the iteration.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int pairSum(ListNode* head) {
        // Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer method
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
        ListNode *prev = nullptr, *curr = slow, *next;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        // Step 3: Calculate twin sums and find the maximum
        int max_sum = 0;
        ListNode *first = head, *second = prev;
        while (second != nullptr) {
            max_sum = max(max_sum, first->val + second->val);
            first = first->next;
            second = second->next;
        }

        return max_sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Test the solution here
    ListNode* node4 = new ListNode(3);
    ListNode* node3 = new ListNode(2, node4);
    ListNode* node2 = new ListNode(2, node3);
    ListNode* node1 = new ListNode(4, node2);
    Solution sol;
    cout << "Max Twin Sum: " << sol.pairSum(node1) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Finding the Middle:** \( O(n) \)
2. **Reversing the Second Half:** \( O(n/2) \)
3. **Calculating the Maximum Twin Sum:** \( O(n/2) \)

The overall time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This ensures that the solution is efficient and suitable for large linked lists up to 100,000 nodes.
