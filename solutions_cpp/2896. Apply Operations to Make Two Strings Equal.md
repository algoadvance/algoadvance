[Leetcode 2896. Apply Operations to Make Two Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2896)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length, consisting of digits `0` and `1` only. You can perform the following operations on the strings:

1. **Swap any two characters** in `s1` and `s2`. This swap operation allows you to choose one character from `s1` and one character from `s2` and swap them.
2. **Swap within each string individually.** This operation allows choosing any two characters within a string and swap them.

Determine if you can make both strings equal by any number of the above operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the length of the strings**:
   - The strings `s1` and `s2` are of equal length.
   - Length (n) is `1 <= n <= 1000`.

2. **Characters involved**:
   - Strings only consist of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

3. **Output**:
   - Return `true` if you can make both strings equal using the allowed operations.
   - Return `false` otherwise.

### Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences**:
   - First, count the number of `0's` and `1's` in both strings.
   - If the counts of `0's` and `1's` are not the same in both strings, it is impossible to make them equal.

2. **Check Swappability**:
   - The swaps allow any permutation of the characters in `s1` and any permutation of the characters in `s2`.
   - This means the specific order of characters does not matter as long as the count of each character is the same.

### Time Complexity

- Counting each character takes `O(n)` time complexity for each string.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

bool canMakeEqual(string s1, string s2) {
    // Check if both strings are of the same length
    if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Initialize counters
    int count1[2] = {0, 0};
    int count2[2] = {0, 0};
    
    // Count occurrences of '0' and '1' in both strings
    for (size_t i = 0; i < s1.length(); ++i) {
        count1[s1[i] - '0']++;
        count2[s2[i] - '0']++;
    }
    
    // Check if both strings have the same number of '0's and '1's
    return count1[0] == count2[0] && count1[1] == count2[1];
}

int main() {
    string s1 = "1100";
    string s2 = "0011";
    cout << (canMakeEqual(s1, s2) ? "true" : "false") << endl;  // Output should be true
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization and Length Check**: We start by checking the lengths of the strings. Since the problem specifies equal lengths, this should always pass.
2. **Counting Characters**: We use arrays `count1` and `count2` to store the counts of `0's` and `1's` for both strings.
3. **Comparing Counts**: Finally, we check if the counts match for both characters. If they do, it implies that the strings can be made equal through the allowed operations.

This implementation efficiently checks for the possibility of making the strings equal using the allowed operations within `O(n)` time.
