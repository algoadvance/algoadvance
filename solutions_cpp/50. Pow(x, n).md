[Leetcode 50. Pow(x, n)](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l50)
## Problem Statement

Implement `pow(x, n)`, which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (`x^n`).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `x` be any real number?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can `n` be any integer, including negative values?**
   - Yes.

3. **What are the constraints on the input values `x` and `n`?**
   - Typically, constraints on such problems are within the range of double precision for `x` and within the range of int for `n`.

4. **Are there any special cases we need to handle?**
   - Yes, we need to handle cases like when `n` is 0 (return 1), or when `x` is 0 (consider edge cases with `n` being positive, negative or zero).

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using an efficient algorithm known as **Exponentiation by Squaring**, which works in `O(log n)` time complexity. This method helps in reducing the time complexity compared to a naive approach which would take `O(n)` time.

### Approach:

1. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If `x` is 0:
     - If `n` is positive, return `0`.
     - If `n` is zero, typically 0 raised to the power 0 is considered as 1.
     - If `n` is negative, handle by returning a statement (It's generally undefined; mathematically referred to as infinity).
   - If `n` is 0, return 1 since any number raised to the power 0 is 1.

2. **Handling Negative Power:**
   - If `n` is negative, compute the positive power of 1/x to the absolute value of `n`.

3. **Exponentiation by Squaring:**
   - Recursively break down the power into smaller components.
   - If `n` is even, `x^n` can be broken down into `(x * x)^(n / 2)`.
   - If `n` is odd, `x^n` can be broken down into `x * x^(n - 1)`.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

class Solution {
public:
    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        // Edge cases:
        if (x == 0) {
            if (n > 0) return 0;
            else if (n == 0) return 1;
            else return INFINITY; // undefined case for x = 0 and n < 0
        }
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return x;
        
        long long N = n; // To handle INT_MIN case
        if (N < 0) {
            x = 1 / x;
            N = -N;
        }
        
        return fastPow(x, N);
    }
    
private:
    double fastPow(double x, long long n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1.0;
        double half = fastPow(x, n / 2);
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return half * half;
        } else {
            return half * half * x;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::cout << sol.myPow(2.00000, 10) << std::endl; // Output: 1024.00000
    std::cout << sol.myPow(2.10000, 3) << std::endl;  // Output: 9.26100
    std::cout << sol.myPow(2.00000, -2) << std::endl; // Output: 0.25000
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is `O(log n)`:

- **Exponentiation by Squaring**: Reduces the problem size by half each time (`n/2`), leading to a logarithmic time complexity.

The space complexity is `O(log n)` due to the recursive call stack for the `fastPow` function.
