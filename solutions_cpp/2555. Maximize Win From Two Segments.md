[Leetcode 2555. Maximize Win From Two Segments](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2555)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `prizes` representing the prizes on a series of positions, and an integer `k` representing the maximum length of each segment, you want to maximize the sum of prizes you can obtain by selecting exactly two non-overlapping segments.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range and Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values inside the `prizes` array?
    - What is the range of the integer `k`?
    - Are there any specific constraints on the indices that need to be considered?

2. **Overlap**:
    - Should the selected segments be strictly non-overlapping, i.e., no shared starting or ending indices?

3. **Output**:
    - What should be returned? The maximum sum possible by picking the two segments?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int maxSumTwoNoOverlap(vector<int>& A, int L, int M) {
    // Rolling sum variables.
    int n = A.size();
    vector<int> sumA(n + 1, 0);

    // Precompute presum which will help in calculating sum in constant time.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        sumA[i + 1] = sumA[i] + A[i];
    }

    // Initialize the max sums.
    int maxL = 0, maxM = 0;
    int result = 0;

    // Traverse through each possible end index of L length segment
    for (int i = L + M; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Evaluate and update possible maximum L length segment
        maxL = max(maxL, sumA[i - M] - sumA[i - M - L]);
        // Evaluate maximum combination sum using up-to-date maxL
        result = max(result, maxL + sumA[i] - sumA[i - M]);
    }

    // Reset for the reverse
    maxL = 0;

    // Traverse through each possible end index of M length segment
    for (int i = L + M; i <= n; ++i) {
        // Evaluate and update possible maximum M length segment
        maxM = max(maxM, sumA[i - L] - sumA[i - L - M]);
        // Evaluate maximum combination sum using up-to-date maxM
        result = max(result, maxM + sumA[i] - sumA[i - L]);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Array**:
    - First, create a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. **Traverse Twice**:
    - Traverse the array twice:
        - Once to find the maximum sum if the first subarray of length `L` is chosen before the subarray of length `M`.
        - Once to find the maximum sum if the first subarray of length `M` is chosen before the subarray of length `L`.

3. **Dynamic Update**:
    - For each position, dynamically update the maximum possible sum for the segments.

4. **Result Gathering**:
    - In each pass, gather the maximum sum possible using non-overlapping segments.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The prefix sum array creation and following double traversal lead to an overall time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `prizes` array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional prefix sum array.

This solution efficiently maximizes the sum of prizes by using dynamic programming concepts embedded within a double sweep of the array.
