[Leetcode 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1899)
## Problem Statement:

Leetcode Problem #1899: "Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet"

A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where `triplets[i] = [a_i, b_i, c_i]`, and an integer array target = [x, y, z].

You want to form the target triplet [x, y, z] using a selection of triplets from the input array. To do this, select some of the triplets and merge them into one by taking:

- the maximum value of a_i from the selected triplets,
- the maximum value of b_i from the selected triplets, and
- the maximum value of c_i from the selected triplets.

Return `true` if you can form the target triplet [x, y, z] using a selection of the given triplets. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the values of elements within the triplets and the target triplet?
   - How many triplets can there be in the input list? 

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if there are no triplets in the input list?
   - Can the elements of the triplets be negative?

### Constraints:
- \(1 \leq \text{triplets.length} \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq a_i, b_i, c_i, x, y, z \leq 1000\)

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to check if we can form the target triplet [x, y, z] by merging the given triplets. The condition to form the target by selecting and merging the triplets is:
- We need at least one triplet such that `ai <= x`, `bi <= y`, `ci <= z`.
- By taking the maximum value of a, b, and c from valid triplets, we should be able to reach `x`, `y`, and `z`.

### Steps:
1. Iterate through each triplet.
2. Check if the current triplet can contribute to the target triplet without exceeding the target values.
3. Track the highest values of `a`, `b`, and `c` that are less than or equal to `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.
4. If at the end, the tracked values match the target `[x, y, z]`, then it is possible to form the target triplet; otherwise, it is not.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of triplets because we process each triplet only once.

## Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

bool mergeTriplets(vector<vector<int>>& triplets, vector<int>& target) {
    int maxA = 0, maxB = 0, maxC = 0;
    
    for (const auto& triplet : triplets) {
        if (triplet[0] <= target[0] && triplet[1] <= target[1] && triplet[2] <= target[2]) {
            maxA = max(maxA, triplet[0]);
            maxB = max(maxB, triplet[1]);
            maxC = max(maxC, triplet[2]);
        }
    }
    
    return maxA == target[0] && maxB == target[1] && maxC == target[2];
}

int main() {
    vector<vector<int>> triplets = {{2, 5, 3}, {1, 8, 4}, {3, 6, 5}};
    vector<int> target = {3, 6, 5};
    
    bool result = mergeTriplets(triplets, target);
    cout << (result ? "True" : "False") << endl; // Output should be "True"
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through the list of triplets, determines if they can potentially form the target triplet, and checks if the maximum values formed match the target values. If they do, it returns `true`, otherwise, `false`.
