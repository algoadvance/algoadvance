[Leetcode 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l829)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, return the number of ways you can write `n` as a sum of consecutive positive integers.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What should be done if `n` is a negative number or zero?
   **A:** `n` is always a positive integer in this problem as the problem mentions consecutive positive integers.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of `n`?
   **A:** The constraints on `n` are not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement. We should assume `n` can be a reasonably large integer.

### Strategy:
1. **Understanding the Formula:**
   - We can express `n` as:
     \[
     n = k + (k+1) + (k+2) + \ldots + (k+(m-1))
     \]
     This equation can be re-written using the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     n = m \cdot k + \frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2}
     \]
     Solving for `k` gives us:
     \[
     k = \frac{n - \frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2}}{m}
     \]
   - `k` must be a positive integer, so \( n - \frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2} \geq 0 \) and \( \frac{n - \frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2}}{m} \) must be an integer.

2. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Iterate over possible values of `m`.
   - For each `m`, check if \( n - \frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2} \) is non-negative and divisible by `m`.
   - Count all valid `m` that satisfy these conditions.

3. **Stopping Condition:**
   - Since \(\frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2}\) grows quadratically and must be less than or equal to `n`, we only need to consider `m` such that:
     \[
     m \cdot (m-1) \leq 2n
     \]

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach will be \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) because we only iterate through potential values of `m` up to roughly \(\sqrt{2n}\).

### C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        // Iterate m from 1 to the point where the formula makes sense
        for (int m = 1; m * (m - 1) / 2 < n; ++m) {
            // Check if (n - m*(m-1)/2) is divisible by m
            int val = n - m * (m - 1) / 2;
            if (val % m == 0) {
                ++count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    int n = 15; // input value
    std::cout << "Number of ways to write " << n << " as a sum of consecutive numbers: " << sol.consecutiveNumbersSum(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the provided code:
- We iterate over potential values of `m` starting from 1.
- For each `m`, we check if \( n - \frac{m \cdot (m-1)}{2} \geq 0 \) and if the result is divisible by `m`.
- We increment the count for each valid solution.

This should cover the problem requirements and ensures our solution is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(\sqrt{n}) \).
