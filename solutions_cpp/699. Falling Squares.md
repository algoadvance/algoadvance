[Leetcode 699. Falling Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l699)
Sure, let's walk through solving the problem "699. Falling Squares" from LeetCode.

### Problem Statement

On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.

- The `i`-th square drops with its left edge aligned at position `positions[i][0]`, and it has a side length of `positions[i][1]`.
- Each square leads to a positive integer height change, meaning if a square drops and causes other squares beneath it to stack up, this height change should be noted.

Return a list where `ans[i]` represents the height of the structure after the `i-th` square drops.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the positions and lengths of the squares be positive integers?**
   - Yes, `positions[i][0]` and `positions[i][1]` are positive integers.
   
2. **Is it possible for squares to overlap?**
   - Yes, squares can overlap both partially and fully.
   
3. **What is the range of `positions` array size?**
   - Typically questions of this form will have constraints like \(1 \leq \text{positions.size()} \leq 10^4\).

### Strategy

We'll use a technique to keep track of the heights of sections of the line where squares have fallen. Specifically, we'll iterate through each square and determine:
- Where it intersects with previous squares.
- The resultant height of the square after it falls.

We'll maintain an array `heights` to track the current height after each square falls.

### Code

Below is a possible implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> fallingSquares(vector<vector<int>>& positions) {
        vector<pair<int, int>> intervals;  // {left, right, height}
        vector<int> result;
        int maxHeight = 0;

        for (const auto& pos : positions) {
            int left = pos[0];
            int size = pos[1];
            int right = left + size;
            int baseHeight = 0;

            // Calculate the base height where this square can sit
            for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
                if (interval.second > left && interval.first < right) {
                    baseHeight = max(baseHeight, interval.second);
                }
            }

            int newHeight = baseHeight + size;
            intervals.push_back({left, newHeight, right});
            maxHeight = max(maxHeight, newHeight);
            result.push_back(maxHeight);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Strategy Explained

1. **Tracking Intervals**:
   - We maintain a list of intervals where each interval is defined by a `left` position, `height`, and `right` position.
   - When adding a new square, we calculate its base height by checking which intervals it intersects with.

2. **Determine Base Height**:
   - For each square, we iterate through existing intervals to determine the highest point it will land on if it intersects with any previous squares.

3. **Update Intervals and Heights**:
   - Push the new square as an interval with updated height.
   - Maintain the maximum height encountered so far.

### Time Complexity

- **Complexity per iteration**: O(n) for each step where `n` is the number of squares.
- **Overall complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case because each insertion might require iterating through all earlier intervals.

While this solution works correctly, it may become inefficient for very large inputs (e.g., \(n \approx 10^4\)). For such cases, advanced data structures like Segment Trees or Binary Indexed Trees (BIT) may be used to improve the performance.

I hope this solution and explanation help you understand how to solve the "Falling Squares" problem efficiently in C++. If you have any further questions or optimizations in mind, feel free to ask!
