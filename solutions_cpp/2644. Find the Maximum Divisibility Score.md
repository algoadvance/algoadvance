[Leetcode 2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2644)
### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`, return the divisor from `divisors` that has the maximum divisibility score. The divisibility score of a divisor is the number of elements in `nums` that are divisible by that divisor. If there is more than one divisor with the maximum score, return the smallest divisor.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the inputs?**
   - Typical constraints would be helpful to know, such as the maximum length of `nums` and `divisors` and the range of the values within these arrays.
2. **What should be returned if both `nums` and `divisors` are empty?**
   - Clarifying an edge case where inputs might be empty can help in structuring our solution.
3. **Can the elements in `nums` or `divisors` be negative?**
   - This affects how we calculate divisibility.

### Assumptions
- Based on common constraints, we can assume:
  - The lengths of `nums` and `divisors` are reasonable for an O(n * m) solution.
  - Elements in `nums` and `divisors` are non-negative integers (assuming divisors would typically be positive for common problems of this nature).

### Strategy
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - A variable to keep track of the maximum score.
   - A variable to keep the best candidate divisor with the maximum score.

2. **Iterate Over Divisors:**
   - For each divisor in the `divisors` list, count how many elements in `nums` are divisible by the divisor.
   - If the count for the current divisor is higher than our current maximum score, update the maximum score and set the current divisor as the best candidate.
   - If the count is equal to the current maximum score but the current divisor is smaller than the best candidate, update the best candidate.

3. **Return the Best Candidate:**
   - Finally, return the divisor with the maximum divisibility score or the smallest such divisor in case of ties.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>

int maxDivisibilityScore(const std::vector<int>& nums, const std::vector<int>& divisors) {
    int maxScore = 0;
    int bestDivisor = INT_MAX;

    for (int divisor : divisors) {
        int currentScore = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % divisor == 0) {
                currentScore++;
            }
        }

        if (currentScore > maxScore) {
            maxScore = currentScore;
            bestDivisor = divisor;
        } else if (currentScore == maxScore) {
            bestDivisor = std::min(bestDivisor, divisor);
        }
    }

    return bestDivisor;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is the number of elements in `divisors`.
  - This is because for each divisor, we inspect all elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:**
   - The `maxScore` is initialized to 0 and `bestDivisor` to a very large value (INT_MAX) ensuring any real divisor will be smaller.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - For each divisor, we count how many numbers in `nums` are divisible by it.
   - If a divisor manages to get a higher count than the current `maxScore`, it becomes the `bestDivisor` and updates the `maxScore`.
   - If the count is equal, the smaller of the current `bestDivisor` and the current divisor is chosen.
   
3. **Return:**
   - The `bestDivisor` with the maximum score (or smallest in case of ties) is returned.

By following this strategy, we ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient within the provided constraints.
