[Leetcode 1304. Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1304)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, return any array containing `n` unique integers such that they add up to 0.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of the input integer `n`?
   - There are no specific constraints given, so we will assume that `n` is a non-negative integer.
2. Can `n` be zero?
   - If `n` is zero, the output should be an empty array.
3. Is there a specific order in which the integers should appear in the output array?
   - No specific order is mentioned, so any order is acceptable as long as the sum is zero.

### Strategy:
1. If `n` is zero, return an empty array.
2. Otherwise, create an array of length `n` such that the sum of the elements is zero. 
3. One simple strategy is to include pairs of integers `(-i, i)` for `i` from `1` to `n/2`. This ensures each pair sums to zero.
4. If `n` is odd, include `0` in the array since including `0` does not change the sum.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> sumZero(int n) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    
    // Add pairs (-i, i) to the result vector
    for(int i = 1; i <= n / 2; ++i) {
        result.push_back(-i);
        result.push_back(i);
    }
    
    // If n is odd, add 0 to the result vector
    if(n % 2 == 1) {
        result.push_back(0);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation:
- We initialize an empty vector `result` to store the integers.
- We then add pairs of integers `(-i, i)` from `1` to `n/2`. Each pair sums up to zero.
- If `n` is odd, we add an additional `0` to ensure the total number of integers is `n` and the sum is zero.
  
### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) since we iterate from `1` to `n/2` and possibly add one more element if `n` is odd.
- The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage of the `n` integers in the result vector.
