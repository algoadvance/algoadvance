[Leetcode 2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2507)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer `n`. Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors until `n` remains the same. Return the smallest value `n` that can be achieved after repeatedly performing this replacement.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Does `n` always start as a positive integer?**
    - Yes.

2. **If `n` is already a prime number, should we just return `n`?**
    - Yes, as prime numbers cannot be decomposed further into other prime factors.

3. **What should we do in terms of optimization, given that the value of `n` can be very large?**
    - We need to consider efficient prime factorization and updating the value of `n` iteratively until it stabilizes.

### Strategy:
1. **Prime Factorization**: Create a function to find the sum of prime factors of `n`.
2. **Replacement Process**: Replace `n` continuously with the sum of its prime factors until `n` remains the same.
3. **Loop Prevention**: Ensure the loop halts when `n` reaches a steady state.

### Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Function to get the sum of prime factors of a number
int sumOfPrimeFactors(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    // Check for number of 2s
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
        sum += 2;
        n /= 2;
    }
    
    // Check for odd prime factors
    for (int i = 3; i <= sqrt(n); i += 2) {
        while (n % i == 0) {
            sum += i;
            n /= i;
        }
    }
    
    // If n becomes a prime number greater than 2
    if (n > 2) {
        sum += n;
    }
    
    return sum;
}

int smallestValue(int n) {
    int current = n;
    while (true) {
        int next = sumOfPrimeFactors(current);
        if (next == current) {
            break;
        }
        current = next;
    }
    return current;
}

// Example usage
int main() {
    int n = 12;
    std::cout << "Smallest value after replacements for " << n << " is " << smallestValue(n) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sum of Prime Factors Function** (`sumOfPrimeFactors`):
    - Factorize `n` by dividing continually by 2 first (to handle even numbers).
    - Then, for all odd potential factors up to the square root of `n`, divide continually and add to the sum.
    - If `n` ends up being a prime number greater than 2, add it to the sum.
  
2. **Smallest Value Function** (`smallestValue`):
    - Iteratively calls the sum of prime factors function and updates `n`.
    - Stops the loop when the sum of the prime factors equals the previous value of `n`.

### Time Complexity:
1. **Sum of Prime Factors**: The time complexity is `O(sqrt(n))` for each number due to the factorization up to the square root.
2. **Overall Complexity**: Since the value of `n` decreases or stabilizes over iterations, the while-loop will run a small number of times. Hence, overall complexity is effectively `O(k * sqrt(n))`, where `k` is the number of iterations needed to reach a stable `n`.

This solution ensures that the process is efficient even for larger values of `n`.
