[Leetcode 239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l239)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`, and there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position, return the max value of the window.

Implement the function `vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k)` which returns the list of maximums.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the array?**
   - The array size `n` where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
   
2. **What are the values of the elements in the array?**
   - The values of the elements in `nums` are within the range of `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Do the values of `k` and `n` have any specific constraints?**
   - Yes, `1 <= k <= n`.

4. **Is the input array always non-empty?**
   - Based on the constraints, yes, the input array is always non-empty.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a deque (double-ended queue) data structure. The basic idea is:

1. **Maintain a Deque:**
   - The deque will store indices of the array elements.
   - The elements in the deque will be in decreasing order of their values in the array.
   
2. **Sliding Window Mechanism:**
   - For each element in the array, we'll add it to the deque while maintaining the order.
   - We'll remove elements from the deque that are out of the current window.
   - The first element of the deque is always the maximum of the current window.

3. **Efficient Updates:**
   - By using deque operations (push and pop from both ends), we keep the operations on average O(1).

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm processes each element exactly twice (once added and once removed from the deque).
- Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n).

## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

vector<int> maxSlidingWindow(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    vector<int> result;
    deque<int> deq; // stores indices
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // Remove elements that are out of this window
        if (!deq.empty() && deq.front() == i - k) {
            deq.pop_front();
        }
        
        // Remove elements that are smaller than the current element
        // from the deque
        while (!deq.empty() && nums[deq.back()] < nums[i]) {
            deq.pop_back();
        }
        
        deq.push_back(i);
        
        // The front of the deque is the largest element of the current window
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            result.push_back(nums[deq.front()]);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result` vector to store maximums.
   - `deque<int> deq` to store indices.

2. **Iterate Over Elements:**
   - For each element `nums[i]`:
     - Remove indices that are out of the current window (indices `i - k` and beyond).
     - Remove indices whose values are smaller than `nums[i]` to maintain a decreasing order in the deque.
     - Add the current index `i` to the deque.
     - Once we have processed at least the first `k` elements, add the current window's maximum (front of deque) to the result.

By following the above steps, we ensure the maximum elements for each window are found efficiently.
