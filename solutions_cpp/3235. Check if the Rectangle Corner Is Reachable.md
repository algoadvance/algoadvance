[Leetcode 3235. Check if the Rectangle Corner Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3235)
### Problem Statement

We need to determine whether a given corner of a rectangle is reachable from the origin (0, 0). The corner is defined by its coordinates (x, y). You are allowed to move to any point (a + b, a - b), where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers. That is, you can simulate moving right-down or left-up in steps. Given `x` and `y`, write a function to determine if the point (x, y) is reachable from (0, 0).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** 
    - Are `x` and `y` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
    - What is the maximum value for `x` and `y`?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the function return a boolean value indicating the reachability?

3. **Directional moves:**
    - Are we allowed to partition the moves into any sequence of steps? For instance, can we keep moving right for several steps then move down?

4. **Range specifics:**
    - Could the rectangle dimensions be zero (where x or y is zero)?

For assumption, we'll proceed with:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers in a reasonably bounded range for typical interview problems.
- The function should return a boolean value.
  
### Strategy

In this problem, we need to check if the corner defined by (x, y) is reachable starting from (0, 0) given the movement rules. The movement rules highly suggest investigating a mathematical property inherent in the coordinates.

#### Observations and Approach:

We can observe that the operations allowed resemble adding coordinates and suggests GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) properties due to their linear combination nature. If we can always reduce the problem to compare `gcd` of given values, we have a way of checking reachability:
- We should test if the `gcd(x, y)` is 1 because if it is, then (1, 1) path can be scaled up to (x, y) via repeated applications of allowed operations.

#### Algorithm:
1. We will use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`.
2. If `gcd(x, y)` equals 1, then the point (x, y) is reachable from (0, 0). Else, it isnâ€™t.

### Code

Here is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

/**
 * Function to calculate GCD of two numbers
 */
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}

/**
 * Function to determine if (x, y) is reachable from (0, 0)
 */
bool isReachable(int x, int y) {
    return gcd(x, y) == 1;
}

// Main function to test
int main() {
    int x = 3;
    int y = 7;
    if (isReachable(x, y)) {
        std::cout << "The corner (" << x << ", " << y << ") is reachable from (0, 0)." << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The corner (" << x << ", " << y << ") is NOT reachable from (0, 0)." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for computing the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm is `O(log(min(x, y)))`. Since computing GCD is the major step in our algorithm, the total time complexity is `O(log(min(x, y)))`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the reachability of the point (x, y) from (0, 0) based on allowed moves.
