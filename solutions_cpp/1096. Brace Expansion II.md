[Leetcode 1096. Brace Expansion II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1096)
## Problem Statement

Given an expression representing a set of words with `{,}`, `,` and `{`, `}` that form groups, return all possible words formed by expanding the groups in sorted order.

For example, the expression "a{b,c}" generates "ab" and "ac", and the expression "{a,b}{c{d,e}}" generates "acd", "ace", "bcd", and "bce".

### Example:
1. Input: "{a,b}{c{d,e}}"
   Output: ["acd", "ace", "bcd", "bce"]

2. Input: "\{\{a,z},a{b,c},{ab,z}}"
   Output: ["a", "ab", "ac", "z"]

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the expression be nested deeply?**
   - Yes, expressions can be nested deeply with multiple levels of `{}`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the input's length?**
   - The length of the input expression will be relatively moderate to fit typical LeetCode constraints.

3. **What should be the output format?**
   - The result should be a list of strings in sorted order.

4. **Can we assume the input is always a valid expression?**
   - Yes, you may assume the input expression is valid.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, you need to iteratively expand the groups of characters and combine the results appropriately. We can consider three main operations:
1. **Parsing the string** to identify groups and individual characters.
2. **Combining sets** of words formed by individual characters and groups.
3. **Sorting the final set of words** to obtain the required output.

We can use a stack-based approach or recursion to handle nested structures effectively. Here's a possible strategy:
1. **Recursive Parsing:** Treat input string parsing recursively, breaking down the expression whenever nested braces are identified.
2. **Set Operations:** Use sets to manage and eliminate duplicates and perform union and cartesian product operations.
3. **Lexicographical Sorting:** Ensure the final output is sorted lexicographically.

## Code Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <stack>
#include <set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> braceExpansionII(string expression) {
        return vector<string>(helper(expression).begin(), helper(expression).end());
    }
    
private:
    set<string> helper(const string &exp) {
        stack<set<string>> stk;
        set<string> current, temp;
        current.insert("");
        
        for (int i = 0; i < exp.size(); ++i) {
            if (exp[i] == '{') {
                stk.push(current);
                current.clear();
            } else if (exp[i] == '}') {
                temp = current;
                current = stk.top();
                stk.pop();
                
                set<string> combined;
                for (const string &t : current) {
                    for (const string &s : temp) {
                        combined.insert(t + s);
                    }
                }
                current = combined;
            } else if (exp[i] == ',') {
                stk.push(current);
                current.clear();
            } else {
                // Handle characters
                int j = i;
                while (j < exp.size() && exp[j] != '{' && exp[j] != '}' && exp[j] != ',') ++j;
                string part = exp.substr(i, j - i);
                i = j - 1;

                set<string> newSet;
                for (const string &str : current) {
                    newSet.insert(str + part);
                }

                current = newSet;
            }

            // If there was a ',' comma, perform union
            if (i < exp.size() && exp[i] == ',') {
                temp = stk.top();
                stk.pop();
                current.insert(temp.begin(), temp.end());
            }
        }
        
        return current;
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is challenging to determine precisely due to the nested nature of brace expansions. However, each character in the string is processed at most a few times, leading to complexity in the worst-case scenario which involves exponential expansion for deeply nested and combinatorially complex expressions.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also proportional to the size of the final expanded set, which can potentially be very large in the worst case.

This solution involves heavy use of recursion and set operations to handle nested structures and merge results, maintaining efficiency through careful string parsing and combination operations.
