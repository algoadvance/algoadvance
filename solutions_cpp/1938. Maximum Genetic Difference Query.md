[Leetcode 1938. Maximum Genetic Difference Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1938)
### Problem Statement

You are given two separate sequences:

1. A **rooted tree** consisting of `n` nodes with `0` as the root. The tree nodes are labeled from `0` to `n-1` and the `parent` array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`.
2. A list of **queries**. Each query contains two integers, `u` and `v`. For each query, you want to find a node `w` in the subtree of node `u` that maximizes the genetic difference (exclusive OR) between `v` and `w`.

Output an array of integers where the `i-th` integer is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What are the constraints on the number of nodes and the number of queries?
2. **Node Values:** What are the possible values for `u` and `v` in the queries?
3. **Data Structures:** Can I assume the use of any particular data structure for efficient solving of the problem?

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    TrieNode* children[2];
    TrieNode() {
        children[0] = children[1] = nullptr;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    TrieNode* root;
    
    void insert(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; --i) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (!node->children[bit]) {
                node->children[bit] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[bit];
        }
    }
    
    void remove(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; --i) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            node = node->children[bit];
        }
        // Placeholder for a delete operation in Trie
    }
    
    int query(int num) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        int maxXor = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; --i) {
            int bit = (num >> i) & 1;
            if (node->children[1-bit]) {
                maxXor = maxXor | (1 << i);
                node = node->children[1-bit];
            } else {
                node = node->children[bit];
            }
        }
        return maxXor;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<int> tree[], int node, unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> &queries, vector<int> &results) {
        insert(node);
        if (queries.find(node) != queries.end()) {
            for (auto &q : queries[node]) {
                results[q.second] = query(q.first);
            }
        }
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            dfs(tree, child, queries, results);
        }
        remove(node);
    }
    
    vector<int> maxGeneticDifference(vector<int>& parents, vector<vector<int>>& q) {
        int n = parents.size();
        vector<int> tree[n];
        int root = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(parents[i] != -1) {
                tree[parents[i]].push_back(i);
            } else {
                root = i;
            }
        }
        
        unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> queries;
        for (int i = 0; i < q.size(); ++i) {
            queries[q[i][0]].emplace_back(q[i][1], i);
        }
        
        vector<int> results(q.size());
        root = new TrieNode;
        dfs(tree, root, queries, results);
        
        return results;
    }
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Trie Structure:** Use a Trie to store binary representations of node values.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Perform DFS traversal of the tree to dynamically update the Trie.
3. **Insert & Query:** For each node during DFS, insert the node value into the Trie. Answer the queries related to the node, and remove the node after processing its subtree.

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Query in Trie:** O(32) for each insertion, removal, and query operation (constant time, since integers are 32 bits).
- **DFS Traversal:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Query Handling:** Each query is handled in constant time O(1) during traversal.

The overall time complexity is approximately O(n + m), where `m` is the number of queries and `n` is the number of nodes. Given constant time for Trie operations, the complexity is efficient for typical problem constraints.

Note: Ensure correct deallocation and management of dynamic nodes in the Trie to avoid memory leaks.
