[Leetcode 2552. Count Increasing Quadruplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2552)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n`. Return the number of increasing quadruplets `(i, j, k, l)` such that:

- `0 <= i < j < k < l < n`
- `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array `nums` have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate values. The quadruplet indices need to satisfy the given conditions regardless of element values.

2. **What is the range of `n` (the size of the array)?**
   - The problem doesn’t explicitly state the range of `n`, but typical constraints will have `1 <= n <= 2000`.

3. **What should be returned if there are no increasing quadruplets?**
   - If there are no increasing quadruplets, the function should return `0`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, let's break down the steps and use combinatorial and traversal techniques:

1. **Brute Force Approach (for understanding):**
   - Iterate through all possible combinations of indices `(i, j, k, l)`.
   - Check the conditions `0 <= i < j < k < l < n` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`.
   - This approach is computationally expensive with `O(n^4)` complexity and is not feasible for larger arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Use pre-computation and dynamic counting.
   - We can pre-compute arrays or use data structures to keep track of counts of elements meeting the conditions during our traversal.

Given this breakdown, we can think of maintaining counts and running partial traversals to reduce the complexity from `O(n^4)` to a more feasible range.

### Code

Here’s a feasible implementation of the optimized approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int countQuadruplets(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;

        // We're using vectors to keep precomputed smaller and larger elements counts
        std::vector<int> pre_count_less(n, 0);  // Count of numbers less than nums[i] up to i-1
        std::vector<int> post_count_more(n, 0); // Count of numbers more than nums[i] from i+1 onward

        // Temporary arrays to store count of elements less and more than `nums`
        std::vector<int> less(n, 0), more(n, 0); 
        
        // Calculate pre_count_less
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                    pre_count_less[i]++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Calculate post_count_more
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; --i) {
            for (int j = n-1; j > i; --j) {
                if (nums[j] > nums[i]) {
                    post_count_more[i]++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Calculate the number of quadruplets
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int k = i + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                if (nums[i] < nums[k]) {
                    less[k]++;
                }
            }
            for (int j = i + 2; j < n; ++j) {
                if (nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                    for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                        if (nums[k] < nums[j]) {
                            count += less[k] * post_count_more[j];
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pre-computation of `pre_count_less` and `post_count_more`:** `O(n^2)`
- **Traversing and counting quadruplets:** `O(n^2)`
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2 + n^2) = O(n^2)`.

### Conclusion

This approach leverages the power of pre-computation to bring down the complexity from exponential to quadratic, making it suitable for typical constraint limits found in interview questions. The provided implementation avoids the pitfalls of nested quadruple loops through strategic counting and efficient traversal.
