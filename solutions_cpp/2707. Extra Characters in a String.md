[Leetcode 2707. Extra Characters in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2707)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `dictionary`. You need to determine the minimum number of characters left after you remove any occurrences of words in the dictionary from the string `s`.

For example, given `s = "leetscodesarefun"` and `dictionary = ["leet", "code", "codes", "fun"]`, you can remove "leet", "codes", and "fun" to get an empty string, thus the answer would be 0 because no characters are left.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are repetitions of words from the dictionary allowed in `s`?**
   - Yes, words from the dictionary can appear multiple times in `s`.

2. **Can the words from the dictionary overlap in the string `s`?**
   - Yes, words can overlap. For example, if `s = "aaa"` and `dictionary = ["aa", "a"]`, the possible removals can be complex.

3. **What should be returned if no words from the dictionary can be completely removed from `s`?**
   - Return the length of the string `s` in this case.

## Strategy

We'll need to use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum characters left after trying to remove words from the dictionary. We'll use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of leftover characters after considering the first `i` characters of `s`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize a dp array**: `dp` with size `s.length() + 1` where `dp[0] = 0` (base case: no characters considered, hence no leftover characters).
2. **Iterate over the string**: For each position in the string, check if any word in the dictionary ends at that position. If so, update the `dp` table accordingly.
3. **Word Removal Check**: For every word in the dictionary, check if it ends at the current position in `s` by matching substrings.
4. **Update dp table**: If a word from the dictionary is found ending at position `i`, compute the new possible value for `dp[i+1]`.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity will be `O(n * m * k)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is the number of words in the dictionary, and `k` is the maximum length of a word in the dictionary.
  
## Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minExtraChar(string s, vector<string>& dictionary) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0; // Base case

        unordered_set<string> wordSet(dictionary.begin(), dictionary.end());

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (dp[i] == INT_MAX) continue;
            
            // Try to extend dp[i] by adding each possible word from dictionary ending at j
            for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                string substring = s.substr(i, j - i + 1);
                if (wordSet.find(substring) != wordSet.end()) {
                    dp[j + 1] = min(dp[j + 1], dp[i]);
                } else {
                    dp[j + 1] = min(dp[j + 1], dp[i] + (j - i + 1));
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

This solution efficiently evaluates the minimum number of extra characters left after considering all possible removals of dictionary words from the string `s`.
