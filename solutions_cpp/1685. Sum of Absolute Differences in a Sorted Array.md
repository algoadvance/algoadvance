[Leetcode 1685. Sum of Absolute Differences in a Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1685)
## Problem Statement:
Given a sorted array `nums` of integers, return the sum of absolute differences between each pair of elements for every element in the array.

Consider two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` where `i != j`. The absolute difference between the two elements is `|nums[i] - nums[j]|`. For each element in the array, sum these absolute differences and return the result for each element in an array.

### Example:
**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [2,3,5]
```
**Output:**
```cpp
[4,3,5]
```

**Explanation:**
- For `nums[0] = 2`, the absolute differences are `|2-3| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4`.
- For `nums[1] = 3`, the absolute differences are `|3-2| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `nums[2] = 5`, the absolute differences are `|5-2| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. What are the constraints on the elements of the array (e.g., size of the array, range of elements)?
2. Can the array contain duplicates?
3. Is the array guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order?

## Strategy:

1. **Prefix and Suffix Sums Approach:** 
   - Given the array is sorted, for each element `nums[i]`, you can leverage prefix and suffix sums to efficiently compute the sum of absolute differences.
   - Maintain a prefix sum array that captures the sum of elements up to the current index.
   - Similarly, maintain a suffix sum array that captures the sum of elements from the current index to the end.
   - For a given index `i`, the sum of absolute differences can be derived from the prefix and suffix sums.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Compute the prefix sums: `prefix[i]` is the sum of elements from the start to `i`.
2. Compute the suffix sums: `suffix[i]` is the sum of elements from `i` to the end.
3. For each element in `nums`, calculate the absolute difference sum using the prefix and suffix sums:
   \[
   \text{sum\_absolute\_differences}(i) = (i \cdot nums[i] - \text{prefix}[i]) + (\text{suffix}[i+1] - (n - i - 1) \cdot nums[i])
   \]
   where \(n\) is the size of the array.

## Code:
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> getSumAbsoluteDifferences(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> prefix(n, 0), suffix(n, 0), result(n, 0);

    // Compute prefix sums
    prefix[0] = nums[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }

    // Compute suffix sums
    suffix[n - 1] = nums[n-1];
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        suffix[i] = suffix[i + 1] + nums[i];
    }

    // Calculate the sum of absolute differences for each element
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int leftSum = (i > 0) ? (i * nums[i] - prefix[i-1]) : 0;
        int rightSum = (i < n-1) ? (suffix[i+1] - (n - i - 1) * nums[i]) : 0;
        result[i] = leftSum + rightSum;
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Prefix Sum and Suffix Sum Calculation:** O(n)
- **Result Calculation:** O(n)
- Overall, the solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
