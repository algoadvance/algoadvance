[Leetcode 2369. Check if There is a Valid Partition For The Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2369)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You have to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays.

A partition is called valid if each subarray meets one of the following conditions:
1. The subarray consists of exactly 2 equal elements. For example, subarray `[2,2]` is valid.
2. The subarray consists of exactly 3 equal elements. For example, subarray `[4,4,4]` is valid.
3. The subarray consists of exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between adjacent elements is 1. For example, subarray `[3,4,5]` is valid, but subarray `[1,3,5]` is not.

Return `true` if the array has at least one valid partition. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of the size of `nums`?
    - `nums.length` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

2. **Element Range**: What are the possible values for elements in `nums`?
    - Each element in `nums` will be in the range `[0, 10^6]`.

3. **Output Type**: What is the expected output type?
    - The expected output is a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

4. **Constraints on contiguity**: Are we allowed to re-arrange the elements of the array?
    - No, the partitions must be contiguous subarrays.

### Strategy

We can use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. Here's an outline of the approach:

1. **DP State Definition**: Let `dp[i]` be `true` if `nums[0:i]` can have a valid partition. Otherwise, it is `false`.

2. **Base Case**: Start by setting up the initial base cases:
    - `dp[0] = false` because an empty array cannot be partitioned.
    - `dp[1] = true` if `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` form a subarray satisfying one of the valid conditions.

3. **Transition**: Fill up the `dp` array using the defined valid conditions:
    - `dp[i] = true` if any of the following is `true`:
      1. `nums[i] == nums[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` is `true` (subarray of two equal elements ending at `i`).
      2. `nums[i] == nums[i-1] == nums[i-2]` and `dp[i-3]` is `true` (subarray of three equal elements ending at `i`).
      3. `nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1` and `nums[i] == nums[i-2] + 2` and `dp[i-3]` is `true` (subarray of three consecutive increasing elements ending at `i`).

4. **Result**: The result will be `dp[n-1]`.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool validPartition(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 1) return false;

        vector<bool> dp(n + 1, false);
        dp[0] = true; // base case for an empty prefix
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            // Condition 1: Two equal elements
            if (nums[i-1] == nums[i-2] && dp[i-2]) {
                dp[i] = true;
            }
            // Condition 2: Three equal elements
            if (i > 2 && nums[i-1] == nums[i-2] && nums[i-2] == nums[i-3] && dp[i-3]) {
                dp[i] = true;
            }
            // Condition 3: Three consecutive increasing elements
            if (i > 2 && nums[i-1] == nums[i-2] + 1 && nums[i-2] == nums[i-3] + 1 && dp[i-3]) {
                dp[i] = true;
            }
        }

        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

The solution checks each element exactly once after the initial loops, leading to an overall time complexity of:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the auxiliary `dp` array. This can be optimized to \(O(1)\) as we only need a few previous states in our transitions.

With this approach, we ensure that we efficiently check for all valid partitions while adhering to the given constraints.
