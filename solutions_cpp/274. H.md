[Leetcode 274. H](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l274)
### Problem Statement

The H-Index is a metric that aims to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar. Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their i-th paper, calculate the researcher's H-Index.

The H-Index is defined as follows: A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n - h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the size of the citations array?
   - Can the elements of the citations array be negative?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Should the output be an integer representing the H-Index?
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should the function handle the case where there are no papers?

### Strategy

To determine the H-Index, let's follow these steps:

1. **Sort the `citations` array in non-decreasing order.**
2. **Iterate from the end of the sorted array** and find the maximum value of `h` where `citations[i] >= h`.

### Code

Below is the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int hIndex(std::vector<int>& citations) {
    std::sort(citations.begin(), citations.end(), std::greater<int>());
    int h = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i++) {
        if (citations[i] >= i + 1) {
            h = i + 1;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    return h;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**:
   - We start by sorting the array in descending order.
   - This allows us to count from the highest citation downward and find the largest `h` where there are at least `h` papers with `h` or more citations.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate over the sorted array and check if the current paper's citation count is greater than or equal to the current index + 1 (to handle 0-based indexing).
   - We update `h` to be the maximum value of `i + 1` where the condition holds.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of papers.
2. **Iteration**: `O(n)`, iterating through the sorted array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`. This efficiency is suitable for typical input sizes in coding interviews and real-world scenarios.

I hope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarifications.
