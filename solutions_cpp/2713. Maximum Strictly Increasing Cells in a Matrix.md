[Leetcode 2713. Maximum Strictly Increasing Cells in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2713)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` matrix `matrix` consisting of positive integers. You can select any cell of the matrix as your starting point and traverse diagonally. In each step, you may move to any of the four directly connected diagonal cells (i.e., the cell at position `(r-1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, or `(r+1, c+1)`) if it contains a strictly greater value than the current cell.

Return the length of the longest path in the matrix.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix?**
   - The dimensions `m` and `n` can be large, up to 10^3.

2. **What should be returned if the matrix size is 0?**
   - An empty matrix should return a path length of 0.

3. **Are all the matrix numbers strictly positive?**
   - Yes, the problem confirms that the matrix consists of positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, dynamic programming (DP) can be used along with memoization to store intermediate results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1. **Define DP State:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest path starting from cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The value `dp[i][j]` can be computed by checking the four possible diagonal neighbors. If a neighbor has a greater value, we use the precomputed value of that neighbor to determine our current cell's path length.
   - Hence, `dp[i][j] = 1 + max(up_left, up_right, down_left, down_right)`.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If there are no valid diagonal neighbors with a strictly greater value, the path length starting at `(i, j)` will just be 1 (the cell itself).

4. **Memoization:**
   - Utilize a 2D `dp` array to store the length of the longest increasing path starting from each cell to avoid recomputation.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The result is the maximum value in the `dp` array after processing all cells.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxIncreasingCells(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, -1));
        
        function<int(int, int)> dfs = [&](int r, int c) -> int {
            if (dp[r][c] != -1) 
                return dp[r][c];
            
            int maxLength = 1;
            vector<pair<int, int>> directions = \{\{-1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {1, -1}, {1, 1}};
            
            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nr = r + dir.first;
                int nc = c + dir.second;
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n && matrix[nr][nc] > matrix[r][c]) {
                    maxLength = max(maxLength, 1 + dfs(nr, nc));
                }
            }
            
            dp[r][c] = maxLength;
            return maxLength;
        };

        int maxPath = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                maxPath = max(maxPath, dfs(i, j));
            }
        }
        
        return maxPath;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The function `dfs` is called for each cell only once, and each call processes up to four neighboring cells. Thus, the time complexity is `O(m * n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(m * n)` due to the DP array `dp`.

This solution should be efficient given the constraints and effectively solves the problem of finding the length of the longest increasing path in an `m x n` matrix.
