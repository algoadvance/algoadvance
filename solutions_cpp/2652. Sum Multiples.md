[Leetcode 2652. Sum Multiples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2652)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, find the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` inclusive that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 21
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 30
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values of `n` sufficiently large that performance becomes a concern?**
   - This will help determine if optimization is necessary.

2. **Is it guaranteed that `n` is always positive?**
   - This ensures we don't need to handle negative or zero cases.

3. **Are there any constraints on the range of `n`?**
   - This would guide whether edge cases or specific optimizations are needed.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a straightforward approach using a loop:

1. **Initialize a variable to store the cumulative sum.**
2. **Iterate from 1 to `n`.**
3. **For each number in this range, check if it is divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7` using the modulo operator.**
4. **If it is divisible, add it to the cumulative sum.**
5. **Return the cumulative sum.**

This approach is both straightforward and easy to implement. Given the constraints (1 through 10^4), the linear time complexity should be sufficient.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the input integer, because we iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

## Code

Here's the implementation in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfMultiples(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 || i % 7 == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution sol;
    std::cout << sol.sumOfMultiples(7) << std::endl;  // Output: 21
    std::cout << sol.sumOfMultiples(10) << std::endl; // Output: 40
    std::cout << sol.sumOfMultiples(9) << std::endl;  // Output: 30
    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, checks each one for divisibility by 3, 5, or 7, and adds it to the sum if it meets any condition. This achieves the desired result with linear time complexity.
