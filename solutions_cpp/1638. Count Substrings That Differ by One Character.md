[Leetcode 1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1638)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. You want to count the number of non-empty substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in `t` by exactly one character.

Example:
- Input: s = "aba", t = "baba"
- Output: 6

Explanation:
The substrings of `s` and `t` that differ by exactly one character are:
1. ("a", "b")
2. ("a", "b")
3. ("b", "a")
4. ("a", "b")
5. ("ab", "bb")
6. ("ba", "bb")

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the strings `s` and `t` have different lengths?**
   - Yes, they can have different lengths.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of `s` and `t`?**
   - Typically constraints like these need to be checked, but assume for simplicity they are within typical reasonable lengths for interview problems (e.g., <= 1000 characters).

3. **What is the character set for strings `s` and `t`?**
   - Assume `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach by considering all possible substrings of `s` and `t` and counting the ones that differ by exactly one character. However, this approach might be inefficient for longer strings. Instead, we'll opt for a more efficient approach:

1. **Traverse through all substrings of `s` and `t`:**
   - For each starting position in `s`, try each substring length.
   - For each substring of `s`, check all possible substrings of `t` of the same length to see if they differ by exactly one character.

2. **Check for exactly one character difference:**
   - Compare each substring pair character by character.
   - Count the number of differing characters. If they differ by exactly one, count it as a valid pair.

### Code

Here's the C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
    int m = s.size();
    int n = t.size();
    int count = 0;
    
    // Traverse each substring of s
    for(int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for(int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            int diffCount = 0;
            // Compare substrings starting from s[i] and t[j]
            for(int k = 0; i + k < m && j + k < n; ++k) {
                if (s[i + k] != t[j + k]) {
                    diffCount++;
                }
                
                if(diffCount == 1) {
                    count++;
                } else if(diffCount > 1) {
                    break; // No need to check further if differences > 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

int main() {
    string s = "aba";
    string t = "baba";
    cout << countSubstrings(s, t) << endl; // Output should be 6
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m^2 \times n^2)\), where \(m\) is the length of `s` and \(n\) is the length of `t`. This is because for each pair of starting points in `s` and `t`, we may compare up to the length of the remaining substring.

- The nested loops (i and j) run in \(O(m \times n)\).
- The innermost loop runs up to \(O(\min(m, n))\) for each pair of (i, j).

This complexity should be efficient enough given the constraints typically found in coding interviews, i.e., lengths up to around 1000 characters.
