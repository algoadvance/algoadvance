[Leetcode 1880. Check if Word Equals Summation of Two Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1880)
### Problem Statement
You are given three strings `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord`, each consisting of lowercase English letters. 

You need to determine if the summation of the numeric values of `firstWord` and `secondWord` equals the numeric value of `targetWord`.

The numeric value of a word is defined by concatenating the differences between each letter and 'a'. For instance, the numeric value of "acb" is defined as "021", representing the concatenation of 0 for 'a', 2 for 'c', and 1 for 'b'.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the lengths of `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord`?
    - All given strings are of length between 1 and 8.
2. **Character Set**: Can we assume all characters in the strings are valid lowercase English letters?
    - Yes.
3. **Output**: Should the function return a boolean value?
    - Yes, it should return `true` if the numeric value of `firstWord` + `secondWord` equals the numeric value of `targetWord`, otherwise `false`.

### Strategy
1. **Convert Word to Numeric Value**:
    - Write a helper function to convert a given word to its numeric value by computing the difference between each character and 'a', and then concatenating these differences.
2. **Compare the Summation**:
    - Convert `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord` to their respective numeric values.
    - Convert the resulting numeric strings to integers to perform the summation and comparison.

### Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSumEqual(string firstWord, string secondWord, string targetWord) {
        int num1 = convertToNumericValue(firstWord);
        int num2 = convertToNumericValue(secondWord);
        int targetNum = convertToNumericValue(targetWord);
        return (num1 + num2) == targetNum;
    }
    
private:
    int convertToNumericValue(const string& word) {
        int numericValue = 0;
        for (char c : word) {
            numericValue = numericValue * 10 + (c - 'a');
        }
        return numericValue;
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    cout << boolalpha << solution.isSumEqual("acb", "cba", "cdb") << endl; // Output: true
    cout << boolalpha << solution.isSumEqual("aaa", "a", "aab") << endl; // Output: false
    cout << boolalpha << solution.isSumEqual("aaa", "a", "aaaa") << endl; // Output: true
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Conversion**: Each string conversion has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string (maximum length is 8).
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity of the function `isSumEqual` is O(n), as it requires converting each of the three strings, ultimately leading to a constant time complexity given the maximum input length.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures requiring space proportional to input size are used outside the integer space for storing numeric values.

This solution efficiently addresses the problem using string manipulation and integer arithmetic constrained by given inputs.
