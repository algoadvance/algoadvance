[Leetcode 814. Binary Tree Pruning](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l814)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value of `0` or `1`. Prune the tree so that subtrees containing all `0`s are removed. A subtree of a node `node` is `node` plus every node that is a descendant of `node`.

Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a `1` has been removed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does the structure of a binary tree node look like?**
   Typically, a binary tree node in C++ might be defined as follows:
   ```cpp
   struct TreeNode {
       int val;
       TreeNode *left;
       TreeNode *right;
       TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
       TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
       TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
   };
   ```

2. **Can the input tree be empty?**
   Yes, the input tree can be empty (`root` could be `nullptr`).

3. **What should be returned if the entire tree is pruned?**
   If the entire tree is pruned, return `nullptr`.

### Strategy

1. **Post-order Traversal**
   - For each node, first process its left and right subtrees.
   - If any subtree does not contain a `1`, set the respective child pointer to `nullptr`.
   
2. **Recursive Function**
   - Define a recursive function that performs the pruning and returns the pruned tree.
   - The base case would be when the node is `nullptr`.
   - Recursively prune the left and right subtrees.
   - Determine whether to prune the current node based on its value and the status of its children.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is the space occupied by the call stack during recursion.

### Code

Here's an implementation in C++:

```cpp
// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* pruneTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        // Recursively prune the left and right subtrees
        root->left = pruneTree(root->left);
        root->right = pruneTree(root->right);
        
        // If the current node's value is 0 and both subtrees are nullptr, prune this node
        if (root->val == 0 && !root->left && !root->right) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Recursive Pruning**:
   - Start with the root node and recursively check the left and right children.
   
2. **Pruning Condition**:
   - After processing the left and right children, the current node is pruned if its value is `0` and if both its left and right children are `nullptr`.
   
3. **Return the Pruned Tree**:
   - Return the root (pruned) for each recursive call.

This approach ensures that unnecessary nodes are removed efficiently while preserving nodes that have or are required by nodes with the value `1`.
