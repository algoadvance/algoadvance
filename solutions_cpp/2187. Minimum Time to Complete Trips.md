[Leetcode 2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2187)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the `i-th` bus to complete one trip. Each bus can complete multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start immediately after completing the current trip. You are also given an integer `totalTrips`, which denotes the total number of trips that you have to complete.

Return the minimum time required such that all buses complete at least `totalTrips` trips.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array `time` sorted?**
   - No, there is no guarantee that the array `time` is sorted.

2. **What is the range of the values in the `time` array and `totalTrips`?**
   - Typically, values in `time` and `totalTrips` could be large. However, they will not exceed the constraints provided by the LeetCode problem definition.

3. **Can the value of a bus trip time be zero?**
   - No, the bus trip time should be positive integers according to logical problem constraints.

4. **Do all buses need to complete the same number of trips?**
   - No, buses can complete different numbers of trips. The goal is to ensure the total number of trips equals `totalTrips`.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - As the minimum time needs to be optimized, a binary search approach is suitable to find the lowest possible time.
   - Use binary search on the possible time range.
     - The minimum possible time is `1` (if only 1 minute is sufficient for all trips).
     - The maximum possible time can be calculated as `max(time) * totalTrips` (if the slowest bus were to perform all trips).

2. **Trip Calculation:**
   - For each middle point in binary search (`mid`), determine the total number of trips all buses can complete using:
     - `totalTrips = sum(mid // t for t in time)`

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - If the total trips are greater than or equal to `totalTrips` at `mid`, move the upper bound to `mid - 1`.
   - If the total trips are less than `totalTrips`, raise the lower bound to `mid + 1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** O(log(maxTime * totalTrips))
- **Trips Calculation at each step:** O(n) where n is the length of `time`.

The total time complexity: **O(n * log(maxTime * totalTrips))**

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

class Solution {
public:
    long long minimumTime(std::vector<int>& time, int totalTrips) {
        long long left = 1;  // Minimum possible time
        long long right = static_cast<long long>(*std::max_element(time.begin(), time.end())) * totalTrips;  // Maximum possible time

        while (left < right) {
            long long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canCompleteTripsInTime(time, totalTrips, mid)) {
                right = mid;  // Try for a smaller time
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;  // Need more time
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

private:
    bool canCompleteTripsInTime(const std::vector<int>& time, int totalTrips, long long currentTime) {
        long long trips = 0;
        for (int t : time) {
            trips += currentTime / t;
            if (trips >= totalTrips) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return trips >= totalTrips;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization of Binary Search Bounds:**
   - `left` is set to 1 (minimum conceivable time).
   - `right` is set to the maximum time any bus might take to complete `totalTrips`.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Determine the middle time `mid`.
   - Use `canCompleteTripsInTime` to check if it is feasible to achieve `totalTrips` within `mid` time.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
   - For a given `mid` time, calculate the total number of trips possible.
   - If the number of trips is greater than or equal to `totalTrips`, it's feasible; otherwise, it is not.

The solution leverages a binary search approach to efficiently find the minimum time necessary to complete the given number of trips.
