[Leetcode 956. Tallest Billboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l956)
## Problem Statement

You are building a billboard, and you want it to be at the highest possible height. You have some steel rods, and each rod has a positive integer length.

You can connect rods one after another, and you can also connect rods to the opposite ends to make two rods that are of the same height. You want to find the highest possible height of the billboard which can be achieved using these rods.

You can cut the rods into shorter rods, but you cannot treat them as separate if you do so.

**Example:**

1. **Input:** `rods = [1,2,3,6]`
   - **Output:** `6`
   
2. **Input:** `rods = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
   - **Output:** `10`
   
3. **Input:** `rods = [1,2]`
   - **Output:** `0`

**Note:**

- `0 <= rods.length <= 20`
- `1 <= rods[i] <= 1000`
- The sum of rods lengths will not exceed `5000`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the rods be cut into smaller pieces?**
   - No, you cannot cut the rods into smaller pieces.

2. **If I use a rod in one of the billboards, can I use it in the other?**
   - No, each rod can only be used once.

3. **Do both sides of the billboard need to be the same height?**
   - Yes, you need to arrange the rods such that the two sides are of equal height.

## Strategy

This problem is a variant of the partition problem and can be solved using dynamic programming. We will use a dictionary to track the difference in height between two subarrays of rods and optimize accordingly to maximize the minimum height.

1. **Initialize a DP dictionary** where the key represents the difference in height between two partitions (-10000 to +10000, initialized to -âˆž). Start by initializing `dp[0] = 0` (same height, 0 difference).
   
2. **Iterate through each rod,** and for each rod update possible differences in the DP dictionary.

3. **Update the dictionary iteratively** and ensure that at each state, the possible height of one partition (while maintaining the current difference) is maximized.

4. Finally, the height of the billboard is `dp[0]`, which represents the maximum height that can be achieved where both partitions are the same height.

## Code

Here is the implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int tallestBillboard(std::vector<int>& rods) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> dp;
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int rod : rods) {
            std::unordered_map<int, int> new_dp = dp;
            for (auto [diff, height] : dp) {
                // Add rod to one side
                new_dp[diff + rod] = std::max(new_dp[diff + rod], height);
                
                // Add rod to the other side
                int newDiff = std::abs(diff - rod);
                new_dp[newDiff] = std::max(new_dp[newDiff], height + std::min(diff, rod));
            }
            dp = std::move(new_dp);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

## Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in `O(n * d)` time complexity where `n` is the number of rods and `d` is the sum of the lengths of the rods. Given the constraints (sum of rods does not exceed 5000), this is efficient.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(d)` due to the storage needed for the DP dictionary which holds the possible height differences.
