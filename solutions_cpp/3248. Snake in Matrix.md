[Leetcode 3248. Snake in Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3248)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of non-negative integers. We need to find and return the path, starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1) with the maximum sum of integers. The path can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Here is a summary:
- Find the path with the highest sum starting from grid[0][0] to grid[m-1][n-1].
- You can only move down or right.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that `m` and `n` will always be greater than or equal to 1?**
   - Yes.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the grid?**
   - All integers are non-negative, and all values in the grid fall within the range from 0 to a large value.

3. **Should we consider the case of moving diagonally?**
   - No, movement is strictly down or right.

## Strategy

We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem by creating a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum sum of the path from the top-left to the cell `(i, j)`. The recurrence relation can be defined as:

\[ dp[i][j] = \text{grid}[i][j] + \max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) \]

Where:
- `dp[i-1][j]` refers to the value from the cell directly above, and
- `dp[i][j-1]` refers to the value from the cell directly to the left.

Initial conditions:
- `dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]`

Boundary conditions should handle the first row and first column separately since they only have one valid incoming direction (from the left or from above, respectively).

## Code

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(std::vector<std::vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        // If the grid dimensions are less than required, return 0.
        if(m == 0 || n == 0) return 0;

        // Create a DP table with the same dimensions as the grid.
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> dp(m, std::vector<int>(n, 0));

        // Initialize the starting point.
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];

        // Fill the first row.
        for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
        }

        // Fill the first column.
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }

        // Fill the rest of the dp table.
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + std::max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
};

// Example of running the code.
int main() {
    Solution solution;
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> grid = {
        {5, 3, 2, 1},
        {1, 7, 1, 8},
        {4, 6, 5, 2},
        {1, 2, 3, 4}
    };
    int result = solution.maxPathSum(grid);
    std::cout << "The maximum path sum is: " << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to fill each cell in the `dp` table once.

The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the additional storage for the `dp` table.
