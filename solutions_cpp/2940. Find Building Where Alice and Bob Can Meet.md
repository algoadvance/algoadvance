[Leetcode 2940. Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2940)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are looking to meet in a building. There is a list of buildings, each represented by their respective floor numbers. Both Alice and Bob start from their respective starting positions, and they can travel to the next building or the previous building. Write an efficient algorithm to determine the building where both Alice and Bob can meet. If there are multiple buildings where they can meet, return the first one (based on the index).

You are given two arrays where:

- `aliceStart[i]` denotes the starting building for Alice
- `bobStart[i]` denotes the starting building for Bob
- `buildingNumbers[i]` denotes the floor numbers of the buildings

Return the index of the building where Alice and Bob can meet. If no such building exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of the input arrays?
    - Are the building numbers guaranteed to be unique?
    - Are Alice and Bob's starting positions guaranteed to be valid indices within the building numbers array?

2. **Movement Restrictions**:
    - Can Alice and Bob move simultaneously, or do they move in turns?
    - Are they allowed to meet in the building they start at?

3. **Building Index**:
    - Should the smallest index be considered if they can meet at multiple buildings?

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - Are there possible cases where either Alice or Bob start outside the bounds of the array?

### Strategy

Given the problem, the strategy will be to perform a simultaneous traversal from both Alice's and Bob's starting positions and see if their paths cross and meet at the same building number.

Steps:
1. Initialize two sets starting from `aliceStart` and `bobStart`.
2. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from both starting positions.
3. Track visited positions to avoid cycles.
4. If their paths intersect at any building number, return the index of that building.
5. If no such building is found, return -1.

### Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_map>

using namespace std;

int findMeetingBuilding(const vector<int>& aliceStart, const vector<int>& bobStart, const vector<int>& buildingNumbers) {
    
    unordered_set<int> aliceVisited, bobVisited;
    queue<int> aliceQueue, bobQueue;
    
    // Populate initial positions into visited sets and queues
    for (int alicePos : aliceStart) {
        aliceVisited.insert(alicePos);
        aliceQueue.push(alicePos);
    }
    
    for (int bobPos : bobStart) {
        bobVisited.insert(bobPos);
        bobQueue.push(bobPos);
    }
    
    while (!aliceQueue.empty() && !bobQueue.empty()) {
        // Process queue for Alice
        int aliceSize = aliceQueue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < aliceSize; ++i) {
            int aliceCurrent = aliceQueue.front();
            aliceQueue.pop();
            
            if (bobVisited.find(aliceCurrent) != bobVisited.end()) return aliceCurrent;

            if (aliceCurrent - 1 >= 0 && aliceVisited.find(aliceCurrent - 1) == aliceVisited.end()) {
                aliceQueue.push(aliceCurrent - 1);
                aliceVisited.insert(aliceCurrent - 1);
            }
            if (aliceCurrent + 1 < buildingNumbers.size() && aliceVisited.find(aliceCurrent + 1) == aliceVisited.end()) {
                aliceQueue.push(aliceCurrent + 1);
                aliceVisited.insert(aliceCurrent + 1);
            }
        }

        // Process queue for Bob
        int bobSize = bobQueue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < bobSize; ++i) {
            int bobCurrent = bobQueue.front();
            bobQueue.pop();
            
            if (aliceVisited.find(bobCurrent) != aliceVisited.end()) return bobCurrent;
            
            if (bobCurrent - 1 >= 0 && bobVisited.find(bobCurrent - 1) == bobVisited.end()) {
                bobQueue.push(bobCurrent - 1);
                bobVisited.insert(bobCurrent - 1);
            }
            if (bobCurrent + 1 < buildingNumbers.size() && bobVisited.find(bobCurrent + 1) == bobVisited.end()) {
                bobQueue.push(bobCurrent + 1);
                bobVisited.insert(bobCurrent + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If no common building is found
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The code primarily involves traversing through the building array using BFS, which ensures that each building position is processed only once:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of buildings. Both Alice and Bob traverse through each building number at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), due to the storage of visited positions and BFS queues.

This approach effectively finds the meeting point efficiently with respect to both time and space.
