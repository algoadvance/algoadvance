[Leetcode 665. Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l665)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. We define an array as non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` for every `i` (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

#### Example:
1. Input: `nums = [4,2,3]`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.

2. Input: `nums = [4,2,1]`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modifying just one element.

#### Constraints:
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array be empty?
   - No, `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1.
2. Are there any constraints on modifying elements to make the array non-decreasing?
   - You are allowed to modify any element to achieve the objective.
   
### Strategy
1. **Identify Violations**: Iterate through the array to find points where `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`.
2. **Count Violations**: If more than one violation is found, return `false`.
3. **Adjustments**:
   - If a violation is found at `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`, decide whether to adjust `nums[i]` or `nums[i + 1]` based on surrounding elements.
   - If `i == 0` or `nums[i - 1] <= nums[i + 1]`, decrease `nums[i]`.
   - Else, increase `nums[i + 1]`.
4. **Return Result**: If only one or no violations are found after the loop, return `true`.

### Code
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

bool checkPossibility(vector<int>& nums) {
    int countViolations = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
            // If already more than one modification required
            if (countViolations == 1) {
                return false;
            }
            countViolations++;

            // If this is the first element, or we can adjust nums[i]
            if (i == 0 || nums[i - 1] <= nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] = nums[i + 1];
            } else {
                // Otherwise adjust nums[i + 1]
                nums[i + 1] = nums[i];
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This approach ensures that we check the minimum number of changes needed and decide appropriately based on the current and previous elements.
