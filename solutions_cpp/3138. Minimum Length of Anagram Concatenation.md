[Leetcode 3138. Minimum Length of Anagram Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3138)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, each of length `n`, you must concatenate `s` with itself one or more times to form a string `s'`, such that `t` is an anagram of some substring of `s'`. You need to return the minimum length of the concatenation of `s` required to form such a string `s'`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
   - Yes, compare characters considering case-sensitivity.

2. **Character Set**: Should the characters be considered from `a-z` and `A-Z` only, or any possible character?
   - Assume it can be any possible ASCII character.

3. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `n` (length of `s` and `t`)?
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

4. **Result Precision**: Are we only interested in the length of the concatenated string, not the actual substring or additional operations?
   - Yes, only the length of the concatenated string is needed.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to understand that if `t` can be an anagram of a substring of `s'`, then `s'` should have enough characters to cover all characters of `t`.

1. **Frequency Count**: First, we'll compute the frequency of characters in `t` and `s`.
  
2. **Determine Multiples**: For `t` to be a substring of `s'`, all character frequencies in `t` should be met by some multiple of the frequencies in `s`. Calculate the minimum multiple needed for each character to ensure all characters in `t` are covered.

3. **Compute Required Length**: Multiply the length of `s` by the maximum multiple required to cover frequencies of all characters in `t`.

## Code

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minAnagramConcatLength(string s, string t) {
    unordered_map<char, int> freqT, freqS;

    // Calculate frequency of characters in `t`
    for(char c : t) {
        freqT[c]++;
    }

    // Calculate frequency of characters in `s`
    for(char c : s) {
        freqS[c]++;
    }

    int maxMultiple = 0;

    // Calculate the minimal multiple such that all characters in `t` are covered in `s'`
    for(auto &pair : freqT) {
        char character = pair.first;
        int countInT = pair.second;
        int countInS = freqS[character];

        if(countInS == 0) return -1; // `t` contains a character that's not in `s`.

        int multiple = (countInT + countInS - 1) / countInS; // Ceiling of countInT / countInS
        maxMultiple = max(maxMultiple, multiple);
    }

    return maxMultiple * s.length();
}

int main() {
    string s = "ab";
    string t = "baba";

    int result = minAnagramConcatLength(s, t);
    cout << "Minimum length of concatenation: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Frequency Calculation**: This involves iterating over both `s` and `t`, which takes `O(n)` time.
- **Multiple Calculation**: This involves iterating over the characters in `t`, which takes `O(n)` time since we only iterate over unique characters.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum length of the concatenation required by leveraging frequency counts and minimum multiples.
