[Leetcode 2030. Smallest K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2030)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, a character `c` and two integers `k` and `m`, you need to find the smallest lexicographical subsequence of length `k` which contains at least `m` occurrences of the character `c`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if it's not possible to find such a subsequence?**
   - Usually, the problem would specify behavior for this, typically returning an empty string or a special value.

2. **Are all characters in the string `s` lowercase English letters?**
   - Assuming yes since no further specification is provided.

3. **Is it guaranteed that `k` is less than or equal to the length of `s`?**
   - Yes, we assume that `k` will always be valid as per typical constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Heap Approach**:
   - This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm with the help of a min-heap data structure to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - Traverse through the string keeping track of possible 'm' occurrences of `c`.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window of length `k`.
   - Adjust the window to ensure it contains `m` occurrences of `c` while keeping the lexicographically smallest string possible.

### Code

Here is the C++ solution using a greedy approach with a stack:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

string smallestKLengthSubsequence(string s, char c, int k, int m) {
    int n = s.length();
    vector<int> count(n + 1, 0);

    // To store the answer string
    string result = "";
    
    // To store the number of character 'c' to the right of i-th position including i itself
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        count[i] = count[i + 1] + (s[i] == c ? 1 : 0);
    }
    
    // To track the elements we have included in our answer
    stack<char> st;
    int requiredCs = m;
    
    for (int i = 0, len = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        // If we still have space in our subsequence
        if (len < k) {
            // Pop elements from stack if they can be replaced by current element which is smaller
            while (!st.empty() && st.top() > s[i] && (st.size() - 1 + (n - i) >= k) && 
                ((st.top() == c && count[i] > requiredCs) || st.top() != c)) {
                len--;
                if (st.top() == c) {
                    requiredCs++;
                }
                st.pop();
            }
            
            // If it's possible to push current element in stack
            if (st.size() + 1 <= k) {
                if (s[i] == c) {
                    requiredCs--;
                }
                st.push(s[i]);
                len++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Collect the elements from the stack to form the result
    while (!st.empty()) {
        result = st.top() + result;
        st.pop();
    }

    // Ensure that the result contains at least 'm' occurrences of the character 'c'
    int countC = 0;
    for (char ch : result) {
        if (ch == c) {
            countC++;
        }
    }

    return countC >= m ? result : "";
}

int main() {
    string s = "cbacdcbc";
    char c = 'c';
    int k = 4, m = 2;
    cout << smallestKLengthSubsequence(s, c, k, m) << endl;  // Output should be "acdc"
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity: O(n)** 
  - Where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed at most once.
  
- **Space Complexity: O(n)**
  - Due to the usage of stack and auxiliary arrays.

Feel free to ask any further questions or clarifications!
