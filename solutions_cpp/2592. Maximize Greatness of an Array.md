[Leetcode 2592. Maximize Greatness of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2592)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you are tasked with maximizing the "greatness" of the array by reordering its elements. The "greatness" of the array is defined as the maximum number of instances `nums[i] > nums[j]` for `i < j`. You need to return the maximum "greatness" achievable by reordering the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements can be negative, zero, or positive.
   
2. **Do the elements of the array need to be distinct?**
   - No, the elements are not required to be distinct; duplicates are allowed.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the array size?**
   - The problem statement usually specifies constraints, but common competitive programming constraints are `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

## Strategy

To maximize the greatness of the array, you can consider each element and see how many elements to its right are greater than itself. By sorting the array, you simplify the process of finding such pairs.

Steps:
1. Sort the `nums` array.
2. Use two pointers to count the number of valid pairs where nums[i] < nums[j], where `i < j`.

## Code

Here's the C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int maximizeGreatness(std::vector<int>& nums) {
    std::sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int n = nums.size();
    int left = 0, right = 1, count = 0;

    while (right < n && left < n) {
        if (nums[right] > nums[left]) {
            count++;
            left++;
        }
        right++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Sorting the array:** Sorting helps simplify the problem since we can then compare each element with the next greater elements easily.
2. **Two pointers technique:**
   - `left` pointer starts from the beginning.
   - `right` pointer starts from one position to the right of `left`.
   - For each pairing where `nums[right] > nums[left]`, increment the count and move the `left` pointer to the next position to form a new pair; always move the `right` pointer to the next.
   
## Time Complexity

- **Sort operation:** `O(n log n)`
- **Two pointers traversal:** `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step. This is optimal given the constraints.
