[Leetcode 3092. Most Frequent IDs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3092)
## Problem Statement

Let's assume the problem is as follows based on the context provided:

Given a list of IDs, find the ID that appears most frequently. If multiple IDs have the same highest frequency, return the smallest ID among them. 

### Input
- A list of integers (IDs).

### Output
- A single integer, the ID with the highest frequency. If there's a tie, return the smallest ID.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the IDs? For example, what is the possible range of ID values?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the list of IDs?
3. Can the list be empty? If so, what should be the return value in that case?
4. Should the solution handle both small and very large inputs efficiently?

Based on typical interpretations:

- ID values are non-negative integers.
- List can have up to \(10^5\) IDs.
- List will not be empty.

## Strategy

1. Use a hash map (unordered_map in C++) to count the frequency of each ID.
2. Traverse the hash map to find the ID with the maximum frequency.
3. In case of a tie in frequency, choose the smallest ID.

## Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <limits>

int mostFrequentID(const std::vector<int>& ids) {
    if (ids.empty()) return -1; // Assuming we return -1 for an empty list

    std::unordered_map<int, int> frequencyMap;

    // Counting the frequency of each ID
    for (int id : ids) {
        frequencyMap[id]++;
    }

    // Finding the most frequent ID (with tie-breaking on smallest ID)
    int maxFrequency = 0;
    int mostFrequentID = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();

    for (const auto& entry : frequencyMap) {
        if (entry.second > maxFrequency) {
            maxFrequency = entry.second;
            mostFrequentID = entry.first;
        } else if (entry.second == maxFrequency && entry.first < mostFrequentID) {
            mostFrequentID = entry.first;
        }
    }

    return mostFrequentID;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> ids = {1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1};
    std::cout << "Most Frequent ID: " << mostFrequentID(ids) << std::endl; // Output: 1
    return 0;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in the list. We make a single pass to count frequencies and another pass to find the most frequent ID.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(U)\), where \(U\) is the number of unique IDs. This space is used by the hash map to store frequencies. 

This solution efficiently handles large input sizes within typical constraints.
