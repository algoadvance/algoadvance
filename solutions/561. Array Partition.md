title:  Array Partition-out
permalink: /s561
---

You are given an integer array `nums` of `2n` integers. Your task is to:
- Partition the array into `n` pairs such that:
  - each pair consists of two integers,
  - for every pair `(a_i, b_i)`, the result of `min(a_i, b_i)` is maximized.
- Return the sum of these minimum values from the pairs.

### Example
- **Input**: `nums = [1,4,3,2]`
- **Output**: `4`
- **Explanation**: One optimal partition is `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`. The sum of minimums is `1 + 3 = 4`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the array `nums` contain both positive and negative integers?
   **A**: Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative integers.
   
2. **Q**: Is the number of elements in the list `nums` always even?
   **A**: Yes, the given problem guarantees that `nums` will have `2n` elements, thus it will always have an even number of elements.

3. **Q**: Can there be duplicate elements in the array `nums`?
   **A**: Yes, duplicate elements are allowed.

### Strategy

The strategy revolves around sorting the array first and then pairing the elements such that we maximize the sum of the smallest elements in each pair. By sorting the array, we can simply pair adjacent elements to achieve this:
1. **Sort the array**: This ensures that each pair `(a, b)` will be `(nums[i], nums[i+1])` where `nums[i]` is always the smaller or equal member.
2. **Sum the smallest elements of the pairs**: The resulting sum is the sum of every second element in the sorted list.

### Code

```python
def arrayPairSum(nums: list) -> int:
    # Sort the array first
    nums.sort()
    # Initialize the sum
    result = 0
    # Sum the minimum of each pair
    for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
        result += nums[i]
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 4, 3, 2]
print(arrayPairSum(nums))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation

- After sorting `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the pairs will be `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`.
- The minimum values of the pairs are `1` and `3`.
- The sum of these minimum values is `1 + 3 = 4`.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Summing elements after sorting**: \(O(n / 2) = O(n)\)

Thus, the **overall time complexity** is dominated by the sorting step and is \(O(n \log n)\).
