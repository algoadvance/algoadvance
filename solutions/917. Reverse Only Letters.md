title:  Reverse Only Letters-out
permalink: /s917
---
Given a string `s`, return the string after reversing the letters of `s` without altering the positions of the non-letter characters.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of characters of the following types:
  * English letters as well as punctuation marks (`"`."
  * Digits from `0` to `9`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Should we consider uppercase and lowercase as distinct characters?**
   - Yes, the problem does not require changing the case of the letters.
   
2. **What should be done if the string consists of only non-letter characters?**
   - The string should remain unchanged as there would be no letters to reverse.

## Strategy
1. **Two-pointer technique**: Utilize two pointers, one starting from the beginning (`left`) and the other from the end (`right`) of the string.
2. **Skip non-letter characters**: Increment the `left` pointer until it finds a letter and decrement the `right` pointer until it finds a letter.
3. **Swap letters**: Swap the characters at the positions of `left` and `right` pointers and then move the pointers toward the center.
4. **Join and return**: Convert the list of characters back to a string and return it.

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string: Each character is processed at most once.

## Code
```python
def reverseOnlyLetters(s: str) -> str:
    # Convert string to list for mutable operations
    s_list = list(s)
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if not s_list[left].isalpha():
            left += 1
        elif not s_list[right].isalpha():
            right -= 1
        else:
            # Swap the letters
            s_list[left], s_list[right] = s_list[right], s_list[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
    
    return ''.join(s_list)

# Example usage
print(reverseOnlyLetters("ab-cd"))       # Output: "dc-ba"
print(reverseOnlyLetters("a-bC-dEf-ghIj")) # Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
print(reverseOnlyLetters("Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!")) # Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
```

In the above code:
- We convert the input string to a list to facilitate easy swapping of characters.
- We use a while loop with two pointers (`left` and `right`) to conditionally swap characters when they are both letters, otherwise, we adjust the pointers.
- Finally, we join the list back into a string and return it.
