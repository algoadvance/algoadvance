title:  String Compression III-out
permalink: /s3163
---

The task is to compress a string using the following algorithm. For a string `s`, a compression of the string is obtained by replacing consecutive same characters by a single occurrence of the character followed by the count of repeating characters (if the count is greater than 1). The notion is similar to run-length encoding.

However, for this problem, the string may have repeating characters removed to achieve the compressed form of a specific size limit `k`.

For example, given `s = "aabbccc"`, you might be tasked to compress it to the length `k = 5`.

Write a function `get_length_of_optimal_compression(s: str, k: int) -> int` which returns the minimum length of the compressed string after removal of at most `k` characters from `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Order of characters:** Should the order of characters in the string remain the same after removing characters?
   
   Yes, the order of characters should remain the same.

2. **Character limits:** What are the constraints on the input `s` and `k`?
   
   - `1 <= s.length <= 100`
   - `0 <= k <= s.length`
   - `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Output format:** What is the expected output format?
   
   An integer representing the minimal length of the compressed string after removing at most `k` characters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll define a 2D dp array `dp[i][k]` which indicates the minimum length of the compressed string up to the first `i` characters of `s` with `k` deletions allowed. The transitions will depend on whether a character is included or excluded and how it affects the current run-length encoding.

### Code

```python
def get_length_of_optimal_compression(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    def calc_len(count):
        if count == 0:
            return 0
        elif count == 1:
            return 1
        elif count < 10:
            return 2
        elif count < 100:
            return 3
        else:
            return 4

    dp[0][0] = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(k + 1):
            if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
            
            cnt, del_cnt = 0, 0
            for l in range(i, 0, -1):
                if s[l-1] == s[i-1]:
                    cnt += 1
                else:
                    del_cnt += 1
                
                if del_cnt > j:
                    break
                
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[l-1][j-del_cnt] + calc_len(cnt))
    
    return dp[n][k]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2 * k), where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of deletions allowed. This is because we iterate over each possible character for each subproblem (resulting in an O(n) loop nested within an O(n) loop) and we perform updates based on the length calculations which adds a multiplicative factor of `k`. 

This dynamic programming approach ensures that we handle overlapping subproblems optimally, giving a feasible solution within reasonable constraints.
