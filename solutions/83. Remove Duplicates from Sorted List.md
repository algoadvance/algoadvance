title:  Remove Duplicates from Sorted List-out
permalink: /s83
---

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input linked list be empty?**
   - Yes, the input can be an empty linked list.

2. **Is the linked list sorted in non-decreasing order?**
   - Yes, the linked list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Can we modify the existing linked list or do we need to create a new one?**
   - You can modify the existing linked list.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Pointer:**
   - Create a pointer `current` that starts at the head of the linked list.
   
2. **Iterate Through the List:**
   - Traverse the linked list using the `current` pointer.
   - For each node, check if it has a duplicate by comparing `current.val` with `current.next.val`.
   
3. **Remove Duplicates:**
   - If a duplicate is found (i.e., `current.val == current.next.val`), skip the next node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`.
   - If no duplicate is found, simply move `current` to the next node.
   
4. **Termination:**
   - Continue this process until the end of the linked list is reached.

5. **Return the Modified List:**
   - Return the head of the modified linked list.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteDuplicates(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    current = head
    
    while current and current.next:
        if current.val == current.next.val:
            # Skip the next node, it's a duplicate
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            # Move to the next node
            current = current.next
    
    return head
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization:** A pointer `current` begins at the head of the linked list.
- **Traversal:** The `while` loop continues as long as `current` and `current.next` are not `None`.
  - If the value of the `current` node is equal to the value of the next node (`current.next.val`), then we skip the next node by adjusting the `next` pointer of the `current` node (`current.next = current.next.next`).
  - If the values are different, we move the `current` pointer to the next node (`current = current.next`).
- **Return:** After traversing the entire list and removing duplicates, the modified list is returned.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We only make a single pass through the linked list, hence the time complexity is linear in relation to the number of nodes, `n`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - No extra space is used other than a few pointers, so the space complexity is constant.
