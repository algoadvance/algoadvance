Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be negative?**
   - No, powers of three are positive integers.
   
2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem traditionally deals with 32-bit signed integers, so `n` can range from `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.

3. **What if `n` is zero?**
   - Zero is not a power of three, so the result should be `False`.

### Strategy
1. **Iterative Approach**: One way to solve this problem is to iteratively divide the number by 3 and check if we can end up with 1.
   - Start with `n`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return `False` (since powers of three are positive).
   - Keep dividing `n` by 3 as long as it's divisible by 3.
   - After the loop, if `n` equals 1, then it is a power of three; otherwise, it is not.

2. **Mathematical Approach**: Another more elegant solution leverages the fact that the maximum possible power of three that can fit in a 32-bit signed integer is `3^19` which is `1162261467`.
   - Any power of three `n` must be a divisor of `1162261467` if it lies within the 32-bit integer range.

### Code
Let's start with the iterative approach and then also provide the mathematical approach.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        while n % 3 == 0:
            n //= 3
        return n == 1

    def isPowerOfThreeMathematical(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # 3^19 is 1162261467, which is the largest power of three in signed 32-bit integer range.
        return n > 0 and 1162261467 % n == 0
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Iterative Approach**: O(logâ‚ƒ(n)). This is because we keep dividing `n` by 3 until `n` becomes 1.
2. **Mathematical Approach**: O(1). This is because it only involves a couple of arithmetic operations.

### Conclusion
Both approaches effectively determine if a number is a power of three, but the mathematical approach is more efficient due to its constant time complexity.
