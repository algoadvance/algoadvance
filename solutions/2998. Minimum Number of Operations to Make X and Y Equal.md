title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make X and Y Equal-out
permalink: /s2998
---

You are given two arrays of integers, `x` and `y`, each of length `n`.

In one operation, you can:
1. Choose an index `i` (0 <= i < n) and replace `x[i]` with any integer value.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `x` and `y` equal at all corresponding indices.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range and Constraints:**
    - What is the range of values in the arrays `x` and `y`?
    - What is the maximum possible length `n` of the arrays?

2. **Examples:**
    - Can you provide an example for better understanding?
    
3. **Special Cases:**
    - Should we consider cases where arrays are already equal?
    - What if `n` is 0? Should we handle empty arrays?

### Assumptions

- Both arrays `x` and `y` are non-empty and have the same length `n`.
- The values in `x` and `y` are integer values.

### Example

**Input:**
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [2, 2, 3]
```

**Output:**
```python
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Replace `x[0]` with `2` to match the corresponding element in `y`. Only one operation is needed.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a counter `operations` to 0.
2. Loop through the arrays `x` and `y` simultaneously.
3. For each index `i`, if `x[i]` is not equal to `y[i]`, increment the `operations` counter.
4. Return the value of the `operations` counter as it represents the minimum number of operations needed.

### Code

```python
def min_operations_to_make_equal(x, y):
    if len(x) != len(y):
        raise ValueError("Arrays x and y must have the same length")
    
    operations = 0
    for i in range(len(x)):
        if x[i] != y[i]:
            operations += 1

    return operations

# Example use
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [2, 2, 3]
print(min_operations_to_make_equal(x, y))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- Loop through the arrays once, so the time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the arrays `x` and `y`.

With this strategy and code, we can determine the minimum number of operations required to make the arrays `x` and `y` equal at all corresponding indices.
