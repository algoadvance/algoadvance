title:  Number of Wonderful Substrings-out
permalink: /s1915
---

A **wonderful** string is a string where exactly one letter appears an odd number of times.

Given a string `word`, return the number of **wonderful** non-empty substrings in the given string `word`. If the substrings do not have exactly one letter that appears an odd number of times, they are not considered wonderful.

**Example:**
    
    Input: word = "aba"
    
    Output: 4
    
    Explanation:
    
    Four wonderful substrings are "a", "a", "aba", "b"

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input string contain characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - No, based on the problem description and typical constraints, it will contain only lowercase English letters.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - We need to check the constraints, but let's assume it's reasonably large (e.g., up to \(10^5\)).

3. **Do overlapping substrings count?**
   - Yes, each possible substring (non-empty) should be considered.

## Strategy

1. **Odd Count Tracking:**
   - We can use a bitmask to track the odd/even counts of each letter. Since there are 26 lowercase English letters, we need a 26-bit bitmask.

2. **Prefix Sum and Bitmask Approach:**
   - Utilize a dictionary to count occurrences of each bitmask (prefix sum states).
   - Iterate through the string and update the bitmask as you encounter each character.
   - Use the dictionary to check how many previous states have the required bitmask (indicating a substring with exactly one odd character).

3. **Possible Bitmask Variants:**
   - To ensure exactly one odd character, we need the bitmask to transition from one state to another by flipping exactly one bit.

## Code

```python
def wonderfulSubstrings(word: str) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    count = defaultdict(int)
    count[0] = 1  # Base case: empty prefix.
    bitmask = 0
    result = 0
    
    for char in word:
        bitmask ^= (1 << (ord(char) - ord('a')))
        result += count[bitmask]
        
        # Check all bitmasks differing by just one bit.
        for i in range(26):
            result += count[bitmask ^ (1 << i)]
        
        count[bitmask] += 1
    
    return result

# Example Usage
word = "aba"
print(wonderfulSubstrings(word))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times 26)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string. Each character processing involves checking 26 possible bitmask states.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) for the dictionary storing frequency counts of bitmask states.

The solution efficiently leverages bitmasks and prefix sums to count the number of wonderful substrings, ensuring performance is optimal even for large input sizes.
