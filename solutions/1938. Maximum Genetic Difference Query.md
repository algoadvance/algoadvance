title:  Maximum Genetic Difference Query-out
permalink: /s1938
---

You are given the `root` of a binary tree and `queries` which are a list of pairs \[(node, val)\]. For each query, a pair \[(node, val)\], you need to determine the maximum bitwise XOR of `val` with any node value on the path from the given `node` to the `root`.

- The `root` of the binary tree is a TreeNode.
- Each query needs to be processed independently.

The output should be a list of integers representing the results of each query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the TreeNode?**
   - A: A typical TreeNode class will have attributes `val` (node value), `left` (left child), and `right` (right child).

2. **How many queries can we expect?**
   - A: The number of queries can vary but we should consider efficient lookups and computations due to the potentially large size.

3. **What are the constraints on the values of the nodes and the val in queries?**
   - A: Given node values and the values in queries can be within a 32-bit integer range.

4. **Do we need to handle invalid input cases (e.g., node not found in the tree)?**
   - A: No need to handle, assume all inputs are valid.

### Strategy

1. **Trie Data Structure for Efficient XOR Queries**: 
   - A Trie is well-suited for efficiently computing the maximum XOR for given values.

2. **Building the Trie from Node to Root Path**:
   - For each node, we will traverse from the node to the root and insert all encountered values into the trie.

3. **Querying the Trie**: 
   - Once the trie is built for a specific node, use it to find the maximum XOR value for the given `val` in O(log(max_value)) time.

4. **DFS for Tree Traversal**:
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) from the given `node` to the `root` to gather all node values on the path.

### Time Complexity

- **Trie Construction**: O(N * M) where N is the number of nodes on the path and M is the number of bits (30-32 bits for 32-bit int).
- **Query Processing**: O(Q * M) for Q queries and M bits per query.

Below is the implementation of this strategy.

### Code

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.value = None

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, num):
        node = self.root
        for i in range(31, -1, -1):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            if bit not in node.children:
                node.children[bit] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[bit]
        node.value = num
    
    def find_max_xor(self, num):
        node = self.root
        if not node.children:
            return -1  # empty trie
        xor = 0
        for i in range(31, -1, -1):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            toggled_bit = 1 - bit
            if toggled_bit in node.children:
                xor = (xor << 1) | 1
                node = node.children[toggled_bit]
            else:
                xor = (xor << 1)
                node = node.children[bit]
        return xor

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def find_path_to_root(node, root, path):
    if node is None:
        return False
    if node == root:
        path.append(node)
        return True
    # check in the left subtree
    if find_path_to_root(node.left, root, path) or find_path_to_root(node.right, root, path):
        path.append(node)
        return True
    return False

def max_genetic_difference(root, queries):
    results = []
    
    for node, val in queries:
        path = []
        find_path_to_root(node, root, path)
        path.reverse()  # path is now from node to root

        trie = Trie()
        for n in path:
            trie.insert(n.val)
        
        max_xor = trie.find_max_xor(val)
        results.append(max_xor)
    
    return results
```

### Execution

The code sets up a Trie and uses DFS to handle each query. Note that the code assumes the `node` given in each query is directly referenced and correct.

This solution should be run against a series of unit tests or within the LeetCode environment to confirm its correctness.
