title:  Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks-out
permalink: /s2279
---

You are given a set of bags, where each bag has a certain capacity and a certain number of rocks already inside it. You are also given some additional rocks, and your task is to determine the maximum number of bags that can be filled to their capacity.

The inputs are:

1. `capacity`: A list of integers where `capacity[i]` is the capacity of the ith bag.
2. `rocks`: A list of integers where `rocks[i]` is the number of rocks currently in the ith bag.
3. `additionalRocks`: An integer representing the additional rocks that can be used to fill the bags.

Your goal is to maximize the number of bags that are filled to their capacity by optimally distributing the additional rocks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Sizes:**
   - What is the maximum size of the `capacity` and `rocks` lists?
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - Are all values in `capacity` and `rocks` non-negative integers?
   - Is `additionalRocks` a non-negative integer?
   
3. **Bags Already Full:**
   - Are there any bags that are already at full capacity?

### Strategy

The goal is to maximize the number of bags that reach their full capacity. Here's a potential strategy:

1. **Calculate the Deficit:**
   - For each bag, calculate how many more rocks are needed to fill it to its capacity. This is given by `deficit[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i]`.

2. **Sort the Deficit:**
   - Sort the deficits in ascending order. This way, we can try to fill the bags requiring the fewest additional rocks first, maximizing the number of full bags.

3. **Fill the Bags:**
   - Iterate through the sorted deficit list, and subtract the required rocks from `additionalRocks` until we run out of rocks or fill all the bags.

4. **Count of Full Bags:**
   - Keep a count of the number of bags that were filled using the additional rocks.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the deficits will take O(n log n), where n is the number of bags.
- Iterating through the sorted list will take O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Code

```python
def maximumBags(capacity, rocks, additionalRocks):
    # Calculate the deficit for each bag
    deficits = [capacity[i] - rocks[i] for i in range(len(capacity))]
    
    # Sort deficits in ascending order
    deficits.sort()
    
    # Initialize the count of full bags
    full_bag_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted deficits
    for deficit in deficits:
        if additionalRocks >= deficit:
            # Fill this bag by using necessary rocks
            additionalRocks -= deficit
            full_bag_count += 1
        else:
            # Not enough rocks to fill this bag, break the loop
            break
    
    return full_bag_count

# Example usage
capacity = [5, 5, 5]
rocks = [1, 4, 3]
additionalRocks = 3
print(maximumBags(capacity, rocks, additionalRocks))  # Output should be 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Deficit Calculation:** Calculate how many rocks are needed for each bag to be full.
2. **Sorting:** Sort the list of deficits.
3. **Filling Bags:** Try to fill each bag using the additional rocks in the order of the sorted deficit values, counting how many bags can be filled.

By following this strategy, you can efficiently solve the problem and determine the maximum number of bags that can be filled to their capacity.
