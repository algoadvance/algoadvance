title:  Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get-out
permalink: /s1561
---

You have a list of integers representing n piles of coins, each pile containing a positive integer number of coins. You want to distribute all the coins into three groups, such that the sum of coins in the second group (your group) is maximized. The distribution must satisfy the following conditions:
- Each group must get exactly n/3 piles.
- You get the second largest piles of coins from each of the groups.
- Return the maximum number of coins you can get.

**Example:**

```
Input: piles = [2,4,1,2,7,8]
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose the second largest pile in each group: 4 + 2 + 3 = 9.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the input list `piles`?**
   - We consider it as `3n` given that we have n groups and each group should contain `n/3` piles.
2. **Is the input list always valid (i.e., it will always be a multiple of 3)?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, the length of the list will always be a multiple of 3.

### Strategy

To maximize the number of coins you get:
1. **Sort the piles in descending order**: This way, the largest piles are at the beginning.
2. **Select the correct indices** to get the second largest group of piles for yourself:
   - Skip the first pile (as it is the largest and goes to your friend).
   - From the remaining list, pick every second pile.
   - This approach will ensure you are maximizing your sum.
  
For example, consider the sorted list `[8, 7, 4, 2, 2, 1]`. We skip the first pile, and then for the next two (4 and 2), we pick the second largest (4); continue this process.

### Code

```python
def maxCoins(piles):
    # Sort the piles in descending order
    piles.sort(reverse=True)
    n = len(piles) // 3
    max_coins = 0
    
    # Calculate the maximum coins you can get
    for i in range(n):
        max_coins += piles[2 * i + 1]
        
    return max_coins

# Test the code with an example
piles = [2, 4, 1, 2, 7, 8]
print(maxCoins(piles))  # Output should be 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the list**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the list.
- **Calculating the sum**: `O(n/3)` which simplifies to `O(n)`.

Overall, the algorithm runs in `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step.
