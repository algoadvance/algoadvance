title:  Number of Good Ways to Split a String-out
permalink: /s1525
---

You are given a string `s`. A split is called good if you can split `s` into two non-empty strings `s1` and `s2` such that the number of distinct characters in `s1` is equal to the number of distinct characters in `s2`.

Return the number of good splits you can make in `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string contain special characters or numbers, or is it restricted to just lowercase English letters?
2. What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?

These questions can affect the approach and optimizations used in solving the problem.

## Strategy

1. **Count Distinct Characters**: First, count the distinct characters as we iterate through the string from left to right and right to left.
   
2. **Two Passes for Counting**:
   - Use two arrays or dictionaries to keep track of the number of distinct characters from the start up to the current index for `s1`.
   - Use another set or dictionary to keep track of the number of distinct characters from the end up to the current index for `s2`.

3. **Check for Good Splits**:
   - Iterate through the string and check if the number of distinct characters in `s1` equals the number of distinct characters in `s2` for each possible split point.

4. **Complexity**: The solution should ideally be O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is due to the need to pass through the string a constant number of times.

## Code

```python
def numSplits(s: str) -> int:
    from collections import Counter

    left_counter = Counter()
    right_counter = Counter(s)

    left_distinct = 0
    right_distinct = len(right_counter)
    
    good_splits = 0

    for char in s:
        # Add char to left partition
        left_counter[char] += 1
        if left_counter[char] == 1:
            left_distinct += 1
        
        # Remove char from right partition
        right_counter[char] -= 1
        if right_counter[char] == 0:
            right_distinct -= 1
        
        # Check for a good split
        if left_distinct == right_distinct:
            good_splits += 1

    return good_splits

# Example Usage
s = "aacaba"
print(numSplits(s))  # Output should be 2
```

## Explanation

1. **Left and Right Counters**:
   - `left_counter` keeps track of character occurrences from the beginning of the string.
   - `right_counter` is initialized with frequency counts of characters in the entire string and then decrements as we move through the string.
   
2. **Counting Distinct Characters**:
   - `left_distinct` increments when a new character is added to `left_counter`.
   - `right_distinct` decrements when a character's count in `right_counter` drops to zero.

3. **Good Split Check**:
   - As we iterate through the string, we adjust `left_counter` and `right_counter` and compare the distinct counts.
   - Whenever `left_distinct` equals `right_distinct`, it signifies a good split, and we increment our count.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the total count of good splits.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n)** since we make a constant number of passes (specifically two passes through the string). The space complexity is **O(1)** if we consider the fixed set of characters (26 lowercase English letters), or **O(m)** (where m is the number of unique characters) more generally.
