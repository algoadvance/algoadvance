title:  Sum Root to Leaf Numbers-out
permalink: /s129
---
The problem requires you to find the sum of all numbers formed from root to leaf paths in a binary tree. Each path from the root to a leaf forms a number by concatenating the values of the nodes. For example, if the path forms the numbers 1 -> 2 -> 3, the number is 123.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a leaf node?**
   - A leaf node is a node with no children.
   
2. **Can the tree contain negative values or only non-negative integers?**
   - The tree will only contain non-negative integers as per typical interpretations of this problem.

3. **Is the binary tree balanced or can it be any shape?**
   - The binary tree can be of any shape. It does not need to be balanced.

### Strategy
We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. As we traverse, we will maintain the current number formed by the nodes' path. When we reach a leaf node, we will add this number to the total sum. The DFS approach can be implemented using recursion.

1. **Initialize `total_sum` as 0.**
2. **Define a recursive function `dfs(node, current_number)` where `node` is the current node, and `current_number` is the number formed from the root to that node.**
3. **If the node is `None`, return 0 (this handles the base case for an empty subtree).**
4. **Update the `current_number` as `current_number * 10 + node.val`.**
5. **If the node is a leaf, add the `current_number` to `total_sum`.**
6. **Recursively call the `dfs` on the left and right subtrees and accumulate their results.**
7. **Finally, return `total_sum` after traversing the entire tree.**

### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, current_number):
            if not node:
                return 0
            current_number = current_number * 10 + node.val
            if not node.left and not node.right:  # It's a leaf
                return current_number
            # Recursive case for left and right children
            left_sum = dfs(node.left, current_number)
            right_sum = dfs(node.right, current_number)
            return left_sum + right_sum
        
        return dfs(root, 0)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the height of the tree can be `N`, but in the best case of a balanced tree, the height is `log(N)`.

This solution efficiently traverses the tree and accumulates the required sums while handle base cases correctly.
