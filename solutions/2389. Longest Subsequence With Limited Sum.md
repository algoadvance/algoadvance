title:  Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum-out
permalink: /s2389
---

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`. For each `queries[i]`, find the maximum length of a subsequence that can be obtained from `nums` such that the sum of the subsequence's elements does not exceed `queries[i]`. 

Return an array `answer` of length `m` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, `nums` only contains non-negative integers.
2. **Can the elements of `nums` be zero?**
   - Yes, elements of `nums` can be zeros.
3. **Is the order of the elements in the subsequence important?**
   - No, the order is not important; only the sum constraint matters.
4. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `nums` and `queries`?**
   - `1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 1000`
   - `0 <= nums[i], queries[i] <= 10^6`

### Strategy
Given the constraints, we can utilize sorting and prefix sums to efficiently determine the maximum length of the subsequence for each query.

1. **Sort the `nums` array:** By sorting, we can easily find the smallest elements to include in the subsequence to keep the sum under the given limit.
2. **Compute prefix sums:** Compute the prefix sums of the sorted `nums` array. The prefix sums will help us quickly determine how many elements we can include for a given sum.
3. **Binary search for each query:** For each query, use binary search on the prefix sums to determine the maximum number of elements that can form a subsequence within the given sum.

### Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def answerQueries(nums, queries):
    # Sort the numbers to make subsequence selection easier
    nums.sort()
    
    # Compute the prefix sums of the sorted nums
    prefix_sums = []
    current_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        prefix_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    answers = []
    for query in queries:
        # Find the maximum length subsequence with sum <= query
        pos = bisect_right(prefix_sums, query)
        answers.append(pos)
    
    return answers

# Example usage
nums = [4, 5, 2, 1]
queries = [3, 10, 21]
print(answerQueries(nums, queries)) # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting `nums`:** `O(n log n)`
- **Computing prefix sums:** `O(n)`
- **Binary search for each query:** `O(m log n)`

Overall time complexity: `O(n log n + m log n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums` and `m` is the length of `queries`. Given the constraints, this approach will be efficient and suitable.
