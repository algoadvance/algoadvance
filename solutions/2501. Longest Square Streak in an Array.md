title:  Longest Square Streak in an Array-out
permalink: /s2501
---

Given an array of integers `nums`, you need to find a subsequence from it such that the numbers in the subsequence can be the sides of squares. The length of this subsequence should be the longest possible. Return the length of the longest subsequence where each number can be the side length of a square. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does "can be the sides of squares" imply?**
   - It implies numbers that when squared are integers.

2. **Can the array contain negative numbers or non-integer values?**
   - Usually, side lengths of squares should be positive integers, but I'll assume the input array can contain any integer. We will disregard non-positive numbers since they can't be side lengths of a square.

3. **Is the order of numbers in the subsequence important?**
   - No, we are only interested in the longest subsequence where the numbers can form sides of squares.

4. **Can there be duplicate numbers in the array?**
   - Yes, there can be, and we can count each one towards the subsequence if applicable.

5. **What is the expected input size?**
   - This will help us reason about an optimal solution and its complexity.

With these points in mind, let's devise a strategy for solving the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Filter the Numbers**: Extract only the numbers that are positive.
2. **Generate Perfect Squares**:
   - Determine the maximum number in the input array, `max_num`.
   - Generate all perfect squares up to `max_num^2`.
3. **Set Data Structure**:
   - Use a set to store these perfect squares for O(1) average time complexity on lookup.
4. **Longest Valid Subsequence**:
   - Iterate through `nums` and count how many of them can be found in our set of perfect squares.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
def longest_square_streak(nums):
    max_num = max(nums) if nums else 0
    # Generate perfect squares up to max_num^2
    perfect_squares = set(i * i for i in range(1, int(max_num**0.5) + 1))
    
    # Count sides that are in perfect squares
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num in perfect_squares:
            count += 1

    return count

# Example Usage
nums = [4, 9, 16, 25, 1, 2, 3, 50]
print(longest_square_streak(nums))  # Output should be 5 (1, 4, 9, 16, 25)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating Perfect Squares**: O(√max_num), where `max_num` is the largest element in `nums`.
  - This involves iterating up to the square root of the maximum number in the list.
- **Checking Numbers**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
  - Each lookup in the set of perfect squares is O(1) on average.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(√max_num + n). This should be efficient for reasonably large values of `max_num` and `n`.
