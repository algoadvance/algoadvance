title:  Spiral Matrix II-out
permalink: /s59
---
Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n x n` matrix filled with elements from `1` to `n^2` in spiral order.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be the starting point for the spiral? 
   **A:** The spiral should start from the top-left corner of the matrix.
   
2. **Q:** Should the numbers be increasing sequentially?
   **A:** Yes, the numbers should start from 1 and increase sequentially up to `n^2`.

3. **Q:** Is there any constraint on the size of `n`?
   **A:** The problem specifies `n` as a positive integer, so `n` will be at least 1.

## Strategy
1. **Create an `n x n` matrix initialized with zeros.**
2. **Define boundaries**: We need four boundaries `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` to control the spiral direction as we fill the matrix.
3. **Set initial values**: Start the current number at 1 and iterate until reaching `n*n`.
4. **Fill the matrix in a spiral order** by adjusting boundaries:
    - Move from left to right on the top row.
    - Move from top to bottom along the right column.
    - Move from right to left on the bottom row.
    - Move from bottom to top along the left column.
5. **Adjust the boundaries each time a complete row or column is filled.**

## Code

```python
def generateMatrix(n):
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    top, bottom, left, right = 0, n - 1, 0, n - 1
    num = 1
    
    while top <= bottom and left <= right:
        # Fill the top row
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            matrix[top][i] = num
            num += 1
        top += 1
        
        # Fill the right column
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            matrix[i][right] = num
            num += 1
        right -= 1
        
        # Fill the bottom row
        for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
            matrix[bottom][i] = num
            num += 1
        bottom -= 1
        
        # Fill the left column
        for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
            matrix[i][left] = num
            num += 1
        left += 1
    
    return matrix
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm fills each cell in the `n x n` matrix exactly once, so the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because the algorithm creates an `n x n` matrix to store the results.
