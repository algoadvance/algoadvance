title:  Subarrays with K Different Integers-out
permalink: /s992
---
Given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `K`, return the number of subarrays that have exactly `K` different integers.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3], K = 2
Output: 7

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,4], K = 3
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - The size of the `nums` array can range from 1 to 50,000.
2. **What is the range for the values in `nums` and `K`?**
   - The values in `nums` are positive integers and can range from 1 to a large number.
   - `K` is a positive integer and will be between 1 and the length of `nums`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the array `nums` (ordering, uniqueness, etc.)?**
   - No specific constraints, the array can contain duplicates and is not ordered.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach to find the number of subarrays with exactly `K` different integers. We can break this into two main steps using a helper function:

1. **Count the number of subarrays with at most `K` different integers.**
2. **Use this helper to find the number of subarrays with exactly `K` different integers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `K-1` different integers from the number found in step 1.**

The function `atMostK` will help in counting subarrays with at most `K` different integers.

## Code

```python
def subarraysWithKDistinct(nums, K):
    def atMostK(nums, K):
        from collections import Counter
        
        count = Counter()
        left = 0
        result = 0
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if count[nums[right]] == 0:
                K -= 1
            count[nums[right]] += 1
            
            while K < 0:
                count[nums[left]] -= 1
                if count[nums[left]] == 0:
                    K += 1
                left += 1
            
            result += right - left + 1
        
        return result
    
    return atMostK(nums, K) - atMostK(nums, K - 1)

# Example Usage
nums1 = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
K1 = 2
print(subarraysWithKDistinct(nums1, K1))  # Output: 7

nums2 = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]
K2 = 3
print(subarraysWithKDistinct(nums2, K2))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice â€“ once when extending the right end of the window and once when the left end is moved past it. The dictionary operations (increment, decrement, addition) generally take O(1) time.
