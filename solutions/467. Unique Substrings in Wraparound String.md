title:  Unique Substrings in Wraparound String-out
permalink: /s467
---

We are given a string `p` consisting of lowercase English letters. Suppose we have a string 's' that consists of the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so `s` looks like this: "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd...".

We need to determine the number of unique non-empty substrings of `p` that are substrings of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length Constraints**: What is the maximum length of string `p`?
   - The length of `p` can be up to 10,000.

2. **Character Constraints**: Are there any characters in `p` that are outside the range 'a' to 'z'?
   - No, the string `p` consists only of lowercase English letters.

3. **Output**: Are we only interested in the count of unique substrings, or do we need to list them?
   - We only need the count of unique substrings.

### Strategy

1. **Wraparound Consideration**:
   - The wraparound string "s" can be visualized as a sequence where 'z' is followed by 'a', forming a cycle.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use an array `dp` where `dp[c]` stores the maximum length of the substring ending with character `c`.
   - Traverse through the string `p`, for each character, update the lengths of substrings that fit the wraparound condition.
   - Maintain a count of the maximum length of valid substrings ending with each character from 'a' to 'z'.

3. **Length Update**:
   - For each character in the string `p`, check if it is the next character in the wraparound sequence of the previous character.
   - If yes, increment the length of the substring; otherwise, reset it to 1.
   - Update the `dp` array with the maximum length found for each endpoint character.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The answer is the sum of all values in the `dp` array, giving the count of unique substrings.

### Code

```python
def findSubstringInWraproundString(p: str) -> int:
    if not p:
        return 0

    dp = {chr(i): 0 for i in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)}
    max_len_current = 0
    
    for i in range(len(p)):
        if i > 0 and (ord(p[i]) - ord(p[i - 1]) == 1 or ord(p[i - 1]) - ord(p[i]) == 25):
            max_len_current += 1
        else:
            max_len_current = 1
        dp[p[i]] = max(dp[p[i]], max_len_current)
    
    return sum(dp.values())

# Example usage
p = "zab"
print(findSubstringInWraproundString(p))  # Output should be 6
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `p`. Each character of the string is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because the `dp` array stores a fixed number of characters (26 letters in the alphabet), resulting in constant space usage.

This ensures an efficient calculation of the number of unique substrings that fit the given conditions.
