title:  Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal-out
permalink: /s971
---

Given a binary tree with `n` nodes, each node in the tree has a unique number ranging from `1` to `n`. You are given the `root` of the binary tree and a sequence of integers `voyage`, which represents the desired pre-order traversal of the tree.

You need to flip the nodes in the binary tree in such a way that its pre-order traversal matches the given `voyage`. We can flip a node, which means we swap its left and right child subtrees. Return a list of the values of all the nodes that are flipped in order to achieve the desired pre-order traversal. If it is not possible, return the list `[-1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a flip?**
   - A flip at a node means swapping its left and right child subtrees.

2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The number of nodes \(n\) in the binary tree is between 1 and 100.

3. **Can the tree or the voyage be empty?**
   - No, the problem guarantees that there will be at least one node, and both the tree and the voyage will have at least one element.

4. **Are the voyage numbers unique?**
   - Yes, each number in `voyage` is unique and ranges from 1 to `n`.

### Strategy

1. **Pre-order Traversal Definition**:
   - Pre-order traversal processes nodes in the order: root, left subtree, right subtree.

2. **Simulated Matching Process**:
   - We can use a pointer to track our position in the given `voyage`.
   - We then simulate the traversal of the tree and try to match it with the given `voyage`.

3. **Handling Mismatches**:
   - If we encounter a mismatch, we attempt a flip and check both configurations (original and flipped).
   - If neither configuration works, we return `[-1]`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Define a recursive helper function to traverse the tree and check for matches.
   - If needed, record the nodes where flips are performed.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def flipMatchVoyage(root, voyage):
    flips = []
    index = 0
    
    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal index
        if not node:
            return True
        if node.val != voyage[index]:
            return False
        index += 1
        if node.left and node.left.val != voyage[index]:
            flips.append(node.val)
            node.left, node.right = node.right, node.left
        return dfs(node.left) and dfs(node.right)
    
    return flips if dfs(root) else [-1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited exactly once as we simulate the pre-order traversal and check the match with `voyage`.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\).
  - Due to the recursion stack space used by the depth-first search.

This solution aims to provide an efficient and straightforward approach to solve the problem by leveraging recursive tree traversal and minimal state tracking.
