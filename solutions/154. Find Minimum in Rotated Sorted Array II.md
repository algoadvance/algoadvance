title:  Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II-out
permalink: /s154
---
You are given an array of integers `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and then possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index. The array may contain duplicates. You need to find the minimum element in the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time complexity if possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one element.
2. **Are all the elements in the array integers?**
   - Yes, all elements are integers.
3. **Is there an upper bound on the size of the array?**
   - No specific size constraint is given, but the solution should handle reasonably large arrays within typical algorithmic constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Binary Search Modification**: Given the presence of duplicates, we need to slightly adjust the typical binary search used to find the minimum in a rotated sorted array. The key challenge arises when `nums[left]`, `nums[mid]`, and `nums[right]` are equal, making it difficult to decide which side to search.
  
2. **Handling Duplicates**: When duplicates are found, especially when `nums[left]` equals `nums[mid]` equals `nums[right]`, we can safely ignore the `right` boundary by decrementing it. This won't affect the minimum element since `nums[mid]` can give us a direction.
  
3. **Binary Search Logic**:
    - Compute mid as `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
    - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]`.
      - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, the minimum is in the right half.
      - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, the minimum is in the left half.
      - If `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, decrement `right` to skip the duplicate.

### Code
Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def findMin(nums):
    left, right = 0, nums.length - 1

    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] < nums[right]:
            right = mid
        else:
            right -= 1

    return nums[left]

# Example on how the function works
example_array = [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]
print(findMin(example_array))  # Output will be 0
```

### Time Complexity
- **Best and Average Case**: `O(log n)` where binary search efficiently narrows down the search range.
- **Worst Case**: `O(n)` when all elements are the same or there are many duplicates, making the algorithm degrade to linear search.

This solution ensures you efficiently find the minimum element in the array, even with the presence of duplicates.
