title:  Steps to Make Array Non-decreasing-out
permalink: /s2289
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one step, remove all elements from `nums` that are strictly greater than their left neighbor. Return the number of steps required to make `nums` non-decreasing.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Step 1: Remove the numbers which are greater than the number before them: [3,4,4,3,6,8,5]
Step 2: Remove the numbers which are greater than the number before them: [3,4,3,5]
Step 3: Remove the numbers which are greater than the number before them: [3,3]
[3,3] is a non-decreasing array. Therefore, we needed 3 steps to make the array non-decreasing.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,7,7,13]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already non-decreasing. Therefore, we do not need any steps.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are we allowed to modify the input array in place?
   **A:** Yes.
2. **Q:** Will there be negative numbers or zeros in the array?
   **A:** Yes, the problem does not constrain the values of the integers in any specific range.
3. **Q:** What is the smallest possible size for the input array?
   **A:** The smallest possible size is 1.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use an iterative approach where we will repeatedly scan through the array and remove elements that are greater than their left neighbor. This process would be repeated until no such elements are found.

### Code

```python
def totalSteps(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    steps = 0
    stack = []
    time = [0] * n

    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while stack and nums[i] > nums[stack[-1]]:
            time[i] = max(time[i] + 1, time[stack.pop()])
        stack.append(i)
        steps = max(steps, time[i])
    
    return steps

# Example usage
nums1 = [5,3,4,4,7,3,6,11,8,5,11]
nums2 = [4,5,7,7,13]
print(totalSteps(nums1))  # Output: 3
print(totalSteps(nums2))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start by defining a stack to store indices and an array `time` to record the steps.
2. **Iterative Scanning**: We iterate from the end of the list to the start.
   - Use a stack to keep track of the indices we have processed.
   - For each number, if it is greater than the last number added to the stack (which is actually on the right in the original array due to reverse iteration), calculate how many steps it will take to remove it.
   - Update the max steps required to keep track of the number of iterations needed.
3. **Return the Maximum Steps**: After completing all iterations, the `steps` variable will contain the maximum steps needed to make the array non-decreasing.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution operates in O(n) time because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the stack and the `time` list.

This gives us an efficient solution to the problem while ensuring we accurately track and update the steps required at each stage.
