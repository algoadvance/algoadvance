title:  Valid Palindrome II-out
permalink: /s680
---

Given a string `s`, determine if it can become a palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What characters does the string `s` contain? 
   - The string `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.
  
2. What is the length constraint on `s`?
   - The length of the string `s` will be at most \(10^5\).

3. Is the problem case-sensitive?
   - Yes, the string is case-sensitive.

### Strategy

1. We will use a two-pointer approach:
   - Initialize two pointers: `left` pointing to the beginning of the string and `right` pointing to the end.
   - Move the pointers towards each other, comparing the characters at the `left` and `right` positions.
   
2. If the characters at `left` and `right` are the same, move both pointers inward.
3. If the characters are different, we have two options:
   - Skip the character at the `left` pointer and check if the resulting substring is a palindrome.
   - Skip the character at the `right` pointer and check if the resulting substring is a palindrome.
   
4. Use a helper function `is_palindrome` to verify if a substring is a palindrome.
5. If either possibility results in a palindrome, then the original string can be a palindrome after deleting one character.

### Code

```python
def validPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    def is_palindrome(sub: str, left: int, right: int) -> bool:
        while left < right:
            if sub[left] != sub[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True
    
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if s[left] == s[right]:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        else:
            # Try skipping either the left character or the right character
            return is_palindrome(s, left + 1, right) or is_palindrome(s, left, right - 1)
    
    return True
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because, in the worst case, we might check the entire string once with two pointers and may also check one additional substring with the `is_palindrome` function, but overall, we are making a linear pass.
