title:  Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1161
---

Given the `root` of a binary tree, the level of its root is `1`, the level of its children is `2`, and so on.

Return the smallest level `x` such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level `x` is maximal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of values do the tree nodes contain?**
   - The tree nodes contain integer values (both positive and negative).

2. **Is the tree guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the tree is guaranteed to be non-empty.

3. **Can the tree be arbitrarily large?**
   - Yes, the tree can be large, but we can use an efficient traversal method to handle it.

## Strategy

1. **Use Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We'll traverse the tree level by level.
   - For each level, compute the sum of node values.
   - Track the maximum sum encountered and the corresponding level.
   
2. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a queue to perform BFS.
   - Maintain a variable to store the current level and its sum.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def maxLevelSum(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0

    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_level = 1
    current_level = 1
    
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_sum = 0
        level_size = len(queue)
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_sum += node.val
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        if level_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = level_sum
            max_level = current_level
        
        current_level += 1
    
    return max_level
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is processed exactly once.

The space complexity is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the maximum number of nodes at any level. In the worst case, this can be \(O(n/2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\). 

By using BFS, we efficiently find the level with the maximum sum in a single traversal.
