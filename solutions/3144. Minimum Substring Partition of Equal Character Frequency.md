title:  Minimum Substring Partition of Equal Character Frequency-out
permalink: /s3144
---

You've been given a task to partition a string into exactly \( k \) contiguous substrings, such that each character in the original string appears in exactly \( k \) of these substrings. Specifically, for every character in the string, the frequency of that character in each partition should be the same across all the partitions.

Write a function `min_substring_partition(s: str, k: int) -> List[str]` that performs this partitioning. The function should return a list of \( k \) substrings if possible. If no such partitioning exists, return an empty list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of the String**: Is there any constraint on the length of the string?
   - This will determine the efficiency of our algorithm.
   
2. **Character Distribution**: Does the input guarantee that the characters can be evenly distributed?

3. **Character Frequency**: Should each character appear exactly the same number of times in each partition?

### Strategy

- **Frequency Count**: First, count the frequency of each character in the string.
- **Divisibility Check**: Ensure that for each character, its frequency in the string is divisible by \( k \). If not, return an empty list.
- **Construct Partitions**:
  - Use the frequencies to determine how many of each character should be in each partition.
  - Iterate through the string, distributing characters to the partitions in a way that maintains balance.
  
### Time Complexity

- Counting character frequencies will take \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string.
- Constructing the partitions will also take \( O(n) \) since we will iterate through the string again.

Overall, the time complexity will be \( O(n) \).

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
def min_substring_partition(s: str, k: int) -> List[str]:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Calculate frequencies of each character
    freq = Counter(s)
    
    # Check if every character's frequency is divisible by k
    for char in freq:
        if freq[char] % k != 0:
            return []  # Cannot partition as required
    
    # Determine required frequency of each character in each partition
    partition_freq = {char: freq[char] // k for char in freq}
    
    # Initialize k partitions
    partitions = ['' for _ in range(k)]
    
    # Iterate over the string and distribute characters to partitions
    current_partition_idx = 0
    for char in s:
        partitions[current_partition_idx] += char
        if len(partitions[current_partition_idx]) % partition_freq[char] == 0:
            # Move to next partition if current partition has required frequency of this char
            current_partition_idx = (current_partition_idx + 1) % k
    
    return partitions

# Example usage
print(min_substring_partition("aabbcc", 2))  # Expected output: ["abc","abc"]
print(min_substring_partition("aaaa", 2))    # Expected output: ["aa","aa"]
print(min_substring_partition("aaa", 2))     # Expected output: []
```

This code ensures that each character maintains the same frequency across all partitions and handles edge cases where partitioning isn't possible.
