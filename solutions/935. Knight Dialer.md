title:  Knight Dialer-out
permalink: /s935
---

A chess knight can move in an L shape: 
- It can move two squares in a cardinal direction (north, south, east, west), and one square in a perpendicular direction, 
- or one square in a cardinal direction and two squares in the perpendicular direction.

This movement can be granted to a knight dialer on a 3x4 phone keypad, like so:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
* 0 #
```

- The knight cannot land on `*` and `#`.
- Given an integer `n`, the number of allowed moves, you need to count how many distinct phone numbers of length `n` can be dialed starting from any key except `*` or `#`.

Write a function `knightDialer(n: int) -> int` which takes an integer `n` and returns the number of distinct phone numbers of length `n` that can be dialed modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Starting Point**: Can the knight start from any digit?
   - Yes, it can start from any key (0-9) except for `*` and `#`.

2. **Modulus Operation**: Should results be returned modulo 10^9 + 7?
   - Yes, because the result can be very large.

## Strategy

1. **Movement Patterns**: Define the knight's moves from each key.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of paths:
   - Define a DP table `dp[i][j]`, where `i` represents steps taken and `j` represents the digit.
   - Initialize `dp[0][j]` to 1 for all valid digit `j` because it represents starting the knight from any valid key.
   - For each move, calculate the number of ways to reach each key based on the previous state.
3. **Sum Up**: Sum the total number of ways to get a sequence of length `n`.

## Code

```python
def knightDialer(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    moves = {
        0: [4, 6],
        1: [6, 8],
        2: [7, 9],
        3: [4, 8],
        4: [0, 3, 9],
        5: [],
        6: [0, 1, 7],
        7: [2, 6],
        8: [1, 3],
        9: [2, 4]
    }
    
    dp = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(n)]
    for j in range(10):
        dp[0][j] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(10):
            dp[i][j] = 0
            for move in moves[j]:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][move]
                dp[i][j] %= MOD
    
    return sum(dp[n - 1]) % MOD

# Example usage:
# n = 3
# print(knightDialer(n))  # Output: 46
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * 10 * 3)`, which simplifies to `O(n)`, since:
- We have `n` steps to iterate.
- For each digit (10 digits), we are iterating and performing a constant number of operations (up to 3 moves per digit).

The space complexity is also `O(n * 10)`, which simplifies to `O(n)` for the dp table.
