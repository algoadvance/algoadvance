title:  Flood Fill-out

An image is represented by an m x n integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `newColor`. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `newColor`.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

### Example 1:
```
Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the pixel with value 1),
all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
 ```

### Example 2:
```
Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
```

### Constraints:
- `m == image.length`
- `n == image[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `0 <= image[i][j], newColor < 2^16`
- `0 <= sr < m`
- `0 <= sc < n`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we perform the flood fill if the starting pixel is already the new color? *No, there is no need to perform the flood fill if the starting pixel is already of the new color, as it won't change anything in the image.*
2. Is it guaranteed that the given indices `sr` and `sc` are within the bounds of the image? *Yes, the constraints guarantee that `0 <= sr < m` and `0 <= sc < n`.*

## Strategy
We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to perform the flood fill. Here are the detailed steps:
1. Check if the starting pixel `image[sr][sc]` is already equal to the `newColor`. If it is, simply return the image as no changes are needed.
2. Otherwise, store the original color of the starting pixel.
3. Use a recursive DFS function to visit each pixel that has the same original color and change it to the `newColor`.
4. Handle the recursion by stopping when encountering a pixel that is out of bounds or not of the original color.

## Code

```python
def floodFill(image, sr, sc, newColor):
    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or r >= len(image) or c < 0 or c >= len(image[0]) or image[r][c] != originalColor:
            return
        image[r][c] = newColor
        dfs(r + 1, c)
        dfs(r - 1, c)
        dfs(r, c + 1)
        dfs(r, c - 1)
    
    originalColor = image[sr][sc]
    if originalColor == newColor:
        return image
    
    dfs(sr, sc)
    return image

# Example usage:
image = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
sr = 1
sc = 1
newColor = 2
print(floodFill(image, sr, sc, newColor))  # Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1]]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(m * n) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the image. In the worst-case scenario, every pixel might need to be visited and colored. 
- The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to recursion stack space usage in the worst case. 

This solution is efficient given the constraints.
