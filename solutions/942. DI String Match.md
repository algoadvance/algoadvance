You are given a string `s` that consists only of the characters `'I'` (increase) and `'D'` (decrease). Assume that `s` has a length `n`. You need to find a permutation `perm` of the integers from `0` to `n` such that for all `i`:

- If `s[i] == 'I'`, then `perm[i] < perm[i + 1]`
- If `s[i] == 'D'`, then `perm[i] > perm[i + 1]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**
   - Is the input string guaranteed to have only characters 'I' and 'D'? 
     - Yes, the problem guarantees this constraint.
   - What is the range for the length `n`?
     - The length can be up to 10,000, as per typical LeetCode problem constraints.

2. **Output Expectations**
   - Should the output be any valid permutation that satisfies the condition?
     - Yes, any valid permutation meeting the criteria is acceptable.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer technique. Start with the smallest and largest possible numbers, and place them based on the characters in the string:

- Initialize two pointers: `low` to 0 and `high` to `n` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`).
- Traverse through the string `s` and construct the permutation:
  - If the current character is `'I'`, set the current position in the permutation to `low` and increment `low`.
  - If the current character is `'D'`, set the current position in the permutation to `high` and decrement `high`.
- The last element to be placed after the loop will be the remaining value of `low` (which should be equal to `high` at that point).

This approach ensures that all conditions are met with a time complexity of O(n).

### Code

```python
def diStringMatch(s: str):
    n = len(s)
    low, high = 0, n
    perm = []
    
    for char in s:
        if char == 'I':
            perm.append(low)
            low += 1
        else:
            perm.append(high)
            high -= 1
    
    # Append the last remaining number which should be same for both low and high
    perm.append(low)  # low and high are the same at this point
    
    return perm

# Example Usage
s = "IDID"
print(diStringMatch(s))  # Output should be a valid permutation like [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We make a single pass through the string to determine the permutation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, due to the storage requirement of the output list `perm`.
