title:  Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles-out
permalink: /s3047
---

You are given the bottom-left coordinates, width, and height of two rectangles. Your goal is to find the largest possible area of a square that can fit exactly inside both rectangles. 

### Inputs:
1. `rect1_bottom_left` - A tuple `(x1, y1)` representing the bottom-left coordinates of the first rectangle.
2. `rect1_width` - Width of the first rectangle.
3. `rect1_height` - Height of the first rectangle.
4. `rect2_bottom_left` - A tuple `(x2, y2)` representing the bottom-left coordinates of the second rectangle.
5. `rect2_width` - Width of the second rectangle.
6. `rect2_height` - Height of the second rectangle.

### Output:
- The side length of the largest possible square that can fit exactly inside both rectangles.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no square can fit in both rectangles?**
   - Return `0` if no square can fit exactly inside both rectangles.

2. **Is the origin (0,0) at the bottom-left of the coordinate system?**
   - Yes, this is the typical assumption unless otherwise mentioned.

3. **Are the rectangle dimensions positive integers?**
   - Yes, the widths and heights of the rectangles are positive integers.

4. **Can the rectangles overlap or intersect?**
   - This problem assumes we are only given the dimensions and coordinates and not focusing on the overlap or intersection.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Constraints:**
   - Determine the possible constraints for the side length of the square by figuring out the maximum possible size that can fit within each rectangle separately.

2. **Determine Minimum Side Length of the Square:**
   - The length of the side of the square that can fit inside both rectangles must be the minimum width and height from both rectangles.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Compute the maximum side length for each rectangle.
   - Choose the minimum of these values as the largest possible side length of the square that can fit within both rectangles.

## Code

```python
def largest_square_side_length(rect1_bottom_left, rect1_width, rect1_height, rect2_bottom_left, rect2_width, rect2_height):
    # Calculate maximum possible side for each rectangle
    max_side_rect1 = min(rect1_width, rect1_height)
    max_side_rect2 = min(rect2_width, rect2_height)
    
    # The largest possible square side that fits both rectangles
    result_side = min(max_side_rect1, max_side_rect2)
    
    return result_side

# Example usage:
rect1_bottom_left = (0, 0)
rect1_width = 2
rect1_height = 3

rect2_bottom_left = (1, 1)
rect2_width = 2
rect2_height = 2

print(largest_square_side_length(rect1_bottom_left, rect1_width, rect1_height, rect2_bottom_left, rect2_width, rect2_height))
# Output should be: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
  - The calculations involve a constant number of operations which do not depend on the size of the input values.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - No additional space proportional to the input size is used.
