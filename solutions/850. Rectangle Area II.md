title:  Rectangle Area II-out
permalink: /s850
---

You are given a list of `rectangles` represented as `rectangles[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of the bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of the top-right corner of the ith rectangle. Calculate the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Any area covered by two or more rectangles should only be counted once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Coordinates**: What is the range of the coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)?
    - **Answer**: Coordinates are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

2. **Rectangle Constraints**: Are rectangles guaranteed to be non-degenerate? i.e., x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.
    - **Answer**: Yes, it's guaranteed that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2 for all rectangles.

3. **Number of Rectangles**: What is the maximum number of rectangles that can be provided in the input?
    - **Answer**: The maximum number of rectangles is 200.

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we can use a data structure and algorithm that can handle overlapping areas efficiently. A good approach is to use **line sweeping** combined with an **event-based approach**, where we handle entering and leaving events for the rectangles:

1. **Event Generation**:
    - For each rectangle, generate two events: 
        - An entering event when a rectangle starts.
        - A leaving event when a rectangle ends.

2. **Sort Events**:
    - Sort the events primarily by the x-coordinate. If two events have the same x-coordinate, sort them by the event type (entering event first).

3. **Line Sweep and Active Intervals**:
    - Use a line sweep on the x-coordinates, calculate the total area covered by maintaining a count of active intervals on the y-axis.

### Code

Here's a Python implementation of the strategy described above:

```python
def rectangleArea(rectangles):
    # Event structure: (x, type, y1, y2)
    events = []
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in rectangles:
        events.append((x1, 1, y1, y2))
        events.append((x2, -1, y1, y2))

    # Sort events by x, and then by type
    events.sort()

    # This function calculates the total length of union of intervals
    def calc_total_y(active_y_intervals):
        total = 0
        prev_y = -1
        for y1, y2 in active_y_intervals:
            if y1 > prev_y:
                total += y2 - y1
                prev_y = y2
            else:
                if y2 > prev_y:
                    total += y2 - prev_y
                    prev_y = y2
        return total
    
    # To store the active intervals on the y axis
    active_intervals = []
    current_x = events[0][0]
    total_area = 0
    
    for x, event_type, y1, y2 in events:
        total_area += calc_total_y(active_intervals) * (x - current_x)
        current_x = x
        
        if event_type == 1:  # Add new interval
            active_intervals.append((y1, y2))
            active_intervals.sort()
        else:  # Remove interval
            active_intervals.remove((y1, y2))
    
    return total_area % (10**9 + 7)

# Example usage:
rectangles = [
    [0, 0, 2, 2],
    [1, 0, 2, 3],
    [1, 0, 3, 1]
]

print(rectangleArea(rectangles))  # Expected output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the events: \(O(N \log N)\)
- Processing events: \(O(N^2)\) in the worst case, because for each event, we might need to re-sort the active intervals.
- Total time complexity: \(O(N^2)\)

This solution ensures that overlaps are handled correctly and provides an efficient method to compute the area covered by multiple rectangles, even when they overlap.
