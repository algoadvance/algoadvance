### 2338. Count the Number of Ideal Arrays

An array `arr` is considered ***ideal*** if the following conditions hold:
- `arr[i] ≤ 2 * arr[i - 1]` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`.

Given two integers `n` (length of the array) and `maxValue` (maximum value of any element in the array `arr`), return the number of ***ideal arrays*** of length `n` such that the maximum element is within the given `maxValue`. Return the number of such arrays modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n` and `maxValue`?**
   - `n` ranges from `1` to `10^4`.
   - `maxValue` ranges from `1` to `10^4`.
   
2. **Are we considering arrays of non-negative integers only?**
   - Yes, arrays consist of positive integers since the max value is given and is positive.
   
3. **What is the desired output format?**
   - The count of ideal arrays modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Let's proceed with the solution strategy.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to use some dynamic programming because of the high constraints to enumerate all combinations directly.

1. **Define a DP table:** `dp[length][num]` where `dp[length][num]` represents the number of ideal arrays of length `length` that end with the number `num`.

2. **Base case:** For arrays of length `1`:
   - `dp[1][num] = 1` for all `1 <= num <= maxValue`.

3. **Transition between states:**
   - For a given length `l` and number `num`, the array can end with `num` only if the previous number in the array could be `num/2`, `num/3`, ... , `num/k` as long as the integer division results in a positive integer.

4. **Summing up results:**
   - The final result will be the sum of `dp[n][x]` for all `1 <= x <= maxValue`.

5. **Modulus Operation:** Since the output should be given modulo `10^9 + 7`, we need to continuously take modulo in our operations to avoid overflow and adhere to the constraint.

## Code

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
def idealArrays(n, maxValue):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    dp = [[0] * (maxValue + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize base case
    for x in range(1, maxValue + 1):
        dp[1][x] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for num in range(1, maxValue + 1):
            for k in range(1, num + 1):
                if num % k == 0:
                    dp[length][num] = (dp[length][num] + dp[length - 1][num // k]) % MOD
    
    # Sum up the result
    result = sum(dp[n][x] for x in range(1, maxValue + 1)) % MOD
    return result

# Example usage
n = 2
maxValue = 5
print(idealArrays(n, maxValue))  # Output should be based on the constraints and logic correctness
```

## Time Complexity

Given the nested loops, the time complexity can be analyzed as:

1. **DP Table Initialization:**
   - Takes O(maxValue) time for the base case initialization.

2. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - Two nested loops for `n` and `maxValue` respectively, leading to O(n * maxValue).
   - The innermost loop runs up to `maxValue` times in the worst case, leading to O(maxValue).
   
Thus, the time complexity is:
   - O(n * maxValue^2) in the worst case scenario.

This approach is feasible within the given constraints (assuming `10^4 * 10^4^2` operations would be manageable).

However, further optimizations or approach refinements can be considered to improve time complexity if this approach turns out to be inefficient for edge cases.
