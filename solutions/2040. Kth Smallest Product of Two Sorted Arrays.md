title:  Kth Smallest Product of Two Sorted Arrays-out
permalink: /s2040
---

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `m` and `n` respectively, return the k-th smallest product of any pair `(nums1[i], nums2[j])` where `1 <= k <= m * n`. The product of the pair is defined as `nums1[i] * nums2[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the constraints on the elements of `nums1` and `nums2`? (e.g., integer range)
    - Are there any duplicates in the arrays?

    Constraints generally help in deciding on possible edge cases and efficiency considerations.

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should we return the k-th smallest product as an integer?

3. **Example Cases**:
    - To ensure understanding, providing a few examples would be helpful.

### Code

Here we will use a binary search strategy to find the k-th smallest product. Binary search can help efficiently narrow down the range of potential products.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Considerations**:
    - Start with identifying the range of possible products. The smallest product could be `nums1[0] * nums2[0]` and the largest could be `nums1[-1] * nums2[-1]`.
  
2. **Binary Search Setup**:
    - Use binary search to identify the potential product value at the k-th position. The middle product value (`mid`) will be checked to see if there are at least `k` products less than or equal to it.

3. **Counting Function**:
    - For each candidate product, count how many products are less than or equal to the candidate. This can be done efficiently with two pointers due to the sorted nature of the arrays.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log(max_product - min_product))
- **Counting Less Than or Equal Products**: O(m + n) per binary search step

Given this, the overall complexity is effectively O((m + n) * log(max_product - min_product)).

### Code Implementation

```python
def kthSmallestProduct(nums1, nums2, k):
    def countLessEqual(mid):
        count = 0
        j = len(nums2) - 1
        for num in nums1:
            while j >= 0 and num * nums2[j] > mid:
                j -= 1
            count += (j + 1)
        return count
    
    low, high = min(nums1[0] * nums2[0], nums1[-1] * nums2[-1]), max(nums1[0] * nums2[0], nums1[-1] * nums2[-1])
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if countLessEqual(mid) < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    
    return low

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 7, 11]
nums2 = [2, 4, 6]
k = 3

print(kthSmallestProduct(nums1, nums2, k))  # Adjust according to the expected example
```

This implementation uses a binary search to efficiently zero in on the k-th smallest product by leveraging the sorted nature of the arrays. For each candidate product value, we count how many products are less or equal to it, adjusting our search range based on this count.
