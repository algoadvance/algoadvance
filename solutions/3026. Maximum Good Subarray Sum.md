title:  Maximum Good Subarray Sum-out
permalink: /s3026
---

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k, find the subarray which has the maximum good sum-out. A good sum-out of a subarray is defined as the sum of cubes of each element in the subarray minus k * sum of elements in the subarray. Formally, given a subarray nums[i] to nums[j], the good sum-out can be represented as:

\[
\text{GoodSumOut}(i, j) = \left( \sum_{x = i}^{j} \text{nums}[x]^3 \right) - k \left( \sum_{x = i}^{j} \text{nums}[x] \right)
\]

You need to return the maximum good sum-out of all possible subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `nums` and size `n`:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums` and the values it can contain?
   - Can `nums` contain negative numbers?

2. **Subarray definition:**
   - Is the subarray required to have a minimum length, or can it be of length 0?

3. **Multiple maximum subarrays:**
   - If there are multiple subarrays with the same maximum good sum-out, do you need to return all or just one?

#### Clarifying Questions and Answers

1. - The array can have up to 10^5 elements.
   - `nums` can contain negative numbers.
2. - Subarrays should have a minimum length of 1.
3. - No specific requirement to return multiple subarrays, just the maximum good sum-out value.

### Strategy

1. **Transformation of the Problem:**
   - Define a new array `transformed_nums` where each element is `nums[i]^3 - k * nums[i]`.
   - The problem now converts to finding the maximum subarray sum in the `transformed_nums` array, which is a typical "Maximum Subarray Sum" problem.

2. **Apply Kadane's Algorithm:**
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently.

### Code

```python
def max_good_sum_out(nums, k):
    # Transform the array according to the problem statement
    transformed_nums = [x**3 - k*x for x in nums]

    # Apply Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum
    max_ending_here = transformed_nums[0]
    max_so_far = transformed_nums[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(transformed_nums)):
        max_ending_here = max(transformed_nums[i], max_ending_here + transformed_nums[i])
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    
    return max_so_far

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, -3, 4]
k = 2
print(max_good_sum_out(nums, k))  # Example output, need input for exact result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Transformation Step:** Transforming the array takes O(n) time.
- **Kadane's Algorithm:** Applying Kadane's algorithm also takes O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.

### Conclusion

This approach leverages a simple and efficient transformation followed by Kadane's Algorithm to solve the problem in linear time. The method ensures that we can handle large inputs up to the constraint limits efficiently.
