title:  Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix-out
permalink: /s1594
---
Given a rectangular grid of integers, find the maximum non-negative product of any path in the grid. The path should go from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell and you are only allowed to move right or down. Return the maximum non-negative product mod 10^9 + 7. If the maximum non-negative product is negative, return -1.

## Example:
```
Input: grid = [[-1,-2,-3],
               [-2,-3,-3],
               [-3,-3,-2]]
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the grid contain zeroes?
   - Yes, the grid can contain zeroes.
2. Are we allowed to revisit cells?
   - No, we can only move to the right or down.
3. What is the constraint on the grid size?
   - The grid's size can be `1 <= grid.size() <= 15`.

## Strategy

The main idea is to use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum and maximum products at each cell because the maximum product could involve multiplying negative values to get a positive value. We'll use two matrices: `min_product[i][j]` and `max_product[i][j]`, where `min_product[i][j]` holds the minimum product until cell (i, j) and `max_product[i][j]` holds the maximum product until cell (i, j).

### Steps:
1. Initialize `min_product` and `max_product` matrices the same size as the input grid.
2. Set `min_product[0][0]` and `max_product[0][0]` to `grid[0][0]`.
3. Iterate over the grid and for each cell, calculate the minimum and maximum product one can achieve at that cell by coming either from the left or from above.
4. Update the `min_product` and `max_product` values considering both previous states.
5. The answer is `max_product[m-1][n-1] % (10^9 + 7)` if it's non-negative, else `-1`.

### Code:
```python
def maxProductPath(grid):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize DP arrays
    min_product = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    max_product = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    min_product[0][0] = max_product[0][0] = grid[0][0]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 and j == 0:  # Skip the starting cell
                continue
            
            if i > 0:
                min_prod_upper = min_product[i-1][j] * grid[i][j]
                max_prod_upper = max_product[i-1][j] * grid[i][j]
            else:
                min_prod_upper = max_prod_upper = float('inf') if grid[i][j] < 0 else float('-inf')
            
            if j > 0:
                min_prod_left = min_product[i][j-1] * grid[i][j]
                max_prod_left = max_product[i][j-1] * grid[i][j]
            else:
                min_prod_left = max_prod_left = float('inf') if grid[i][j] < 0 else float('-inf')
            
            min_product[i][j] = min(min_prod_upper, min_prod_left, max_prod_upper, max_prod_left)
            max_product[i][j] = max(min_prod_upper, min_prod_left, max_prod_upper, max_prod_left)

    max_prod = max_product[m-1][n-1]
    return max_prod % MOD if max_prod >= 0 else -1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We iterate over each cell once and perform a constant amount of work per cell.

We should be ready to implement the solution, considering these detailed steps ensure we are on the right track for solving the problem efficiently.
