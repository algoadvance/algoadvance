The problem is defined on LeetCode as follows:

**1879. Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays**

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`.

The **XOR sum** of the two integers is a binary operation, denoted as `a ^ b`, where each bit in the result is the same as the corresponding bit in `a` if `b` is `0`, and it's the complement of the corresponding bit in `a` if `b` is `1`.

- For example, `1 ^ 3 = 2` because `1` is represented as `01` in binary and `3` is `11`, thus `01 ^ 11 = 10` = 2.
- The XOR sum of an array is the XOR of all the elements in the array.

You need to find the minimum XOR sum of the two arrays by assigning each element in `nums2` to an element in `nums1` such that each element in `nums2` is assigned exactly once.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the numbers in the arrays?**
   - Integers in arrays `nums1` and `nums2` will be non-negative and based on typical constraints, numbers could be large.

2. **What is the size range of `n`?**
   - The typical size range could be `1 <= n <= 14` based on typical constraints for such problems.

3. **Should we assume both arrays are always of the same length?**
   - Yes, it's given in the problem that both arrays have length `n`.

4. **Is reordering of elements in `nums1` or `nums2` allowed?**
   - Yes, elements in `nums2` can be assigned to elements in `nums1` such that each element is assigned exactly once to minimize the XOR sum.

## Strategy

This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming with bitmasking.

1. **Bitmask Representation**:
   - Use bitmask to represent states. Each bit in the mask represents whether a number in `nums2` has been paired.

2. **DP State**:
   - Let `dp[mask]` represent the minimum XOR sum we can get with the matching specified by the bitmask `mask`.

3. **State Transition**:
   - Iterate through all possible pairings using the bitmasks and calculate the new states by considering the XOR sums of these pairings.

4. **Base Case**:
   - If `mask == 0`, no pairings have been made, so the cost is `0`.

5. **Recurrence**:
   - Update the state `dp[new_mask]` by considering the minimum sum of current state and new pairing.

6. **Answer**:
   - The final result will be in `dp[(1 << n) - 1]` which represents all `n` elements paired.

## Code

Here is a Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def minimumXORSum(nums1, nums2):
    n = len(nums1)
    max_mask = 1 << n
    dp = [float('inf')] * max_mask
    dp[0] = 0

    for mask in range(max_mask):
        count = bin(mask).count('1')
        if count > n: continue

        for j in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << j) == 0:
                new_mask = mask | (1 << j)
                dp[new_mask] = min(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + (nums1[count] ^ nums2[j]))

    return dp[max_mask - 1]
```

## Time Complexity

The complexity for this approach is:

- **DP Table Size**: `2^n` (since we use bitmasking for subsets).
- **Transition**: For each mask, we may consider `n` possible additions.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(2^n \cdot n) \). Given \( n \leq 14 \), this is manageable within typical computational limits.

## Conclusion

The provided solution effectively manages the combinatorial complexity through bitmasking and dynamic programming, ensuring the minimum XOR sum is computed efficiently.
