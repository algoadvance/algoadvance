title:  Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently-out
permalink: /s2164
---
Given an integer array `nums`, **separate** the numbers at even indices from those at odd indices. The indices must follow the following conditions:
- Sort the even-indexed elements in non-decreasing order.
- Sort the odd-indexed elements in non-increasing order.

Reconstruct the array by maintaining the original index structure but with the sorted even and odd index elements.

For example:
- Input: `nums = [4,1,2,3]`
- Output: `nums = [2,3,4,1]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, all inputs are valid integers.
2. What if the input array is empty?
   - Returning an empty array in that case is acceptable.
3. Is the input array guaranteed to have an even number of elements?
   - No, the number of elements can be either even or odd.

### Strategy
1. Separate the elements that are at even indices and the elements that are at odd indices.
2. Sort the elements at even indices in ascending (non-decreasing) order.
3. Sort the elements at odd indices in descending (non-increasing) order.
4. Place the sorted even elements back at their original even positions and odd elements back at their original odd positions.

### Code
Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def sortEvenOdd(nums):
    # Separate even and odd indexed elements
    even_nums = [nums[i] for i in range(0, len(nums), 2)]
    odd_nums = [nums[i] for i in range(1, len(nums), 2)]
    
    # Sort even indexed elements in non-decreasing order
    even_nums.sort()
    
    # Sort odd indexed elements in non-increasing order
    odd_nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Reconstruct the array
    result = []
    
    even_idx, odd_idx = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result.append(even_nums[even_idx])
            even_idx += 1
        else:
            result.append(odd_nums[odd_idx])
            odd_idx += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [4, 1, 2, 3]
sorted_nums = sortEvenOdd(nums)
print(sorted_nums)  # Output should be [2, 3, 4, 1]
```

### Explanation
1. We first use list comprehensions to separate the elements at even and odd indices.
2. We then sort the even-indexed elements in non-decreasing order.
3. We sort the odd-indexed elements in non-increasing order.
4. Finally, we reconstruct the array by iterating through the original indices and placing the sorted elements back in the respective positions.

### Time Complexity
- Separating the elements into even and odd indexed lists takes `O(n)` time.
- Sorting the even indexed list takes `O(k log k)` time and the odd indexed list takes `O(m log m)` time, where `k` and `m` are the lengths of these lists respectively. Since `k + m = n`, the sorting operations are approximately `O((n/2) log (n/2)) = O(n log n)`.
- Reconstructing the array takes `O(n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
