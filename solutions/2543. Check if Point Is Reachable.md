title:  Check if Point Is Reachable-out
permalink: /s2543
---
Given a point `(targetX, targetY)`, you start at point `(1, 1)` and your goal is to determine if you can reach the target point by repeatedly performing the following operations any number of times:

1. From `(a, b)` to `(a + b, b)`
2. From `(a, b)` to `(a, a + b)`

The question is to check if it is possible to reach exactly `(targetX, targetY)` from `(1, 1)`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are targetX and targetY guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, the problem implies that the coordinates are positive integers.
  
2. **Are there any limits on the values of `targetX` and `targetY`?**
   - The problem does not specify any upper bounds, so we should consider them to be large.

3. **Are we allowed to use extra memory or is there a constraint on space complexity?**
   - There is no explicit constraint on the memory usage, but we should aim for an efficient solution.

### Strategy:

We will approach the problem in reverse from `(targetX, targetY)` to `(1, 1)` using the following observations:

- If we start from `(x, y)`, the only possible predecessor points are:
  1. `(x - y, y)` if `x > y`
  2. `(x, y - x)` if `y > x`

Using this reverse approach:
- We keep transforming `(targetX, targetY)` until we reach `(1, 1)`, or it becomes impossible (e.g., coordinates become negative or zero).

Our goal is to iteratively check if the point can be traced back to `(1, 1)` using the reversed operations.

### Code:

```python
def isReachable(targetX, targetY):
    while targetX > 1 and targetY > 1:
        if targetX > targetY:
            targetX %= targetY
        else:
            targetY %= targetX
            
    return targetX == 1 or targetY == 1

# Example Usage:
print(isReachable(5, 8))  # Output: False
print(isReachable(3, 2))  # Output: True
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Check**: We check if both `targetX` and `targetY` are greater than 1.
2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - If `targetX > targetY`, we reduce `targetX` by making `targetX %= targetY`.
   - If `targetY > targetX`, we reduce `targetY` by making `targetY %= targetX`.
   
   This step effectively simulates the reverse of the allowed operations in the forward direction.
3. **Termination Check**:
   - The loop continues until one of the coordinates becomes `1` or both become impossible (i.e., becomes less than or equal to zero).
4. **Result Check**:
   - If at any point `targetX == 1` or `targetY == 1`, it means we can reach `(1, 1)` using allowed operations, hence we return `True`.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is `O(log(min(targetX, targetY)))` due to the use of the modulo operation which reduces the size of one of the coordinates significantly in each iteration.
