title:  Minimum Falling Path Sum II-out
permalink: /s1289
---

Given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

A falling path with non-zero shifts is a path that starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's column by at least one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the dimensions for the grid?**
   - The value \(n\) can range from 1 to 200.
2. **What is the range of values for the grid elements?**
   - The grid elements can have values from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Utilize a dynamic programming (DP) approach to keep track of the minimum sum for each cell in the matrix.
   - Define a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum sum ending at cell `(i, j)`.
   - Initialize the first row of `dp` table with the values of the first row of the given `grid`.
   - For each subsequent row:
     - For each cell `(i, j)`, the minimum sum can be obtained by adding the current cell value `grid[i][j]` with the minimum value from the previous row, but excluding the column `j`.
     - This ensures that the path follows the rule of non-zero shifts.
   - The final result will be the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` table.

2. **Optimization:**
   - During the DP table update, keep track of the minimum and the second minimum values in each row. This helps in efficiently determining the minimum value for any cell in the subsequent row without a nested loop.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the size of the grid, since we iterate through all cells of the grid twice.
- The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) for storing the `dp` table, but it can be reduced to \(O(n)\) by using only two arrays to store the current and previous rows.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy in Python:

```python
def minFallingPathSum(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    if n == 1:
        return grid[0][0]  # Base case: Only one element in grid
    
    # Initial DP array using the first row of grid
    prev_row = grid[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Create current dp row from prev row
        current_row = [float('inf')] * n
        
        # Find the minimum and second minimum in the previous row
        first_min, second_min = float('inf'), float('inf')
        for value in prev_row:
            if value < first_min:
                second_min = first_min
                first_min = value
            elif value < second_min:
                second_min = value
        
        for j in range(n):
            # For each cell (i, j), determine minimum from previous row excluding column j
            if prev_row[j] == first_min:
                # If the minimum value is in the same column, use the second minimum
                current_row[j] = grid[i][j] + second_min
            else:
                # Otherwise, use the first minimum
                current_row[j] = grid[i][j] + first_min
        
        # Move to the next row
        prev_row = current_row
    
    # The result is the minimum value in the last row of dp array
    return min(prev_row)

# Example usage:
grid = [[2,1,3],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]]
print(minFallingPathSum(grid))  # Output: 13
```

This code calculates the minimum falling path sum with non-zero shifts based on the provided grid using an efficient dynamic programming approach.
