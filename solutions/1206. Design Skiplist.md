title:  Design Skiplist-out
permalink: /s1206
---

Design a Skiplist from scratch that supports `add(int num)`, `erase(int num)`, and `search(int target)` operations. Implement these functions:

- `bool search(int target)`: Returns true if there is a `target` in the Skiplist or false otherwise.
- `void add(int num)`: Inserts a value into the Skiplist.
- `bool erase(int num)`: Removes a value in the Skiplist. Returns true if `num` exists and was removed, or false otherwise. If there are multiple instances of `num`, only one instance is to be removed.

### Example Usage:
```plaintext
Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();

skiplist.add(1);
skiplist.add(2);
skiplist.add(3);
skiplist.search(0); // return False
skiplist.add(4);
skiplist.search(1); // return True
skiplist.erase(0);  // return False, 0 is not in the skiplist
skiplist.erase(1);  // return True
skiplist.search(1); // return False, 1 has already been erased
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= num, target <= 2 * 10^4`
- There will be at most `5 * 10^4` calls to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Levels in the Skiplist:** Should the number of levels in the Skiplist be dynamic or fixed? 
   - **Answer:** The number of levels can be dynamic, governed by a probabilistic mechanism.
   
2. **Duplicates:** Are duplicate values allowed in the Skiplist?
   - **Answer:** Yes, duplicates are allowed. The `erase` function should remove one instance at a time.
   
3. **Memory Limitations:** Should we consider any specific memory limits for the implementation?
   - **Answer:** No specific memory limits are mentioned. The focus should be on functionality and efficiency within usual constraints.

## Strategy

### Skiplist Structure:
A skiplist is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements. It's a layered list, where each layer is a subsequence of the list in the layer below, with the lowest layer containing all elements.

### Node Structure:
Each node contains:
- Value and pointers to the next node in each level.

### Operations:
1. **Search:** Traverse from the topmost level. If the target is found at any level, return true.
2. **Add:** Determine the level for the new node via a random process (e.g., coin flip). Insert the new node in all appropriate levels.
3. **Erase:** Find the node. If found, remove it from every level.

```python
from random import randint

MAX_LEVEL = 16  # Max levels for the skiplist

class SkiplistNode:
    def __init__(self, val, level):
        self.val = val
        self.forward = [None] * level

class Skiplist:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = SkiplistNode(-1, MAX_LEVEL)
        self.level = 1

    def random_level(self):
        level = 1
        while randint(0, 1) and level < MAX_LEVEL:
            level += 1
        return level

    def search(self, target):
        current = self.head
        for i in range(self.level - 1, -1, -1):
            while current.forward[i] and current.forward[i].val < target:
                current = current.forward[i]
        current = current.forward[0]
        return current and current.val == target

    def add(self, num):
        update = [None] * MAX_LEVEL
        current = self.head
        for i in range(self.level - 1, -1, -1):
            while current.forward[i] and current.forward[i].val < num:
                current = current.forward[i]
            update[i] = current

        level = self.random_level()
        if level > self.level:
            for i in range(self.level, level):
                update[i] = self.head
            self.level = level

        new_node = SkiplistNode(num, level)
        for i in range(level):
            new_node.forward[i] = update[i].forward[i]
            update[i].forward[i] = new_node

    def erase(self, num):
        update = [None] * MAX_LEVEL
        current = self.head
        for i in range(self.level - 1, -1, -1):
            while current.forward[i] and current.forward[i].val < num:
                current = current.forward[i]
            update[i] = current

        current = current.forward[0]
        if not current or current.val != num:
            return False

        for i in range(self.level):
            if update[i].forward[i] != current:
                break
            update[i].forward[i] = current.forward[i]

        while self.level > 1 and not self.head.forward[self.level - 1]:
            self.level -= 1

        return True
```

## Time Complexity
- **Search Operation:** Average O(log n), worst-case O(n) due to the probabilistic nature.
- **Add Operation:** Average O(log n), worst-case O(n).
- **Erase Operation:** Average O(log n), worst-case O(n).

These complexities allow the skiplist to handle large datasets effectively with average-case performance comparable to balanced binary search trees.
