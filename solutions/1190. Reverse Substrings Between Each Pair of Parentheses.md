title:  Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses-out
permalink: /s1190
---

You are given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters and parentheses. You need to reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one. The result should not contain any parentheses.

#### Example:
1. Input: `s = "(abcd)"`
   - Output: `"dcba"`
   
2. Input: `s = "(u(love)i)"`
   - Output: `"iloveu"`
   
3. Input: `s = "(ed(et(oc))el)"`
   - Output: `"leetcode"`
   
4. Input: `s = "a(bcdefghijkl(mno)p)q"`
   - Output: `"apmnolkjihgfedcbq"`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input string `s` ever be empty?
   - No, the input string `s` will always contain at least one character.
2. Are the parentheses always balanced in the input string `s`?
   - Yes, the parentheses will always be balanced.
3. Are there any nested parentheses?
   - Yes, the parentheses can be nested and we should start reversing from the innermost parenthesis.

### Strategy
1. **Use a Stack**: We can use a stack to efficiently solve this problem. The idea is to push characters to a stack until we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`.
2. **Reverse on Closing Parenthesis**: When a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, we pop characters from the stack until an opening parenthesis `(` is found. We then reverse the characters popped and push them back onto the stack.
3. **Build Result from Stack**: After processing the entire string, the stack will contain the characters in the desired order. We can join these characters to get the final result.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, because each character is processed at most twice (once pushed and once popped from the stack).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the stack used to store characters.

### Code
```python
def reverseParentheses(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if char == ')':
            # Start popping from the stack until we find an opening parenthesis '('
            temp = []
            while stack and stack[-1] != '(':
                temp.append(stack.pop())
            # Remove the '(' from the stack
            if stack: 
                stack.pop()
            # Push the reversed characters back to the stack
            stack.extend(temp)
        else:
            # Push current character to stack
            stack.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(stack)

# Example usage
print(reverseParentheses("(abcd)"))  # Output: "dcba"
print(reverseParentheses("(u(love)i)"))  # Output: "iloveu"
print(reverseParentheses("(ed(et(oc))el)"))  # Output: "leetcode"
print(reverseParentheses("a(bcdefghijkl(mno)p)q"))  # Output: "apmnolkjihgfedcbq"
```

This implementation effectively uses a stack to reverse substrings between each pair of parentheses, ensuring an efficient and correct solution.
