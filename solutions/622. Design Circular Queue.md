title:  Design Circular Queue-out
permalink: /s622
---

Design your implementation of the circular queue. A circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

**Implementation the class MyCircularQueue:**

- `MyCircularQueue(k: int)` Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be `k`.
- `bool enQueue(int value)` Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return `true` if the operation is successful.
- `bool deQueue()` Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return `true` if the operation is successful.
- `int Front()` Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.
- `int Rear()` Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.
- `bool isEmpty()` Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
- `bool isFull()` Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

You must solve the problem without using the built-in queue data structure in your programming language.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the size of the circular queue fixed after initialization?**
   - Yes, the size of the queue is fixed after the object is initialized.

2. **Can negative or zero be an input value for enQueue?**
   - Yes, any integer (positive, negative, or zero) can be enqueued.

3. **What should the methods return when operations can't be performed (like deQueue on an empty queue, enQueue on a full queue)?**
   - In such cases, the methods should return `false` for unsuccessful operations and `-1` for Front/Rear when the queue is empty.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a fixed-size list to represent the queue and maintain `front` and `rear` pointers for the circular movement.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `queue` with a list of given size `k`.
   - Set both `front` and `rear` to `-1` and maintain a variable `count` to track the number of elements.

3. **Methods Implementation**:
   - **enQueue**: Insert an element by moving the `rear` pointer circularly and increase `count`.
   - **deQueue**: Remove an element by moving the `front` pointer circularly and decrease `count`.
   - **Front**: Return the element at the `front` pointer.
   - **Rear**: Return the element at the `rear` pointer.
   - **isEmpty**: Check if `count` is 0.
   - **isFull**: Check if `count` is equal to the capacity `k`.

### Code

```python
class MyCircularQueue:

    def __init__(self, k: int):
        self.queue = [0] * k
        self.capacity = k
        self.front = -1
        self.rear = -1
        self.count = 0

    def enQueue(self, value: int) -> bool:
        if self.isFull():
            return False
        if self.isEmpty():
            self.front = 0
        self.rear = (self.rear + 1) % self.capacity
        self.queue[self.rear] = value
        self.count += 1
        return True

    def deQueue(self) -> bool:
        if self.isEmpty():
            return False
        if self.front == self.rear:
            self.front = -1
            self.rear = -1
        else:
            self.front = (self.front + 1) % self.capacity
        self.count -= 1
        return True

    def Front(self) -> int:
        if self.isEmpty():
            return -1
        return self.queue[self.front]

    def Rear(self) -> int:
        if self.isEmpty():
            return -1
        return self.queue[self.rear]

    def isEmpty(self) -> bool:
        return self.count == 0

    def isFull(self) -> bool:
        return self.count == self.capacity
```

### Time Complexity

- `enQueue`: O(1)
- `deQueue`: O(1)
- `Front`: O(1)
- `Rear`: O(1)
- `isEmpty`: O(1)
- `isFull`: O(1)

The time complexity of each operation is O(1), which is optimal for queue operations.
