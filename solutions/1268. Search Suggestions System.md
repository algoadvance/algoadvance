title:  Search Suggestions System-out
permalink: /s1268
---

Given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix, return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should we assume the `products` list is already sorted, or do we need to sort it?
   - We should assume it's not sorted. Sorting will be part of our algorithm.

2. Can `products` contain duplicate entries?
   - Yes, but they should be handled just as any other entry.

3. How long can `searchWord` be?
   - For the sake of simplicity, assume `searchWord` and each product in `products` can have a maximum length of 100, and there can be up to 1000 products.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the `products` list**: Sorting helps in finding the lexicographically smallest suggestions easily.
2. **Binary Search for Prefix**: Use binary search to find the position where products starting with the current prefix should be located.
3. **Collect Suggestions**: For each prefix, collect up to three suggestions starting from the found position.

### Code

```python
from typing import List
import bisect

def suggestedProducts(products: List[str], searchWord: String) -> List[List[str]]:
    # Sort the products list
    products.sort()
    
    def find_suggestions(prefix: str) -> List[str]:
        # Find the point where this prefix could be inserted
        start_idx = bisect.bisect_left(products, prefix)
        suggestions = []
        # Check the next 3 elements in the sorted list for matching prefix
        for i in range(start_idx, min(start_idx + 3, len(products))):
            if products[i].startswith(prefix):
                suggestions.append(products[i])
            else:
                break
        return suggestions
    
    result, prefix = [], ""
    for char in searchWord:
        prefix += char
        result.append(find_suggestions(prefix))
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

1. Sorting the `products` list: **O(N log N)**, where N is the number of products.
2. For each character in `searchWord`:
   - Using binary search to find the insertion point: **O(log N)**.
   - Collecting up to three suggestions: **O(1)** (since we are collecting a fixed number of items).
   - Assembling the prefix and iterating over `searchWord`: **O(M)**, where M is the length of `searchWord`.

The overall time complexity is **O(N log N + M log N)**, but since `N` is typically much larger than `M`, the dominant factor is **O(N log N)**.
