title:  Continuous Subarray Sum-out
permalink: /s523
---

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return `true` if `nums` has a continuous subarray of size at least two whose elements sum up to a multiple of `k`, or `false` otherwise.

An integer `x` is a multiple of `k` if there exists an integer `n` such that `x = n * k`. `0` is always a multiple of `k`.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [23, 2, 4, 6, 7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [2, 4] is a continuous subarray of size 2 whose sum is a multiple of 6.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [23, 2, 6, 4, 7], k = 6
Output: true
Explanation: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an entire array whose sum is a multiple of 6.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [23, 2, 6, 4, 7], k = 13
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the size of the input array `nums`?
    - Typical constraint details.

2. Can the input array include negative numbers?
    - Relevant for sum calculations.

3. What if `k` is zero?
    - Special handling might be needed.

## Strategy

1. **Zero Special Case:** If `k` is zero, find if there exists a zero-sum subarray of size ≥ 2.
2. **Prefix Sum and Remainder Method:** Use prefix sums and a hashmap to store remainders.
    - Maintain a cumulative sum and a hashmap to store the remainder of the cumulative sum when divided by `k`.
    - If the same remainder appears again and the subarray is of length ≥ 2, it implies the subarray sum is a multiple of `k`.

## Code

```python
def checkSubarraySum(nums, k):
    if k == 0:
        # Special case handling for k = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] == 0 and nums[i + 1] == 0:
                return True
        return False
    
    remainder_map = {0: -1}  # Handle if a subarray from the start
    cumulative_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        cumulative_sum += nums[i]
        
        if k != 0:
            cumulative_sum %= k
        
        if cumulative_sum in remainder_map:
            if i - remainder_map[cumulative_sum] > 1:  # At least 2 elements
                return True
        else:
            remainder_map[cumulative_sum] = i
            
    return False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, k)), as we are storing the remainders in a hashmap. At most, we might need to store `min(n, k)` entries if all remainders are unique.

This algorithm efficiently checks for the presence of a continuous subarray whose sum is a multiple of `k`, while maintaining linear time complexity.
