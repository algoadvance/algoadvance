Let's consider a problem where a "good meal" is defined as a meal where the sum of prices of any two dishes is a power of two. Each dish has a price, and you are given a list of integers where each integer represents the price of a dish. Your task is to find the number of good meals possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a power of two?**
   - A power of two is any number in the form of \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).

2. **Can there be duplicate prices in the list?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate prices in the list.

3. **Are all prices non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, all prices in the list are non-negative integers.

4. **What is the expected size of the input list?**
   - The list will contain up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) prices.

### Strategy

1. **Generate Powers of Two:** First, generate all possible powers of two that could be achieved by summing two prices from the list. Since the maximum price is \( 10^6 \), the maximum sum will not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \). Hence, we consider powers of two up to \( 2^{21} \), where \( 2^{21} = 2097152 \).

2. **Frequency Dictionary:** Use a dictionary to record the frequency of each price.

3. **Pair Counting:** For each price in the list, check if the difference between the current power of two and the price exists in the dictionary. If it does, it means we can form a valid pair. Count all such valid pairs.

4. **Handle Frequencies Properly:** Be cautious about pairing the same price with itself (e.g., \( p + p = 2^k \)). If the same price is used twice, ensure it is not over-counted.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation of the strategy outlined above:

```python
def countPairs(deliciousness):
    from collections import defaultdict

    max_val = 2 ** 21  # The maximum possible value given the constraints

    # Generate powers of two up to 2^21
    powers_of_two = [1 << i for i in range(22)]
    
    # Frequency map of prices
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    
    count = 0
    mod = 10**9 + 7  # Modulo value for large numbers

    for price in deliciousness:
        # Check for pairs with current price forming a power of two
        for target in powers_of_two:
            complement = target - price
            if complement in freq:
                count = (count + freq[complement]) % mod
        
        # Add the current price to the frequency map
        freq[price] += 1

    return count

# Example usage
deliciousness = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(countPairs(deliciousness))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n \cdot m) \), where \( n \) is the number of prices in the input list and \( m \) is the number of powers of two we are considering (22 in this case).
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for the frequency dictionary.

The solution is efficient for the given constraints, with a time complexity of \( O(n \cdot 22) \) simplifying to \( O(n) \). This ensures it can handle the upper limit of input sizes within reasonable time.
