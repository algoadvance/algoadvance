title:  Largest Local Values in a Matrix-out
permalink: /s2373
---
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`. Generate an `n-2 x n-2` integer matrix `result` such that:
- `result[i][j]` is equal to the largest value in the 3x3 matrix defined as follows:
    - The top-left corner of the 3x3 matrix is at `(i, j)`
    
Return the `result` matrix.

**Example:**
```python
Input: grid = [
  [9, 9, 8, 1],
  [5, 6, 2, 6],
  [8, 2, 6, 4],
  [6, 2, 2, 2]
]
Output: [
  [9, 9],
  [8, 6]
]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `n`? (Minimum and Maximum values of `n`)
   - What is the range of values for the elements in `grid`? (Minimum and Maximum values of each element)
  
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What do we return if `n` is less than 3?

### Strategy
1. **Validations**: First, we will check if `n` is less than 3 because an `n x n` grid where `n < 3` cannot form even a single 3x3 subgrid. In such a case, output should be an empty list.
2. **Result Matrix Initialization**: Initialize a matrix `result` of size `n-2 x n-2`.
3. **Iterate through the Grid**:
   - Loop through each possible top-left corner position of the 3x3 subgrids.
   - For each 3x3 subgrid, find the maximum value.
   - Store the maximum value in the corresponding cell of the `result` matrix.
4. **Return Result**: Once all the maximum values have been computed, return the `result` matrix.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution will be O(n^2), where `n` is the dimension of the original grid. This is because:
- We loop through each possible 3x3 subgrid using two nested loops, each running `n-2` times.
- For each subgrid, we find the maximum value by iterating through 9 elements, which is a constant operation.

### Code
Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def largestLocal(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    if n < 3:
        return []

    result = [[0] * (n - 2) for _ in range(n - 2)]
    
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(n - 2):
            max_val = -float('inf')
            for k in range(3):
                for l in range(3):
                    max_val = max(max_val, grid[i + k][j + l])
            result[i][j] = max_val
    
    return result

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [9, 9, 8, 1],
    [5, 6, 2, 6],
    [8, 2, 6, 4],
    [6, 2, 2, 2]
]

print(largestLocal(grid))  # Output: [[9, 9], [8, 6]]
```

This code will correctly compute the largest local values in a matrix as described by the problem statement.
