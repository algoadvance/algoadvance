Given an array `nums` of integers, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array that is divisible by 3.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What are the constraints on the elements of `nums`?**
   - A: The array `nums` will have at least one integer and at most 10^4 integers. Each integer will be between -10^4 and 10^4.

2. **Q: Are negative numbers allowed in the array?**
   - A: Yes, negative numbers can be present.

3. **Q: Should the solution handle large arrays efficiently?**
   - A: Yes, the solution should be efficient enough to handle arrays with up to 10^4 integers.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest subset of `nums` such that its sum is divisible by 3. We can achieve this using dynamic programming.

1. Using three states to store the best sums for the sums that give remainders of 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3.
2. Initialize an array `dp` with three elements, all set to 0. `dp[0]` will store the maximum sum that is divisible by 3, `dp[1]` will store the maximum sum that gives a remainder of 1, and `dp[2]` will store the maximum sum that gives a remainder of 2.
3. Iterate through each number in `nums`, and for each number, update the relevant states in `dp`.
4. The value of `dp[0]` at the end will be our answer.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once and update the states in constant time.

## Code

```python
def maxSumDivThree(nums):
    dp = [0, 0, 0]  # Initial states for sums % 3

    for num in nums:
        # Temporary array to hold updated states
        new_dp = dp[:]
        for i in range(3):
            new_dp[(dp[i] + num) % 3] = max(new_dp[(dp[i] + num) % 3], dp[i] + num)
        dp = new_dp

    return dp[0]  # The maximum sum that is divisible by 3

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 6, 5, 1, 8]
print(maxSumDivThree(nums))  # Output: 18
```

This code efficiently calculates the maximum sum of elements that is divisible by 3 using a dynamic programming approach.
