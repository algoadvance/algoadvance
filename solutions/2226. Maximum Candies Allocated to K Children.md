title:  Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children-out
permalink: /s2226

Given a list of integers `candies` where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies in the `i-th` pile. There are `k` children and you want to distribute the candies such that each child gets the same maximum number of candies. Return the maximum number of candies each child can get.

**Example:**

```python
candies = [5, 8, 6]
k = 3
max_candies_per_child = 5 # Explanation: Each of the three children can get at most 5 candies. The child getting 8 candies' pile will keep 3 candies for later.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the number of children `k` be greater than the number of candy piles?
2. Is it guaranteed that all children will get at least one candy?
3. Can the `candies` list contain zero or negative values?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a **binary search algorithm** to efficiently find the maximum number of candies each child can get. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initial Check**: If the total number of children `k` is zero, return 0 because there are no children to distribute candies to.
2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The minimum possible value for the maximum candies per child is `1`.
   - The maximum possible value is the largest pile in the `candies` array.
   
3. **Binary Search Process**:
   - Calculate the mid-point value (`mid`) of the current search range.
   - Determine if it is possible to distribute the candies such that each child gets at least `mid` candies:
     - Calculate the total number of children that can be served if each child gets `mid` candies.
     - If the total number of children is at least `k`, then it is possible, and we should try for a higher value (`mid`).
     - If not, we should try a lower value.
4. **Continue the binary search** until the search range is exhausted.

### Time Complexity

- The binary search runs in `O(log(max(candies)))`, where `max(candies)` is the largest pile.
- For each binary search step, summing up candies into groups of `mid` takes O(n), where n is the number of piles.
  
Overall, the complexity is `O(n * log(max(candies)))`.

### Code

```python
def maxCandies(candies, k):
    # If there are no children, return 0
    if k == 0:
        return 0

    left, right = 1, max(candies)
    
    def canDistribute(mid):
        count = 0
        for pile in candies:
            count += pile // mid
        return count >= k

    max_candies_per_child = 0
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canDistribute(mid):
            max_candies_per_child = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return max_candies_per_child

# Example Usage:
candies = [5, 8, 6]
k = 3
print(maxCandies(candies, k))  # Output: 5
```

This code finds the maximum number of candies each child can receive using a binary search strategy, effectively reducing the possible range for the maximum candies per child, and ensuring an efficient search process.
