Given an integer `n`, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`.

For example:
- Input: `n = 13`
- Output: `6`
  
Explanation: The digit 1 appears in the numbers 1, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `n` be a negative integer?
   - **A:** No, the problem states non-negative integers.

2. **Q:** What is the range of `n`?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify the range, but we can assume it fits within the range of typical integer types.

## Strategy

To count the number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`, we can utilize a mathematical pattern rather than brute-forcing through every number.

### Key Insight

For each digit in the number:
- Consider the digit's position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).
- Count contributions of '1' for each position individually.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Define a variable** `count` to keep track of the total number of '1's.
2. **Iterate** over each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.):
   - For each position, calculate the count of 1s contributed by the current digit.
   - Accumulate the count from each position.
   
### Approach

1. Initialize `count = 0`.
2. Iterate over digit positions starting from the least significant digit:
   - For each digit, compute the number of 1s contributed to the total count.
   - Update the total `count`.
3. Return the total count.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(log10(n))` since we are examining each digit of `n` individually.

## Code

Here's the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
def countDigitOne(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 0:
        return 0

    count = 0
    factor = 1
    while factor <= n:
        lower_numbers = n // factor
        current_digit = (n // factor) % 10
        higher_numbers = n // (factor * 10)
        
        # Count the number of 1s contributed by the current digit's place
        if current_digit > 1:
            count += (higher_numbers + 1) * factor
        elif current_digit == 1:
            count += higher_numbers * factor + (n % factor) + 1
        else:
            count += higher_numbers * factor
        
        factor *= 10

    return count
```

### Explanation of Code

- `count`: Initializes the total count of digit 1.
- `factor`: Iterates over each positional place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).
- `lower_numbers`: Calculates numbers divided by current factor to shift digits.
- `current_digit`: Determines the digit at the current positional place.
- `higher_numbers`: Calculates numbers divided by next place factor.
- `count` is updated based on the value of `current_digit`:
  - If the digit is greater than 1, it fully contributes.
  - If the digit is 1, it contributes partially based on the rest numbers.
  - Otherwise, it adds contributions from higher numbers.

### Testing

To verify, consider `n = 13`:

- For units place: `1` seen in 1, 10, 11, 12, 13 (5 times).
- For tens place: `1` seen in 10, 11, 12, 13 (1 time).

Total = `5 + 1 = 6`. This can be verified by running the function `countDigitOne(13)` and checking if it returns `6`.
