724. **Find Pivot Index**

Given an array of integers `nums`, write a method that returns the "pivot" index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is `0` because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The pivot index is 3.
Left sum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 5 + 6 = 11
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no index that satisfies the conditions in the problem statement.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
The pivot index is 0.
Left sum = 0 (no elements to the left of index 0)
Right sum = nums[1] + nums[2] = 1 + -1 = 0
```

### Constraints:
- The length of `nums` will be in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- The elements of `nums` will be in the range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` be empty?
2. Can there be multiple pivot indices?

## Strategy

1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Initialize `left_sum` to `0`.
3. Iterate through the array while calculating the right sum as `total_sum - left_sum - nums[i]`.
4. If `left_sum` equals the right sum at any index `i`, return `i`.
5. Update `left_sum` by adding the value of the current element `nums[i]`.
6. If no pivot index is found, return `-1`.

## Code

```python
def pivotIndex(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    left_sum = 0

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum - num
        if left_sum == right_sum:
            return i
        left_sum += num

    return -1
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array only once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space for variables irrespective of the input size.
