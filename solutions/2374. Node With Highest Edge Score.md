title:  Node With Highest Edge Score-out
permalink: /s2374
---

You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has exactly one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented by a **0-indexed integer array** `edges` of length `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

The **edge score** of a node `i` is defined as the sum of the labels of the nodes that point to `i`.

Return the node with the highest edge score. If multiple nodes have the same edge score, return the node with the smallest index.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the edges array be empty?
   - No, the edges array cannot be empty as `n >= 1`.

2. Can the nodes form cycles?
   - Yes, nodes can be part of cycles given that every node has exactly one outgoing edge.

3. What would be the range for `n`?
   - Typically, it would range from 1 to 10^5, common in such problems.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialize a Dictionary:**
   - To store edge scores of each node.
   
2. **Iterate Through Nodes and Update Scores:**
   - For each node `i`, find the node it points to and update the edge score for the target node.

3. **Determine the Node with Highest Edge Score:**
   - Traverse through the scores dictionary to find out the node which has the maximum score. In case of ties, return the node with the smallest index.

### Code:

```python
def nodeWithHighestEdgeScore(edges):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    edge_scores = defaultdict(int)

    # Calculate edge scores
    for src in range(len(edges)):
        dest = edges[src]
        edge_scores[dest] += src

    # Determine node with the highest edge score
    max_score = -1
    max_node = -1
    for node, score in edge_scores.items():
        if score > max_score or (score == max_score and node < max_node):
            max_score = score
            max_node = node
    
    return max_node
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the `edges` array once to calculate the scores, and a second time through a dictionary of size at most `n` to find the node with the highest score.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The space complexity is O(n) for the dictionary used to store the edge scores.
