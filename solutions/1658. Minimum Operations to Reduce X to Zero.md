title:  Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero-out
permalink: /s1658
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums`. Your goal is to reduce `x` to exactly `0` by performing the minimum number of operations. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

### Example:

``` 
Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last two elements to reduce x to zero.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the range of values for `nums` and `x`?**
   - A: `nums` is an array of integers which can contain both positive and negative numbers, and `x` is an integer.

2. **Q: What should be returned if it's impossible to reduce `x` to zero?**
   - A: Return `-1`.

3. **Q: Is it possible for `nums` to be empty?**
   - A: Yes, `nums` can be empty. In such a case, if `x` is not zero, return `-1`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can reframe it:

1. We need to find the minimum number of elements from the start and the end that sum up to `x`.
2. By flipping the problem, it means finding the maximum length subarray in `nums` that sums up to the sum of `total_sum - x`. This is because removing elements from both ends means keeping the remaining middle part intact.
3. This can now be solved using the sliding window (two pointers) technique to find the maximum length subarray that sums up to the target sum (`total_sum - x`).

### Code

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def minOperations(nums, x):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    target = total_sum - x
    
    if target < 0:
        return -1
    
    if target == 0:
        return len(nums)
    
    max_len = -1
    current_sum = 0
    left = 0
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        
        while current_sum > target and left <= right:
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        
        if current_sum == target:
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    
    return len(nums) - max_len if max_len != -1 else -1

# Example usage
nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3]
x = 5
print(minOperations(nums, x))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm involves a single traversal of the array using the sliding window technique.
- Each element is processed at most twice (once added, once removed), leading to a linear time complexity of:
  - **O(N)** where **N** is the length of the input array `nums`.

Thus, the above approach ensures an efficient solution to the problem while ensuring clarity and correctness.
