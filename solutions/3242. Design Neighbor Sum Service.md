title:  Design Neighbor Sum Service-out
permalink: /s3242
---

Design a Neighbor Sum Service that supports the following operations on an integer array:

1. **insert(idx: int, val: int)**
   - Inserts `val` at index `idx`. If `idx` is out of bounds, do nothing.
   
2. **update(idx: int, val: int)**
   - Updates the integer at index `idx` to be `val`. If `idx` is out of bounds, do nothing.
   
3. **sum_neighbors(idx: int) -> int**
   - Returns the sum of the integer at index `idx` and its neighbors (i.e., `idx-1`, `idx`, and `idx+1`). If `idx` is out of bounds, return 0.

### Example

```python
nss = NeighborSumService([1, 2, 3, 4])
nss.insert(1, 5)  # Now, the array is [1, 5, 2, 3, 4]
nss.update(2, 8)  # Now, the array is [1, 5, 8, 3, 4]
print(nss.sum_neighbors(2))  # Returns 16 (5 + 8 + 3)
print(nss.sum_neighbors(4))  # Returns 7 (3 + 4)
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should the service do if an `insert` operation is attempted at an index that is out of bounds? 
   - Assume that nothing should happen if the index is out of bounds.

2. What should the service do if an `update` operation is attempted at an index that is out of bounds?
   - Assume that nothing should happen if the index is out of bounds.

3. What should the `sum_neighbors` function return if the given index has no valid neighbors?
   - It should sum the values of any existing valid neighbors only.

### Strategy

- Use a list to store the elements.
- Operations like insertions and updates will be straightforward list operations.
- For `sum_neighbors`, check bounds before accessing the array to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

### Code

```python
class NeighborSumService:
    def __init__(self, initial_array):
        # Initialize with the given integer array
        self.array = initial_array
    
    def insert(self, idx, val):
        # Check index is within bounds
        if 0 <= idx <= len(self.array):
            self.array.insert(idx, val)
    
    def update(self, idx, val):
        # Check index is within bounds
        if 0 <= idx < len(self.array):
            self.array[idx] = val
    
    def sum_neighbors(self, idx):
        if 0 <= idx < len(self.array):
            neighbor_sum = 0
            # Include value at idx
            neighbor_sum += self.array[idx]
            # Include value at idx - 1 if valid
            if idx - 1 >= 0:
                neighbor_sum += self.array[idx - 1]
            # Include value at idx + 1 if valid
            if idx + 1 < len(self.array):
                neighbor_sum += self.array[idx + 1]
            return neighbor_sum
        # If idx is out of bounds, return 0
        return 0
```

### Time Complexity

- `insert(idx: int, val: int)`:
  - Average case: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array, due to the potential reallocation of elements.
  - Worst case: O(n) due to similar reallocation.

- `update(idx: int, val: int)`:
  - O(1), as updating an element in a list by index is a constant-time operation.

- `sum_neighbors(idx: int) -> int`:
  - O(1), because checking and summing up to three elements involves a fixed number of operations.
