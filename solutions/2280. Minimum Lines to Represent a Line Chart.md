title:  Minimum Lines to Represent a Line Chart-out
permalink: /s2280
---

You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei]` indicates the price of the stock on the `dayi`. A line chart is created from these points, and you need to find out the minimum number of lines required to connect all the points in the ascending order of the days such that each line represents a straight segment between two points.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Can the input `stockPrices` have duplicate days?
    - Is the input guaranteed to have at least one price point?
    - Are the days guaranteed to be in sorted order or do we need to sort them?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the output be the total number of line segments required?

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**:
    - First, ensure that the points are sorted by the `dayi` if they are not already sorted.
    
2. **Checking Colinearity**:
    - Iterate through the sorted list and check for colinearity of each triplet of points. 
    - Use the concept of slope to determine if three points `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)` are colinear. The slopes between `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` and `(x2, y2)` to `(x3, y3)` should be equal, which can be checked without division to avoid precision issues using cross multiplication:
        \[
        (y2 - y1) \times (x3 - x2) = (y3 - y2) \times (x2 - x1).
        \]

3. **Count Line Segments**:
    - Initialize the count of line segments.
    - For each group of colinear points, consider them as using one line segment.
    - Increment the count whenever a new line segment starts.

### Code Implementation

```python
def minimumLines(stockPrices):
    if len(stockPrices) < 2:
        return 0

    # Sorting points based on dayi
    stockPrices.sort()
    
    def is_colinear(p1, p2, p3):
        x1, y1 = p1
        x2, y2 = p2
        x3, y3 = p3
        return (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) == (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)

    # Initialize line segments count
    line_segments = 1

    # Iterate through points to find line segments
    for i in range(2, len(stockPrices)):
        if not is_colinear(stockPrices[i-2], stockPrices[i-1], stockPrices[i]):
            line_segments += 1

    return line_segments
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The initial sorting of `stockPrices` takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of points.
- **Iteration**: The iteration through the list to check for colinearity takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).

### Execution and Testing

To ensure that the function works correctly, we need to test it with various cases:
- A case with minimum points (just two, expecting 1 line).
- A case with multiple points forming a straight line.
- A case with random points forming multiple line segments.

Here's a simple test example:

```python
print(minimumLines([[1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 5], [4, 4], [6, 2]]))   # Expected: 1
print(minimumLines([[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6]]))   # Expected: 2
print(minimumLines([[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]]))          # Expected: 1
print(minimumLines([[1, 1], [2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 5]]))          # Expected: 2
```
