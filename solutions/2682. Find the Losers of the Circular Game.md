title:  Find the Losers of the Circular Game-out
permalink: /s2682

In this problem, you are tasked with finding the losers of a circular game. The game is played in a circular arrangement, and each round, we eliminate participants in a specific manner.

Given the total number of participants `n`, and a step value `k` which determines how participants are eliminated, continue eliminating participants every `k-th` turn until only one participant remains. You need to return a list of participants who were eliminated in the order they were eliminated.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** Can the number of participants (`n`) and the step value (`k`) be large numbers?
2. **Type of Data:** Are the inputs guaranteed to be integers?
3. **Output Order:** Should the output list the eliminated participants in the order they were eliminated?
4. **Special Cases:** What should be returned if `n` is 1? (Since there's only one participant, no one should be eliminated).

### Assumptions
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- The participants are numbered from 1 to `n`.

### Strategy
1. **Circular Elimination:** Use a list to simulate the circle of participants.
2. **Index Calculation:** Use modular arithmetic to efficiently handle the circular nature of the game.
3. **Elimination Simulation:** Use a loop to go through and eliminate participants, keeping track of the current index and removing participants until only one remains.
4. **Track and Store:** Store the eliminated participants in a list in the order they were eliminated.

### Algorithm
1. Create a list of participants from 1 to `n`.
2. Use a variable to keep track of the current index in the participant list.
3. Iterate until the list of participants is reduced to one element:
   - Calculate the index of the participant to be eliminated using the step value `k`.
   - Remove the participant from the list and append them to the result list.
4. Return the result list containing eliminated participants in order.

### Code Implementation

```python
def findLosers(n, k):
    # Step 1: Initialize the participants list
    participants = list(range(1, n + 1))
    eliminated = []
    index = 0

    # Step 2: Eliminate participants until only one remains
    while len(participants) > 1:
        # Calculate the index of the participant to eliminate
        index = (index + k - 1) % len(participants)
        # Remove the participant and add to eliminated list
        eliminated.append(participants.pop(index))

    # Return the list of eliminated participants
    return eliminated

# Example usage:
n = 5
k = 2
print(findLosers(n, k))  # Outputs the order in which participants are eliminated
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** Creating the initial list of participants takes O(n).
- **Loop for Elimination:**
  - Each iteration removes one participant: O(1) for each removal in average case but O(n) worst case if implemented using a naive list.
  - Total iterations: `n - 1` to eliminate participants.
  - So, total time in naive list removal is O(n^2) in the worst case.

The algorithm is effective and clear for smaller values of `n`. For larger values, an optimized structure (like a linked list) could be used to improve complexity but isn't shown here for simplicity.
