title:  Guess Number Higher or Lower-out
permalink: /s374
---

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a predefined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results:
- `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e., my number is smaller).
- `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e., my number is larger).
- `0`: Your guess is correct (i.e., you found my number).

Implement a function `int guessNumber(int n)` that uses the `guess` API to find the number I picked.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on `n`?
    - `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`. 
2. Do we need to handle invalid inputs or out-of-bound values?
    - We can assume the function will be called with valid inputs within the given range for `n`.

## Strategy

To find the number that the system has picked, we can use a binary search algorithm. Since the feedback from the `guess` API tells us whether the number is higher or lower, binary search is efficient and appropriate for this problem.

1. Initialize the search bounds with `left = 1` and `right = n`.
2. Use a loop to repeatedly narrow down the search range:
    - Calculate the middle point `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`.
    - Call the `guess(mid)` function.
    - Depending on the result:
        - If it returns `0`, then `mid` is the correct guess.
        - If it returns `-1`, the picked number is lower than `mid`, so adjust the search range to `left` to `mid - 1`.
        - If it returns `1`, the picked number is higher than `mid`, so adjust the search range to `mid + 1` to `right`.
3. Continue the above steps until the correct number is found.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def guessNumber(n: int) -> int:
    left, right = 1, n
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        res = guess(mid)
        
        if res == 0:
            return mid
        elif res == -1:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return -1  # This line is just for completeness; the loop should always return within the loop.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) since we are effectively dividing the search space in half with each iteration of the binary search.

Note: Since the `guess` function is predefined, ensure it's available in the environment where you test this solution or mock it for testing purposes.
