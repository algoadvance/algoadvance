title:  High-Access Employees-out

You are given a 2D integer array, `logs`, where each `logs[i] = [employee_id, minutes_accessed]` represents that employee `employee_id` has accessed the system for `minutes_accessed` minutes. 

An employee is considered "high-access" if they have accessed the system for more than a threshold of 1000 minutes in total. It is also guaranteed that each employee has a unique employee_id.

Return a list of employee_ids of all high-access employees sorted in ascending order.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be negative values in `minutes_accessed`?** 
   - No, all minutes are positive integers.
2. **Is the `logs` array sorted in any way?**
   - No, the `logs` array is not sorted.
3. **Can we assume that the `logs` array will always have at least one entry?**
   - Yes, the logs array will always have at least one row.
4. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - A list of employee IDs who have accessed the system for more than 1000 minutes, sorted in ascending order.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to store the total minutes accessed by each employee.
2. **Iterate through each log entry**:
   - Update the dictionary with the minutes accessed by the current employee.
3. **Filter the employees**:
   - Select those employees who have accessed the system for more than 1000 minutes.
4. **Sort the list of high-access employees** by their employee IDs in ascending order.
5. **Return the sorted list** of high-access employee IDs.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` 
  - Where `n` is the number of entries in the `logs` array, due to the sorting step. 
  - Iterating through `logs` is `O(n)` and inserting/updating into the dictionary is average `O(1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)`
  - Where `m` is the number of unique employee IDs, as we need to store the total minutes for each employee.

## Code

```python
def high_access_employees(logs):
    from collections import defaultdict

    access_log = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Tally up total minutes accessed by each employee
    for employee_id, minutes_accessed in logs:
        access_log[employee_id] += minutes_accessed
    
    # Filter employees who have more than 1000 minutes access and sort them
    high_access = [employee_id for employee_id, total_minutes in access_log.items() if total_minutes > 1000]
    
    return sorted(high_access)

# Test the function with an example input
logs = [
    [1, 500],
    [2, 1500],
    [3, 1100],
    [1, 600],
    [3, 100]
]

print(high_access_employees(logs))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

This solution iterates over the logs to accumulate the minutes for each employee, filters the high-access employees, and then sorts their IDs before returning the result.
