title:  Set Intersection Size At Least Two-out
permalink: /s757
---

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents all the integers from start_i to end_i inclusively.

A set of integers `S` is a **subset** of all the integers in the interval array if for every interval `intervals[i]`, the intersection of S with the interval is at least two elements.

Return the minimum size of such a set `S`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3], [1,4], [2,5], [3,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}. S has size 3 and every interval has at least 2 elements.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2], [2,3], [2,4], [4,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Consider the set S = {1, 2, 4, 5}. S has size 5 and every interval has at least 2 elements.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 3000`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^8`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can intervals be overlapping or contain other intervals? 
   - Yes, intervals can be overlapping and contain other intervals.
2. Should the set `S` be a list of integers?
   - Yes, the set `S` should be a list of integers such that every interval in the input array contains at least two elements from `S`.
3. Is there any limitation on the values of integers in the intervals?
   - There is no limitation within the given constraints, other than `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^8`.

## Strategy
1. **Sort Intervals**: First, sort the intervals by their end points. We want to focus on intervals that finish earlier because they tend to be more restrictive.
2. **Two Points Greedy Approach**: Keep track of the last two points in the set `S` such that every interval intersects with at least these two points.
   - If the current interval does not contain these two points, we need to add new points to cover the interval.

## Code
```python
def intersection_size_two(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    S = []
    
    for interval in intervals:
        if len(S) == 0 or S[-1] < interval[0]:
            S.append(interval[1] - 1)
            S.append(interval[1])
        elif S[-2] < interval[0]:
            S.append(interval[1])
    
    return len(S)

# Example usage
intervals1 = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]
print(intersection_size_two(intervals1))  # Output: 3

intervals2 = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]
print(intersection_size_two(intervals2))  # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sort operation takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Iteration**: The iteration through intervals takes `O(n)`.
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This code should work efficiently for the problem within the given constraints and ensures every interval in `intervals` array intersects with at least two elements from the set `S`.
