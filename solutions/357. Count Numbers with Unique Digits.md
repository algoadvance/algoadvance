title:  Count Numbers with Unique Digits-out
permalink: /s357
---

Given a non-negative integer `n`, count all numbers with unique digits, `x`, where `0 ≤ x < 10^n`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 91 
```
Explanation: The total numbers with unique digits, x, where `0 ≤ x < 10^2`, are `[0, 1, 2, ..., 99]`. Among these, 91 have unique digits.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically, `0 ≤ n ≤ 8` because 10^9 is the highest possible valid number within the 32-bit integer range.

2. **What should be the output if `n` is 0?**
   - The output should be 1, since the only number in the range `0 ≤ x < 10^0` is 0 itself.

3. **Are there constraints on the runtime or memory usage?**
   - No specific constraints mentioned, but an optimal solution is preferred.

## Strategy

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If n = 0, return 1.
   - If n = 1, return 10, since we have numbers 0 to 9, all of which are unique.

2. **Recursive Calculation:**
   - Use a backtracking or combinatorial approach to calculate the numbers with unique digits for higher values of `n`.
   - Start with the digit selection process for each additional digit position until reaching `n`.
   - Use the principle of counting permutations with constraints (where the constraint is that digits must be unique).

## Code

```python
def countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 10
    
    # Dynamic Programming storage for the calculation
    unique_count = [0] * (n+1)
    unique_count[0] = 1
    unique_count[1] = 10
    
    # Calculate for values 2 to n
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        count = 9
        for j in range(i-1):
            count *= (9 - j)
        unique_count[i] = unique_count[i-1] + count
    
    return unique_count[n]

# Usage example:
n = 2
print(countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(n))  # Output: 91
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n):

- **Base Cases Initialization:** O(1).
- **Loop to calculate for each value up to n:** O(n).
   
Given that the loop runs a fixed number of multiplications (at most 9 for any `n`), this is efficient.
   
The space complexity is also O(n) for the `unique_count` list, which stores the results for `0` to `n`.
