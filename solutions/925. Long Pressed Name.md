title:  Long Pressed Name-out
permalink: /s925
---

The problem is taken from LeetCode and is stated as follows:

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character 'c', the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed one or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: True
```
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.

#### Example 2:
```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: False
```
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.

#### Example 3:
```
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: True
```
Explanation: 'e' was long pressed in both places it appears in 'leelee'.

#### Example 4:
```
Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: True
```
Explanation: No characters are long pressed.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= name.length <= 1000
- 1 <= typed.length <= 1000
- The characters of `name` and `typed` are lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What happens if `typed` is shorter than `name`?**
   - Typed cannot represent the name, and we should return `False`.
   
2. **Can we assume all characters in `name` and `typed` are lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, according to the problem constraints.

### Strategy

We will use a two-pointer technique to solve this problem. Here's the detailed strategy:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` for `name` and `j` for `typed`.
2. Traverse through `typed` using pointer `j`:
   - If `name[i]` == `typed[j]`, move both pointers `i` and `j`.
   - If `typed[j]` == `typed[j-1]`, just move pointer `j` (long press scenario).
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, return `False`.
3. At the end of traversal of `typed`, if `i` has traversed all of `name`, return `True`.
4. Else, return `False`.

### Code

```python
def isLongPressedName(name: str, typed: str) -> bool:
    i, j = 0, 0
    while j < len(typed):
        if i < len(name) and name[i] == typed[j]:
            i += 1
        elif j > 0 and typed[j] == typed[j - 1]:
            j += 1
            continue
        else:
            return False
        j += 1

    return i == len(name)

# Example usage:
print(isLongPressedName("alex", "aaleex"))      # Output: True
print(isLongPressedName("saeed", "ssaaedd"))    # Output: False
print(isLongPressedName("leelee", "lleeelee"))  # Output: True
print(isLongPressedName("laiden", "laiden"))    # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `name` and \(m\) is the length of `typed`. This is because we are traversing both strings in linear time using two pointers.
