Write a program to check whether a given number is an "ugly number".

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, and 5.

- For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not because it includes another prime factor 7.
  
Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:**
   - What is the range of input values? 
   - Is the input value guaranteed to be an integer?
   
   *Assume: The input value will be an integer and within a typical 32-bit signed integer range.*

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be a boolean indicating whether the number is ugly?
   
   *Yes, the output should be a boolean: `True` if the number is ugly; otherwise, `False`.*

### Strategy
1. **Initial Check:**
   - If the number is less than or equal to zero, return `False` since ugly numbers are positive.

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - Use a loop to divide the number by 2 as long as it is divisible by 2.
   - Repeat the process for prime numbers 3 and 5.
   
3. **Final Check:**
   - After dividing out all factors of 2, 3, and 5, if the resulting number is 1, the original number is an ugly number.
   - Otherwise, it contains other prime factors.

### Code
```python
def is_ugly_number(num):
    if num <= 0:
        return False
    
    for factor in [2, 3, 5]:
        while num % factor == 0:
            num //= factor
    
    return num == 1

# Example Use Case
print(is_ugly_number(6))  # True
print(is_ugly_number(8))  # True
print(is_ugly_number(14)) # False
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
  - For each factor (2, 3, and 5), the division reduces the number by that factor.
  - In the worst-case scenario, the number is divisible multiple times, but this is logarithmic in nature.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - No additional space is used other than a few integer variables.

This solution should efficiently determine if a number is an "ugly number" using the defined constraints and properties.
