title:  Minimum Time to Finish the Race-out
permalink: /s2188
---

You are given an integer `n`, which is the number of laps you need to finish in a race. You are also given a 1-indexed 2D array `tires` where `tires[i] = [f_i, r_i]` indicates that the `i`-th tire takes `f_i` seconds to finish the first lap and for each subsequent lap, the time taken increases by a factor of `r_i`. 

* For example, if `f_i = 3` and `r_i = 2`, then the time taken will be `3` seconds for the first lap, `3 * 2 = 6` seconds for the second lap, `6 * 2 = 12` seconds for the third lap, and so on.

You may change tires as many times as needed. The cost of changing to another tire is the same regardless of which tire you choose to use next and is given by the integer `changeTime`.

Return the minimum time to finish the race.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `n` be very large, like `10^9`?
2. What are the constraints on the values of `f_i` and `r_i`?
3. What is the range for the `changeTime`?

3. Once we switch tires, do we have to start the lap count afresh?

## Strategy

1. **Understand tire performance over laps:** We need to compute how each tire performs over multiple laps considering the performance degradation due to the `r_i` factor.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** We can use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum time to finish `i` laps. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible strategies dynamically.
3. **Using Memoization:** Memoization can be utilized to avoid redundant calculations especially due to the tire switches.
4. **Tire Strategy Array:** Precompute the best single-tire strategy for up to a feasible number of laps before a tire should be swapped.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def minTimeToFinishRace(tires, changeTime, n):
    import math
    
    # A large constant for initial comparison
    MAXIMUM = float('inf')
    
    # Number of tires available
    t = len(tires)
    
    # Compute the time taken to complete a fixed number of laps (1-indexed) for each set of tires 
    time = [[0] * 20 for _ in range(t)]
    for i in range(t):
        f, r = tires[i]
        for j in range(1, 20):
            time[i][j] = f if j == 1 else time[i][j-1] * r
    
    # Dynamic Programming array to find minimum time to complete k laps
    dp = [MAXIMUM] * (n + 1)
    
    # Base case: The minimum time to complete 0 laps is 0
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for k in range(1, min(i, 18) + 1):  # considering that we need to change tires often to make it feasible
            for tire in range(t):
                if k > 1 and time[tire][k] >= MAXIMUM / 10:
                    break  # Need to ensure we don't choose suboptimal degraded tires
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - k] + time[tire][k - 1] + changeTime)
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
tires = [[2, 3], [3, 4]]
changeTime = 5
n = 4
print(minTimeToFinishRace(tires, changeTime, n))  # Example that needs to be tested.
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Pre-computation:** Generating the `time` array for each tire and lap costs `O(t * 20)` where `t` is the number of tires.
2. **Dynamic Programming:** Filling the DP array costs `O(n * t * min(i, 18))`. Due to the large constraint of `n`, the practical complexity is driven by the limit of feasible tire swaps and memoization.

The overall complexity can be considered `O(nt(18))` where 18 denotes a practical lap switch threshold.
