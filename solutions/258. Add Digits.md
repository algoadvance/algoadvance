Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example:
- Input: `num = 38`
- Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, the problem statement implies that the input integer is non-negative.
   
2. **What should be returned if the input is 0?**
   - The process would indicate that 0 is returned since no further addition is required.

3. **Is there a limit to the size of the integer `num`?**
   - The problem does not specify a limit, so we should assume `num` can be a large non-negative integer.

### Strategy

The task essentially requires iteratively summing the digits of the number until we get a single digit. There are two common approaches to solve this problem:

1. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Sum the digits repeatedly until a single digit is obtained.

2. **Mathematical Approach (Digital Root)**:
   - Utilize the properties of numbers, specifically using the digital root congruence formula to find the result in constant time. The digital root for a number is given by `1 + (num - 1) % 9`.

### Code

We'll use the mathematical approach for its efficiency.

```python
def addDigits(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return 1 + (num - 1) % 9

# Example usage
print(addDigits(38))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iterative Approach**: O(log(num))
  - Each iteration reduces the number of digits, hence the overall time complexity is proportional to the number of digits in `num`.
- **Mathematical Approach**: O(1)
  - The formula `1 + (num - 1) % 9` directly computes the result in constant time.

In this implementation, we've chosen the mathematical approach due to its straightforward and efficient constant time complexity.
