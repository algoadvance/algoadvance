title:  Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters-out
permalink: /s395
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest substring of `s` such that the frequency of each character in this substring is at least `k`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the string `s`?**
   - The length can vary but let's consider typical lengths for competitive programming constraints, often up to 10^5 characters.

2. **What kind of characters does the string `s` contain?**
   - The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Can `k` be greater than the length of the string `s`?**
   - Yes, in such cases the return value should be 0 because it's impossible to have any substring with repeating characters `k` times.

4. **Can the input string `s` be empty?**
   - Yes, if `s` is empty, the function should return 0.

## Strategy
1. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - If any character appears fewer than `k` times, then it cannot be part of the substring we are looking for.
   - We can split the string at these characters and recursively find the solution in the resulting substrings.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - The base case is if the string length is zero or if all characters in the given substring meet the requirement of appearing at least `k` times.

3. **Helper Function**:
   - Write a helper function that performs the divide and conquer strategy.

Here is the plan:

1. Implement a recursive function that:
   - Counts the frequency of characters in the substring `s`.
   - Splits `s` at characters whose frequency is less than `k`.
   - Recursively evaluates each partitioned substring and returns the maximum length of valid substrings.

## Code

```python
def longestSubstring(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    def helper(substring: str) -> int:
        if len(substring) == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Frequency count of characters
        freq = {}
        for char in substring:
            if char in freq:
                freq[char] += 1
            else:
                freq[char] = 1
        
        for char in freq:
            if freq[char] < k:
                # Split by this character and recursively solve
                return max(helper(part) for part in substring.split(char))
        
        # All characters meet or exceed k frequency
        return len(substring)
    
    return helper(s)

# Example usage:
s = "aaabb"
k = 3
print(longestSubstring(s, k))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n * m) where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the number of unique characters in the string. Here's the breakdown:
  - Splitting a string on a character and checking each part takes O(n) in the worst case.
  - The recursion depth can be up to `m` where `m` is limited by the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase English letters).

- In practice, this complexity is efficient for strings up to length of 10^5 given the constraints.
