title:  Distinct Subsequences II-out
permalink: /s940
---

Given a string `s`, you need to count the number of **distinct non-empty subsequences** of the string. Since the result might be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example:**
```
Input: "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
```
```
Input: "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "ba", "aa", and "aba".
```
```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The distinct subsequences are "a", "aa", and "aaa".
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the subsequences be contiguous?**
   - No, subsequences can be formed by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Do we consider empty subsequences?**
   - No, we are only interested in non-empty subsequences.

3. **Is the order of subsequences important?**
   - No, only the distinctness of subsequences matters, not their order.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming with the following approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Define `dp[i]` as the number of distinct subsequences that can be formed using the first `i` characters of the string `s`.

2. **Transition:**
   - When a new character `s[i-1]` is added to the existing subsequences, it can either start new subsequences from scratch or extend all subsequences previously formed up to `i-1`.
   - We can use an array `last` to keep track of the last occurrence of each character to avoid double-counting subsequences.

3. **Formulation:**
   - For each character in `s`, update `dp[i]` by doubling `dp[i-1]`:
     \[
     dp[i] = 2 \times dp[i-1]
     \]
   - If the character `s[i-1]` has been seen before at position `last[s[i-1]]`, subtract `dp[last[s[i-1]]-1]` to remove duplicates:
     \[
     dp[i] -= dp[last[s[i-1]]-1]
     \]
   - Take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Always update `last[s[i-1]]` to the current position `i`.

4. **Result:**
   - The final result will be stored in `dp[len(s)]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string \(s\).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the storage used for the `dp` array and the `last` array which requires constant space.

### Code

```python
def distinctSubseqII(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: empty subsequence
    
    last = {}
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        char = s[i - 1]
        dp[i] = (2 * dp[i - 1]) % MOD
        
        if char in last:
            dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[last[char] - 1]) % MOD
        
        last[char] = i
    
    return (dp[n] - 1) % MOD  # subtract the empty subsequence

# Example usage
print(distinctSubseqII("abc"))  # Output: 7
print(distinctSubseqII("aba"))  # Output: 6
print(distinctSubseqII("aaa"))  # Output: 3
```

This solution iteratively builds up the count of distinct subsequences while using the `last` array to account for previously seen characters, ensuring all subsequences are accounted for correctly without duplication.
