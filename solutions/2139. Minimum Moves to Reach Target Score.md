title:  Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score-out
permalink: /s2139
---

You are playing a game involving a counter initially set to `1`, and you have two moves available:

1. **Increment Move:** Increment the counter by 1.
2. **Double Move:** Double the value of the counter.

Given two integers `target` and `max_doubles`, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach exactly the `target` starting with the value `1` on the counter.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the target value be less than 1?
   **A:** No, the problem constraints will ensure that target is at least 1.

2. **Q:** Once we reach the maximum number of doubles, do we only use the increment move?
   **A:** Yes, once the double moves are exhausted, only increment moves should be used.

3. **Q:** Are the values for target and max_doubles within manageable constraints for typical integer operations in Python?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume the values for `target` and `max_doubles` are within typical constraints for these operations.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, the following strategy can be adopted:

1. **Backtrack from Target:** Instead of incrementing and doubling from `1` to reach the `target`, consider the problem in reverse. Start from the `target` and work backwards to `1`.
2. **Decide Move Types:**
    - If the current value is even and we have remaining double moves, perform a reverse double (i.e., halve the value).
    - If the current value is odd (or we have exhausted our double moves), perform a reverse increment (i.e., decrement the value by 1).
3. **Count Moves:** Keep track of the steps taken while applying the reverse of the moves.

This reverse approach helps in minimizing the total steps by leveraging the half reduction from double moves effectively when possible.

### Code

```python
def min_moves_to_reach_target(target: int, max_doubles: int) -> int:
    moves = 0
    while target > 1:
        if target % 2 == 0 and max_doubles > 0:
            target //= 2
            max_doubles -= 1
        else:
            if target % 2 == 1:
                target -= 1
            else:
                target -= 1 if max_doubles == 0 else 0
        
        moves += 1
    return moves

# Example Usage
target = 19
max_doubles = 2
print(min_moves_to_reach_target(target, max_doubles))  # Output should be 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The loop runs while `target > 1`, and in each iteration, the target is either halved (O(log(target)) complexity in the worst case) or decremented by 1, leading to an overall complexity of **O(log(target) + target) or O(target)** which simplifies to **O(target)** in the worst case where double operations aren't used.

- **Space Complexity:** The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, thus **O(1)**.

This approach is efficient and leverages backwards thinking to minimize the number of moves optimally.
