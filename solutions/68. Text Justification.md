Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will get more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything else we do"
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** Are all input words guaranteed to be valid strings without spaces within them?
2. **Special Cases:** If a single word exceeds `maxWidth`, can we assume inputs are properly constrained?
3. **Output Format:** Should punctuation be considered in space distribution, or they to be treated as regular characters?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty line and iterate over each word.
2. **Adding Words:** Add words to the current line until adding another would exceed `maxWidth`.
3. **Justification:** Distribute spaces as evenly as possible between words:
   - If it's the last line, left-justify.
   - For other lines, distribute additional spaces from left to right.
4. **Line Completion:** Once the line is constructed or nearing completion, justify it.
5. **Edge Cases:** Manage cases where words perfectly fill the line, or last line formatting requirements.

## Implementation

```python
def fullJustify(words, maxWidth):
    res = []
    current_line = []
    current_length = 0
    
    for word in words:
        # Check if adding the next word would exceed the maxWidth
        if current_length + len(word) + len(current_line) > maxWidth:
            # Distribute spaces and form the current line
            for i in range(maxWidth - current_length):
                current_line[i % (len(current_line) - 1 or 1)] += ' '
            res.append(''.join(current_line))
            current_line, current_length = [], 0
        # Add the word to the current line
        current_line.append(word)
        current_length += len(word)
    
    # The last line: left-justified
    res.append(' '.join(current_line).ljust(maxWidth))
    return res

# Example case
words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
maxWidth = 16
print(fullJustify(words, maxWidth))
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of words. The algorithm processes each word at most twice - once when forming the current line and once when distributing spaces.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing the result.

This implementation covers initialization, adding words to lines, and space distribution, ensuring both even distribution and handling of the last line.
