title:  Find Beautiful Indices in the Given Array II-out
permalink: /s3008
---

You are given an array `arr` of positive integers. An index `i` is considered beautiful if there exists two distinct indices `j` and `k` (j != k, j != i, k != i) such that `arr[j] * arr[k] == arr[i]`. Your task is to find all beautiful indices in the given array and return them in ascending order.

Write a function `find_beautiful_indices(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]` that returns a list of all beautiful indices in sorted order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the indices zero-based or one-based?
2. Can we assume that the array has at least three elements?
3. What should be the output if there are no beautiful indices? An empty list?

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def find_beautiful_indices(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(arr)
    beautiful_indices = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                if i != j and i != k and j != k:
                    if arr[j] * arr[k] == arr[i]:
                        beautiful_indices.append(i)
                        break
            if i in beautiful_indices:
                break
    
    return sorted(set(beautiful_indices))

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
print(find_beautiful_indices(arr))  # Expected output: Indices where the condition is satisfied
```

## Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list `beautiful_indices` to store the indices of the beautiful numbers.
2. Iterate over each index `i` in the array.
3. For each index `i`, check for any two distinct indices `j` and `k` (`j != k`, `j != i`, `k != i`) such that `arr[j] * arr[k] == arr[i]`.
4. If such indices `j` and `k` are found, add `i` to the list of beautiful indices.
5. Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set and then back to a list.
6. Sort the list of indices before returning it.

## Time Complexity

- The resulting time complexity of this approach is `O(n^3)` because of the three nested loops.
- This is because for each index `i`, we are checking all pairs of indices `j` and `k`.

(Note: An `O(n^3)` solution might be feasible for small arrays, but for large arrays, this could be improved with hash maps or another optimized approach.)

Would you like me to improve the solution or further explain any part of the code?
