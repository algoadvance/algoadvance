title:  Minimum Right Shifts to Sort the Array-out
permalink: /s2855
---

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of length `n`. The array `nums` can be right-shifted any number of times.

A **right shift** operation moves the last element of `nums` to the front:

- For example, if `nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]`, after one right shift, `nums = [4, 2, 1, 3]`.

Return the minimum number of right shifts required to sort `nums` in non-decreasing order. If it is impossible to sort the array using right shifts, return -1.

### Example

**Input**: `nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`  
**Output**: 3

**Input**: `nums = [1, 3, 5]`  
**Output**: 0

**Input**: `nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]`  
**Output**: -1

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to have no duplicates?**
   - Yes, assume all elements are distinct as the problem does not mention handling duplicates.

2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one element.

3. **Is only right shifting allowed?**
   - Yes, only right shifting is allowed as per the problem statement.

## Strategy

1. **Identify sorted segments**:
    - The main task is to identify if the array can be made sorted by any number of right shifts.
    - For this, we need to identify a segment where the array is already in non-decreasing order, and the rest of the array can be made sorted by right shifts.

2. **Find pivot point**:
    - Find the point where the order is disrupted. This point will be the pivot for the right shift.
    - If such a pivot exists, then the number of shifts needed would be the position of this pivot from the end of the array.

3. **Form a single-pass check**:
    - Start from the first element, traverse the array to find the position where `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.
    - This position determines the point after which the right shift must start.

4. **Validation**:
    - Once the potential pivot is found, verify if rotating from this point sorts the array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
    - If the array is already sorted, return `0`.
    - If no pivot can sort the array, return `-1`.

## Code

```python
def minimum_right_shifts(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    pivot = -1

    # Finding the pivot
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            pivot = i
            break
    
    # If pivot is not found, it means array is sorted
    if pivot == -1:
        return 0

    # Check if the array can be sorted with this pivot rotation
    for i in range(pivot + 1, n - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            return -1
    
    # To verify, we need to make sure last element is smaller than first element
    if nums[-1] > nums[0]:
        return -1

    # The minimum shifts needed is length - 1 - pivot
    return n - 1 - pivot

# Example Usage
nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
print(minimum_right_shifts(nums))  # Output: 3

nums = [1, 3, 5]
print(minimum_right_shifts(nums))  # Output: 0

nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]
print(minimum_right_shifts(nums))  # Output: -1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) since we are performing a single pass through the array to identify the pivot.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as no additional space is used apart from a few variables.
