title:  K Divisible Elements Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2261
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`. Find the number of **distinct** subarrays which contain at most `k` integers divisible by `p`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. Two subarrays are distinct if they are different as arrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the return type?**
   - The return type should be an integer representing the number of distinct subarrays.
   
2. **Constraints on the input?**
   - The length of the array `nums` will be in the range `[1, 2000]`.
   - The elements in the `nums` array will be between `1` and `2000`.
   - The integers `k` and `p` will also be between `1` and `2000`.

3. **What defines a subarray to be different?**
   - Subarrays are considered different based on their content and order. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 1]` are distinct subarrays.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Solution**: 
   - Iterate through every possible subarray.
   - For each subarray, count how many numbers are divisible by `p`.
   - Store subarrays that meet the condition (i.e., at most `k` numbers divisible by `p`) into a set to ensure all subarrays are distinct.
   - Return the size of the set as the result.

2. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Even though a brute force approach can work within the given constraints, we can optimize using a set to store and check for unique subarrays.

### Code

Here's a Python function to implement the above strategy.

```python
def countDistinct(nums, k, p):
    n = nums.length
    distinct_subarrays = set()
    
    # Loop to find all possible subarrays
    for i in range(n):
        divisible_count = 0
        subarray = []
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarray.append(nums[j])
            if nums[j] % p == 0:
                divisible_count += 1
            
            if divisible_count > k:
                break
            
            # Add subarray as tuple to set for uniquity
            distinct_subarrays.add(tuple(subarray))
    
    return len(distinct_subarrays)

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 2]
k = 2
p = 2
print(countDistinct(nums, k, p)) # Output may vary based on input
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops iterating over the array to generate subarrays.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case due to storing all possible subarrays in a set.

This approach is appropriate given the constraints (with a maximum of 2000 elements), ensuring that we can handle the worst-case scenario within reasonable time and space limits.
