> You are given an integer array `nums` with a length of `2 * n` where `n` is greater than 1. The elements in `nums` are between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
>
> The array `nums` contains n + 1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated `n` times.
>
> Return the element that is repeated `n` times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - `nums` will have a length of `2 * n` where `n > 1`.
   - All elements in `nums` are between `1` and `n`.
   - Exactly one element repeats `n` times.

2. **Output requirements:**
   - Return the element that is repeated `n` times.

3. **Examples:**
   - Example 1:
     - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]`
     - Output: `3`
   - Example 2:
     - Input: `nums = [2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2]`
     - Output: `2`
   - Example 3:
     - Input: `nums = [5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4]`
     - Output: `5`

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify which element is repeated exactly `n` times in the array. Given the constraints and properties of the array, a few different methods could work, but for simplicity and efficiency:

1. **Hash Map:**
   - Traverse the array and count the occurrences of each element using a hash map (dictionary).
   - If any element's count reaches `n`, return that element immediately.

This approach ensures that we don't traverse the array more than necessary and provides a time-efficient solution.

## Code

Let's implement the hash map strategy in Python:

```python
def repeatedNTimes(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in nums:
        counts[num] += 1
        if counts[num] == len(nums) // 2:
            return num

# Test cases
print(repeatedNTimes([1, 2, 3, 3]))      # Output: 3
print(repeatedNTimes([2, 1, 2, 5, 3, 2])) # Output: 2
print(repeatedNTimes([5, 1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4])) # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array. We traverse the array once, and dictionary operations (insert and check) are average O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array, as we may need to store counts for all elements in the worst case.

This solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
