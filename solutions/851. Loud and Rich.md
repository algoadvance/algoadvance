851. Loud and Rich

There is a group of `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of loudness. You are given an array `richer` where `richer[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that person `ai` has more money than person `bi` and an integer array `quiet` where `quiet[i]` is the quietness of the `i`-th person. All the arrays are 0-indexed.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[x] = y` indicates that the person `y` that the person `x` would choose to be the quietest among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person `x`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**:
    - What are the constraints on the number of people `n` and the size of the `richer` array?

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Should we consider situations where `ricker` array is empty?
    - Is it possible to have cycles in the richer relationships?

3. **Output**:
    - Should the output always have the same length as the number of people `n`?
    - Can there be multiple valid outputs or is the result unique for given inputs?

4. **Performance**:
    - What kind of time complexity is acceptable for this problem?

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**:
    - Represent the richer relationships as a directed graph where an edge from node `a` to node `b` indicates that `a` has more money than `b`.

2. **DFS for Traversal**:
    - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to determine the quietest person for each node in the graph.

3. **Memoization**:
    - Use memoization to store the quietest person for each node to avoid redundant computations.

4. **Result Construction**:
    - Construct the result array by iterating over each person and determining the quietest person who has equal to or more money than them.

### Code
```python
def loudAndRich(richer, quiet):
    n = len(quiet)
    
    # Build the adjacency list for the graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in richer:
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # Result array and memoization
    answer = [-1] * n
    
    def dfs(node):
        # If answer[node] has already been computed, return it.
        if answer[node] != -1:
            return answer[node]
        
        # Start with the assumption that the node itself is the quietest
        answer[node] = node
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            candidate = dfs(neighbor)
            if quiet[candidate] < quiet[answer[node]]:
                answer[node] = candidate
        
        return answer[node]
    
    # Compute for each person
    for i in range(n):
        dfs(i)
    
    return answer
```

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges in the `richer` array.
- **DFS Traversal**: Each node and edge is processed once, making the DFS `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges.
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is `O(V + E)`, which is efficient for typical constraints on such problems.

This approach efficiently computes the required answers and leverages memoization to avoid redundant calculations, making it optimal for large inputs.
