title:  Remove Boxes-out
permalink: /s546
---

You are given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers.

You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there are no more boxes left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (composed of `k` boxes, `k >= 1`), remove them and get `k * k` points.

Find the maximum points you can get.

**Example:**

```
Input: boxes = [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 23
Explanation: 
[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (4 points from 2s)
----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1 point from 4)
----> [1, 1] (9 points from 3s)
----> [] (4 points from 1s)
```
### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume the input is always valid, i.e., an array of positive integers?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the input array `boxes`?
3. Should we be concerned with memory limits?

### Strategy

This problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. Given the nature of the problem, a multi-dimensional DP array will be used to store the maximum score for every subarray of a given length.

Let `dp[l][r][k]` represent the maximum points we can get from the subarray `boxes[l:r+1]` with `k` boxes of the same color (as `boxes[r]`) adjacent to `boxes[r]`.

Steps to solve the problem:

1. **Base Case**: When `l > r`, then `dp[l][r][k] = 0`.
2. Recursive `dp[l][r][k]` computation where:
   - Remove the last `k` boxes directly, i.e., `dp[l][r-1][0] + (k+1)*(k+1)`.
   - Try to split the solution by inserting possible points `m` which is between `l` to `r-1` such that `boxes[m] == boxes[r]`.

### Code

```python
def removeBoxes(boxes):
    n = len(boxes)
    dp = [[[0] * n for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    
    def calculate_points(l, r, k):
        if l > r:
            return 0
        if dp[l][r][k] != 0:
            return dp[l][r][k]
        
        # We can directly delete the boxes[r] with 'k' boxes attached to it
        while r > l and boxes[r] == boxes[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            k += 1
        
        dp[l][r][k] = calculate_points(l, r - 1, 0) + (k + 1) * (k + 1)
        
        # Try to find a middle position to split the problem
        for m in range(l, r):
            if boxes[m] == boxes[r]:
                dp[l][r][k] = max(dp[l][r][k], calculate_points(l, m, k + 1) + calculate_points(m + 1, r - 1, 0))
        
        return dp[l][r][k]
    
    return calculate_points(0, n - 1, 0)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is O(n^4):
- We use three nested loops to fill up the `dp` table.
- An additional loop to find the middle point `m`.
  
This complexity arises because we are essentially checking every possible combination of subarrays and the conditions around them. Although high, it is optimized to fit within well-defined constraints.
