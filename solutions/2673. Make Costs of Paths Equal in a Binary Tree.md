title:  Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s2673
---

Given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes, each node in the tree has a value representing the cost. We want to make the costs of all paths from the root to any leaf node equal. To do this, you can increase the cost of any node (including the root itself) any number of times. The cost is only increased in integer amounts.

Determine the minimum additional cost needed to make the costs of all the root-to-leaf paths equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the value of a node be negative?**
   - Normally, node values are non-negative integers. For this problem, we will assume node values are non-negative. If they can be negative, that would change how we calculate the additional cost.

2. **Are all the values integers?**
   - Yes, all the values and costs are integers.

3. **What should we do if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, there are no paths, and hence no additional cost is needed.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Root-to-Leaf Costs:**
   - Traverse the tree to compute the cost for each path from the root to leaf nodes.

2. **Find Maximum Path Cost:**
   - The maximum cost of any path will be the target that all other paths must match.

3. **Calculate Additional Cost:**
   - For each path, compute the difference between its cost and the maximum cost from step 2. Sum these differences to get the total additional cost needed.

### Code

Here is a Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def minCost(root):
    # Helper function to calculate the cost of all root-to-leaf paths
    def dfs(node, current_cost, path_costs):
        if not node:
            return
        
        # Add current node's value to the current path cost
        current_cost += node.val
        
        # If it's a leaf node, append the current path cost to path_costs
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            path_costs.append(current_cost)
            return
        
        # Recurse on left and right children
        dfs(node.left, current_cost, path_costs)
        dfs(node.right, current_cost, path_costs)
    
    if not root:
        return 0  # No additional cost needed for an empty tree
    
    path_costs = []
    
    # Populate path_costs with the cost of each root-to-leaf path
    dfs(root, 0, path_costs)
    
    # The target cost for each path to equal should be the maximum cost among all paths
    target_cost = max(path_costs)
    
    # Calculate the total additional cost needed
    additional_cost = sum(target_cost - cost for cost in path_costs)
    
    return additional_cost

```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree since we visit each node exactly once.
- **Finding Maximum Path Cost:** O(m), where m is the number of leaf nodes (since we collect all path costs during the traversal).
- **Calculating Additional Cost:** O(m), the number of leaf nodes.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), assuming m (the number of leaf nodes) is also O(n) in the worst case for a tree with low branching factor.
