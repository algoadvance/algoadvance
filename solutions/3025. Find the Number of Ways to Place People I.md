title:  Find the Number of Ways to Place People I-out
permalink: /s3025

You are given `n` people to place in seats labeled from 1 to `n`. People can sit alone, with one seat empty between them, or in groups of two with no seats in between. For example, if you have 3 people, some valid placements could be:
- [Person, Empty, Person]
- [Person, Person, Empty, Person]

The task is to determine the number of ways to place `n` people according to these rules. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can people sit next to each other without an empty seat?**
   - Yes, but only if they form a group of two people.

2. **Are seats always labeled from 1 to `n`, and should all seats be occupied in the described manner?**
   - Yes, seats are labeled from 1 to `n`, and they should be occupied in a way that either one person is alone, or two people sit together without an empty seat.

3. **Should the positions of empty seats between people be considered in the placements?**
   - Yes, the pattern of people and empty seats matter.

### Strategy

This problem resembles a variation of the Fibonacci sequence problem where each position can either be:
1. Occupied by a single person (contributing to the number of ways to place the remaining `n-1` people).
2. Occupied by a pair of people (contributing to the number of ways to place the remaining `n-2` people).

To solve it:
- Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to place `i` people.
- Initialize `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` since they have straightforward solutions.
- Use the recursive relation:

\[ dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2] \]

Here's the plan:
1. Initialize the base cases.
2. Use a loop to fill the dp array based on the recursive relation.
3. Return the value of `dp[n]`.

### Code

```python
def find_number_of_ways(n):
    # Base cases
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    
    # Initialize dp array where dp[i] is the number of ways to place i people
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # No people means one way (doing nothing)
    dp[1] = 1  # One person can only be placed in one way
    dp[2] = 2  # Two people can either sit alone or together
    
    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    
    return dp[n]

# Example Usage
print(find_number_of_ways(3))  # Output: 3
print(find_number_of_ways(4))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) since we're iterating from 3 to `n` to fill the DP array. The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage needed for the DP array.

This solution is efficient and should work well for reasonably large values of `n`.
