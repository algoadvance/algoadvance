1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Can I assume that `arr1` and `arr2` are always given and are both non-empty?
   - Will `arr2` always contain distinct integers, and will all elements of `arr2` be present in `arr1`?
   - How should elements in `arr1` that do not appear in `arr2` be handled in the final sorted array?

2. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of `arr1` and `arr2`?
   - How should we handle duplicate elements in `arr1`?
   - Is there any constraint on the range of integer values in `arr1` and `arr2`?

With these questions, we can comprehend the requirements and constraints needed to tailor an efficient solution for this problem.

Let's assume the following until further details are provided:
- `arr2` will only contain unique values, and each of these values will definitely be present in `arr1`.
- Any elements in `arr1` not in `arr2` should be sorted in ascending order at the end of the output list.

## Strategy:

1. **Create a Mapping for Order in `arr2`:** Use a dictionary to map each element in `arr2` to its index, which will help in ordering elements of `arr1` that are present in `arr2`.
2. **Segregate and Sort:** Traverse `arr1`:
   - Collect elements that are in `arr2` and sort them using the mapping from the dictionary.
   - Collect elements that are not in `arr2` and sort them in ascending order.
3. **Combine Results:** Concatenate the sorted elements from `arr2` and the sorted elements not in `arr2`.

## Time Complexity:

- **Mapping**: Creating the dictionary from `arr2` will take \(O(n2)\) time, where \(n2\) is the length of `arr2`.
- **Segregating**: Traversing `arr1` and categorizing elements will take \(O(n1)\) time, where \(n1\) is the length of `arr1`.
- **Sorting**: Sorting the elements in `arr1` that are not in `arr2` will take \(O(m \log m)\) time, where \(m\) is the number of elements in `arr1` not found in `arr2`.

Hence, the overall complexity will be \(O(n1 + m \log m + n2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\) in the worst case where `n` is the length of `arr1`.

## Code:

```python
def relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2):
    # Create a mapping from arr2 to its indices
    order_map = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(arr2)}

    # Function to get sort key
    def sort_key(val):
        if val in order_map:
            return (0, order_map[val])  # Elements in arr2 are prioritized
        else:
            return (1, val)  # Elements not in arr2 are sorted naturally

    # Sort arr1 using the custom key
    arr1.sort(key=sort_key)

    return arr1

# Example usage
arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19]
arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
print(relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

In the given code:
- **order_map** holds the indices of elements in `arr2`.
- The `sort_key` function ensures that elements present in `arr2` are prioritized and sorted according to their indices.
- Elements not in `arr2` are sorted naturally in ascending order.

Feel free to run this code with different inputs to verify its correctness!
