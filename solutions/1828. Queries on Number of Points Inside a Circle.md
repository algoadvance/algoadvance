title:  Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle-out
permalink: /s1828
---

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinates. You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]` represents a circle centered at (xj, yj) with radius `rj`.

For each query `queries[j]`, compute the number of points inside the circle. Points on the border of the circle are also considered inside.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j`-th query.

### Example:
```
Input: 
points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]]
queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]

Output: 
[3,2,2]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= points.length <= 500`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `-1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= xj, yj <= 1000`
- `1 <= rj <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be duplicate points in the 'points' array?**
    - Yes, multiple points can have the same coordinates.

2. **Are we guaranteed that the input points and queries are within the specified constraints?**
    - Yes, according to the constraints provided.

3. **Should points lying exactly on the boundary of the circle be counted as inside?**
    - Yes, points on the border of the circle are considered inside.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through each query**:
    - Extract the center coordinates `(xj, yj)` and radius `rj` for each query.
    - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of points inside the current circle.
    
2. **Check each point**:
    - For each point `(xi, yi)`, calculate the squared distance from the point to the center `(xj, yj)`.
    - Compare the squared distance to the squared radius (`rj`Â²). If it is less than or equal, increment the counter for the query.
    
3. **Store the result of each query**:
    - Append the counter to the results list after evaluating all points for the current query.

4. **Return the results list** after processing all queries.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

def countPoints(points: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    def is_inside_circle(px, py, cx, cy, r):
        # Check if point (px, py) is inside the circle centered at (cx, cy) with radius r
        return (px - cx) ** 2 + (py - cy) ** 2 <= r ** 2

    results = []
    
    for xj, yj, rj in queries:
        count = 0
        for xi, yi in points:
            if is_inside_circle(xi, yi, xj, yj, rj):
                count += 1
        results.append(count)
    
    return results
```

## Time Complexity

- **Checking each point for each query**:
  - There are `Q` queries and `P` points.
  - Each pair is checked once, leading to `O(Q * P)` operations where `Q` is the number of queries and `P` is the number of points.
  - In the worst case, `Q` and `P` are each up to 500, resulting in `O(250,000)` operations.

The code is efficient for the given constraints and iteratively checks each point against each circle.
