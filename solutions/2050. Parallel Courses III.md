title:  Parallel Courses III-out
permalink: /s2050
---

You are given:
1. An integer `n` which represents the number of courses.
2. A 2D array `relations` where `relations[i] = [prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i]` denotes a prerequisite relationship, indicating that you must complete course `prevCourse_i` before course `nextCourse_i`.
3. An array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many months it takes to complete the i-th course.

You want to find the minimum time needed to complete all the courses while respecting the prerequisites.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume there are no cycles in the prerequisite graph?
   **A:** Yes, the problem guarantees the absence of cycles.
   
2. **Q:** Can a course have multiple prerequisites, and can a course be a prerequisite for multiple other courses?
   **A:** Yes, a course can have multiple prerequisites and can be a prerequisite for multiple other courses.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the number of courses (`n`) or the length of each course (`time[i]`)?
   **A:** The constraints typically would be given in the problem. Assuming standard limits for competitive programming (e.g., `n` up to 10^4).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Maintain an array `in_degrees` to keep track of how many prerequisites each course has.

2. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting which makes use of BFS.
   - Keep a queue to process all courses that have an in-degree of 0 initially (i.e., no prerequisites).

3. **Calculate Minimum Time**:
   - Use an array `completion_time` to track the time taken to complete each course including its prerequisites.
   - For each course `u` dequeued, update the time for each of its neighbors `v` as `completion_time[v] = max(completion_time[v], completion_time[u] + time[v])`.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
from typing import List

def minimumTime(n: int, relations: List[List[int]], time: List[int]) -> int:
    # Step 1: Create graph and initialize in-degrees
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degrees = [0] * n
    for u, v in relations:
        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
        in_degrees[v - 1] += 1

    # Step 2: Initialize queue with courses that have no prerequisites
    queue = deque()
    completion_time = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if in_degrees[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
            completion_time[i] = time[i]

    # Step 3: Process the courses in topological order
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degrees[v] -= 1
            if in_degrees[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)
            completion_time[v] = max(completion_time[v], completion_time[u] + time[v])

    return max(completion_time)

# Example usage:
n = 5
relations = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5], [3, 5]]
time = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(minimumTime(n, relations, time))  # Output: 12
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph construction**: O(E) where E is the number of edges (prerequisites).
- **Topological sorting (Kahn's algorithm)**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (courses).
- **Updating completion times**: Each edge is processed at most once, thus O(E).

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(V + E). Given the constraints, this should be efficient.

### Space Complexity

- **Graph storage**: O(V + E).
- **Additional arrays** (`in_degrees`, `completion_time`): O(V).

Overall space complexity is O(V + E).
