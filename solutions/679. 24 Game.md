You are given an array of four integers `nums` (each ranging from 1 to 9). You need to determine if you can operate on these integers using any of the basic arithmetic operations `(+, -, *, /)` and parenthesis to get the result 24.

Return `True` if you can do it, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are divisions supposed to be integer or floating point?**
   - Floating point divisions are allowed.

2. **Can we use each number in the array more than once?**
   - No, each number must be used exactly once in the expression.

3. **Is the order of the numbers as given in the array important?**
   - No, you can rearrange the numbers in any order.

4. **Are there any constraints on the operations?**
   - Operations can be any of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parentheses can be used to dictate the order of operations.

### Strategy

1. **Generate Permutations**:
   - Since the order of numbers can be rearranged, generate all permutations of the input array.

2. **Generate All Possible Expressions**:
   - For each permutation, generate all possible ways to combine these numbers with the four operations between them, respecting the rules of parentheses to change the order of operations.

3. **Evaluate Expressions**:
   - For each generated expression, evaluate it and check if it equals 24. Care must be taken to handle division by zero.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - We will use backtracking to try out all possible combinations and check if any combination results in 24.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def eval_rpn(tokens):
    stack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token in "+-*/":
            b = stack.pop()
            a = stack.pop()
            if token == '+':
                stack.append(a + b)
            elif token == '-':
                stack.append(a - b)
            elif token == '*':
                stack.append(a * b)
            elif token == '/':
                if b == 0:
                    return float('inf')
                stack.append(a / b)
        else:
            stack.append(token)
    return stack[0]

def generate_expressions(nums):
    if not nums:
        return [[]]
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return [[nums[0]]]
    expressions = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if i == j:
                continue
            remaining = [nums[k] for k in range(len(nums)) if k != i and k != j]
            for exp in generate_expressions(remaining):
                expressions.append([nums[i], nums[j], '+'] + exp)
                expressions.append([nums[i], nums[j], '-'] + exp)
                expressions.append([nums[i], nums[j], '*'] + exp)
                if nums[j] != 0:
                    expressions.append([nums[i], nums[j], '/'] + exp)
    return expressions

def judgePoint24(nums):
    for perm in permutations(nums):
        for exp in generate_expressions(list(perm)):
            if abs(eval_rpn(exp) - 24) < 1e-6:
                return True
    return False

# Example usage
nums = [4, 1, 8, 7]
print(judgePoint24(nums))
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Permutations Generation**: Generating permutations of 4 numbers has a time complexity of \( O(4!) = O(24) \).
- **Expression Generation and Evaluation**: For each permutation, the function `generate_expressions` generates all possible expressions which is a combinatorial problem. Though it's difficult to give an exact complexity, it is bounded by a constant as we are only permuting 4 numbers and 4 operators in fixed slots.
- **Total Complexity**: The overall complexity is influenced by the constant number of permutations and evaluations, making it feasible for the given constraints (fixed size of 4 numbers).

The provided code aims to exhaustively check all possible expressions and evaluate them to find if any combination results in 24. This is plausible given the small, fixed input size.
