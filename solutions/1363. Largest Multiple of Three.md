title:  Largest Multiple of Three-out
permalink: /s1363
---

Given an array of digits `digits`, return the largest multiple of three that can be formed by concatenating some of the given digits in any order. If there is no answer, return an empty string.

### Example
```text
Input: digits = [8,1,9]
Output: "981"

Input: digits = [8,6,7,1,0]
Output: "8760"

Input: digits = [1]
Output: ""

Input: digits = [0,0,0,0,0]
Output: "0"
```

### Constraints
* `1 <= digits.length <= 10^4`
* `0 <= digits[i] <= 9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the digits array contain leading zeros when forming a number? 
   **A:** Yes, but the final concatenated number should not have leading zeros unless it is representing zero itself.
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned if it's impossible to form a multiple of three?
   **A:** An empty string should be returned.

3. **Q:** Can the input array contain only zeros?
   **A:** Yes, in such a case the result should be '0'.

## Strategy

To determine the largest multiple of three from the concatenation of the given digits, we can use the properties of numbers divisible by three:
- A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

Here's the strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Sum Calculation and Grouping:**
   - Compute the sum of all digits.
   - Collect digits into three groups based on their remainders when divided by 3 (0, 1, and 2).

2. **Adjusting Digits Based on Sum Remainder:**
   - If the sum is already divisible by 3, we can just concatenate the digits in descending order.
   - If the sum leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, try to remove one digit with a remainder of 1. If none is available, remove two digits with a remainder of 2.
   - If the sum leaves a remainder of 2, try to remove one digit with a remainder of 2. If none is available, remove two digits with a remainder of 1.

3. **Concatenating Remaining Digits:**
   - After adjusting the digits, sort them in descending order and concatenate to form the final number.
   - Handle the special case where all remaining digits are zeros by returning '0'.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy in Python:
```python
def largestMultipleOfThree(digits):
    digits.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sum = sum(digits)
    
    remainder_buckets = {0: [], 1: [], 2: []}
    
    for digit in digits:
        remainder_buckets[digit % 3].append(digit)
    
    def remove_minimum_count_of_digits(count, remainder):
        while count > 0:
            if remainder_buckets[remainder]:
                remainder_buckets[remainder].pop()
                count -= 1
            else:
                return False
        return True

    if total_sum % 3 == 1:
        if not remove_minimum_count_of_digits(1, 1):
            remove_minimum_count_of_digits(2, 2)
    elif total_sum % 3 == 2:
        if not remove_minimum_count_of_digits(1, 2):
            remove_minimum_count_of_digits(2, 1)
    
    result_digits = remainder_buckets[0] + remainder_buckets[1] + remainder_buckets[2]
    result_digits.sort(reverse=True)
    
    if not result_digits:
        return ""
    
    if result_digits[0] == 0:
        return "0"
    
    return "".join(map(str, result_digits))

# Test Cases
print(largestMultipleOfThree([8,1,9]))  # Output: "981"
print(largestMultipleOfThree([8,6,7,1,0]))  # Output: "8760"
print(largestMultipleOfThree([1]))  # Output: ""
print(largestMultipleOfThree([0,0,0,0,0]))  # Output: "0"
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Digits:** \( O(n \log n) \)
2. **Sum Calculation:** \( O(n) \)
3. **Distribution into Remainder Groups:** \( O(n) \)
4. **Adjusting the Digits:** \( O(n) \)
5. **Final Sort and Concatenation:** \( O(n \log n) \)

Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \( O(n \log n) \).
