title:  Find Peak Element-out
permalink: /s162
---

The problem is from LeetCode (162. Find Peak Element):

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = -∞` and `nums[n] = -∞`, which means that an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is out of bounds.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we do if the array has multiple peak elements?
   **A:** Return the index of any one of the peak elements.
   
2. **Q:** Can the array have duplicate values?
   **A:** The problem implies that we deal with strictly greater neighbors, so the assumption would be no duplicates in direct neighbors.

3. **Q:** What is the minimum length of the array?
   **A:** The array must contain at least one element.

### Strategy

To meet the O(log n) time complexity requirement, a binary search approach is appropriate. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - Compare the middle element `nums[mid]` with its neighbors `nums[mid - 1]` and `nums[mid + 1]` (handling the edge cases where `mid` is at the boundaries of the array).
   - If `nums[mid]` is greater than both of its neighbors, `nums[mid]` is a peak element, return `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is less than its right neighbor `nums[mid + 1]`, there must be a peak element to the right. Move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is less than its left neighbor `nums[mid - 1]`, there must be a peak element to the left. Move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - Continue the process until `left` equals `right`, at which point you've found a peak element.

### Code

```python
def findPeakElement(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]: 
            # Peak must be in the left half or at mid
            right = mid
        else:
            # Peak must be in the right half
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left

# Example usage:
print(findPeakElement([1,2,3,1]))  # Output: 2 (index 2, value 3, is a peak)
print(findPeakElement([1,2,1,3,5,6,4]))  # Output: 1 (could also be 5)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) due to the binary search approach.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we are using a constant amount of additional space.
