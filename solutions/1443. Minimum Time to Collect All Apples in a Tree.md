title:  Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree-out
permalink: /s1443
---

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has `n-1` edges, and a boolean array `hasApple` of length `n` where `hasApple[i]` is `True` if vertex `i` has an apple, otherwise `False`, return the minimum time in seconds you need to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex `0` and coming back to this vertex.

Edges are represented by a 2D array `edges` of size `n-1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` denotes that there is an edge between vertices `ai` and `bi`.

### Example
```python
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [False,False,True,False,True,True,False]
Output: 8
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if no apples are present in the tree?**
   - If no apples are present, the function should return `0`.

2. **Is the tree always connected, i.e., any node can be reached from node 0?**
   - Yes, since it is given as a tree, it is always connected.

### Strategy
1. **Tree Representation:** Convert the given edge list to an adjacency list for easier traversal.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the tree and collect apples.
   - Keep track of the total time taken.
   - Recursively explore each node and sum the times required to collect apples from its child nodes.
   - Add 2 seconds for each node if and only if its subtree has apples (1 second to go and 1 second to return).
3. **Base Case:** If a node has no child nodes with apples and the node itself does not have an apple, return 0 for that subtree.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def minTime(n, edges, hasApple):
    # Building the adjacency list for the tree representation
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        # Base case: If there's no connected child that contains an apple, return 0.
        time_spent = 0
        
        # Recursively search all connected nodes (children)
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue
            child_time = dfs(neighbor, node)
            if child_time or hasApple[neighbor]:
                time_spent += child_time + 2
        
        return time_spent
    
    # Perform DFS from the root node (0), no parent for the root node
    return dfs(0, -1)

# Example Usage
n = 7
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]]
hasApple = [False,False,True,False,True,True,False]
print(minTime(n, edges, hasApple))  # Output should be 8
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building Adjacency List:** `O(n)` since we are converting `n-1` edges to the adjacency list.
- **DFS Traversal:** `O(n)` in the worst case as every node is visited.
- Overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

This approach ensures we correctly and efficiently calculate the minimum time required to collect all apples starting and ending at vertex `0`.
