title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box-out
permalink: /s1769
---

You have `n` boxes. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where `boxes[i]` is '0' if the `ith` box is empty, and '1' if it contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the `ith` box.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the input string be very large?**
   - Yes, the input string length can be quite large (up to \(10^4\)).

2. **Do the operations account for both left and right movements?**
   - Yes, balls can be moved to both left and right adjacent boxes.

3. **Is it required to consider the move cost sequentially or aggregate total cost?**
   - The task is to consider the aggregate total cost to move all balls to each box.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider the cumulative cost of moving balls to each box. We will use a two-pass approach:

1. **First Pass (Left to Right):**
    - Calculate the cumulative cost of moving balls to the current box from the left side.
  
2. **Second Pass (Right to Left):**
    - Add the cumulative cost of moving balls to the current box from the right side.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Initialize:
    - `n` as the length of the `boxes` string.
    - `answer` array of size `n` initialized with zeros.
    - `operations` initialized to 0 for counting move costs.
    - `balls` initialized to 0 for counting the number of balls encountered so far.

2. **First Pass (Left to Right):**
    - Traverse from left to right.
    - Update `answer[i]` with the current `operations`.
    - If `boxes[i]` is '1', increment the `balls`.
    - Increment `operations` by `balls`.

3. **Second Pass (Right to Left):**
    - Reinitialize `operations` and `balls` to 0.
    - Traverse from right to left.
    - Update `answer[i]` with the current `operations`.
    - If `boxes[i]` is '1', increment the `balls`.
    - Increment `operations` by `balls`.

This two-pass method ensures that we achieve the result in \(O(n)\) time complexity, which is efficient for large inputs.

### Code:

```python
def minOperations(boxes):
    n = len(boxes)
    answer = [0] * n
    
    # First pass: Left to right
    operations = 0
    balls = 0
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] += operations
        if boxes[i] == '1':
            balls += 1
        operations += balls
    
    # Second pass: Right to left
    operations = 0
    balls = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        answer[i] += operations
        if boxes[i] == '1':
            balls += 1
        operations += balls
    
    return answer

# Example usage:
boxes = "110"
print(minOperations(boxes))
# Output: [1, 1, 3]
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\) because:
- The solution involves two passes over the `boxes` array, each requiring \(O(n)\) time.
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the `answer` array used to store the results.

This makes the solution both time-efficient and space-efficient for large inputs.
