title:  Avoid Flood in The City-out
permalink: /s1488
---
You are given an integer array `rains` where:

- `rains[i] > 0` means that there will be a rain over the `rains[i]` lake.
- `rains[i] == 0` means that you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array `ans` where:
- If `rains[i] > 0`, then `ans[i]` should be `-1`.
- If `rains[i] == 0`, then `ans[i]` should be the lake you chose to dry or `1` if multiple valid options exist.

If it is impossible to avoid flooding, return an empty array.

### Strategy
1. **Tracking Lakes**:
    - Use a dictionary to keep track of the latest occurrence of rain for each lake.
    - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to decide on the earliest lake that should be dried when needed.

2. **Heap Utilization**:
    - When encountering a dry day (`0`), use the heap to find the earliest-rain lake and dry it.
    - Always ensure no lake floods by drying before rains accumulate.

### Code
Here's the code implementing the strategy described:

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from collections import defaultdict

def avoidFlood(rains):
    n = len(rains)
    ans = [-1] * n
    last_rain = {}
    dry_days = []
    to_dry_heap = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if rains[i] > 0:
            lake = rains[i]
            if lake in last_rain:
                heappush(to_dry_heap, (last_rain[lake], lake))
            last_rain[lake] = i
        else:
            dry_days.append(i)
    
    for day in dry_days:
        if to_dry_heap:
            dry_before_day, lake_to_dry = heappop(to_dry_heap)
            ans[day] = lake_to_dry
        else:
            ans[day] = 1
            
        if to_dry_heap and to_dry_heap[0][0] < dry_days[0]:
            return []

    return ans

# Example test case
rains = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1]
print(avoidFlood(rains))
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Unique Lakes**: Are the lake numbers in `rains` unique or can the same lake number appear multiple times?
2. **Edge Cases**: Is the length of the array always greater than 0?
3. **Multiple Dry Days**: If multiple dry days exist, is there a preference on which lake to dry?

These clarifications help ensure any edge cases are handled correctly in the implementation.

### Time Complexity
- **Insertion Operations**: `O(log N)` for each operation in the heap.
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(N log N)` where `N` is the length of the `rains` array.
  
  This complexity ensures the solution is efficient even for larger input sizes.

In case more detailed handling of drying days or specific order maintenance is required, adjustments can be made appropriately.
