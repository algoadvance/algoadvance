title:  Count Nice Pairs in an Array-out
permalink: /s1814
---

You are given an array `nums`. A pair `(i, j)` is called nice if `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` and `rev(x)` is the reverse of the decimal representation of x.

Return the number of nice pairs in the array.

### Example:
1. Input: `nums = [42,11,1,97]`
   Output: `2`
   Explanation: Two pairs are (0,1) and (1,3), since:
   - `42 + rev(11) == 11 + rev(42)`
   - `11 + rev(97) == 97 + rev(11)`

2. Input: `nums = [13,10,35,24,76]`
   Output: `0`
   Explanation: There are no nice pairs in the array.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the array contain only non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` consists of non-negative integers.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

3. **What is the maximum length of the array?**
   - The length of the array can go up to `10^5`.

4. **What is the range of the elements in the array?**
   - Each element in the array `nums` is within the range `[0, 10^9]`.

## Strategy

1. **Reverse Calculation**:
   - Define a helper function `rev(x)` to reverse the digits of an integer `x`.

2. **Nice Pair Condition Simplification**:
   - From the problem statement, given `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`, we can simplify this to `nums[i] - rev(nums[i]) == nums[j] - rev(nums[j])`.
   - This implies if we calculate `diff = num - rev(num)` for each element in the array, we should then count how many times each `diff` appears.

3. **Using a HashMap**:
   - We can utilize a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each `diff`.
   - For every new element processed, calculate its corresponding `diff` and add it to the result based on how many times the same `diff` has appeared before.

4. **Calculate Result**:
   - For every `diff` observed, increment the result by the count of its previous occurrences.

## Code

```python
def countNicePairs(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    def rev(x):
        return int(str(x)[::-1])

    count = defaultdict(int)
    result = 0
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    
    for num in nums:
        diff = num - rev(num)
        result = (result + count[diff]) % mod
        count[diff] += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(countNicePairs([42, 11, 1, 97]))  # Output: 2
print(countNicePairs([13, 10, 35, 24, 76]))  # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Calculating `rev(x)` for each element takes `O(d)` where `d` is the number of digits in the number (bounded by log10(10^9) â‰ˆ 9 in this case).
  - Looping through all the elements once results in a time complexity of `O(n * d)` where `n` is the length of the `nums` array and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number.
  - In this specific problem, `d` is a small constant value (at most 9), so the effective time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the usage of the dictionary to store counts of the `diff` values.
  
Thus, the provided solution is efficient and should work well within the provided constraints.
