title:  Maximum Points in an Archery Competition-out
permalink: /s2212
---

You are given two integers `numArrows` and `numBalloons`, and an array `points` where `points[i]` is the number of points Alice can earn for hitting the `i-th` balloon with a bullseye. Additionally, there is another array `bobArrows` where `bobArrows[i]` is the number of arrows Bob uses to burst the `i-th` balloon. Alice wants to maximize her points by strategically targeting the balloons.

Alice can only burst a balloon `i` if she uses more arrows than Bob uses for that balloon. Alice has a total of `numArrows` arrows to use.

Your task is to determine the maximum points Alice can earn.

__Inputs:__
- `numArrows`: an integer representing the total number of arrows Alice has.
- `points`: an array of integers where each element represents points earned if the corresponding balloon is burst.
- `bobArrows`: an array of integers where each element represents the arrows Bob uses to burst the corresponding balloon.

__Outputs:__
- An integer representing the maximum number of points Alice can earn.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can a balloon not burst if Alice uses equal or fewer arrows than Bob's?**
   - Yes, Alice must use more arrows than Bob to burst a balloon.
   
2. **Is there any restriction on the values in the points and bobArrows arrays?**
   - Presumably, both arrays would have non-negative integers.

3. **What if Alice has fewer arrows than the sum of all bobArrows?**
   - Alice will have to strategically select which balloons to target to maximize her points based on the available arrows.

## Strategy (Dynamic Programming / Knapsack-like problem)
1. Since Alice has a limited number of arrows, we can think of this problem as a variation of the knapsack problem.
2. We need to maximize the points by considering which balloons to target.
3. This problem will be solved using dynamic programming to evaluate the best possible points for each sum of arrows from `1` to `numArrows`.

## Code

```python
def maximumPoints(numArrows, points, bobArrows):
    n = len(points)
    dp = [[0] * (numArrows + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(numArrows + 1):
            # If we do not take current balloon
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            
            # If we take current balloon
            if j > bobArrows[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - bobArrows[i - 1] - 1] + points[i - 1])
    
    return dp[n][numArrows]

# Example usage
print(maximumPoints(10, [3, 4, 5, 9], [2, 4, 6, 7]))
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above solution is `O(n * numArrows)`, where `n` is the number of balloons. The space complexity is also `O(n * numArrows)` due to the DP table.

## Explanation
1. We create a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points Alice can get with `j` arrows considering the first `i` balloons.
2. We iterate through each balloon and for each number of arrows, we decide whether to target the balloon or skip it.
3. If we target, we make sure Alice uses more arrows than Bob used and add the points potential from that balloon.
4. By iterating through all possible scenarios, we get the maximum points Alice can collect for `numArrows`.
