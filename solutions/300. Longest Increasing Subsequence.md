title:  Longest Increasing Subsequence-out
permalink: /s300
---
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3, 6, 2, 7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0, 3, 1, 6, 2, 2, 7]`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 4
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]
Output: 1
```

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - Initialize each value in `dp` to 1 since the minimum length of an increasing subsequence including any element is 1 (the element itself).
   - For each element `i` in the array, iterate through all previous elements `j` (0 to `i-1`):
     - If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, then `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

2. **Binary Search Optimization**:
   - Maintain an array `lis` which will store the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of various lengths.
   - Iterate through the array `nums`, and for each element `num`, use binary search to determine its position in `lis`.
   - If `num` is greater than the largest element in `lis`, append it to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element in `lis` that is just bigger than `num` with `num`.
   - The length of `lis` at the end will be the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

## Time Complexity
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: O(n^2)
- **Binary Search Optimization**: O(n log n)

We will use the Binary Search Optimization approach for better performance.

## Code
```python
def lengthOfLIS(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    lis = []
    
    for num in nums:
        pos = binarySearch(lis, num)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(num)
        else:
            lis[pos] = num
            
    return len(lis)

def binarySearch(lis, num):
    left, right = 0, len(lis)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if lis[mid] < num:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

# Example Usage
nums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
print(lengthOfLIS(nums))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Initialize an empty list `lis`.
- **Iterate through `nums`**: For each number in `nums`:
  - Use `binarySearch` to find its placement in `lis`.
  - If it should be added to the end, append it.
  - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with this number.
- **Return the length of `lis`**: This length represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

This approach ensures an efficient time complexity of O(n log n) due to the binary search within the loop.
