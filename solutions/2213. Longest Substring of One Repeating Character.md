title:  Longest Substring of One Repeating Character-out
permalink: /s2213
---

Given a string `s` and a 2D integer array `queryCharacters` where each `query = [index, character]`, you need to update the string `s` at the given indexes and return the length of the longest substring of one repeating character after each update.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Are the index updates strictly sequential (i.e., can updates affect the results of subsequent updates)?
   - **A:** Yes, an update may affect the results of subsequent updates, and they should be applied in order.

2. **Q:** What are the constraints on the length of the string and the number of queries?
   - **A:** The specific constraints aren't provided, but typically we deal with lengths up to \(10^5\) for such problems.

3. **Q:** Can the same index be updated multiple times?
   - **A:** Yes, the same index can be updated multiple times.

4. **Q:** Is the input string `s` guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?
   - **A:** Assuming the input string `s` contains only lowercase English letters, as per usual problems of this nature.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial State Calculation:**
   - Compute the initial length of the longest substring of repeating characters before any updates.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the string is updated at the given index.
   - After each update, the longest substring of repeating characters is recalculated.

3. **Data Structure Choice:**
   - Use segment trees or other efficient data structures to keep track of repeating character segments to optimize recalculations after each update.

4. **Optimization Consideration:**
   - Rather than recomputing the longest substring from scratch after each update, we can limit the recalculation to the affected segments of the string only.

### Time Complexity:

- Initial longest substring calculation: O(n) where n is the length of the string.
- Update handling could be made efficient using segment trees to handle the range updates and queries in O(log n).

### Code Implementation:
```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedDict

class LongestRepeatingSubstring:
    def __init__(self, s: str):
        self.s = list(s)
        self.n = len(s)
        self.ranges = SortedDict()
        self.create_ranges()
    
    def create_ranges(self):
        start = 0
        while start < self.n:
            end = start
            while end < self.n and self.s[end] == self.s[start]:
                end += 1
            self.ranges[start] = (end - start, self.s[start])
            start = end
    
    def update_char(self, index: int, char: str):
        if self.s[index] == char:
            return
        
        self.s[index] = char
        
        left_bound = max(self.ranges.bisect_right(index) - 1, 0)
        start = list(self.ranges.keys())[left_bound]
        
        segments_to_update = []
        
        keys = list(self.ranges.keys())
        i = left_bound
        while i < len(keys) and keys[i] <= index:
            segments_to_update.append(keys[i])
            i += 1
        
        new_bound = min(self.n, end) + 1
        if new_bound < self.n:
            end = keys[i]
            segments_to_update.append(end)
        
        for seg in segments_to_update:
            del self.ranges[seg]
        
        i = start
        while i < self.n:
            end = i
            while end < self.n and self.s[end] == self.s[i]:
                end += 1
            self.ranges[i] = (end - i, self.s[i])
            i = end
    
    def get_longest_substr(self):
        return max(self.ranges.values(), key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
    
    def longest_repeating(self, queryCharacters: list) -> list:
        results = []
        for q in queryCharacters:
            index, char = q
            self.update_char(index, char)
            results.append(self.get_longest_substr())
        return results

# Usage example:
s = "aaabbaaac"
queryCharacters = [(1, 'b'), (7, 'd'), (5, 'd')]
lrs = LongestRepeatingSubstring(s)
result = lrs.longest_repeating(queryCharacters)
print(result)  # Example output: [3, 2, 3]
```

This code initializes a class with the initial string, builds initial segments of repeating characters, handles updates, and recalculates the longest substring of one repeating character efficiently using a `SortedDict` data structure. Each update and query is processed in logarithmic time relative to the number of segments, ensuring the solution is efficient for large inputs.
