title:  Max Pair Sum in an Array-out
permalink: /s2815
---

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, the sum of two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (where `i != j`) is called a **pair sum**. Suppose the maximum pair sum in an array is the largest such sum. 

Return the **maximum pair sum** that can be formed in the array.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]
Output: 13
Explanation: The pair (6, 7) forms the maximum pair sum 13.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: The pair (3, 4) forms the maximum pair sum 7.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - Usually, the array can contain negative numbers, but it would be useful to confirm.
2. What is the minimum and maximum length of the input array `nums`?
   - Confirming boundary conditions such as an array of length 1 would be important.
3. Are there any constraints around space and time complexity?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify the two largest numbers in the array, as their sum would be the maximum pair sum. 

Steps:
1. Sort the array.
2. The two largest numbers will be the last two elements of the sorted array.
3. Sum these two largest numbers and return the result.

### Sorting Approach:

1. **Sort the array** in ascending order.
2. **Identify the two largest numbers**: these would be the last two elements in the sorted list.
3. **Compute their sum** and return it.

**Time Complexity Analysis**:
- Sorting the array will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- Accessing the last two elements and computing their sum is \(O(1)\).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

```python
def max_pair_sum(nums):
    # Sort the array
    nums.sort()
    # The maximum pair sum is the sum of the last two elements
    return nums[-1] + nums[-2]

# Test Cases
print(max_pair_sum([5, 6, 2, 7, 4]))  # Output: 13
print(max_pair_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 7
```

This code will effectively provide the maximum pair sum by first sorting the array and then summing the two largest elements.
