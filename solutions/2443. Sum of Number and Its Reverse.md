title:  Sum of Number and Its Reverse-out
permalink: /s2443
---

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return `true` if there exists a non-negative integer `x` such that `num = x + reverse(x)`, or `false` otherwise.

The reverse of an integer `x` is obtained by reversing the digits of `x`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `num`**: What is the maximum value `num` can take?
    - *Answer*: The problem doesn't specify the upper limit but typically integer inputs could range up to \(10^9\) unless otherwise specified.

2. **Reverse Calculation**: Should we consider leading zeros in the reversed number?
    - *Answer*: No, leading zeros are ignored when computing the reversed number.
    
3. **Method of Reversal**: Do we need to write our own reverse function?
    - *Answer*: Yes, since the reverse operation is a core part of the solution, we should implement it.

### Strategy

1. **Reverse a Number**: Create a helper function to reverse a given non-negative integer.
2. **Check for Validity**: Iterate over possible values of `x` from `0` to `num // 2`.
    - For each `x`, compute its reverse and check if `x + reverse(x) == num`. If such an `x` exists, return `true`.
3. **Return False**: If no such `x` is found after the loop, return `false`.

- **Why `num // 2`?**
    - As `x` and `reverse(x)` both contribute to the sum, examining values up to `num // 2` will suffice. Beyond this, the sum will exceed `num`.

### Time Complexity

- **Reversal Operation**: Reversing a number takes \(O(\log(x))\).
- **Overall Iteration**: The outer loop runs \(O(num / 2)\), leading to a total complexity of \(O(num \cdot \log(num))\).

### Code

```python
def reverse_number(x: int) -> int:
    rev = 0
    while x > 0:
        rev = rev * 10 + x % 10
        x //= 10
    return rev

def sum_of_number_and_reverse(num: int) -> bool:
    for x in range(num // 2 + 1):
        if x + reverse_number(x) == num:
            return True
    return False

# Example usage
print(sum_of_number_and_reverse(443))  # Example case
```

### Explanation

1. **Reverse Function**:
    - `reverse_number(x)`: Takes an integer `x` and returns its reversed value by repeatedly extracting the last digit and building the reversed number.

2. **Sum Check**:
    - Iterate through all values of `x` from `0` to `num // 2`. For each `x`, compute `reverse(x)` and check if `x + reverse(x) == num`.
    - Return `true` if found, otherwise proceed to next `x`.
    - If the loop completes without finding a valid `x`, return `false`.

### Remarks

Ensure to test with edge cases such as the smallest (`num = 0`) and large numbers to verify correctness and performance.
