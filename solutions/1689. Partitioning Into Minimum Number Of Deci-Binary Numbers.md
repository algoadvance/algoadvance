title:  Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers-out
permalink: /s1689
---
You are given a string `n` that represents a positive integer. We call a positive integer deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. We must return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to `n`.

For example, if `n` is "32", you can output 3 since you can have three deci-binary numbers "11", "11", "10" which sum to "32".

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure clarity, here are a few key questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `n`?
   - Are there any non-numeric or invalid characters in the string `n`?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Is the output always an integer representing the minimum number of deci-binary numbers?

By default, I'll assume `n` is a valid string representation of a positive integer.

### Strategy
The key observation here is that a deci-binary number only contains digits 0 or 1. To determine the minimum number of deci-binary numbers required to sum up to `n`, we should consider the largest single digit in `n`.

- Since each deci-binary number can at most contribute '1' to any position in `n`, the largest digit in `n` dictates the number of deci-binary numbers needed. For example:
  - For `n = "32"`, the digit '3' suggests we need at least three deci-binary numbers (e.g., '111', '111', '010') to sum to 3 in the tens place.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity for this solution is `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the string `n`, since we need to iterate through each digit once.

### Code
```python
def minPartitions(n: str) -> int:
    # The minimum number of deci-binary numbers is determined by the maximum digit in n.
    return max(map(int, n))
```

### Explanation
- `map(int, n)`: Converts each character in the string `n` to its integer equivalent.
- `max(...)`: Determines the maximum digit in the list produced by `map(int, n)`.
- Since the maximum digit indicates the number of deci-binary numbers required, this value is returned.

Using this code, we can efficiently determine the minimum number of deci-binary numbers required to sum up to the given number `n`.
