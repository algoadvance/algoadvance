title:  Minimum Number of Visited Cells in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2617
---

You are given a `m` x `n` grid where each cell contains an integer. The integer in cell (i, j) represents the number of cells to the right or down that you can move from that cell.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of cells you need to visit starting from (0, 0) to reach (m-1, n-1). You can only move to cells directly to the right or directly down from your current cell.

You are to return the minimum number of cells you have to visit to move from the top left to the bottom right.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we move both right and down from any cell?**
   - **Yes.**
  
2. **Does the integer in a cell represent the exact number of steps you need to take from that cell?**
   - **Yes.**

3. **Are all cells guaranteed to have non-negative integers?**
   - **Yes, all cells have non-negative integers.**

4. **Is it possible to reach the target, or might there be cases where it's impossible?**
   - **Consider it always possible based on the constraints.**

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We will use BFS to explore the grid since BFS processes nodes level by level, which naturally lends itself to finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
   
2. **Queue Management:**
   - Initialize a queue that will store the current cell and the depth (number of cells visited so far).
   - Use a set to track visited cells to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
   
3. **Directional Vectors:**
   - From each cell, calculate possible cell coordinates that can be reached by moving to the right or down according to the integer value in the current cell.
  
### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import deque

def min_num_visited_cells(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    # Directions: (Row delta, Column delta)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0)]
    
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 1)])  # (row, col, steps)
    visited = set((0, 0))
    
    while queue:
        row, col, steps = queue.popleft()

        # Check if we've reached the bottom-right cell
        if row == m - 1 and col == n - 1:
            return steps
        
        # Explore the neighboring cells
        for dr, dc in directions:
            for step in range(1, grid[row][col] + 1):
                new_row, new_col = row + dr * step, col + dc * step
                if 0 <= new_row < m and 0 <= new_col < n and (new_row, new_col) not in visited:
                    visited.add((new_row, new_col))
                    queue.append((new_row, new_col, steps + 1))
    
    return -1  # This line should never be reached based on the problem constraints

# Example usage:
# grid = [
#   [1, 2, 3],
#   [2, 2, 1],
#   [1, 1, 1]
# ]
# print(min_num_visited_cells(grid))  # Output: expected minimum steps
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:** 
   - In the worst case, each cell is processed once, and for each cell, each possible move (up to `grid[row][col]` steps right or down) is considered: `O(m * n * k)`, where `k` is the maximum value in any cell. 
   - Typically, `k` is considered bounded and part of grid dimensions, so this is often simplified to `O(m * n * (k))`.
   
2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space used by the queue can grow up to `O(m * n)`, and the space used by the visited set is `O(m * n)`.
   - Therefore, the space complexity is typically `O(m * n)`.

This solution effectively explores the grid to find the shortest path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
