title:  Most Frequent IDs-out
permalink: /s3092
---

You are given an array of integers `arr`, where each integer represents a student ID. Your task is to return an array of the most frequently occurring IDs. If there are ties (i.e., multiple IDs with the same highest frequency), return all of them in any order.

For instance:

```python
most_frequent([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])  # Should return [3]
most_frequent([1, 1, 2, 2, 3])  # Should return [1, 2]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the input array?
   - What is the range of possible values for the IDs?
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If multiple IDs have the same frequency, is the order of the output significant?
   - Can the input array be empty?

## Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Use a hash map (dictionary) to count the frequency of each ID in the array.
2. **Identify Max Frequency:**
   - Iterate through the dictionary to determine the maximum frequency.
3. **Collect IDs with Max Frequency:**
   - Gather all IDs that have the maximum frequency into a result list.
4. **Return Result:**
   - Return the result list.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def most_frequent(arr):
    if not arr:
        return []

    # Count frequency of each ID
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the highest frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    
    # Collect all IDs that have the maximum frequency
    result = [id for id, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]
    
    return result

# Examples
print(most_frequent([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]))  # Output: [3]
print(most_frequent([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2]
print(most_frequent([]))  # Output: []
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - The `Counter` from the `collections` module counts frequencies in \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array.

2. **Finding the Maximum Frequency:**
   - Finding the maximum value from the dictionary values is \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of unique IDs.

3. **Collecting IDs with Max Frequency:**
   - Iterating through the dictionary to collect keys with the maximum frequency is \(O(m)\).

Overall, the dominant factor is the time to count the frequencies, leading to a total time complexity of \(O(n)\).
