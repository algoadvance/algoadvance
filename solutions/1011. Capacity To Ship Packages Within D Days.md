title:  Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days-out
permalink: /s1011
---
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `D` days. The weights of the packages are given as an array `weights` and each package must be shipped in the order given. Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages being shipped within `D` days.

### Example
```python
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the weights of the packages guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   Yes, they are non-negative integers.

2. **Can a package be partially shipped on multiple days?**
   No, each package must be shipped in complete on the day it is chosen.

3. **Is it guaranteed that a solution exists for the given input?**
   Yes, it is guaranteed that a solution exists.

4. **Can the order of the weights be modified?**
   No, the weight order must be maintained.

### Strategy
The problem can be solved using a binary search approach, where we determine the minimum and maximum possible weights to explore potential ship capacities. 

1. **Initial Boundaries**: 
   - The minimum possible ship weight (`left`) is the maximum weight in the `weights` array. This is because the ship must be able to carry the heaviest package.
   - The maximum possible ship weight (`right`) is the sum of all weights, assuming we ship everything in a single day.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We use binary search to find the smallest possible weight capacity `mid`.
   - For each `mid`, we check if it's possible to ship all packages within `D` days by simulating the shipping process. If it's possible, we try for a smaller `mid`. Otherwise, we increase `mid`.
  
3. **Simulation**:
   - We iterate through the weights and keep track of the current load of the ship for a given day.
   - Once the current load exceeds `mid`, increment the day count and reset current load.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity for binary search is `O(log N)`, where `N` is the range from `max(weights)` to `sum(weights)`.
- The simulation of shipping days is `O(K)`, where `K` is the number of weights.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(K log N)`.

### Code
```python
def shipWithinDays(weights, D):
    def canShip(capacity):
        days = 1
        total_weight = 0
        for weight in weights:
            total_weight += weight
            if total_weight > capacity:
                days += 1
                total_weight = weight
                if days > D:
                    return False
        return True
    
    left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canShip(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left

# Example Usage
weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
D = 5
print(shipWithinDays(weights, D))  # Output: 15
```

In this code:
- We define a helper function `canShip` to check if a given capacity can ship all packages within `D` days.
- The main function `shipWithinDays` implements the binary search to find the minimum ship capacity.
