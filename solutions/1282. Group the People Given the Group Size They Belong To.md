title:  Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To-out
permalink: /s1282
---

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the group size for the `i-th` person. Return a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`.

Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group aligned with their group size.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always valid?**
   - Yes, the input will be such that itâ€™s always possible to form the required groups.

2. **What are the constraints for the groupSizes?**
   - 1 <= groupSizes.length <= 500
   - 1 <= groupSizes[i] <= groupSizes.length

3. **Can the input array contain duplicate group sizes?**
   - Yes, multiple people can have the same group size, and they should be grouped accordingly.

4. **Do the groups need to be in any particular order?**
   - No, the order of the groups and the order of people within the groups does not matter.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to keep track of people with the same group size.
2. **Group the people** by iterating over `groupSizes` and adding each person to the corresponding group in the dictionary.
3. **Form the final groups**:
   - Iterate over the dictionary.
   - Break down each list of people into sublists where each sublist's length is equal to the group size.
4. **Return the list of all groups** formed.

### Code

```python
def groupThePeople(groupSizes):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Dictionary to keep people of the same group size together
    size_to_people = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Populate the dictionary
    for person, size in enumerate(groupSizes):
        size_to_people[size].append(person)
    
    result = []
    
    # Form the groups
    for size, people in size_to_people.items():
        for i in range(0, len(people), size):
            result.append(people[i:i + size])
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of people since we loop through the list a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` to store the intermediate groupings in the dictionary and the resultant list of groups.

This solution should efficiently handle the constraints provided.
