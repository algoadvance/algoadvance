title:  Sliding Subarray Beauty-out
permalink: /s2653
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` and two integers `k` and `x`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. A subarray's beauty is the `x`-th smallest integer in that subarray. By default, negative beauty in any subarray is considered to be `0`.

You need to compute the beauty of every sliding subarray of size `k`.

Return an array of the beauty values for each subarray of size `k` in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in the array `nums` positive, negative, or both?**
   - The integers can be both positive and negative.

2. **What should be the length of the output array?**
   - The output array should be of length `len(nums) - k + 1`.

3. **If `x`-th smallest element results in an index out of range or doesn't exist, what should we assume?**
   - We assume all valid indices, since the problem states `x`-th smallest in the subarray.

4. **Should we consider subarrays if they are smaller than length `k`?**
   - No, only subarrays exactly of length `k` should be considered.

### Strategy

1. Use a sliding window of size `k` to traverse the array `nums`.
2. In each iteration, get the subarray of the current window.
3. Determine the `x`-th smallest integer in this subarray.
4. If this `x`-th smallest integer is negative, calculate its beauty, otherwise set the beauty to `0`.
5. Add the calculated beauty to the result list.
6. Continue this process until all subarrays of size `k` are considered.

### Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def sliding_subarray_beauty(nums, k, x):
    def get_xth_smallest(sorted_list, x):
        # Since x is 1-indexed and SortedList is 0-indexed
        return sorted_list[x - 1] if x - 1 < len(sorted_list) else None
    
    result = []
    window = SortedList()
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Add the new element to the window
        window.add(nums[i])
        
        # Remove the element that's sliding out of the window
        if i >= k:
            window.remove(nums[i - k])
        
        # If we have a full window, add the beauty of the subarray to the result
        if i >= k - 1:
            xth_smallest = get_xth_smallest(window, x)
            if xth_smallest is not None and xth_smallest < 0:
                result.append(xth_smallest)
            else:
                result.append(0)
    
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4, 5]
k = 2
x = 1
print(sliding_subarray_beauty(nums, k, x))  # Expected output: [-1, -2, -3, -4]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Sorted List construction**: O(k log k) for the first subarray of length `k`.
- **Sliding the window**: O(log k) for insertion and O(log k) for deletion per element.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(n log k), where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the size of the window.

The logarithmic factor comes from maintaining the sliding window in a sorted state using `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` module.
