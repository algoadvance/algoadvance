title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous-out

The problem "Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous" requires us to transform an integer array `nums` into a continuous array with the minimum number of operations. An array is continuous if and only if there are no duplicate elements, and the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is equal to the length of the array minus one.

The allowed operation is:
- Pick any element from the array and replace it with any integer value.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array `nums` continuous.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [4,2,5,3]`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: `nums` is already continuous.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Duplicates:** Are there any initial restrictions on the occurrence of duplicates in the given array `nums`?
2. **Array Size:** What is the range of the size of the array `nums`?
3. **Element Range:** What is the range of the elements in the array `nums`?

## Strategy
1. **Eliminate Duplicates:** First, convert the array into a set to eliminate any duplicates, since a continuous array cannot have duplicate elements.
2. **Sort the Elements:** Convert the set back to a sorted list.
3. **Sliding Window:** Utilize a sliding window approach to find the longest subarray which can be made into a continuous array. Count elements within the range `[x, x + n - 1]` where `x` is any element within the sorted list and `n` is the length of the array after removing duplicates.
4. **Operations Calculation:** The minimum number of operations will be the total elements minus the length of the longest continuous subarray found.

This ensures we discover the minimum operations needed effectively by checking the feasibility of converting segments of the list into a continuous range.

## Code
```python
def minOperations(nums):
    # Remove duplicates and sort the array
    nums = sorted(set(nums))
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Initialize the two-pointer basis sliding window
    maxLen = 0
    j = 0
    
    # Sliding window to find the longest subarray that can be continuous
    for i in range(n):
        while j < n and nums[j] <= nums[i] + n - 1:
            j += 1
        # Calculate the length of the subarray
        maxLen = max(maxLen, j - i)
    
    # The minimum number of operations required
    return len(nums) - maxLen

# Example Usage:
print(minOperations([4,2,5,3])) # Output: 0
print(minOperations([1,2,2,2,5,6])) # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- **Removing Duplicates and Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the original array `nums`.
- **Sliding Window Execution:** `O(n)` time complexity, as each element is considered only once in the duration of the pointers' movement.
  
Overall, the algorithm runs in `O(n log n)` time due to the sorting step.
