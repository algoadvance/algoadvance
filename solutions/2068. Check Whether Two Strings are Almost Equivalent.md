title:  Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent-out
permalink: /s2068
---

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, they are considered almost equivalent if the following condition is satisfied:

For every character `ch` in the set of characters of `word1` âˆª `word2`, the absolute difference between the number of occurrences of `ch` in `word1` and `word2` is at most `3`.

Return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are almost equivalent, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
   - Yes, characters should be considered case-sensitive.
2. What is the allowed length for `word1` and `word2`?
   - The lengths of `word1` and `word2` are not specified, but usual constraints for string problems like this on LeetCode fall within a manageable range for algorithms needing O(n) time complexity.

## Strategy

1. Create a frequency counter for each string using Python's `collections.Counter`.
2. For each character in the union of the sets of characters from both strings, compute the absolute difference in their counts from `word1` and `word2`.
3. If any character's count difference exceeds `3`, return `false`.
4. If all differences are within the acceptable range, return `true`.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def checkAlmostEquivalent(word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
    # Count character frequencies for both words
    counter1 = Counter(word1)
    counter2 = Counter(word2)
    
    # Get the union of keys from both counters
    all_chars = set(counter1.keys()).union(set(counter2.keys()))
    
    # Check the absolute difference for each character
    for ch in all_chars:
        if abs(counter1.get(ch, 0) - counter2.get(ch, 0)) > 3:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage
word1 = "acbdeab"
word2 = "abcdedcbf"
print(checkAlmostEquivalent(word1, word2))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- Counting the frequency of each character in both strings: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`.
- Constructing the union set of characters: O(u), where `u` is the total number of unique characters from both strings combined. However, u is at most 26 for lowercase letters in the Latin alphabet.
- Iterating over the set of unique characters to check differences: O(u).
- Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n + m).

## Space Complexity

- We use two `Counter` objects to store the frequency of each character in `word1` and `word2`, which will each require space proportional to the number of unique characters, resulting in a space complexity of O(u).
