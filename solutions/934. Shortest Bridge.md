title:  Shortest Bridge-out
permalink: /s934
---
In this problem, you are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. There are exactly two islands in the grid (each island is formed by connected `1`s horizontally or vertically and there are no tunnels between islands).

You need to find the shortest bridge (the number of `0`s that must be flipped to `1`s) to connect the two islands.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the value range for `n`? 
      - `n` ranges from 2 to 100.
    - Will there always be exactly two islands?
      - Yes.
    - Is each island guaranteed to be connected horizontally or vertically without disjoint parts?
      - Yes.

### Strategy
1. **Identify the Two Islands:**
    - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find and differentiate between the two islands in the binary matrix.
      
2. **Breadth-First Search for Shortest Path:**
    - From one of the islands, perform BFS to find the shortest path to any part of the second island. 
    - During this BFS process, keep counting the distance (number of `0`s being flipped).

### Steps to Implement
1. Traverse the grid to find the first island and mark all its cells.
2. Push all the cells from the first island into a queue.
3. Perform BFS from the cells in the queue, looking for the shortest path to reach the second island.

Here is the Python code implementation:

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

def shortestBridge(grid):
    def dfs(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x >= n or y < 0 or y >= n or grid[x][y] != 1:
            return
        grid[x][y] = -1  # mark the cell to identify the first island
        island.append((x, y))
        for dx, dy in directions:
            dfs(x + dx, y + dy)

    def bfs():
        steps = 0
        while queue:
            # Process all nodes at the current level
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                x, y = queue.popleft()
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:
                        if grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                            return steps  # Found the second island
                        if grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                            grid[nx][ny] = -1
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
            steps += 1
        return -1

    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    island = []

    # Step 1: Find and mark the first island with DFS
    found = False
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                dfs(i, j)
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break

    # Step 2: Perform BFS from the boundary of the first island
    queue = deque(island)
    return bfs()

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [0,1,0],
    [0,0,0],
    [0,0,1]
]
print(shortestBridge(grid))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **DFS Traversal:** O(n^2), as we may visit all cells to identify the first island.
- **BFS Traversal:** O(n^2), in the worst case, we may have to look at all cells to find the shortest path.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^2)

### Space Complexity
- **Extra Space for Queue and Island list:** O(n^2) in the worst case, where all cells are used.
  
This solution efficiently uses DFS to locate the island and BFS to compute the shortest path for connecting the two islands.
