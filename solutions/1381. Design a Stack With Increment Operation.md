title:  Design a Stack With Increment Operation-out
permalink: /s1381
---
Design a stack which supports the following operations:

* `push(x)`: Push element `x` onto the stack.
* `pop()`: Remove the element on the top of the stack and return it. If the stack is empty, return -1.
* `inc(k, val)`: Increment the bottom `k` elements of the stack by `val`. If there are less than `k` elements in the stack, increment all the elements.

Implement the `CustomStack` class:
* `CustomStack(int maxSize)`: Initializes the object with `maxSize` which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
* `void push(int x)`: adds `x` to the stack if the stack hasn't reached the `maxSize`.
* `int pop()`: pops and returns the top of the stack or `-1` if the stack is empty.
* `void inc(int k, int val)`: increments the bottom `k` elements of the stack by `val`. If there are less than `k` elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the stack contain negative integers?
   - Yes, the stack can contain negative, zero, and positive integers.
2. What should happen if we attempt to `push` into a stack that has already reached its maximum size?
   - The `push` operation should be ignored if the stack is at its maximum size.
3. What is the range of values for `maxSize`, `x`, `k`, and `val`?
   - `maxSize` will be a positive integer, `x` and `val` can be any integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Use a list to store stack elements and maintain a `maxSize` to limit stack expansion.
2. **Push Operation**: Append the element to the list if the current size is less than `maxSize`.
3. **Pop Operation**: Return the last element of the list if it's not empty, and remove it from the list. If the list is empty, return -1.
4. **Increment Operation**: Iterate over the first `min(k, current stack size)` elements and increment each by `val`.

## Code
```python
class CustomStack:
    def __init__(self, maxSize: int):
        self.stack = []
        self.maxSize = maxSize
        
    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        if len(self.stack) < self.maxSize:
            self.stack.append(x)
        
    def pop(self) -> int:
        if self.stack:
            return self.stack.pop()
        else:
            return -1
    
    def inc(self, k: int, val: int) -> None:
        limit = min(k, len(self.stack))
        for i in range(limit):
            self.stack[i] += val
```

## Explanation
1. **Constructor**: Initialize an empty list `stack` and set the `maxSize` property.
2. **Push Operation**: Check if the stack has not reached its maximum size before appending the new element.
3. **Pop Operation**: If the stack is non-empty, remove and return the top element; otherwise return `-1`.
4. **Increment Operation**: Determine how many of the bottom elements need to be incremented (the smaller of `k` and the current stack size), then increment each of those elements.

## Time Complexity
1. **Push Operation**: \(O(1)\) - Constant time complexity for appending an element.
2. **Pop Operation**: \(O(1)\) - Constant time complexity for popping an element.
3. **Increment Operation**: \(O(k)\) - Linear time complexity relative to `k`, although the effective complexity is bounded by the stack's current size if `k` exceeds it.

This design ensures efficient operations for the given stack functionalities.
