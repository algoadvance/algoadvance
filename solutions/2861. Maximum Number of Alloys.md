title:  Maximum Number of Alloys-out
permalink: /s2861
---

You are given an integer `n`, which represents the number of different types of metals. Additionally, you have access to `k` different machines, each of which can create a specific type of metal.

The raw materials are given by an `n x 1` vector `rawMaterials`. Each element of this vector indicates the amount of raw material available for that type.

You are also given a nested list `machines` of size `k x n`. Each `i`-th list within `machines` tells you the raw material requirements per unit of metal produced by the `i`-th machine.

Your task is to find the maximum number of alloys you can produce given the raw materials and the machines available.

### Input:
- `n`: An integer representing the number of different types of metals.
- `k`: An integer representing the number of different machines available.
- `rawMaterials`: A list of integers of size `n`, where each element represents the available amount of a specific raw material.
- `machines`: A list of lists of integers of size `k x n`, where each inner list represents the raw material requirements per unit of metal produced by a respective machine.

### Output:
- Return the maximum number of alloys that can be produced.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the values in the `rawMaterials` and `machines` lists be negative?**
   - No, all values will be non-negative integers as raw material quantities can't be negative.

2. **Should we consider any specific constraints regarding the values of `n` and `k`?**
   - The constraints align with typical competitive programming limits and are well-defined.

3. **Is the objective to maximize the number of alloys produced by any single machine or across all machines collectively?**
   - The objective is to maximize the number of alloys produced by any single machine.

## Strategy

1. **Understand Resource Constraints:**
   - Each machine has specific raw material requirements.
   - Determine how many units of metal each machine can produce given the available raw materials.

2. **Calculate Production Capacity:**
   - For each machine, calculate the maximum number of units that can be produced using available raw materials.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Iterate over each machine and keep track of the maximum number of alloys that can be produced.

## Code

```python
def maxNumberOfAlloys(n, k, rawMaterials, machines):
    # Initialize the maximum number of alloys to zero
    max_alloys = 0

    # Iterate over each machine
    for machine in machines:
        min_alloys_from_machine = float('inf')  # Start with a high number (infinity)

        # Calculate the maximum number of alloys this machine can produce
        for i in range(n):
            if machine[i] == 0:
                continue  # If the machine doesn't need this material, skip
            
            min_alloys_from_machine = min(min_alloys_from_machine, rawMaterials[i] // machine[i])

        # Update the maximum number of alloys if this machine can produce more
        max_alloys = max(max_alloys, min_alloys_from_machine)

    return max_alloys

# Example usage:
n = 3
k = 2
rawMaterials = [10, 15, 20]
machines = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [2, 1, 2]
]

print(maxNumberOfAlloys(n, k, rawMaterials, machines))  # Output is the maximum number of alloys that can be produced
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(k \cdot n)\), where `k` is the number of machines and `n` is the number of types of raw materials. This is because we are iterating over each machine and for each machine, we iterate over all the types of raw materials to calculate the production capacity.
