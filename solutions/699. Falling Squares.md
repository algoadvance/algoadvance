### Problem Statement:

You are given a list of `positions`. Each element in `positions` is a pair `positions[i] = [left, side_length]`, where `left` represents the x coordinate of the left edge of the square and `side_length` represents the side length of the square.

Each square drops from above onto a certain position on the number line. The squares do not rebound after hitting the ground or the top of another square. Instead, they just sit on top of the highest point they intersect with below them.

Write a program to return a list of heights after each square falls. The height of each square is the y-coordinate of its top side after it has landed.

### Example:

Input: `positions = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]]`

Output: `[2, 5, 5]`

Explanation:

1. After the first square drops, it is positioned at `(1, 0)` and has a side length of `2`. Thus, its height is `2`.
2. After the second square drops, it intersects with the first square and stacks on it. Hence its height becomes `5`.
3. The third square drops independently at position `6` and has a height of `1`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: Can two squares overlap partially?
   **A**: Yes, if a new square falls such that it overlaps with an existing square partially, the new square will sit on the highest point it touches.

2. **Q**: Are the positions in the input list sorted by the `left` coordinate?
   **A**: We cannot assume that, so we should handle cases where they aren't sorted.

3. **Q**: Can the input array be empty?
   **A**: No, we can assume the input positions will contain at least one element.

4. **Q**: Are side lengths and coordinates guaranteed to be positive integers?
   **A**: Yes, both side_length and left are positive integers.

### Strategy:

1. **Tracking Height**: We need to track the height of the tallest point at each segment on the number line. We can use a list of tuples to keep track of the segments and their heights.
2. **Iterate Through Positions**: For each square, determine the range `[left, left + side_length - 1]` it covers.
3. **Find Maximum Height**: Check overlapping intervals to find the maximum height at the starting position of the current square, then add the side_length of the current square to this height.
4. **Update Intervals**: Update the intervals with the new square's position and its computed height.
5. **Track Maximum Heights**: Keep track of the maximum height after placing each square to formulate the result.

### Code Solution:

```python
def fallingSquares(positions):
    intervals = []  # To store existing squares as (start, end, height) tuples
    heights = []  # Resulting heights after each square falls

    max_height = 0

    for left, side in positions:
        current_left = left
        current_right = left + side - 1
        base_height = 0

        # Determine the highest base we can place this square on
        for start, end, height in intervals:
            if not (current_right < start or current_left > end):
                base_height = max(base_height, height)

        # Place the current square
        current_height = base_height + side
        max_height = max(max_height, current_height)
        heights.append(max_height)

        # Update intervals
        new_interval = (current_left, current_right, current_height)
        intervals.append(new_interval)

    return heights

# Example usage
positions = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]]
print(fallingSquares(positions))  # Output: [2, 5, 5]
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Worst Case**: O(n^2), where `n` is the number of squares. This is due to the nested loops: for each square, we iterate through the intervals to determine the highest base.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing intervals and heights for each square.

This should cover the problem comprehensively! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
