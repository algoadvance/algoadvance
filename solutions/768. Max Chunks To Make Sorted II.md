title:  Max Chunks To Make Sorted II-out
permalink: /s768
---

You are given an integer array `arr`. We split `arr` into some number of chunks (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return the maximum number of chunks we can split the array into.

Example:
```
Input: arr = [2,1,3,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can split into two chunks, such as [2, 1], [3], [4, 4]. One possible way to resplit and sort the concatenated array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 4].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Order Filtering**: Does the sorting of individual chunks preserve the relative order of equal elements?
   - Yes, the relative order should preserve so that concatenating results in the sorted array.

2. **Array Characteristics**: Is there any constraint on the values in the array?
   - No specific constraints mentioned other than being integers. The values can be positive or negative.

3. **Chunk Size**: Are we looking for the maximum number of chunks such that sorting each individually and then concatenating forms the sorted array?
   - Correct.

### Strategy

To achieve the maximum number of chunks:
1. Traverse through the array while maintaining two critical lists:
   - `max_from_left` where `max_from_left[i]` stores the maximum value from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - `min_from_right` where `min_from_right[i]` stores the minimum value from index `i` to the end of the array.

2. Use these lists to determine if a chunk can be formed. Specifically, a chunk can end at index `i` if the maximum value from the left of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value from the right starting from `i + 1`.

### Code

```python
def maxChunksToSorted(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_from_left = [0] * n
    min_from_right = [0] * n
    
    # Populate max_from_left
    max_from_left[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_from_left[i] = max(max_from_left[i - 1], arr[i])
    
    # Populate min_from_right
    min_from_right[-1] = arr[-1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        min_from_right[i] = min(min_from_right[i + 1], arr[i])
    
    # Determine the number of chunks
    chunks = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if max_from_left[i] <= min_from_right[i + 1]:
            chunks += 1
    
    # Add the last chunk
    return chunks + 1

# Example usage
arr = [2, 1, 3, 4, 4]
print(maxChunksToSorted(arr))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The algorithm involves three linear scans of the array:
  1. Constructing `max_from_left` which takes O(n).
  2. Constructing `min_from_right` which also takes O(n).
  3. Determining the number of chunks which takes another O(n).

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n).

By following this strategy, we can efficiently find the maximum number of chunks into which the array can be split to ensure that sorting each chunk individually and concatenating results in the sorted array.
