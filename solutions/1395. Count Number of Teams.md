title:  Count Number of Teams-out

You are given an array `rating` of `n` integers, where `rating[i]` represents the rating of the `i`-th soldier. You are tasked with forming teams of 3 soldiers, where the ratings of the soldiers in each team are in strict increasing or strictly decreasing order. Formally, a team `(rating[i], rating[j], rating[k])` is valid if either:

- `rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]` or
- `rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]`.

Return the number of teams you can form under these conditions.

### Example
```
Input: rating = [2,5,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can form three teams given the conditions: (2,3,4), (5,4,1), and (2,5,1).
```

### Constraints
- `n == rating.length`
- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `1 <= rating[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in `rating` array be negative?
   - No, as per constraints, the elements will be between 1 and 10^5.
2. Can a soldier be part of multiple teams?
   - Yes, a soldier can be part of multiple teams as long as the conditions are met.

## Strategy

Given the constraints, we can use a brute force solution to check all possible teams of three soldiers. However, with `n` being at most 200, this approach will not be efficient enough. Therefore, a more efficient approach is needed.

### Optimized Approach

To solve this problem, consider the following steps:

1. For each soldier considered as the middle soldier (`rating[j]`), count the number of soldiers before (`rating[i]`) and after (`rating[k]`) who can form valid teams.
   
2. We count how many ratings before `j` are less than or greater than `rating[j]`.
   - `less_left[j]`: number of soldiers with rating less than `rating[j]` to the left of `j`.
   - `greater_left[j]`: number of soldiers with rating greater than `rating[j]` to the left of `j`.

3. Similarly, count ratings after `j` that are less than or greater than `rating[j]`.
   - `less_right[j]`: number of soldiers with rating less than `rating[j]` to the right of `j`.
   - `greater_right[j]`: number of soldiers with rating greater than `rating[j]` to the right of `j`.

4. For each `rating[j]`, the number of valid teams can be calculated using:
   - Teams in increasing order: `less_left[j] * greater_right[j]`
   - Teams in decreasing order: `greater_left[j] * less_right[j]`

5. Sum all the valid teams' counts.

### Code

```python
def numTeams(rating):
    n = len(rating)
    less_left = [0] * n
    greater_left = [0] * n
    less_right = [0] * n
    greater_right = [0] * n
    
    # Fill less_left and greater_left
    for j in range(n):
        for i in range(j):
            if rating[i] < rating[j]:
                less_left[j] += 1
            elif rating[i] > rating[j]:
                greater_left[j] += 1
                
    # Fill less_right and greater_right
    for j in range(n):
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
            if rating[k] < rating[j]:
                less_right[j] += 1
            elif rating[k] > rating[j]:
                greater_right[j] += 1
                
    total_teams = 0
    # Calculate teams for each j
    for j in range(n):
        total_teams += less_left[j] * greater_right[j]  # increasing order
        total_teams += greater_left[j] * less_right[j]  # decreasing order
        
    return total_teams

# Example usage
rating = [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]
print(numTeams(rating))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- Filling up `less_left` and `greater_left` arrays: \(O(n^2)\)
- Filling up `less_right` and `greater_right` arrays: \(O(n^2)\)
- Calculating the total number of teams: \(O(n)\)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\). Given the constraints `n <= 200`, this complexity is acceptable.
