title:  Modify Graph Edge Weights-out
permalink: /s2699
---

You are given a connected undirected graph with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1` and `m` edges represented by a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` with weight `wi`.

You are also given three integers `source`, `destination`, and `target` representing the start and end nodes of a path and the desired weight of this path, respectively.

Modify the weights of the edges to exactly match the total weight `target` of the path from `source` to `destination`. You can increase or decrease the weights as needed. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them. If no modification can achieve this, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What should be returned if there are multiple solutions?**
   - Any one possible solution can be returned.
2. **Can the weights be negative?**
   - If no conditions forbid negative weights, weights can be adjusted either way.
3. **What if the edges are not unique or the graph has cycles?**
   - The graph is a connected undirected graph, each edge can only appear once but nodes can appear multiple times.

### Strategy:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list for better DFS/BFS traversal.
2. **Find a Path**: Use DFS or BFS to find any path from `source` to `destination`.
3. **Calculate Current Path Weight**: Calculate the total path weight for the found path.
4. **Adjust Weights**: If the current path weight differs from the target, adjust the weights of the edges in the path accordingly.
5. **Validation**: Ensure any weight adjustments do not lead to weights becoming infeasible (e.g., negative weights if not allowed).
6. **Return the Modified Edges**: Return the modified `edges` array as needed.

### Code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def modifyGraphEdges(n, edges, source, destination, target):
    # Create an adjacency list for the graph
    adjacency_list = defaultdict(list)
    edge_map = {}
    for index, (u, v, w) in enumerate(edges):
        adjacency_list[u].append((v, index))
        adjacency_list[v].append((u, index))
        edge_map[(u, v)] = index
        edge_map[(v, u)] = index

    # Use BFS to find any path from source to destination
    path = []
    def dfs(node, target, visited):
        if node == target:
            return True
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor, idx in adjacency_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if dfs(neighbor, target, visited):
                    path.append((node, neighbor, idx))
                    return True
        return False

    visited = set()
    dfs(source, destination, visited)

    # If no path is found, return an empty array
    if not path:
        return []

    # Calculate current weight of the path
    current_weight = sum(edges[idx][2] for _, _, idx in path)

    # Calculate the difference needed to reach the target weight
    weight_diff = target - current_weight

    # Adjust the weights of the edges in the path
    if weight_diff == 0:
        return edges
    
    # We assume we're allowed to distribute the diff across edges:
    increment_per_edge = weight_diff // len(path)
    remainder = weight_diff % len(path)

    for i, (_, _, idx) in enumerate(path):
        edges[idx][2] += increment_per_edge
        if i < remainder:
            edges[idx][2] += 1  # Distribute the remainder
    
    return edges
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Graph Representation**: `O(m)` - where `m` is the number of edges.
- **Finding Path (DFS)**: `O(n + m)`.
- **Adjusting Weights**: `O(k)` - where `k` is the length of the path found.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`.
