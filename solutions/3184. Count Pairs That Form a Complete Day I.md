title:  Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day I-out
permalink: /s3184
---

You are given two arrays `time1` and `time2` both of length `n`. Each `time1[i]` and `time2[i]` represent times in the format `HH:MM` (24-hour clock) respectively. A pair (i, j) is said to form a complete day if `time1[i] + time2[j] = 24:00`. Your task is to count how many pairs (i, j) form a complete day.

```
Example 1:
Input: time1 = ["12:00", "18:00", "06:30"], time2 = ["12:00", "06:00", "17:30"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Pair (0, 0) => "12:00" + "12:00" = "24:00"
Pair (1, 1) => "18:00" + "06:00" = "24:00"

Example 2:
Input: time1 = ["14:30"], time2 = ["09:00"]
Output: 0
Explanation: No pair adds up to form a complete day.
```

## Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the implementation, let's clarify a few things:
1. Are there any constraints on the inputs such as the maximum length of the arrays `time1` and `time2`, and the format of the time strings?
2. Can we assume that the input times are always valid and formatted correctly?
   
## Strategy

1. **Convert Time to Minutes:** Convert the times in `time1` and `time2` from HH:MM format to the number of minutes past midnight. This simplifies the addition and comparison process.
2. **Target Minutes Calculation:** The target time in minutes for a complete day is `24:00`, which equals `1440` minutes.
3. **Count Complements Using a Hash Map:** Use a hash map to store the count of times (in minutes) from `time2` and check for each time in `time1` if its complement exists in the hash map.

## Time Complexity
- **Conversion to minutes:** O(n) where n is the length of the arrays.
- **Counting pairs:** O(n) because we only traverse both arrays once.
 
The overall time complexity is O(n).

## Code

```python
def convert_time_to_minutes(time):
    hours, minutes = map(int, time.split(':'))
    return hours * 60 + minutes

def count_pairs(time1, time2):
    target_minutes = 24 * 60  # 1440 minutes for a complete day
    
    # Convert all times to minutes
    time1_minutes = [convert_time_to_minutes(time) for time in time1]
    time2_minutes = [convert_time_to_minutes(time) for time in time2]
    
    # Create a frequency map for times in time2
    time2_count = {}
    for t in time2_minutes:
        if t not in time2_count:
            time2_count[t] = 0
        time2_count[t] += 1
    
    # Count valid pairs
    count = 0
    for t1 in time1_minutes:
        complement = target_minutes - t1
        if complement in time2_count:
            count += time2_count[complement]

    return count

# Example usage
time1 = ["12:00", "18:00", "06:30"]
time2 = ["12:00", "06:00", "17:30"]
print(count_pairs(time1, time2))  # Output: 2
```

This code converts times to minutes after midnight, counts pairs that sum to `24:00`, and uses a hash map to efficiently track and count complements. This ensures that the solution is both clear and efficient.
