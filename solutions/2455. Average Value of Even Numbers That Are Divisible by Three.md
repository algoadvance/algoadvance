title:  Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three-out
permalink: /s2455
---
You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to return the average value of the even numbers that are divisible by three. If there are no such numbers, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length of the input array? 
    - What are the possible values in the input array?
    - Can the array contain negative numbers?

2. **Output Specifics**:
    - Should the average be an integer or a float?

For the sake of this solution, I will assume:
- The length of the input array can vary, and can go up to 10^4.
- The values in the input array range between -10^4 and 10^4.
- The array can contain negative numbers.
- The average should be a float.

### Strategy
1. Iterate through each number in the array.
2. Check if the number is even and divisible by 3.
3. Collect these numbers into a list.
4. Calculate the average of the collected numbers.
5. If the list is empty, return 0.
6. Otherwise, return the average as a float.

### Time Complexity
The algorithm consists of a single pass through the array to filter valid numbers and another step to compute the average. The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input array.

### Code

```python
def averageValueOfEvenNumbersDivisibleByThree(nums):
    # Filter even numbers that are also divisible by three
    valid_nums = [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0 and num % 3 == 0]
    
    # If there are no valid numbers, return 0
    if not valid_nums:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate the average of the valid numbers
    average = sum(valid_nums) / len(valid_nums)
    return average

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]
print(averageValueOfEvenNumbersDivisibleByThree(nums))  # Output: 12.0
```

### Explanation
1. **Filtering**:
    - `num % 2 == 0` ensures the number is even.
    - `num % 3 == 0` ensures the even number is also divisible by 3.
2. **Computing the Average**:
    - If `valid_nums` is empty, return `0.0`.
    - Otherwise, compute the average using `sum(valid_nums) / len(valid_nums)` and return the result.

This approach ensures the solution is efficient and simple.
