title:  The Score of Students Solving Math Expression-out
permalink: /s2019
---

You are given a string `s` that contains a mathematical expression with only digits and the `+`, `*` operations with no parentheses, and an integer array `answers` that contains possible answers you need to score. You should return the total score of all students.

- Students can make at most one mistake in their calculation.
- A student gets 5 points if they answer the correct result, and 2 points if the answer is result of *one* wrong multiplication or addition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - `s`: A string representing a mathematical expression composed of digits and the characters `+`, `*`.
   - `answers`: An array of integers representing various answers provided by students.

2. **Output Format:**
   - An integer representing the total score of all students.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The length of `s` is â‰¤ 31.
   - `s` contains only digits and characters `+`, `*`.
   - Each digit within `s` is a single digit between 0 and 9.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single digit expressions like `s = "5"`.
   - No students answers provided, i.e., `answers = []`.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Correct Answer:**
   - Use a stack-based evaluation for handling `+` and `*` operations.

2. **Generate Possible Mistakes:**
   - By changing the order of operations, generate all other possible values that can be achieved with one mistake:
     - Add all possible re-groupings with one misplaced parenthesis in the expression.

3. **Scoring:**
   - Go through each student's answer and determine the score based on the correct and possible incorrect answers.

### Code

```python
from typing import List, Set

def calculate(expression: str) -> int:
    """ Helper function to evaluate the final expression result correctly. """

    terms = expression.split('+')
    sum_result = 0
    for term in terms:
        factors = term.split('*')
        product = 1
        for factor in factors:
            product *= int(factor)
        sum_result += product
    
    return sum_result

def get_possible_expressions(expression: str) -> Set[int]:
    """ Generate all possible results by changing the order of operations. """
    
    n = len(expression)
    dp = {}

    def evaluate_expression(i, j):
        if (i, j) in dp:
            return dp[(i, j)]

        possible_values = set()
        substring = expression[i:j+1]

        if '*' not in substring and '+' not in substring:
            possible_values.add(int(substring))
        else:
            for k in range(i, j):
                if expression[k] == '*':
                    left, right = evaluate_expression(i, k-1), evaluate_expression(k+1, j)
                    for l in left:
                        for r in right:
                            possible_values.add(l * r)
                elif expression[k] == '+':
                    left, right = evaluate_expression(i, k-1), evaluate_expression(k+1, j)
                    for l in left:
                        for r in right:
                            possible_values.add(l + r)

        dp[(i, j)] = possible_values
        return possible_values

    return evaluate_expression(0, n-1)

def score_of_students(s: str, answers: List[int]) -> int:
    correct_answer = calculate(s)
    possible_answers = get_possible_expressions(s)
    score = 0

    for ans in answers:
        if ans == correct_answer:
            score += 5
        elif ans in possible_answers:
            score += 2
    
    return score
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Correct Answer Calculation:**
   - Splitting the string and evaluating simple product and summation: O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **Generate Possible Mistakes:**
   - Dynamic programming approach to generate all possible expressions with one mistake, essentially visiting sub-expressions multiple times: O(n^3) in the worst case where `n` is the length of the string.

3. **Overall Scoring:**
   - Iterating over all given answers and checking against possible sets: O(m) where `m` is the number of student answers.

Hence, the time complexity is dominated by the generation of possible mistaken expressions which is O(n^3).
