Leetcode Problem 2275: **Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero**

Given an array of positive integers `candidates`, find the largest combination size such that the bitwise AND of that combination is greater than zero. 

A combination is defined as a subset of the original array. For example, given _candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]_, the `71` has the highest number of set bits in each of its binary positions and is enough alone to have a subset thatâ€™s the largest with one count.

Return the size of the largest combination with bitwise AND greater than zero.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array include duplicates?** 
   - Yes, it can include duplicates as no such restriction is mentioned.

2. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array?**
   - Let's assume the standard constraints of Leetcode problems apply, typically, the number of elements (n) in the array can be large, i.e., \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).

3. **Can elements be zero?**
   - No, as the problem explicitly mentions the candidates are positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. **Analyze Each Bit Position:**
   - For each bit position, count how many of the candidates have that bit set (`1`). This can be done by iterating through the bit positions (let's say a max of 32 for typical 32-bit integers).
  
2. **Determine the Maximum Count:**
   - The maximum count of bits set in a position gives the largest combination size where the bitwise AND can be greater than zero.

### Code

```python
def largestCombination(candidates):
    # Initialize a list with 32 zeros to count set bits at each position
    bit_counts = [0] * 32
    
    for num in candidates:
        for i in range(32):
            if (num >> i) & 1:
                bit_counts[i] += 1
    
    # The result is the maximum value in bit_counts
    return max(bit_counts)

# Example usage:
candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]
print(largestCombination(candidates))  # Output: 4
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Bit Counting:**
   - For each number in the `candidates` list, check each bit position.
   - If a bit is set `(num >> i) & 1`, increment the count for that bit position.
   
2. **Finding Max Count:**
   - After processing all numbers, the maximum count in the `bit_counts` array represents the largest combination size, as more set bits in a position corresponds to the possibility of finding a larger subset.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times 32)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `candidates` array. This simplifies to \(O(n)\) as 32 is a constant.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since the additional space used does not depend on the input size, only the fixed size of the bit count array (32 elements).

This strategy ensures we efficiently count set bits and determine the largest combination size involving bitwise AND operations greater than zero.
