title:  Number of Ways to Buy Pens and Pencils-out
permalink: /s2240
---

You are given an integer `total` denoting the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers `cost1` and `cost2` denoting the cost of a pen and the cost of a pencil, respectively. 

You want to specify the number of ways of buying pens and pencils such that the total cost does not exceed the given `total`. Please note that you can buy 0 or more pens or/and 0 or more pencils.

Return the number of ways to buy pens and pencils.

### Example
```python
total = 20
cost1 = 10
cost2 = 5
```
Output: 9

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `total`, `cost1`, or `cost2` be zero?**
   - It is assumed that `total`, `cost1`, and `cost2` are non-negative integers, but all values can be tested to ensure they are positive and the condition makes sense.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the inputs?**
   - Constraints will generally align with typical problem parameters on LeetCode, generally the upper bound values will be practical within computational limits.

3. **Are fractional costs or amounts allowed?**
   - Generally, no. It is assumed that these values are integers.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, you can iterate through the number of pens and calculate how many pencils can be bought with the remaining amount of money. 

The steps are as follows:
1. Initialize a counter for the number of ways.
2. Loop through possible purchases of pens from 0 to maximum possible number of pens.
3. For each number of pens, calculate the remaining money.
4. Determine how many pencils can be bought with the remaining money.
5. Increment the counter based on valid combinations of pencils and pens that fit within the total budget.

### Code

```python
def waysToBuyPensPencils(total: int, cost1: int, cost2: int) -> int:
    ways = 0
    # Iterate over the number of pens
    for pens in range(total // cost1 + 1):
        remaining_money = total - pens * cost1
        ways += (remaining_money // cost2 + 1)
    return ways

# Example usage:
total = 20
cost1 = 10
cost2 = 5
print(waysToBuyPensPencils(total, cost1, cost2))  # Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where `n` is the `total // cost1` because we are iterating through each possible number of pens and performing a constant time calculation for each iteration. 

Since the constraints on `total`, `cost1`, and `cost2` are not provided but typically manageable within limits (usually up to \(10^6\) or \(10^9\)), this solution should work efficiently within these constraints.
