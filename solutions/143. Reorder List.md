title:  Reorder List-out

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Are we given the head of a singly linked list, and we need to reorder it in-place without changing the node values (only changing pointers)?
2. **Output Format**: Do we need to return the head of the modified list, or just modify the list in place without returning anything?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the number of nodes in the list? What should we do if the list has less than three nodes?

Assuming:
- The input is the head of a singly linked list.
- We don't need to return anything; the list should be modified in place.
- The list might have any number of nodes, including edge cases like 0, 1, or 2 nodes.

### Strategy
The task is to reorder a list such that:
Given `L0 → L1 → … → Ln-1 → Ln`, reorder it to `L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …`

#### Steps:
1. **Find the Middle of the List**: Use the Fast and Slow pointer technique to find the middle node.
2. **Reverse the Second Half**: Reverse the list starting from the node next to the middle to the end.
3. **Merge Two Halves**: Merge the first half and the reversed second half alternating between nodes.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Finding the Middle**:
    - Use two pointers, slow and fast. Move slow by one step and fast by two steps until fast reaches the end.
    - Slow will point to the middle.
2. **Reversing the Second Half**:
    - From the next of the middle node to the end, reverse these nodes.
3. **Merging**:
    - Merge the nodes, where you take one node from the first half and one node from the reversed second half alternately.

### Code Implementation
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reorderList(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return
    
    # Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

    # Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
    prev, curr = None, slow.next
    slow.next = None  # Cut the list into two halves
    while curr:
        next_temp = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = next_temp
    
    # Step 3: Merge the two halves
    first, second = head, prev
    while second:
        next_first, next_second = first.next, second.next
        first.next = second
        second.next = next_first
        first, second = next_first, next_second

# Example usage
# Let's create a list: 1->2->3->4
head = ListNode(1)
head.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next = ListNode(3)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(4)

reorderList(head)
# The list should be reordered to 1->4->2->3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding the middle**: O(n)
- **Reversing the second half**: O(n/2) -> O(n)
- **Merging two halves**: O(n)

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.

### Space Complexity
- The algorithm runs in **O(1)** extra space, excluding the input and output list space.

Feel free to ask any further clarifying questions or simulating additional test cases to ensure the solution is robust!
