title:  Domino and Tromino Tiling-out
permalink: /s790
---

You have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and a "L" tromino shape. You may rotate the tromino shapes. 

Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board using these two types of tiles. 

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. 

Return the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume \( n \) is a non-negative integer?
   **A:** Yes, \( n \) will be a non-negative integer.

2. **Q:** Do we need to consider rotations of domino and tromino?
   **A:** Yes, we need to consider all rotations/positions in which the tromino can be used.

3. **Q:** Is there a well-defined base case for \( n = 0 \)?
   **A:** For \( n = 0 \), the answer should be 1 since there's one way to cover an empty board.

### Strategy

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll define two states:

- **`dp[i]`**: Number of ways to fully cover a 2 x `i` board.
- **`dpT[i]`**: Number of ways to cover a 2 x `i` board that has one cell in the i-th column uncovered.

#### Recurrence Relations:

1. **Base cases:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to cover an empty board)
   - `dp[1] = 1` (1 way to cover a 2x1 board with a single domino)

2. **Recurrence for `dp[i]`:**
   - Cover the last two columns entirely with vertical dominos: `dp[i-2]`
   - Cover the last two columns as the base of an "L" tromino shape in three different rotations: `2 * dpT[i-1]`
   - Cover the last three columns with two "L" tromino shapes: `dp[i-3]`
   
3. **Recurrence for `dpT[i]`:**
   - Join the uncovered cell with the cell to its left using a horizontal domino and consider the rest of the board fully covered: `dp[i-2]`
   - Complete the row with another "L" tromino: `dpT[i-1]`

### Code

```python
def numTilings(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2  # Two ways: two vertical dominos or two horizontal dominos

    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dpT = [0] * (n + 1)

    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2

    dpT[2] = 1

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 * dpT[i-1] % MOD) % MOD
        dpT[i] = (dpT[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD

    return dp[n] % MOD

# Example usage:
print(numTilings(3))  # Output: 5
print(numTilings(4))  # Output: 11
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n) \) because we are iterating through the range of `n` to fill the dp arrays. The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) due to the storage used for the `dp` and `dpT` arrays.
