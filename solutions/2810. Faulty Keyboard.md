title:  Faulty Keyboard-out
permalink: /s2810
---
You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, digits, and underscores ('_'). A string `t` is said to be an output of keyboard if `t` can be obtained by concatenating some characters in `s` (keeping the order). If `Keyboard` is known to be faulty, return the minimum possible length of `t`.


### Clarifying Questions
1. **Do we have to maintain the order of characters in the resultant string `t`?**
   - Yes, the order of characters must be the same as in the original string `s`.

2. **What should be the output if the string `s` is empty?**
   - If `s` is empty, the minimum possible length of `t` would naturally be 0.

3. **Are there any restrictions on the characters allowed in the string?**
   - The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters, digits, and underscores ('_').

### Strategy
To achieve the minimum length of the output string `t`, we need to consider the longest subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of `s` that contains distinct characters. The logic behind this is straightforward:
1. Traverse through the string and keep adding characters if they are not already part of the result.
2. Keep a set to track characters that have already been added to the result to ensure uniqueness.

### Code

```python
def min_length_t_from_faulty_keyboard(s: str) -> int:
    seen = set()
    t = ""
    
    for char in s:
        if char not in seen:
            seen.add(char)
            t += char
    
    return len(t)

# Example usage:
s = "aabb_cc_ddee12"
print(min_length_t_from_faulty_keyboard(s))  # Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are making a single pass through the string and performing constant-time operations (checking membership in a set and adding to a set) for each character.

Thus, the solution is efficient and should work well within typical input size constraints.
