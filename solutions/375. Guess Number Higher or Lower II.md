title:  Guess Number Higher or Lower II-out
permalink: /s375
---

We are playing the game "Guess the Number." The game is as follows:

I pick a number between 1 and n. You guess a number between 1 and n. If you guess the right number, you win the game. If you guess wrong, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess, and you will continue guessing. Every time you guess a wrong number, you must pay the amount equal to the number you guessed. You win the game when you guess the correct number.

**Given a particular n, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.**

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input:** A single integer, `n`, which denotes the range [1, n] within which you need to guess the number.
2. **Output:** A single integer, which is the minimum amount of money required to guarantee you can guess the correct number without running out of money.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: n = 10
Output: 16
```

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **State Definition:** Let `DP[i][j]` be the minimum amount of money required to guarantee a win if the number to be guessed is between `i` and `j`.
2. **Base Case:** For `i == j`, `DP[i][j] = 0`, because if there's only one number to guess, no cost is required.
3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For each number `k` guessed between `i` and `j`, the worst case cost is `k` plus the maximum of the cost between the splits `[i, k-1]` and `[k+1, j]` (as the actual number could be in either split).
   - Therefore, `DP[i][j] = min(k + max(DP[i][k-1], DP[k+1][j]))` for all `k` in `[i, j]`.

### Code

```python
def getMoneyAmount(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialization of DP table with inf values
    DP = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Fill DP table
    for length in range(2, n+1): # length of range to consider
        for start in range(1, n-length+2): # starting point of range
            end = start + length - 1 # ending point of range
            DP[start][end] = float('inf')
            for k in range(start, end+1):
                # DP value considering guessing k
                cost = k + max(DP[start][k-1] if k > start else 0, DP[k+1][end] if k < end else 0)
                DP[start][end] = min(DP[start][end], cost)
    
    return DP[1][n]

# Example test case
print(getMoneyAmount(10))  # Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2), since we use a 2D table of size `n x n`.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^3), because of the nested loops â€” the range length loop, the start point loop, and the loop for finding the optimal guess (which theoretically could cover all `n`).

This approach ensures that you have the minimum guaranteed money to win the game.
