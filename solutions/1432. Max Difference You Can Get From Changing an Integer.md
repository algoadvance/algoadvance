title:  Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer-out
permalink: /s1432
---

Given an integer `num`, you are allowed to change at most one digit in the integer. Return the maximum difference you can obtain between the integer you get by changing at most one digit and the original integer `num`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the number**: Can `num` be negative or is it always a positive integer?
    - **Assumption**: `num` is always a positive integer based on usual constraints for such problems.
  
2. **Number of digits**: Is there any constraint on the number of digits in `num`?
    - **Assumption**: The number can have up to 10 digits typically, but let's confirm with the problem if there's any explicit constraint.

3. **Changing digit rules**: Are we allowed to change any digit to any other digit (0-9)?
    - **Assumption**: Yes, we can change any single digit to any other digit (0-9).

### Strategy

1. **Maximum Possible Number**: To maximize the integer, we can change the first non-9 digit (from left to right) to '9'. This change will give us the largest possible number obtainable.
2. **Minimum Possible Number**: If the first digit is not '1', we change the first digit to '1'. If the first digit is '1', we change the next non-'0' digit to '0', to minimize the integer.
3. **Calculate Difference**: Calculate the difference between the maximum obtained number and the minimum obtained number.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle the case where all digits are the same.

Using these steps, we can systematically derive the maximum difference possible.

### Code

```python
def maxDiff(num: int) -> int:
    num_str = str(num)
    
    # Generate maximum number by changing the first non-9 digit to 9
    max_num = list(num_str)
    for i in range(len(max_num)):
        if max_num[i] != '9':
            change_digit = max_num[i]
            max_num = [ch if ch != change_digit else '9' for ch in max_num]
            break
    max_num = int("".join(max_num))
    
    # Generate minimum number
    min_num = list(num_str)
    if min_num[0] != '1':
        # Change the first digit to '1'
        change_digit = min_num[0]
        min_num = ['1' if ch == change_digit else ch for ch in min_num]
    else:
        # Change the first non-'1' digit to '0'
        for i in range(1, len(min_num)):
            if min_num[i] != '0' and min_num[i] != '1':
                change_digit = min_num[i]
                min_num = [ch if ch != change_digit else '0' for ch in min_num]
                break
    min_num = int("".join(min_num))
    
    return max_num - min_num

# Example usage:
print(maxDiff(555))   # Expected Output: 888
print(maxDiff(9))     # Expected Output: 8
print(maxDiff(123456)) # Expected Output: 820000
```

### Time Complexity

- **String Conversion**: The conversion of the number to a string and list operations are O(d) where d is the number of digits.
- **Loop Operations**: We iterate over the digits a constant number of times, thus making the overall complexity O(d).

   Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(d), which in the worst case is O(10) (constant time) for typical integer lengths used in such problems. This ensures our solution is efficient.
