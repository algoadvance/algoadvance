title:  Circular Permutation in Binary Representation-out
permalink: /s1238
---
Given 2 integers `n` and `start`, your task is to generate a list representing the circular permutation in binary representation of length `2^n` starting from `start`, using the Gray code sequence.

Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. For a given number of bits `n`, a Gray code sequence must have exactly `2^n` different integers.

The circular permutation starts with the given integer `start`, and the resulting list must be in the form of a circular sequence where the first and last integers also differ by only one bit.

**Example:**
```text
Input: n = 2, start = 3
Output: [3, 2, 0, 1]
Explanation:
The binary representation of Gray code sequence is:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Now the permutation starts at 3 => [3, 2, 0, 1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Will `n` always be greater than or equal to zero?
   **A:** Yes, it is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
2. **Q:** Can `start` be any integer within the range `[0, 2^n - 1]`?
   **A:** Yes, `start` will always be a valid integer within the range `[0, 2^n - 1]`.

## Strategy
1. **Generate Gray Code Sequence:**
    - Calculate the Gray code for numbers ranging from 0 to `2^n - 1`. This can be done using the formula `G(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operator.
2. **Find Start Index:**
   - Identify the index of `start` in the generated Gray code sequence.
3. **Create Circular Permutation:**
   - Build the result list by reorganizing the Gray code sequence to start from the identified `start` index.

## Code
Below is the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def circularPermutation(n, start):
    # Step 1: Generate the Gray Code sequence
    gray_code = [(i ^ (i >> 1)) for i in range(2 ** n)]
    
    # Step 2: Find the start index in Gray Code sequence
    start_index = gray_code.index(start)
    
    # Step 3: Construct the circular permutation starting from start index
    result = gray_code[start_index:] + gray_code[:start_index]
    
    return result

# Example usage
n = 2
start = 3
print(circularPermutation(n, start))
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Generating the Gray Code:** O(2^n) - We generate `2^n` Gray code numbers.
2. **Finding the Start Index:** O(2^n) - We might need to iterate through the entire list of `2^n` elements to find the start index.
3. **Constructing the Result:** O(2^n) - Creating the permutation involves combining two sublists of size `2^n`.

Overall, the time complexity is O(2^n), which is optimal given the problem constraints.
