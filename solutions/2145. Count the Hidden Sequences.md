title:  Count the Hidden Sequences-out
permalink: /s2145
---

You are given a sequence of integers `differences` which represents the differences between consecutive elements of a hidden sequence, and two integers `lower` and `upper`.

- For instance, if the hidden sequence were `[x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n]`, then `differences` would be `[x_2 - x_1, x_3 - x_2, ..., x_n - x_{n-1}]`.

Return the number of possible hidden sequences that can be derived given that every element `x_i` of the hidden sequence falls within the inclusive range `[lower, upper]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of `differences`?**
    - Typically for interview problems, you can expect that the length will be reasonably manageable within typical computation constraints, but specifics should be provided in the problem description.
   
2. **Are there constraints on the values in `differences`, `lower`, and `upper`?**
    - Generally, these values will be within the range of typical integer bounds for such problems, but the exact constraints would be helpful to know.

3. **Does the sequence have to start from a specific value?**
    - The problem does not specify an initial value for the hidden sequence, suggesting we are to count sequences satisfy the range conditions and differences.

### Strategy
1. **Generate the Sequence:**
    - Start with a base value (let's say 0) and generate the cumulative sum sequence from the differences array. The specific starting point is arbitrary for understanding the bounds of values when applying the differences.

2. **Calculate the Range:**
    - Compute the actual minimum and maximum values this sequence could take if started from an arbitrary point.

3. **Adjust for Range Validity:**
    - Determine how the sequence fits into the required `[lower, upper]` bounds by shifting the starting point accordingly.

4. **Count Valid Sequences:**
    - Calculate the number of valid starting points for which the sequence remains within the bounds `[lower, upper]`. This is the count of possible sequences.

### Code

```python
def count_hidden_sequences(differences, lower, upper):
    # Start with a list to keep track of cumulative sums
    cum_sum = [0]
    
    # Calculate cumulative sums based on differences
    for diff in differences:
        cum_sum.append(cum_sum[-1] + diff)
    
    # Find the range of the cumulative sums
    min_val = min(cum_sum)
    max_val = max(cum_sum)
    
    # Calculate the range the starting point must be within
    # to keep the sequence within [lower, upper]
    min_start = lower - min_val
    max_start = upper - max_val
    
    # Count the number of valid starting points
    if min_start > max_start:
        return 0
    else:
        return max_start - min_start + 1

# Example Usage
differences = [1, -3, 4]
lower = 1
upper = 6
print(count_hidden_sequences(differences, lower, upper))  # Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity
- Calculating the cumulative sums: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `differences` array.
- Finding the minimum and maximum of the cumulative sums: \(O(n)\).
- Overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This time complexity is efficient for typical input sizes expected in coding interviews.
