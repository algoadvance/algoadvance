title:  Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination-out
permalink: /s2045
---
You are given a weighted undirected graph consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n` (inclusive) and an array `edges` where edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i] indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` that takes `time_i` seconds to traverse. You are also given an integer `change` which indicates the length of each traffic light cycle.

The traffic light at each node switches between green and red every `change` seconds, starting with green at time 0. During the green period, you can traverse through the node. During the red period, you must wait until the light turns green again.

You want to find the second minimum time it will take to travel from node `1` to node `n`. It is guaranteed that there is at least one path from `1` to `n`.

Write a function `secondMinimum` that returns the second minimum time it takes to travel from node `1` to node `n`.

## Function Signature
```python
def secondMinimum(n: int, edges: List[List[int]], time: int, change: int) -> int:
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is it guaranteed that all nodes are reachable from the start node (node 1)?
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that there is at least one path from `1` to `n`.
   
2. Can two distinct paths have the same travel time?
   - Yes, it is possible for two distinct paths to have the same travel time.

## Strategy
To find the second minimum time to reach the destination using a weighted graph with traffic lights, we can use a modified BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach:
1. Use a queue to track the current node, time, and the number of times the destination node `n` has been visited.
2. Use an array to keep track of the times it takes to reach each node.
3. When we reach the destination node `n` for the second time, we return the time.

Detailed steps:
1. Initialize a queue with the start node `1`, time `0`, and a counter `0` for visits to the destination node.
2. Perform BFS:
   - For each node, calculate the next possible time considering the traffic lights.
   - Append the neighboring nodes to the queue with the newly calculated time.
   - If we reach the destination node, increment the counter.
3. Once the destination node has been visited twice, return the time.

## Code
Here is the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
from typing import List

def secondMinimum(n: int, edges: List[List[int]], time: int, change: int) -> int:
    # Create the graph adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, t in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, t))
        graph[v].append((u, t))
    
    # Queue will store (current_node, current_time, visit_count_to_n)
    queue = deque([(1, 0, 0)])
    visit_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    while queue:
        current_node, current_time, visit_count_to_n = queue.popleft()
        
        # If we have reached the destination node n twice, we return the time
        if current_node == n:
            if visit_count_to_n == 1:
                return current_time
            visit_count_to_n += 1
        
        # Traverse all neighbors
        for neighbor, travel_time in graph[current_node]:
            next_time = current_time + travel_time
            
            # Determine the state of the traffic light on arrival
            if (next_time // change) % 2 == 1:  # Red light, wait for the next green
                next_time += change - (next_time % change)
            
            if visit_count[neighbor] < 2:
                visit_count[neighbor] += 1
                queue.append((neighbor, next_time, visit_count_to_n))
    return -1 # Should never reach here due to problem constraints

```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(E + V)\), where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices since BFS visits each edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V)\) for the queue and the `visit_count` array. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the second minimum travel time considering the constraints and the traffic lights.
