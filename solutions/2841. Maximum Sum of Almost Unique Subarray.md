title:  Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray-out
permalink: /s2841
---

This is an advanced problem where we need to identify subarrays that nearly fulfill uniqueness constraints. You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `m` and `k`. 

Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k` with at most `m` unique elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input sizes**: What is the maximum size of the input array?
   - **Response**: Generally for LeetCode, you can expect arrays up to lengths of 10^5.

2. **Value range of elements**: What is the range of values within `nums`?
   - **Response**: Typically, elements in the array are within the range \([-10^4, 10^4\) in LeetCode problems.

3. **Edge cases**: What should be returned if `k` is greater than the length of `nums`?
   - **Response**: Normally, we would assume input constraints guarantee \(k\) will always be less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

4. **Output**: Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one valid subarray?
   - **Response**: Usually, the problem constraints ensure this; if not, handling should return 0 for no valid subarray.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to inspect subarrays.
2. **HashMap for Count**: Maintain a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of elements within the window.
3. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the window while counting the unique elements using the hashmap.
4. **Check Uniqueness**: Ensure the number of unique elements in the current window doesn't exceed `m`.
5. **Max Sum Tracking**: Track the maximum sum for valid windows as you slide across the array.

## Code

```python
def maxSumAlmostUnique(nums, m, k):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    n = len(nums)
    if k > n:
        return 0
    
    freq_map = defaultdict(int)
    current_sum = 0
    max_sum = 0
    unique_count = 0
    
    # Initialize the first window
    for i in range(k):
        current_sum += nums[i]
        if freq_map[nums[i]] == 0:
            unique_count += 1
        freq_map[nums[i]] += 1
    
    if unique_count <= m:
        max_sum = current_sum
    
    # Slide the window across the array
    for i in range(k, n):
        # Remove the element going out of the window
        out_elem = nums[i - k]
        current_sum -= out_elem
        freq_map[out_elem] -= 1
        if freq_map[out_elem] == 0:
            unique_count -= 1
        
        # Add the new element coming into the window
        in_elem = nums[i]
        current_sum += in_elem
        if freq_map[in_elem] == 0:
            unique_count += 1
        freq_map[in_elem] += 1
        
        # Update the max_sum if the window has at most m unique elements
        if unique_count <= m:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
nums = [4, 2, 4, 5, 6]
m = 2
k = 3
print(maxSumAlmostUnique(nums, m, k))  # Expected output: 11 (subarray [4, 2, 4])
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of the first window**: O(k)
- **Sliding the window across the remaining elements**: O(n - k), but each operation within the sliding window is O(1) due to hashmap operations (add/remove).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is:

\[ O(k + (n - k) \cdot 1) = O(n) \]

This ensures the solution is efficient for large arrays within typical constraints.
