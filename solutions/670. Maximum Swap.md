title:  Maximum Swap-out
permalink: /s670
---
You are given a non-negative integer `num` represented as a string. You can swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you can get. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = "2736"
Output: "7236"
Explanation: Swap the number 2 and the number 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = "9973"
Output: "9973"
Explanation: No swap needed.
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= num <= 10^8`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input type:** Is the input always given as a string?
   - Yes, the input `num` is always a string.
   
2. **Output type:** Should the output also be a string?
   - Yes, the output should also be a string.

3. **Number of swaps:** Can we perform more than one swap?
   - No, we can perform at most one swap.

4. **Leading zeros:** Should we consider cases where the number might end up with leading zeros after swapping?
   - Since `num` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and given the nature of the problem, leading zeros should not occur.

## Strategy
1. Convert the string into a list of characters for easier manipulation.
2. Iterate through the string to identify the maximum number we can form by swapping any two digits.
3. Use a right-to-left traversal to keep track of the last seen positions of each digit.
4. For each digit from left to right, check if there is a larger digit available further in the list.
5. If found, swap and convert the list back to a string, then return it.

## Code
```python
def maximumSwap(num: str) -> str:
    # Convert the string to a list of characters to make manipulation easier
    num_list = list(num)
    n = len(num_list)
    
    # Create a dictionary to track the last index of each digit in the string
    last = {int(d): i for i, d in enumerate(num_list)}
    
    # Traverse the string from the beginning to find where to make the swap
    for i, d in enumerate(num_list):
        # Check for any larger digit after the current position
        for digit in range(9, int(d), -1):
            if last.get(digit, -1) > i:
                # Swap the current digit with the larger digit found
                num_list[i], num_list[last[digit]] = num_list[last[digit]], num_list[i]
                # Convert list back to string and return the result
                return ''.join(num_list)
    
    # If no swap has been made, return the original number
    return num

# Example usage
print(maximumSwap("2736"))  # Output: "7236"
print(maximumSwap("9973"))  # Output: "9973"
```

## Time Complexity
* Constructing the `last` dictionary takes **O(n)** time where `n` is the length of the string.
* The nested loop to find the swap operates in **O(n)** time (since outer loop runs `n` times and inner loop is bounded by a constant, i.e., 10 digits).
* Overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `num`.

## Space Complexity
* The primary additional space used is for the `last` dictionary which holds up to 10 entries (one for each digit from 0 to 9), making the space complexity **O(1)**. 
* The list `num_list` takes **O(n)** space to store the characters of the input string.
