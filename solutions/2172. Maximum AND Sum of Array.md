LeetCode 2172: "Maximum AND Sum of Array"

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `numSlots`. You have to place all the integers from `nums` into `numSlots` slots such that each slot can hold at most two integers. The AND sum of a placement is the sum of all integers `nums[i] & x` where `nums[i]` is an integer from `nums` and `x` is the index of the slot. 

Write a function `maximumANDSum(nums: List[int], numSlots: int) -> int` that returns the maximum possible AND sum of the given array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of elements in `nums`?**
   - The elements of `nums` are integers that can be positive or zero.
2. **What are the constraints on `numSlots`?**
   - `numSlots` determines how many slots are available, with each slot holding a maximum of 2 integers.
3. **What is the range of lengths for `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can vary, but it typically ranges from 1 to 20 for complexity constraints.
4. **Can `nums` have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, `nums` can have duplicate values.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming:** Use dynamic programming with bitmasking to keep track of which elements from `nums` have been placed in which slots.
2. **Bitmask Representation:** Use a bitmask to represent the state of each slot (i.e., how many numbers are currently placed in each slot; 0, 1, or 2).
3. **Recursive Relation:** Recursively calculate the maximum AND sum by considering placing each element into each slot while maintaining the constraint that each slot can hold at most two elements.

### Code
Let's go step-by-step into the implementation:

```python
from functools import lru_cache
from typing import List

def maximumANDSum(nums: List[int], numSlots: int) -> int:
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(index, mask):
        if index == len(nums):
            return 0
        
        max_sum = 0
        for slot in range(numSlots):
            if (mask >> (2 * slot)) & 3 < 2:  # Check if the slot has less than 2 items
                new_mask = mask + (1 << (2 * slot))
                max_sum = max(max_sum, (nums[index] & (slot + 1)) + dp(index + 1, new_mask))
        
        return max_sum
    
    return dp(0, 0)

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numSlots = 2
print(maximumANDSum(nums, numSlots))  # Expected output would be the maximum AND sum possible
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking:** We define a recursive function `dp(index, mask)` that uses `index` to keep track of the current element in `nums` and `mask` to represent the state of the slots.
2. **Base Case:** When `index` reaches the end of `nums`, return 0 as there are no more elements to place.
3. **Recursive Calculation:** Loop through each slot and check if the slot can accommodate the current element (`mask >> (2 * slot)) & 3 < 2`). Calculate a new mask with the current element placed in the slot and update the maximum AND sum.
4. **Memoization:** Use `lru_cache` to optimize the recursive calls and avoid repeated calculations for the same state.

### Time Complexity
- **State Space:** Each slot has 3 possible states (0, 1, or 2 items), and with `numSlots`, there are \(3^\text{numSlots}\) possible masks.
- **Bitmask Iteration:** Each recursive call checks `numSlots` possibilities.
- **Overall Complexity:** The complexity is `O(numSlots * 2^numSlots * len(nums))` due to memoization limiting redundant calculations.

This approach efficiently calculates the maximum AND sum with constraints on placing integers into limited slots.
