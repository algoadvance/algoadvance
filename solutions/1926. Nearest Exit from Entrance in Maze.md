title:  Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze-out
permalink: /s1926
---

You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col]` denotes the 0-indexed coordinates of the entrance cell.

You need to find the nearest exit from the entrance in the maze. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance cell does not count as an exit.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there multiple exits possible, and do we need to find any one?**
   - Yes, the goal is to find the shortest path to any exit; multiple exits might be present.

2. **Can the maze have multiple entrances?**
   - No, there is only one entrance.

3. **What if the entrance is already at the border? Does that mean it's at an exit?**
   - No, the entrance does not count as an exit.

4. **Can the maze dimensions `m` and `n` be very large?**
   - Assume that typical constraints apply (e.g., `1 <= m, n <= 100`).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. BFS is particularly suitable here because it explores all possible paths level by level and finds the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

1. **Initialize BFS:**
   - Start BFS from the `entrance`.
   - Use a queue to manage the current position and the number of steps taken.
   - Use a set to track visited cells to avoid revisiting them.

2. **Explore from the initial position:**
   - From the entrance, explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - If a border cell with `'.'` is found during exploration, it's an exit, and the function should return the number of steps taken to reach this cell.
   - If a non-border `'.'` is found, add it to the BFS queue for further exploration.

3. **Return -1:**
   - If the BFS completes and no exit is reached, return `-1`.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def nearest_exit(maze, entrance):
    m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    start_row, start_col = entrance

    # Use BFS
    queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])  # (row, col, steps)
    visited = set((start_row, start_col))
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    while queue:
        row, col, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check the four possible directions
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            
            if 0 <= new_row < m and 0 <= new_col < n and (new_row, new_col) not in visited and maze[new_row][new_col] == '.':
                # Check if it's an exit (but not the entrance)
                if (new_row == 0 or new_row == m-1 or new_col == 0 or new_col == n-1) and (new_row != start_row or new_col != start_col):
                    return steps + 1
                
                visited.add((new_row, new_col))
                queue.append((new_row, new_col, steps + 1))
    
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the maze. In the worst case, each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the queue and the visited set.

This time complexity ensures that the solution will be efficient for the typical constraints provided in such problems.
