title:  Minimum Operations to Maximize Last Elements in Arrays-out
permalink: /s2934
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. The size of the array is `n`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose any two different indices `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i, j < n`.
- Set `nums[i]` to `nums[i] | nums[j]` (bitwise OR).

Your goal is to maximize the last element in the array `nums`. Return the minimum number of operations required to maximize the last element (i.e., make it as large as possible).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, the problem specifies that the array contains non-negative integers.

2. **Is there any restriction on the length of the array `n`?**
   - No, but we can assume `1 <= n <= 10^5` based on typical constraints for leetcode problems.

3. **Will operations always increase the value of the last element in the array?**
   - Performing the OR operations strategically with the correct indices will help in maximizing the last element.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's proceed as follows:

1. **Initialize Cost and Target:**
   - Start with the last element as the `current_max` value.
   - Initialize the operation count `min_operations` to 0.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Iterate through the array and compute the `OR` of each element with the `current_max`.
   - For each element that leads to an increase in `current_max`, increment the operation count since it will aid in maximizing the last element.
   
3. **Result:**
   - Return the number of operations performed to maximize the last element.

### Code Implementation

Here's the Python code implementation for solving the problem:

```python
def maximize_last_element(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    current_max = nums[-1]
    min_operations = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        new_val = current_max | nums[i]
        if new_val > current_max:
            current_max = new_val
            min_operations += 1
    
    return min_operations
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The algorithm runs in O(n) time because it iterates through the array only once.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The algorithm uses O(1) additional space as it only uses a few extra variables.

By following this strategy, we ensure that we are systematically maximizing the last element with the minimum number of operations.
