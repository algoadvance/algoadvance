title:  Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls-out
permalink: /s1648
---

You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants to buy `orders` balls. The customer wants the balls with the highest value first (as you would sell in descending order). The value of each colored ball is defined by its color.

Initially, you have integers representing the number of balls of each color in your inventory and each integer also represents the initial value of the ball from that color. You can sell the balls for a price equal to the value of the ball's color. Once you sell one ball from the color, the value of that color decreases by 1.

Write a function to maximize your total earnings with the constraints above. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the input format?** The input consists of two parameters:
   - `inventory`: List[int] - representing the counts and initial values of the balls.
   - `orders`: int - representing the number of balls the customer wants to buy.

2. **What is the output format?** The output is a single integer representing the maximum earnings modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **How large can the inventory and orders be?** `inventory` can have up to `10^5` elements, and `orders` can be up to `10^9`.

4. **Constraints:**
   - The inventory might not be enough to fulfill the `orders`.
   - We need to consider performance due to potential large input sizes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm combined with a max-heap to always sell the highest valued balls first. Here's a detailed plan:

1. **Use a max-heap:**
   - Convert the `inventory` list into a max-heap with negative values since Python has a min-heap by default.

2. **Sell balls in descending order of their value:**
   - Each time, pop the largest value from the heap, sell as many balls as needed (or as many as available), and push the updated value back to the heap if it's still greater than zero.

3. **Calculate earnings:**
   - Sum up the earnings while respecting the modulo operation to avoid overflow.

4. **Exit condition:**
   - If `orders` becomes zero, stop the process.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
import heapq

def maxProfit(inventory, orders):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Convert inventory into a max-heap (use negative numbers for max-heap simulation)
    inventory = [-x for x in inventory]
    heapq.heapify(inventory)
    
    earnings = 0
    
    while orders > 0:
        # Extract the max value (in negative form)
        current_val = -heapq.heappop(inventory)
        
        # Determine next highest value in the heap
        next_val = -inventory[0] if inventory else 0
        
        # Maximum number of balls we can sell at `current_val` to `next_val`
        sellable_count = current_val - next_val
        can_sell = min(orders, sellable_count * (sellable_count + 1) // 2)
        
        full_sell_count = min(orders, can_sell)
        full_rows = full_sell_count // (sellable_count)
        leftover = full_sell_count % (sellable_count)
        
        # Add profit from full rows
        earnings += sellable_count * current_val
        earnings += (current_val - leftover) * (leftover + 1)
        earnings %= MOD
        
        # Decrement orders
        orders -= full_sell_count
        
        # Push the updated value back if it's still positive
        if next_val > 0:
            heapq.heappush(inventory, -next_val)
    
    return earnings % MOD
```

### Time Complexity

**Heap Operations:**
1. **Heapify the `inventory`:** \(O(n \log n)\)
2. **Heap operations (pop and push):** For each operation, \(O(\log n)\).

**Total Complexity:**
- Since we perform heap operations \(orders\) times in the worst case, the total complexity would generally be \(O(orders \log n)\), which is efficient enough given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

The solution is designed to efficiently sell the balls with the maximum value first and handle large input sizes using a max-heap. The code leverages Python's `heapq` library to perform heap operations and uses modular arithmetic to manage large numbers. This ensures that the solution is both optimal and adheres to the constraints.
