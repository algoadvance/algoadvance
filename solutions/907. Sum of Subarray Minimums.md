title:  Sum of Subarray Minimums-out
permalink: /s907
---

Given an array of integers `arr`, find the sum of `min(b)`, where `b` ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of `arr`. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - What are the length boundaries for the input array `arr`?
   - What are the possible value ranges for the integers in `arr`?

2. **Output:**
   - Is the result required modulo `10^9 + 7`?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum value of every subarray and then compute the sum of these minimum values. Directly iterating over all subarrays would be too slow as it results in O(n^3) complexity.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Utilize the concept of "Next Less Element" (NLE) and "Previous Less Element" (PLE) for each element in the array. This helps in determining the span of each element being the minimum in subarrays.
   - Use a monotonic stack to efficiently compute NLE and PLE for each element.

3. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Create two arrays `PLE` and `NLE` where:
     - `PLE[i]` represents the number of contiguous subarrays ending at `arr[i]` where `arr[i]` is the minimum.
     - `NLE[i]` represents the number of contiguous subarrays starting at `arr[i]` where `arr[i]` is the minimum.
   - For each element in `arr`, the count of subarrays where the element is minimum is `PLE[i] * NLE[i]`.
   - Compute the sum using these counts and return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```python
def sumSubarrayMins(arr):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Arrays to store previous less and next less
    PLE = [0] * n
    NLE = [0] * n
    
    # Monotonic stack for Previous Less Element (PLE)
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] >= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        PLE[i] = i + 1 if not stack else i - stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Clear stack for reuse
    stack = []
    
    # Monotonic stack for Next Less Element (NLE)
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] > arr[i]:
            stack.pop()
        NLE[i] = n - i if not stack else stack[-1] - i
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Calculate the result
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        result = (result + arr[i] * PLE[i] * NLE[i]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example Usage:
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]
print(sumSubarrayMins(arr))  # Output: 17
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution runs in O(n) time because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) due to the additional arrays and stack used.

By exploiting the properties of the stack and the arrays `PLE` and `NLE`, we can efficiently compute the result while avoiding the brute-force O(n^3) approach.
