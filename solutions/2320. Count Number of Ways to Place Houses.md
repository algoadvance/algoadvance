title:  Count Number of Ways to Place Houses-out
permalink: /s2320
---

You are given a positive integer `n` which represents the number of plots on each side of a street. You need to place houses on these plots such that no two houses are adjacent. 

Given `n` plots, what is the total number of different ways to place houses on *one* side of the street such that no two houses are adjacent? Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Possible arrangements:
- House placed on one side, empty on the opposite.
- Empty on one side, house placed on the opposite.
- No house on either side.
- House on both sides.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 9
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the arrangement of houses on one side affect another?**
   - Initially, the problem only asks for one side; however, in the examples, both sides are considered when calculating the number of ways.

2. **Is the solution required for both sides of the street?**
   - Yes, as indicated in the examples.

3. **What are the edge cases?**
   - Minimum value `n = 1`.
   - Large possible value of `n` pushing the solution for modular arithmetic check.

4. **Simultaneous calculation for both sides or multiplied individually?**
   - Calculate for one side and then square the result since both sides are independent.

## Strategy

1. **Fibonacci Sequence Analogy**: 
   - For a single side, treat placement as a Fibonacci problem where F(i) indicates the number of valid ways to place houses on a plot of length `i`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - \( DP[0] = 1 \) (One way of having zero houses)
   - \( DP[1] = 2 \) (Two ways: one house or no house)

3. **State Transition**:
   - \( DP[i] = DP[i-1] + DP[i-2] \) (Append empty or filled house + empty from the previous state)

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Square the result of `DP[n]` to account for both sides.

5. **Time Complexity**:
   - \( O(n) \): Single pass DP computation.

## Code

Here's the Python implementation of the outlined strategy:

```python
def countHousePlacements(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    if n == 1:
        return 4  # edge case for n = 1
    
    # Initialize the DP array.
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 2

    # Fill the dp array using the state transition equation.
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD

    # The number of ways to place houses on one side is dp[n]
    # The answer for both sides would be dp[n] squared
    result = (dp[n] * dp[n]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example test cases
print(countHousePlacements(1))  # Output: 4
print(countHousePlacements(2))  # Output: 9
```

This code calculates the number of valid ways to place houses on both sides of the streets, ensuring no two houses are adjacent on the same side, and returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
