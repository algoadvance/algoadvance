title:  Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner-out
permalink: /s2290
---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (representing an empty cell) or `1` (representing an obstacle that may be removed).

You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.

Return the minimum number of obstacles to remove so you can move from the upper left corner (0, 0) to the lower right corner (m - 1, n - 1).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we move diagonally?**
   - No, only up, down, left, or right moves are allowed.

2. **What is the maximum size of the grid?**
   - Assume the grid size can be up to 100 x 100.

3. **How do we handle cases where there is no possible path?**
   - We can assume there is always at least one path possible.

4. **Are the given grid values always valid (only `0`s or `1`s)?**
   - Yes, the grid values are always `0` or `1` only.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Instead of a normal BFS which only takes into account the number of steps, we'll also take into account the number of obstacles removed to reach a certain cell.

### Steps

1. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to prioritize the paths with fewer obstacles removed.
2. Start from the top-left corner of the grid.
3. For each cell, propagate its state to its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) while maintaining the minimum number of obstacles removed.
4. Use a visited set to avoid processing the same cell more than once with the same or a higher number of obstacles removed.

### Time Complexity

The modified BFS will process each cell at most once, and for each cell, it explores up to 4 neighbors. So the time complexity is `O(m * n * log(m * n))` due to the priority queue operations.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def minimumObstacles(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Min-heap priority queue with tuples (obstacles_removed, x, y)
    heap = [(0, 0, 0)]
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    while heap:
        obstacles_removed, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)

        # If we reached the bottom-right corner
        if x == m - 1 and y == n - 1:
            return obstacles_removed
        
        # If this cell has been visited with fewer or equal obstacles removed, skip it
        if visited[x][y]:
            continue
        visited[x][y] = True
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n:
                if not visited[nx][ny]:
                    # If it's an obstacle, increment obstacles_removed
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (obstacles_removed + grid[nx][ny], nx, ny))
    return -1  # If we can't reach the corner (shouldn't occur based on problem constraints)
```

This code uses a priority queue to implement a shortest-path algorithm that prioritizes paths with the least number of obstacles removed. It ensures that every cell is processed in an optimal manner regarding obstacle removal.
