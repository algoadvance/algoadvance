title:  Minimum Total Distance Traveled-out
permalink: /s2463
---

You are given two arrays `robots` and `factories`:

- `robots[i]` represents the position of the i-th robot.
- `factories[j]` is an array `[position_j, limit_j]`, where `position_j` is the position of the j-th factory, and `limit_j` is the maximum number of robots that factory j can accommodate.

Return the minimum total distance traveled to accommodate all the robots in the factories. The distance traveled to accommodate a robot at position `robots[i]` to a factory at position `factories[j]` is `|robots[i] - position_j|`, the **absolute difference** between the two positions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum lengths of the `robots` array and the `factories` array?
   - Are all positions unique?
   - Can a factory accommodate fewer robots than its limit?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the answer be an integer representing the minimum total distance?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if there are no robots?
   - What should be returned if there are no factories?

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Lists:**
   - Sort `robots` and `factories` by position. This helps to minimize the distance during allocation.

2. **Greedy Assignment:**
   - Assign robots to factories in a greedy manner to minimize the walking distance.
   - Use two pointers and a priority queue to efficiently allocate robots to suitable factories while respecting the capacity constraints.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Alternatively, use a dynamic programming approach to ensure optimal assignment. Create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance to accommodate the first `i` robots using the first `j` factories.

4. **Calculate the Distances:**
   - Iterate through the robots array and assign the nearest available factory while respecting the factory's limit.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the robots array takes `O(R log R)` and sorting the factories takes `O(F log F)`, where `R` is the number of robots and `F` is the number of factories.
- Assigning robots to factories in a greedy manner takes `O(R + F)` time.

The overall time complexity is `O(R log R + F log F)`.

## Code Implementation

```python
import heapq

def minimumTotalDistanceTraveled(robots, factories):
    robots.sort()
    factories.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    min_distance = 0
    robot_index = 0
    available_factories = []
    
    for position, limit in factories:
        heapq.heappush(available_factories, (position, limit))
        
        while available_factories and robot_index < len(robots):
            factory_position, factory_limit = heapq.heappop(available_factories)
            while factory_limit > 0 and robot_index < len(robots):
                min_distance += abs(factory_position - robots[robot_index])
                robot_index += 1
                factory_limit -= 1
            if factory_limit > 0:
                heapq.heappush(available_factories, (factory_position, factory_limit))
    
    return min_distance

# Test example
robots = [3, 1, 2]
factories = [[2, 1], [5, 2]]
print(minimumTotalDistanceTraveled(robots, factories))  # Output should be the minimum total distance
```

This implementation ensures that we minimize the total distance traveled to accommodate all robots in the given factories.
