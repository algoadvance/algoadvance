title:  Minimum Moves to Convert String-out
permalink: /s2027
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A move consists of choosing any `3` consecutive characters of `s` and converting them to `'XXX'`. Note that the characters in the string do not necessarily need to be distinct. Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of `s` are converted to `'X'`.

Example:
1. Input: `s = "XXX"`, Output: `0`
2. Input: `s = "XXXT"`, Output: `1`
3. Input: `s = "TXXTXX"`, Output: `2`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the transformation of characters in the move only care about converting the characters, or do we have to concern ourselves with their original values?
   - Only concerned with converting to `'X'`.
2. Do overlapping groups of three consecutive characters count as separate moves?
   - No, each move consists of exactly three consecutive characters, ensuring no overlap.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through the string checking sequences of three consecutive characters.
2. Whenever a sequence that includes any non-'X' character is found, increment a move counter and convert that sequence in the string to `'XXX'`.
3. Continue traversing the string by skipping 3 indices ahead whenever you make a move, as the conversion affects that segment.

## Code

```python
def minimumMoves(s: str) -> int:
    moves = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i] != 'X':
            moves += 1
            i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters because they will be converted to 'XXX'
        else:
            i += 1  # Move to the next character to check for non-'X'
    return moves

# Example Usage
print(minimumMoves("XXX"))      # Output: 0
print(minimumMoves("XXXT"))     # Output: 1
print(minimumMoves("TXXTXX"))   # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We traverse each character in the string once, skipping ahead by 3 indices whenever a move is made.
- **Space complexity**: O(1), no extra space other than a few pointers and counters is used.

This strategy ensures we efficiently count the minimum number of moves needed to convert the string.
