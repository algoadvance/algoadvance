title:  Find Number of Coins to Place in Tree Nodes-out
permalink: /s2973
---
Given a binary tree with `n` nodes where each node has either a 0 or 1 as its value, your task is to place coins in the nodes such that each node in the tree ends up with exactly one coin. The number of moves required to achieve this should be minimized, where a move is defined as transferring a coin from one node to any of its direct children or its parent. You need to return the minimum number of moves to distribute the coins.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n` (number of nodes in the tree)?
   - Can the input tree be null or empty?
   - What is the range of values in each node (although it's specified as 0 or 1)?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle edge cases like a single node tree.
   - Trees where all nodes already satisfy the requirement.

## Strategy
1. **Post-order Traversal:** We can use a post-order traversal (left, right, root) to solve this problem. This is because we need to process the children nodes before processing the parent node.
2. **Balance Calculation:** For each node, calculate the balance of coins, which is: 
   \[
   \text{balance} = \text{number of coins in subtree} - \text{number of nodes in subtree}
   \]
   This balance will help us determine how many coins need to be moved to ensure this subtree ends up with one coin per node.

3. **Moves Calculation:** The number of coins that need to be moved for each node can be directly derived from the balance of the node. If a node has a balance of +2, it needs to push 1 coin to its parent for each excess coin, and similarly, if it has a balance of -2, it needs to pull 1 coin from its parent for each deficit coin.

4. **Aggregate Moves:** Aggregate the number of moves from each subtree to get the total number of moves required.

## Code
Here's the implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def distributeCoins(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def postorder(node):
        if not node:
            return 0, 0
        
        left_balance, left_moves = postorder(node.left)
        right_balance, right_moves = postorder(node.right)
        
        current_balance = left_balance + right_balance + (node.val - 1)
        current_moves = left_moves + right_moves + abs(current_balance)
        
        return current_balance, current_moves
    
    total_balance, total_moves = postorder(root)
    return total_moves

# Example usage:
# Constructing a binary tree:
#        1
#      /  \
#     0    0
#    / \
#   3   0
#
# Where:
# root = TreeNode(1)
# root.left = TreeNode(0)
# root.right = TreeNode(0)
# root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
# root.left.right = TreeNode(0)

root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(0)
root.right = TreeNode(0)
root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.right = TreeNode(0)

print(distributeCoins(root))  # Output: Expected number of moves to distribute coins
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once during the post-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), `h` could be `n`.
