Leetcode Problem 796: Rotate String

Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `True` if and only if `s` can become `goal` after some number of shifts on `s`.

A shift on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position. For example, if `s = 'abcde'`, then it will be `'bcdea'` after one shift.

**Example 1:**

- Input: `s = "abcde"`, `goal = "cdeab"`
- Output: `true`

**Example 2:**

- Input: `s = "abcde"`, `goal = "abced"`
- Output: `false`

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length constraint on the strings `s` and `goal`?
2. Do both strings need to be of the same length?
3. Are the strings guaranteed to contain only lowercase letters?
4. What should we return if either `s` or `goal` is empty?

## Strategy

1. **Length Check**: First, check if the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different. If they are, return `False` because a string cannot be rotated into another string of a different length.
2. **Concatenation Method**: Concatenate `s` with itself (i.e., `s + s`). This will include all possible rotations of `s` as substrings.
3. **Substring Check**: Check if `goal` is a substring of the concatenated string `s + s`.

## Time Complexity

- Performing the concatenation takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.
- Checking if `goal` is a substring of `s + s` will take \(O(n)\) on average assuming efficient substring search algorithms.

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

## Code

```python
def rotateString(s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(goal):
        return False

    concatenated_s = s + s
    return goal in concatenated_s
```

Here is how the solution works:
1. It checks if the lengths of `s` and `goal` are the same.
2. If they are, it concatenates `s` with itself to form a new string `concatenated_s`.
3. It checks if `goal` is a substring of `concatenated_s`, and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.

This method ensures an efficient check for all rotations of `s` within a linear time complexity.
