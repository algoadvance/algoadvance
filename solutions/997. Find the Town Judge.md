title:  Find the Town Judge-out
permalink: /s997
---
In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:
1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that person `a` trusts person `b`.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified. Otherwise, return `-1`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What if the `trust` array is empty and `n > 1`?
   - If `trust` is empty and `n > 1`, it means that no one trusts anyone. Hence, there can't be a judge, as the judge needs at least `n-1` people to trust them.
2. What if `n == 1`?
   - If `n == 1`, the single person is trivially the judge as there is no one else in the town.
   
## Strategy
We can use a degree counting approach to solve this problem:
1. Create two arrays `trusts` and `trusted_by` of size `n+1` to count how many people each person trusts and how many people trust each person, respectively.
2. Iterate through the `trust` array and populate these arrays.
3. The town judge will be the person `i` with `trusts[i] == 0` and `trusted_by[i] == n-1`.

## Code
```python
def findJudge(n, trust):
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    trusts = [0] * (n + 1)
    trusted_by = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for a, b in trust:
        trusts[a] += 1
        trusted_by[b] += 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if trusts[i] == 0 and trusted_by[i] == n - 1:
            return i

    return -1
```

## Time Complexity
- Building the `trusts` and `trusted_by` arrays takes O(n) time as we iterate over the `trust` array once.
- Searching for the judge takes O(n) time as well.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

This solution is efficient and should handle the input constraints well. If you have any specific edge cases or further questions, feel free to ask!
