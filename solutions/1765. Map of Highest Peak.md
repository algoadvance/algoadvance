title:  Map of Highest Peak-out
permalink: /s1765
---
You are given an integer matrix `isWater` of size `m x n` that represents a map of land and water cells.

- If `isWater[i][j] == 0`, cell `(i, j)` is a land cell.
- If `isWater[i][j] == 1`, cell `(i, j)` is a water cell.

You must assign each cell a height in a way that:

- The height of each cell must be non-negative.
- If the cell `(i, j)` is a water cell, then its height must be 0.
- The height difference between any two adjacent cells must be at most 1. 

Return an integer matrix `height` of the same size as `isWater` such that `height[i][j]` is the height of the cell `(i, j)`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum size of the matrix `isWater`?**
   - This helps to understand any constraints related to the algorithm's complexity.
   
2. **Are the boundary cells always water or can they be land cells as well?**
   - Both configurations are possible; this helps devise the traversal strategy.

3. **Are there any land-only or water-only matrices?**
   - This will clarify the edge cases to consider.

4. **Is diagonal adjacency considered?**
   - Usually not, we only consider up, down, left, and right adjacency.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the result matrix `height` with `-1` for all land cells (indicating unvisited) and `0` for water cells.
   
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a BFS approach starting from all water cells (with height 0) and propagate the height to land cells. This is because BFS naturally ensures that we spread the heights in the shortest path manner.

3. **Traversal**:
   - Use a queue to manage the cells to visit, starting with all water cells.
   - For each cell, update its adjacent cells if they haven't been visited yet, increasing the height by 1.
   
4. **Return the final `height` matrix**.

## Code
```python
from collections import deque

def highestPeak(isWater):
    m, n = len(isWater), len(isWater[0])
    height = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
    queue = deque()

    # Initialize height matrix and queue with water cells
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if isWater[i][j] == 1:
                height[i][j] = 0
                queue.append((i, j))

    # Define the directions for moving in the grid (up, down, left, right)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    # Perform BFS from water cells
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and height[nx][ny] == -1:
                height[nx][ny] = height[x][y] + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                
    return height
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns, to set up the height matrix and queue.
- **BFS Traversal**: O(m * n) since each cell is visited once.
- **Overall**: O(m * n), which is efficient for typical matrix sizes.

## Space Complexity
- **Queue**: At most O(m * n) in the worst case.
- **Height Matrix**: O(m * n) for storage.
- **Overall**: O(m * n).
