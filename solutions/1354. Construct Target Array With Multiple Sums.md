title:  Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums-out
permalink: /s1354
---

You are given an array `target` of n integers. From a starting array of `arr` consisting of `n` 1's, you may perform the following procedure:

1. Let `x` be the sum of all elements currently in your array `arr`.
2. Choose index `i`, such that `0 <= i < n` and set the value of `arr[i]` to `x`.
3. You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.

Return `true` if it is possible to construct the `target` array from `arr`, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the size of the array `target`?**
   - The size can vary as per the problem constraints, but all values are positive integers.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the `target` array?**
   - The values are positive integers.

3. **How should I handle edge cases, like a single element in `target`?**
   - If `target` has a single element that is 1, the result is always `true`. For any other single element, the result is `false`.

### Strategy:

1. **Understanding the Process:**
   - Starting with an array of all 1's, transform it to the target array by replacing elements iteratively with the sum of the current array.

2. **Top-Down Approach:**
   - Instead of starting with the array `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]` and trying to grow it into the `target` array, we can reverse this process. We can start with the `target` array and try to reduce it back to `[1, 1, 1, ..., 1]`.

3. **Using a Max-Heap:**
   - Use a max-heap (invert values for Python's `heapq` which is a min-heap) to always reduce the largest element, since the largest element should have been formed last by adding all previous elements together.

4. **Steps:**
   - Extract the largest element.
   - Compute the sum of the rest of the array.
   - Ensure that the largest element is a result of `prev_sum + some_value`.
   - Replace the largest with `largest % rest_sum` and push it back into the heap.
   - If at any point the largest element is less than or equal to the sum of the rest or the modulo operation doesnâ€™t reduce it, return `false`.

### Code:

```python
import heapq

def isPossible(target):
    if len(target) == 1:
        return target[0] == 1
    
    # Convert the list into a max-heap (negative values for Python's min-heap)
    total_sum = sum(target)
    target = [-x for x in target]
    heapq.heapify(target)
    
    while True:
        largest = -heapq.heappop(target)
        rest = total_sum - largest
        
        if largest == 1 or rest == 1:
            return True

        if rest == 0 or largest < rest or largest % rest == 0:
            return False
        
        largest %= rest
        total_sum = rest + largest
        heapq.heappush(target, -largest)

### Time Complexity:
- Building the heap takes O(n).
- Each reduction step involves O(log n) operations within the heap.
- The worst case number of operations can depend on how often divisibility conditions and reductions are applied.
- Hence, this efficient approach maintains an average case near O(n log m), where `m` is the value of the largest element.
