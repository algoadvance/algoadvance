You are given a sequence of integers. Your task is to design a data structure that supports the following operations:

1. **append(val)**: Appends an integer `val` to the end of the sequence.
2. **addAll(inc)**: Increments all the integers in the sequence by `inc`.
3. **multAll(m)**: Multiplies all the integers in the sequence by `m`.
4. **getIndex(idx)**: Gets the current value at index `idx` (0-indexed) of the sequence, or returns -1 if `idx` is out of bounds.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
    - Are there any constraints on the values that the integers in the sequence can take?
    - What data types are we dealing with (e.g., will integers be within a specific range)?
  
2. **Bounds**:
    - What are the bounds on the number of operations and the size of the sequence we need to handle efficiently?
  
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should happen if `getIndex` is called with an out-of-bound index? (already specified to return -1)

### Code

Below is an implementation of the Fancy class that supports these operations efficiently.

```python
class Fancy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sequence = []
        self.add = 0
        self.mult = 1
        self.mod = 10**9 + 7

    def append(self, val: int) -> None:
        # Store the value adjusted for the current add and mult factors
        val_adjusted = (val - self.add) * pow(self.mult, self.mod - 2, self.mod) % self.mod
        self.sequence.append(val_adjusted)

    def addAll(self, inc: int) -> None:
        self.add = (self.add + inc) % self.mod

    def multAll(self, m: int) -> None:
        self.add = self.add * m % self.mod
        self.mult = self.mult * m % self.mod

    def getIndex(self, idx: int) -> int:
        if idx >= len(self.sequence):
            return -1
        return (self.sequence[idx] * self.mult + self.add) % self.mod
```

### Strategy

- **append(val)**: We adjust `val` by subtracting the current `add` factor and dividing by the `mult` factor. We store this adjusted value to reflect the current transformations.
- **addAll(inc)**: Simply increment the `add` variable by `inc`.
- **multAll(m)**: Multiply the `mult` and `add` variables by `m`. This handles the scalar multiplication of the entire sequence.
- **getIndex(idx)**: To get the true value at `idx`, we apply the current multiplication and addition factors to the stored value.

### Time Complexity

- **append(val)**: \(O(1)\)
- **addAll(inc)**: \(O(1)\)
- **multAll(m)**: \(O(1)\)
- **getIndex(idx)**: \(O(1)\)

This allows each operation to be performed in constant time, making the overall system highly efficient for large sequences and numerous operations.
