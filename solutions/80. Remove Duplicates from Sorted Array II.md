title:  Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II-out
permalink: /s80
---
Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates are allowed at most twice and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]`
Output: `5`, `nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]`

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]`
Output: `7`, `nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input array always non-empty?**
    - Yes, based on the constraints (`1 <= nums.length`).
2. **Can the values in the array be negative?**
    - Yes, the values range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.
3. **Can I use Pythonâ€™s list slicing?**
    - Yes, but remember that you can't allocate extra space for another array; modifications need to be done in-place.

## Strategy
We'll use a two-pointer approach to efficiently manage the in-place updates:
1. **Initialization:** 
    - Create a pointer `insert_pos` starting at index 0.
    - Loop through the list using another pointer.

2. **Traversal:**
    - Traverse the `nums` array.
    - For each element, check if it is allowed to be inserted based on the previous element at `insert_pos-2`.

3. **Insertion Check:**
    - If `insert_pos` is less than 2, directly insert the element as we need at least two items to compare.
    - Otherwise, check if the current element is the same as the element at `insert_pos-2`. 
        - If not, insert the current element at `insert_pos` and increment `insert_pos`.

4. **End Result:**
    - After the loop, `insert_pos` will be the new length of the modified array.

## Code
```python
def removeDuplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    insert_pos = 0

    for num in nums:
        if insert_pos < 2 or num != nums[insert_pos - 2]:
            nums[insert_pos] = num
            insert_pos += 1

    return insert_pos
```

### Explanation
1. **Edge Case Handling:**
    - If the input list `nums` is empty, immediately return 0.
2. **Two-Pointer Mechanism:**
    - `insert_pos` serves as the place to insert the next valid element for the modified array.
    - Traverse each element in `nums`:
      - If `insert_pos` is less than 2: Directly insert the element, as there are fewer than 2 elements to compare.
      - If the current element `num` is not equal to the element located at `insert_pos - 2`, insert `num` at position `insert_pos` and increment `insert_pos`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate through each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we do not use any extra space proportional to the input size; the modifications are done in-place.

This solution leverages the sorted property of the array and uses constant space for efficient in-place modifications.
