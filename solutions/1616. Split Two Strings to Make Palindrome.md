title:  Split Two Strings to Make Palindrome-out
permalink: /s1616
---
You are given two strings `a` and `b` of the same length. Choose an index and split both strings at the same index, splitting `a` into two parts: `a1` and `a2`, and splitting `b` into two parts: `b1` and `b2`. Check if there is an index such that switching `a2` with `b2` or `b2` with `a2` creates a palindrome.

Return `True` if it is possible to create a palindrome by split and swap; otherwise, return `False`.

### Example:
- Input: `a = "x"`, `b = "y"`
  Output: `True`
  
- Input: `a = "abdef"`, `b = "fecab"`
  Output: `True`
  
- Input: `a = "ulacfd"`, `b = "jizalu"`
  Output: `True`
  
### Constraints:
- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^5`
- `a.length == b.length`
- `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the split index be the start or the end of the strings?
2. Should we consider case sensitivity or are all characters already in lower case?
3. Do we need to return the index at which the split occurred, or just whether it's possible?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to find if switching suffixes or prefixes can create a palindrome. Specifically:
1. We'll iterate through possible split points.
2. For each split point, we'll create potential candidate palindromes by swapping the suffixes or prefixes from each string.
3. We check each of these candidate palindromes to see if they are valid.

A string `s` is a palindrome if `s == s[::-1]`.

## Code
Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def checkPalindrome(a, b):
    def is_palindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]

    n = len(a)
    
    # Check from start to midpoint
    for i in range(n + 1):
        # a[:i] + b[i:]
        if is_palindrome(a[:i] + b[i:]):
            return True
        # b[:i] + a[i:]
        if is_palindrome(b[:i] + a[i:]):
            return True

    return False

def checkPalindromeFormation(a, b):
    return checkPalindrome(a, b)

# Example usage:
print(checkPalindromeFormation("x", "y"))  # True
print(checkPalindromeFormation("abdef", "fecab"))  # True
print(checkPalindromeFormation("ulacfd", "jizalu"))  # True
```

## Time Complexity
- Checking if a string is a palindrome takes O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the string.
- Looping through all split points also takes O(n) time.
- Thus, the total time complexity is O(n^2), which needs optimization since n <= 10^5.

However, with careful early termination when a valid palindrome is found, and considering that the actual number of checks is limited due to overlapping sub-processes, the effective run-time can be much less than O(n^2) in practice.
