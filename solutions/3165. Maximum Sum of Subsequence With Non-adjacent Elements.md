title:  Maximum Sum of Subsequence With Non-adjacent Elements-out
permalink: /s3165
---

Given an integer array `nums`, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with no two elements being adjacent. A subsequence is derived from the array `nums` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Formally, you need to return an integer `maxSum` defined as:

```text
maxSum = max(sum(subsequence) for subsequence in all_subsequences if no adjacent elements in subsequence)
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length of the array `nums`?
   - What range of values can the elements in `nums` take? Are they only positive, or can they be negative?

2. **Output Constraints**:
   - Should the output just be the maximum sum, or should it include the subsequence as well?

Let's assume that the array `nums` has a length of up to \(10^5\) and can contain both positive and negative integers.

## Strategy

This is a classic dynamic programming problem similar to the "House Robber Problem". We use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sums while ensuring that no two selected elements are adjacent.

We can define a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum we can get considering the elements up to the `i-th` index under the constraint that no two elements are adjacent.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - If there are no elements in `nums`, the maximum sum is `0`.
   - If there is only one element, the maximum sum is that element itself.

2. **Transition**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, we have two choices:
     - Include `nums[i]` in the sum and add it to the maximum sum excluding the previous element: `nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.
     - Exclude `nums[i]` and keep the maximum sum up to the previous element: `dp[i-1]`.
   - Therefore, the recurrence relation is:
     ```
     dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + (dp[i-2] if i >= 2 else 0))
     ```

3. **Result**:
   - The result will be in `dp[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the array.

### Code

```python
def max_sum_non_adjacent(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])

    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])

    return dp[-1]

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]
print(max_sum_non_adjacent(nums))  # Should output 15 (3 + 10 + 2 or 5 + 10 is optimal)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) - We iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) - We use a dynamic programming array of size `n`.

For optimized space complexity, we can reduce it to \(O(1)\) by using two variables to keep track of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`.

### Optimized Code

```python
def max_sum_non_adjacent(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    prev2, prev1 = 0, nums[0]

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        current = max(prev1, nums[i] + prev2)
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current

    return prev1

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]
print(max_sum_non_adjacent(nums))  # Should output 15
```

This optimized approach keeps the complexity within \(O(n)\) time and \(O(1)\) space.
