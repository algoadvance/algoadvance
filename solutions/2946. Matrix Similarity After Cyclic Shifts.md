title:  Matrix Similarity After Cyclic Shifts-out
permalink: /s2946
---

You are given two `n x n` binary matrices, `grid1` and `grid2`. You need to determine if `grid2` can be obtained by cyclically shifting the rows in `grid1`. A cyclic shift means moving the rightmost element of a row to the leftmost position and shifting all other elements one position to the right. You can perform the shift operation zero or more times on each row independently.

Return `true` if `grid2` can be obtained by cyclically shifting rows of `grid1`, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can rows be shifted independently of each other or must all be shifted uniformly?**
   - Rows can be shifted independently of each other.

2. **What is the range of the size `n` for the matrix?**
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 50` for this problem.

3. **Are the matrices always square (i.e., n x n)?**
   - Yes, the matrices are always n x n.

4. **Can the matrices contain values other than 0 and 1?**
   - No, the matrices are binary matrices containing only 0s and 1s.

## Strategy

The task is to verify if `grid2` can be obtained by cyclically shifting rows of `grid1`. To do this, we should consider each row's potential formations after any number of cyclic shifts. Each row in a matrix can produce `n` different rows after shifts.

**Steps:**
1. Create a helper function to generate all possible cyclic shifts of a given row.
2. For each row in `grid2`, check if it matches any possible shifted row from the corresponding row in `grid1`.
3. If all rows in `grid2` can match a cyclic shift of the corresponding row in `grid1`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Code

```python
def shift_row(row, n):
    # Return a list of n cyclically shifted rows
    return [row[i:] + row[:i] for i in range(n)]

def can_cyclically_shift(grid1, grid2):
    n = len(grid1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        possible_shifts = shift_row(grid1[i], n)
        if grid2[i] not in possible_shifts:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example Usage
grid1 = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1]
]

grid2 = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1]
]

print(can_cyclically_shift(grid1, grid2))
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Shift Generation:** Generating all shifts for all rows involves looping over each row and generating `n` cyclic shifts, which takes `O(n^2)` for each row.
2. **Checking Shifts:** Each check to find if a row in `grid2` matches any of the `n` shifted versions of the row in `grid1` takes `O(n^2)` comparisons (n rows, and each has at most n possible rows to match).

Hence, the total time complexity is `O(n^3)`, which is manageable given the constraint `1 <= n <= 50`.
