title:  Most Frequent Prime-out
permalink: /s3044
---
You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`). You need to find the most frequently occurring prime number in the array. If there are multiple such numbers, return the smallest one. If there is no prime number, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range**: Can we assume that the elements in the array are all non-negative integers?
2. **Duplicates**: Do duplicate values count towards their frequency?
3. **Output**: Is the function expected to return an integer as output?
4. **Constraints**: Are the constraints only limited to the given `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`?

Assuming standard constraints and conditions.

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Prime Numbers**:
   - Implement a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each prime number in the array.
3. **Determine the Most Frequent Prime**:
   - Iterate through the frequency dictionary to find the prime with the highest frequency, and if there is a tie, return the smallest prime among them.
4. **Edge Case**:
   - If there are no prime numbers in the given array, return -1.

### Code:
We'll write the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime and then use it to count the frequency of prime numbers in the list.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while (i * i) <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def most_frequent_prime(nums):
    prime_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in nums:
        if is_prime(num):
            prime_count[num] += 1
    
    if not prime_count:
        return -1
    
    most_frequent = -1
    highest_frequency = 0
    
    for prime, count in prime_count.items():
        if count > highest_frequency or (count == highest_frequency and prime < most_frequent):
            highest_frequency = count
            most_frequent = prime
    
    return most_frequent

# Example usage
print(most_frequent_prime([1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 2]))  # Output should be 2
print(most_frequent_prime([1, 4, 6, 8, 10]))             # Output should be -1 since there are no primes
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Prime Check (is_prime)**: The function `is_prime` runs in O(sqrt(n)) time for each number.
- **Counting Frequencies and Finding the Most Frequent Prime**: 
  - Iterating through the array takes O(n).
  - Updating and checking the dictionary takes O(1) per operation.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n * sqrt(m)), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is the maximum number in the array (since the prime-check function runs in O(sqrt(m))).

### Space Complexity:
- Using an auxiliary dictionary for storing the frequency of primes, which in the worst case can be O(n) if all numbers are prime, so the space complexity is O(n).
