title:  Strong Password Checker-out
permalink: /s420
---

A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:

1. It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.
2. It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.
3. It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are fulfilled).

Write a function `strongPasswordChecker(s: str) -> int` that, given a string `s`, returns the minimum changes required to make the password strong. Changes include inserting, deleting, or replacing a character. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the input string contain special characters, spaces, or only alphanumeric characters?
   - Should we account for character cases (e.g., is "A" different from "a")?
   
2. **Output Details:**
   - What exactly qualifies as a change? Is inserting or deleting one character considered a change?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we handle null or empty strings explicitly?

## Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```python
def strongPasswordChecker(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    has_lower = has_upper = has_digit = 0
    
    for c in s:
        if c.islower():
            has_lower = 1
        elif c.isupper():
            has_upper = 1
        elif c.isdigit():
            has_digit = 1
    
    categories = has_lower + has_upper + has_digit

    change = 0
    one = two = 0
    i = 2

    while i < n:
        if s[i] == s[i - 1] == s[i - 2]:
            length = 2
            while i < n and s[i] == s[i - 1]:
                length += 1
                i += 1

            change += length // 3
            if length % 3 == 0:
                one += 1
            elif length % 3 == 1:
                two += 1
        else:
            i += 1

    if n < 6:
        return max(6 - n, 3 - categories)
    elif n <= 20:
        return max(change, 3 - categories)
    else:
        delete = n - 20
        change -= min(delete, one)
        change -= min(max(delete - one, 0), two * 2) // 2
        change -= max(delete - one - 2 * two, 0) // 3
        return delete + max(change, 3 - categories)
```

## Strategy

1. **Check Character Categories:**
   - Iterate through the password to check if it contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit.
   
2. **Identify Violations:**
   - Identify sequences of three or more repeating characters and determine the minimal number of changes required to break these sequences.
   
3. **Length Handling:**
   - If the length of the password is less than 6, return the maximum value between `6 - n` and `3 - categories`.
   - If the length of the password is between 6 and 20 (inclusive), return the maximum value between `change` and `3 - categories`.
   - If the length exceeds 20, minimize the deletions required and adjust the changes accordingly.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in O(n) because each step involves scanning the string with various checks and the maximum number of operations (such as replacements and deletions) depends linearly on the length of the string. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n).
