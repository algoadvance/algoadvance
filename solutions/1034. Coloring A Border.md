title:  Coloring A Border-out
permalink: /s1034
---
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `row`, `col`, and `color`. Each value in the grid represents the color of the grid square at that location.

Two cells are considered connected if they are adjacent (up, down, left, right) and have the same color. 

The border of a connected component is all the cells in the connected component that are either on the edge of the grid or whose neighbor in any of the 4 directions is not in the same connected component.

Change the border of the connected component to the given `color`, and return the resulting grid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **How do we handle edge cases such as empty grid or `row` and `col` indices being out of bounds?**
   - We assume valid input as per problem constraints.
2. **Can we modify the given grid in place?**
   - Yes.

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We can use DFS to explore and identify all the cells in the connected component starting from `(row, col)`.
2. **Identify Border Cells:** While performing DFS, we'll check if a cell is at the boundary of the grid or adjacent to a cell of a different color to mark it as a border cell.
3. **Color the Border:** After identifying all border cells, we'll change their color to the given `color`.

### Steps
1. **Initialize:** Start DFS from the given `row` and `col` if valid.
2. **Explore:** Use DFS to explore the connected component and mark boundary cells that either are on the edge of the grid or adjacent to a cell of a different color.
3. **Color Change:** Change the color of all border cells to the given color.
4. **Return:** Return the updated grid.

```python
def colorBorder(grid, row, col, color):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    original_color = grid[row][col]
    visited = set()
    border_cells = set()

    def is_border(r, c):
        if r == 0 or r == m-1 or c == 0 or c == n-1:
            return True
        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] != original_color:
                return True
        return False

    def dfs(r, c):
        visited.add((r, c))
        if is_border(r, c):
            border_cells.add((r, c))
        for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and (nr, nc) not in visited and grid[nr][nc] == original_color:
                dfs(nr, nc)

    dfs(row, col)
    
    for r, c in border_cells:
        grid[r][c] = color
    
    return grid
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. In the worst case, we might need to visit all cells in the grid.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the `visited` and `border_cells` sets.

This approach ensures that all steps are methodically followed to achieve an accurate solution to the problem.
