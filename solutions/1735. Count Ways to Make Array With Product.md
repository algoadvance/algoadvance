title:  Count Ways to Make Array With Product-out
permalink: /s1735
---

You are given a 2D array of integers `queries` where `queries[i] = [n_i, k_i]`. For each query `(n_i, k_i)`:

- You are to determine the number of different sequences of length `k_i` that can be created using the numbers from `1` to `n_i` so that their product is equal to a given target product.

Given that the answer to each query can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a limit to the number of queries?**
   No, the problem does not specify a limit, so we assume it can vary.
   
2. **Are the sequences ordered or unordered?**
   The sequences are considered as ordered sequences.
   
3. **Can the sequences include repeated elements?**
   Yes, the sequences can include repeated elements.
   
4. **What's the target product we need to achieve in the sequences?**
   This is implicitly implied but not explicitly mentioned in the problem, so we must assume multiple interpretations or confirm details if we can.

## Strategy

This problem appears complex due to the combination of factors like sequences of products and modulo operations. Here's a detailed approach:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   Products are easier analyzed when factorized. Decomposing target product into prime factors helps simplify generating combinations.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
   DP can be used to store intermediate results avoiding recomputation. Using combinatorics and number theory especially when considering division of products into k parts.

3. **Combinatorics:**
   The combinatorial aspect can be solved using multinomial coefficients to calculate ways to distribute prime powers.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Precompute Factorials:**
   Precompute factorials up to the largest possible number for combinatorial calculations to speed up the process.

2. **Handle Each Query:**
   For each `(n_i, k_i)`, iterate through combinatorial possibilities considering prime factor distributions.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   Since results can be large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` at various steps to keep the numbers manageable.

### Code

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
    fac = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    ifac = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
        fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % MOD
    ifac[max_n] = pow(fac[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
    for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
        ifac[i] = ifac[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    return fac, ifac

def query_factors(primes, k, fac, ifac):
    result = 1
    for _, count in primes.items():
        result = result * ifac[k] % MOD
        result = result * fac[count + k - 1] % MOD
        result = result * ifac[count] % MOD
    return result % MOD

factorials, inv_factorials = factorials_and_inverses(10000)

def count_ways_to_make_array_with_product(queries):
    res = []
    for n, k in queries:
        fact_count = {}
        t = k
        d = 2
        while d * d <= t:
            while t % d == 0:
                if d not in fact_count:
                    fact_count[d] = 0
                fact_count[d] += 1
                t //= d
            d += 1
        if t > 1:
            if t not in fact_count:
                fact_count[t] = 0
            fact_count[t] += 1
        res.append(query_factors(fact_count, n, factorials, inv_factorials))
    return res

# Example usage with a list of queries
queries = [[100, 2], [81, 3]]
print(count_ways_to_make_array_with_product(queries))
```

## Time Complexity

- **Factorial precomputation:** `O(max_n)`
- **Prime factorization (per query):** `O(sqrt(k_i))`
- **Overall complexity per query:** The complexity per query is `O(k_i + log(queries-i))` for each of the operations involving prime factor distribution.

Apply this strategy to register solutions for each query efficiently.
