title:  Scramble String-out

We need to determine if one string can be transformed into another string using a series of operations. Specifically, we have the following rules:

A string `s` can be transformed into `t` by recursively applying the following steps:
1. Split the string `s` into two non-empty substrings `s1` and `s2`.
2. Swap `s1` and `s2`.
3. Optionally, scramble `s1` and `s2` recursively by applying the above steps on each of them.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, determine if `s1` is a scrambled string of `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Format:** Are both input strings guaranteed to be of the same length?
   - Yes, both strings `s1` and `s2` will be of the same length.
   
2. **Character Set:** Are there any restrictions on the characters within the strings?
   - No, the strings can contain any characters.

3. **Output Format:** What should be the return type of the solution?
   - The return type should be a boolean: `True` if `s1` is a scrambled string of `s2`, and `False` otherwise.

### Strategy:

The idea to solve this problem using a recursive approach can be split into following steps:
1. **Base Case**:
   - If `s1` is equal to `s2`, return `True`.
   - If the sorted strings of `s1` and `s2` are not the same, return `False` (since they must have the same characters).

2. **Recursive Check**:
   - For each possible split point, check both the swapped and non-swapped condition recursively:
     - Check if splitting `s1` into `s1[:i]` and `s1[i:]` and comparing to the same split (both parts match) of `s2`.
     - Check if splitting `s1` into `s1[:i]` and `s1[i:]` and comparing to the swapped split (`s1[:i]` compares to `s2[-i:]` and `s1[i:]` to `s2[:-i]`) of `s2`.

### Code:

```python
def isScramble(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    # Base case: If the two strings are equal
    if s1 == s2:
        return True
    
    # If lengths are different or the sorted characters differ, return False
    if len(s1) != len(s2) or sorted(s1) != sorted(s2):
        return False
    
    n = len(s1)
    
    # Recursively check all possible splits
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Non-swapped case
        if isScramble(s1[:i], s2[:i]) and isScramble(s1[i:], s2[i:]):
            return True
        # Swapped case
        if isScramble(s1[:i], s2[-i:]) and isScramble(s1[i:], s2[:-i]):
            return True
    
    return False
```

### Time Complexity:

The recursive approach can be very costly in terms of time complexity due to overlapping subproblems and recomputation:

- Without memoization, the time complexity is `O(n!)` where `n` is the length of the string, because each of the `n` splits generates subproblems.
- This can be optimized using memoization or dynamic programming techniques, potentially bringing the complexity closer to `O(n^4)` by storing results of subproblems, which avoids redundant computations.

For the current solution:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * 4^n)` in the worst case scenario.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^3)` due to recursive stack and memoization (if applied).
