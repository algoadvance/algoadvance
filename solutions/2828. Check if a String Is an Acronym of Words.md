title:  Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words-out
permalink: /s2828
---

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `s`. Determine if `s` is an acronym of `words`. An acronym is formed by taking the first letter of each word in `words` in order and concatenating them together.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the length of `words` and `s`?
   - Are there any constraints on the characters in `words` and `s` (e.g., only lowercase/uppercase letters)?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return a boolean value indicating whether `s` is an acronym of `words`?

3. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Is the comparison case-sensitive?

Given these questions, a typical response might look like:
- You can assume `1 <= len(words) <= 100` and `1 <= len(word) <= 100` for each word in `words`.
- `s` would have a length `len(s) <= len(words)`.
- Characters are only alphabetic and case-sensitive.

### Strategy

1. **Extract Initials:**
   - Iterate through each word in `words` and form a new string by concatenating the first character of each word.

2. **Compare with `s`:**
   - Compare the concatenated string of initials with `s`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of words since we need to iterate through all words to collect the initials.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the initials string which will be at most the same length as `s`.

### Code

```python
def isAcronym(words: [str], s: str) -> bool:
    # Generate the acronym from the first letters of words
    acronym = ''.join(word[0] for word in words)
    
    # Compare the generated acronym with the input string s
    return acronym == s
```

### Explanation

1. **Generation of Acronym:**
   - `''.join(word[0] for word in words)` generates a string consisting of the first letter of each word in the `words` list.

2. **Comparison:**
   - Simply compare the generated acronym to `s`.

This approach is straightforward and efficient given the problem constraints.
