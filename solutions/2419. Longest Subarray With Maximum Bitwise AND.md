title:  Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND-out
permalink: /s2419
---
You are given an array of integers `nums`. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Return the length of the longest subarray with the maximum bitwise AND.

#### Example
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The subarrays [3,3] have the maximum possible bitwise AND value.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array is always non-empty.
2. **Are there negative numbers in the array?**
   - No, the problem constraints specify that `nums` contains non-negative integers.
3. **What is the expected range for the length of the array?**
   - Typically, `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.
4. **What is the value range of elements in the array?**
   - Elements are non-negative integers typically within the range of standard 32-bit integers.

### Strategy
1. **Determine the Maximum Value:**
   - First, we need to find the maximum value in the array since the bitwise AND of any subarray that has the highest possible value can only include numbers equal to the maximum value.

2. **Find the Longest Subarray:**
   - Once we know this maximum value, we can iterate through the array to find the longest contiguous sequence of this maximum value.

3. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Maintain a counter to track the length of the current subarray of maximum values. Update the global maximum length whenever a longer subarray is found.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def longestSubarray(nums):
    max_val = max(nums)
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num == max_val:
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 0

    return max_length
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding Maximum Value:** `O(n)`
- **Finding Longest Subarray:** `O(n)`
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(n)`

The overall time complexity is linear, which is optimal for input sizes up to `10^5`.

### Explanation of Code
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_val`: Stores the maximum value in the array.
   - `max_length`: Tracks the length of the longest contiguous subarray of `max_val`.
   - `current_length`: Tracks the length of the current subarray of `max_val` being considered.

2. **Iterate Through Array:**
   - For each element `num` in `nums`, check if it is equal to `max_val`.
   - If true, increment `current_length`.
   - Update `max_length` if `current_length` exceeds it.
   - If `num` is not equal to `max_val`, reset `current_length` to zero.

3. **Return Result:**
   - The `max_length` at the end of the iteration will be the length of the longest subarray with the maximum bitwise AND value.

This approach efficiently finds the solution by leveraging a single pass through the array.
