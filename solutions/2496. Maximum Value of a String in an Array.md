title:  Maximum Value of a String in an Array-out
permalink: /s2496
---
You are given an array of strings. Each string can either be a word or a number. The task is to find out the maximum value among these strings. The value of a string is calculated as follows:
- If it contains only digits (0-9), its value is the integer representation of the string.
- Otherwise, its value is the length of the string.

Your goal is to return the maximum value among all the strings in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the strings contain leading zeros if they are numerical values?
2. Are we guaranteed that the input array is non-empty?
3. Can there be negative numbers or non-digit, non-alphabet characters in the strings?

### Strategy
1. Iterate over each string in the array.
2. Check if the string contains only digits using the `str.isdigit()` method.
3. If the string contains only digits, convert it to an integer and consider it as its value.
4. If the string contains any non-digit characters, calculate its value based on its length.
5. Maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum value encountered during the iteration.
6. Return the maximum value after checking all the strings.

### Code
Here is the Python implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def max_value_in_array(arr):
    max_val = float('-inf')
    
    for s in arr:
        if s.isdigit():
            value = int(s)
        else:
            value = len(s)
        
        if value > max_val:
            max_val = value
    
    return max_val

# Example usage:
arr = ["123", "word", "4567", "longestword", "789"]
print(max_value_in_array(arr))  # Output should consider the maximum value based on explained criteria
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with `max_val` being negative infinity to handle comparisons correctly while iterating.
2. **Iteration and Condition**: For each string, determine if it is numeric using `isdigit()`.
3. **Value Assignment**:
   - If numeric, convert to integer.
   - Otherwise, determine the string length.
4. **Max Value Update**: Compare and update the `max_val` accordingly.
5. **Return Result**: After traversing all strings, return the `max_val`.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)** where n is the number of strings in the array. Each string is processed in constant time.

This solution efficiently calculates the desired maximum value while ensuring clarity and correctness through a straightforward algorithm.
