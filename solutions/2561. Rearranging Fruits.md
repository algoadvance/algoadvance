title:  Rearranging Fruits-out
permalink: /s2561

You are given two arrays `basket1` and `basket2` each representing the fruits in two baskets. The goal is to make these two baskets contain the same type of fruits with the same frequencies by swapping elements between the baskets or within a basket. Minimize the total number of swaps required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a valid swap?** Is the swap only between the elements of the two baskets, or within the basket itself as well?
2. **What are the possible values of basket elements?** Are there any constraints on the values in the baskets?
3. **Are there any limit constraints on the array sizes?** What are the maximum and minimum lengths of the arrays?
4. **Should the final arrays maintain the original element's order?**

## Example

Suppose:
- `basket1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `basket2 = [4, 3, 2, 1]`

You should be able to swap elements between the baskets to ensure both `basket1` and `basket2` end up with the same types and counts of fruits.

## Strategy

1. **Create Frequency Maps:** Create frequency maps for both baskets to count occurrences of each fruit type.
2. **Compare Frequencies:** Check if the total frequency of each type of fruit in both baskets matches.
3. **Calculate Differences:** Calculate the number of each type of fruit needed to equalize frequencies between `basket1` and `basket2`.
4. **Perform Swaps:** Use those calculations to determine the minimum number of swaps needed.

## Time Complexity

- Creating the frequency maps will take \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the baskets.
- Comparing frequencies will also take \(O(n)\).
- Performing the swaps based on frequency differences will take \(O(n)\).

Overall time complexity will be \(O(n)\).

## Implementation

Here is the Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def min_swaps_to_equalize_baskets(basket1, basket2):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Create frequency maps for both baskets
    freq1 = Counter(basket1)
    freq2 = Counter(basket2)
    
    # Step 2: Check if total fruit counts match
    if sum(freq1.values()) != sum(freq2.values()):
        return -1  # If the total counts don't match, equalizing is impossible
    
    # Step 3: Calculate differences in frequencies
    diff1 = {}
    diff2 = {}
    
    # Create a full set of unique fruits in both baskets
    all_fruits = set(freq1.keys()).union(set(freq2.keys()))
    
    for fruit in all_fruits:
        count1 = freq1.get(fruit, 0)
        count2 = freq2.get(fruit, 0)
        if count1 > count2:
            diff1[fruit] = count1 - count2
        elif count2 > count1:
            diff2[fruit] = count2 - count1
    
    # Step 4: Perform swaps
    swaps = 0
    
    # Minimizing the swaps
    for fruit in diff1:
        if fruit in diff2:
            swaps_needed = min(diff1[fruit], diff2[fruit])
            swaps += swaps_needed
            diff1[fruit] -= swaps_needed
            diff2[fruit] -= swaps_needed
    
    # Check remaining differences
    if any(diff1.values()) or any(diff2.values()):
        # There are still some differences that couldn't be resolved
        return -1
    
    return swaps

# Example usage
basket1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
basket2 = [4, 3, 2, 1]
print(min_swaps_to_equalize_baskets(basket1, basket2))  # Output: 2
```

In this implementation:
- A Counter is used to tally the occurrences of each fruit.
- Differences in counts are used to calculate the necessary swaps.
- The final number of swaps required is returned. If it's not possible to equalize the baskets, the function will return `-1`.
