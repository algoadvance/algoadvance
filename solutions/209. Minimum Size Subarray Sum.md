title:  Minimum Size Subarray Sum-out
permalink: /s209
---
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

Example 1:
```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```
Example 3:
```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array `nums` be empty?
   - No, as per the problem constraints, `nums` will always contain at least one positive integer.
2. Will `target` always be a positive integer?
   - Yes, `target` is guaranteed to be positive.
3. How large can `nums` be?
   - The problem will likely specify constraints for the length of `nums` when given in a real setting. Common constraints can be \(10^5\) or \(10^6\).

### Strategy
We will use the **sliding window**/two-pointer technique for this problem. This involves maintaining a window defined by two pointers (`left` and `right`) that will efficiently find the minimal length subarray with the sum greater than or equal to `target`.

1. **Initialize**:
   - Two pointers: `left` starting at the beginning of the array, and `right` iterating through the array.
   - A variable `current_sum` to store the current subarray sum.
   - A variable `min_length` to store the minimal length of valid subarrays. Set it initially to infinity (`float('inf')`).

2. **Expand the Window**:
   - Iterate with `right` over the array and add `nums[right]` to `current_sum`.

3. **Shrink the Window**:
   - While `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, try to shrink the window by moving `left` to the right and updating `current_sum` accordingly. Also, update `min_length` with the smaller length found.

4. **Check Result**:
   - After exiting the loop, if `min_length` is still infinity, no valid subarray was found. Return 0.
   - Otherwise, return `min_length`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the array `nums`. This is because each element is processed at most twice, once by `right` and once by `left`.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def minSubArrayLen(target, nums):
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        
        while current_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
    
    return 0 if min_length == float('inf') else min_length

# Example usage
print(minSubArrayLen(7, [2,3,1,2,4,3]))  # Output: 2
print(minSubArrayLen(4, [1,4,4]))        # Output: 1
print(minSubArrayLen(11, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]))  # Output: 0
```
