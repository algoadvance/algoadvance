title:  Replace Non-Coprime Numbers in Array-out
permalink: /s2197
---

You are given an array of integers, `nums`. Perform the following operations on `nums` in order:
1. Find the first adjacent pair of elements in `nums` that are not coprime.
2. Replace the pair with their least common multiple (LCM).
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all adjacent pairs in `nums` are coprime.
4. Return the modified `nums`.

Two integers `a` and `b` are coprime if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is 1.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Non-Coprime Elements**: We need to iterate through the array and find the first adjacent pair that are not coprime. 
2. **Compute LCM and Replace**: Replace this pair with their LCM using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // GCD(a, b)`.
3. **Iterate Until Fully Coprime**: Keep iterating until all adjacent pairs are coprime.

To make this efficient, we can use a stack to maintain the numbers and continually check the top two numbers for coprimeness as we traverse through the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the elements in the list (possible values of integers)?
   - What are the size constraints on the input list?

2. **Output Format**:
   - Should we handle any specific edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with single element?

Based on the typical constraints for competitive programming, letâ€™s assume we are working with reasonably large integer values and array sizes.

### Code

Here is a Python solution using a stack-based approach:

```python
import math
from typing import List

def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def lcm(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)

def replaceNonCoprimes(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    
    for num in nums:
        stack.append(num)
        while len(stack) > 1 and gcd(stack[-1], stack[-2]) > 1:
            a = stack.pop()
            b = stack.pop()
            stack.append(lcm(a, b))
    
    return stack
```

### Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation**: Calculating the GCD of two numbers takes \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **LCM Calculation**: Given the GCD, calculating the LCM is an \(O(1)\) operation since it only involves multiplication and division.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: Each element can be pushed and popped from the stack at most once, so the overall time complexity is dominated by the GCD calculations, which results in \(O(n \log(\text{max}(nums)))\).

This approach ensures that we only make passes over the input list, making it both time and space efficient.
