title:  Gas Station-out

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i-th` station is represented by `gas[i]`, and the cost to travel from the `i-th` station to the `(i+1)-th` station is represented by `cost[i]`. 

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank, and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i-th` gas station to the `(i+1)-th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the input arrays?**
   - The arrays `gas` and `cost` will have the same non-negative length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

2. **Can the gas and cost values be zero?**
   - Yes, both `gas[i]` and `cost[i]` can be zero.

3. **Is the solution always unique if it exists?**
   - Yes, if there is a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

### Strategy

1. **Observation**:
   - If the total gas available is less than the total cost to travel, it is impossible to complete the circuit.

2. **Approach**:
   - Calculate the total gas available and the total cost required. If total gas is less than total cost, return `-1`.
   - Traverse the gas stations while keeping track of the current tank. Start with an empty tank and iterate through each gas station.
   - If at any point the tank becomes negative, reset the starting gas station to the next one.
   - The rationale behind this is that if you can't get from `i` to `i+1`, none of the stations before `i` can be the starting point.
   - Continue until you find a valid starting point or determine it's impossible.

### Code

```python
def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):
    total_gas, total_cost = 0, 0
    tank, start_index = 0, 0
    
    for i in range(len(gas)):
        total_gas += gas[i]
        total_cost += cost[i]
        tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
        
        # If tank is negative, reset the start position
        if tank < 0:
            start_index = i + 1
            tank = 0
    
    # If total gas is less than total cost, it's impossible
    return start_index if total_gas >= total_cost else -1
```

### Time Complexity

The solution works in a single pass through the list, so the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of gas stations. 

### Summary

- We first check if the total gas available is at least as much as the total cost to ensure the trip is feasible.
- Then, we find the starting station by ensuring at any point if we can't proceed, we reset the starting point.
- This efficiently determines the starting point in linear time.
