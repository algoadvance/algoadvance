title:  Sum of Squares of Special Elements -out
permalink: /s2778
---

You are given a 1-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

An element `nums[i]` of `nums` is called **special** if `i` divides `n`, i.e. `n % i == 0`.

Return the **sum of the squares** of all **special elements** of `nums`.

### Example:
```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 17

Explanation:
- nums[1] is special as 4 % 1 == 0 -> 1^2
- nums[2] is special as 4 % 2 == 0 -> 2^2
- nums[4] is special as 4 % 4 == 0 -> 4^2
- Sum of squares = 1^2 + 2^2 + 4^2 = 17
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` contain negative integers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative integers.

2. **What is the minimum and maximum value of `n`?**
   - Minimum `n` is 1. There's no specific maximum value given, but you can assume typical constraints for such problems on LeetCode.

3. **Are the elements of `nums` always integers?**
   - Yes, `nums` contains integers as per the problem description.

4. **Do we need to handle invalid input cases?**
   - It is typically safe to assume that the input will be valid as per the problem constraints in a competitive programming context.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Special Elements:**
   - Traverse the array and check the indices `i` (1-indexed). If `n % i == 0`, the element `nums[i-1]` (since the array is 0-indexed in Python) is a special element.

2. **Calculate Sum of Squares:**
   - For each special element, compute its square and maintain a running sum.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - After processing all the elements, return the final computed sum.

## Code

Here's the implementation based on the strategy:

```python
def sum_of_squares(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum_of_squares += nums[i - 1] ** 2
    return sum_of_squares

# Example Usage
print(sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 17
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - The algorithm traverses the array once, and for each element, performs a constant time operation (checking divisibility and computing the square).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - Only a few extra variables are used to maintain the running sum, making the space complexity constant.
