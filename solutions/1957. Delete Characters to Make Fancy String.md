Leetcode Problem #1957: Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

Given a string `s`, a *fancy string* is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal. Return the longest possible fancy string that can be obtained by deleting some characters from `s`. 

### Example:
- **Input:** `s = "leeetcode"`
- **Output:** `"leetcode"`

- **Input:** `s = "aaabaaaa"`
- **Output:** `"aabaa"`

- **Input:** `s = "aab"`
- **Output:** `"aab"`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string `s` be empty?
   - No, per the constraints, the length of `s` is at least 1.
2. Are we allowed to manipulate the input string in place?
   - Modifying in place is not necessary. We can use additional space if needed.
3. Are there any restrictions on the characters in `s`?
   - The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
1. Use a list to build the resulting fancy string. We will append characters from `s` to this list while ensuring no three consecutive characters are the same.
2. Iterate through the input string `s` while simultaneously filling the resultant list based on the fancy string criterion.
3. For each character `s[i]`:
   - Check if the last two characters in the resultant list are the same as `s[i]`.
   - If they are not, append `s[i]` to the resultant list.
   - If they are same, skip `s[i]`.
4. After iterating through the input string, join the resultant list to form the final fancy string and return it.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the above approach:

```python
def makeFancyString(s: str) -> str:
    if len(s) < 3:
        return s
    
    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the resultant fancy string characters
    
    # Iterate through the given string
    for char in s:
        # Check if last two characters in the result list are the same as the current character
        if len(result) < 2 or not (result[-1] == char and result[-2] == char):
            result.append(char)  # append the current character if the condition is satisfied
    
    return ''.join(result)  # Convert list to string

# Example usage:
print(makeFancyString("leeetcode"))  # Output: "leetcode"
print(makeFancyString("aaabaaaa"))   # Output: "aabaa"
print(makeFancyString("aab"))        # Output: "aab"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, we might store the entire input string in the result list.

By following the above methodology, we ensure the resultant string is the longest possible fancy string as required.
