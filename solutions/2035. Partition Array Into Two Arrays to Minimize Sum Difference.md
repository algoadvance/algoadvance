title:  Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference-out
permalink: /s2035
---

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `2n`. You need to partition `nums` into two arrays of length `n` to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the two arrays. Return the minimum possible absolute difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on array values**:
   - Are the elements of the input array `nums` all integers? Are there any constraints on the range of these integers?

2. **Sum calculation**:
   - Do we need to worry about any special sums (square sums, product sums) or just the regular sums of the array elements?

3. **Constraints on partitioning**:
   - Should the elements be contiguous in the resulting subarrays or can they be any `n` elements from the original array?

4. **Expected output format**:
   - Should the return value be just the minimized absolute difference?

### Code

```python
def minimumDifference(nums):
    n = len(nums) // 2
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    target = total_sum // 2

    def subset_sums(arr):
        n = len(arr)
        result = {0}
        for num in arr:
            result |= {num + x for x in result}
        return result

    left_sub = subset_sums(nums[:n])
    right_sub = subset_sums(nums[n:])
    
    min_diff = float("inf")
    for left_sum in left_sub:
        r_target = target - left_sum
        nearest_right_sum = min(right_sub, key=lambda x: abs(x - r_target))
        current_diff = abs(total_sum - 2 * (left_sum + nearest_right_sum))
        min_diff = min(min_diff, current_diff)
    
    return min_diff

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 9, 7, 3]
print(minimumDifference(nums))  # Output: 2
```

### Strategy

1. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Split the original array `nums` into two halves. Each half will be considered separately.

2. **Subset Sums Calculation**:
   - Generate all possible sums of subsets for both the left and right halves. This is facilitated by the `subset_sums` function.

3. **Closest Sum Matching**:
   - For each subset sum from the left half, find the closest possible subset sum from the right half that, when combined, is closest to the half of the total sum.

4. **Minimum Difference Calculation**:
   - Calculate the difference for each subset pairing and track the minimum difference.

### Time Complexity

- **Generating subset sums**: Each `subset_sums` call operates in O(2^(n/2) * (n/2)) where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Finding the nearest right sum for each left sum**: This part involves processing each potential sum from the left set against the right set, making the key computational task similar to subset sum calculation.

Thus the total time complexity summarily combines to O(2^n * n) when explored in the worst-case scenario for generating subset sums and computing differences.
