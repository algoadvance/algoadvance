title:  Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings-out
permalink: /s2472
---

You need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping palindrome substrings in a given string `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. You can only consider substrings of a minimum length `k` as valid substrings for your answer.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What is the range of the length of string `s` (denoted by \( n \)) and the minimum length \( k \)?
   - Usually, strings might range from 1 to 1000 in length for interview problems.
   
2. **Output:** In what format should the result be returned?
   - Return a single integer representing the maximum number of non-overlapping palindromic substrings.

3. **Palindromes:** Clarify that single characters are only considered if \( k = 1 \).
   - For \( k = 1 \), any single character is considered as a valid palindrome.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the following steps can be followed:

1. **Palindrome Check:** First, we need a helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome.
2. **Dynamic Programming and Greedy Approach:**
    - Use a 2D dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
    - Traverse the input string from the beginning, and try to find the first palindrome of a valid length (â‰¥ k). Record its end index.
    - Continue this process, always starting from the end index + 1 of the last found palindrome, to ensure non-overlapping.
   
### Time Complexity
- Building the DP table will take \( O(n^2) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string.
- Finding the non-overlapping palindromes will take \( O(n) \).

### Code

```python
def maxPalindromes(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    def is_palindrome(start, end):
        while start < end:
            if s[start] != s[end]:
                return False
            start += 1
            end -= 1
        return True
    
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True
    
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for start in range(n - length + 1):
            end = start + length - 1
            if length == 2:
                dp[start][end] = (s[start] == s[end])
            else:
                dp[start][end] = (s[start] == s[end] and dp[start + 1][end - 1])
    
    count = 0
    i = 0
    while i <= n - k:
        found = False
        for j in range(i + k - 1, n):
            if dp[i][j]:
                count += 1
                i = j + 1
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            i += 1
            
    return count
```

### Explanation
1. **is_palindrome function:** Checks if a substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends moving inward.
2. **DP Table Initialization:** The dp table is initialized where `dp[i][i] = True` since single characters are palindromes.
3. **Building DP Table:**
    - For length 2 substrings, `dp[i][j]` is true if `s[i] == s[j]`.
    - For longer substrings, `dp[i][j]` is true if the characters at both ends are equal, and the substring inside them is also a palindrome.
4. **Counting Non-overlapping Palindromes:**
    - Traverse the string and use each palindrome found to update the starting index to the end of the last found palindrome plus one to ensure non-overlapping.

This code thus efficiently finds and counts the maximum number of non-overlapping palindromes of length at least \( k \).
