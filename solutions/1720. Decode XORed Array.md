title:  Decode XORed Array-out

A problem titled "1720. Decode XORed Array" from Leetcode requires the following:

> There is a hidden integer array `arr` that consists of `n` non-negative integers.
>
> It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`. For example, given the original array `arr = [1,0,2,1]`, the encoded array would be `encoded = [1,2,3]`.
>
> You are given the `encoded` array. It is guaranteed that the first element of the original array is `first`, which is provided.
>
> Return the original array `arr`. 

### Example

- **Example 1:**
    ```plaintext
    Input: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1
    Output: [1,0,2,1]
    Explanation: 
    If arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1, 2, 3]
    ```
    
- **Example 2:**
    ```plaintext
    Input: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4
    Output: [4,2,0,7,4]
    ```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `encoded` array contain negative integers?
   **A:** According to the problem statement, `arr` consists of non-negative integers, and the XOR operation between non-negative integers will also result in non-negative integers.

2. **Q:** Is the length of `encoded` array always at least 1?
   **A:** Yes, because `encoded` is derived from `arr` which has at least two elements.

3. **Q:** What is the maximum size of the `encoded` array?
   **A:** Typically, interview problems follow constraints similar to Leetcode's limits, i.e., up to 100,000 elements.

### Strategy

To decode the XORed array, we need to reverse the encoding process. Given that:
\[ encoded[i] = arr[i] \oplus arr[i+1] \]

We can deduce:
\[ arr[i+1] = encoded[i] \oplus arr[i] \]

Starting with the first element known as `first`, we can compute each subsequent element of `arr` iteratively.

### Code

```python
def decode(encoded, first):
    # Initialize the result array with the first element
    arr = [first]
    
    # Iteratively decode each element using the XOR operation
    for i in range(len(encoded)):
        # The next element is obtained by XOR-ing the current element in arr with encoded[i]
        next_element = arr[-1] ^ encoded[i]
        arr.append(next_element)
    
    return arr

# Example usage
encoded = [1, 2, 3]
first = 1
print(decode(encoded, first))  # Output: [1, 0, 2, 1]

encoded = [6, 2, 7, 3]
first = 4
print(decode(encoded, first))  # Output: [4, 2, 0, 7, 4]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We iterate through the `encoded` array once to compute the elements of `arr`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We store the `arr` array which has the same length as `encoded` plus one, i.e., `n`.

This solution ensures the efficient decoding of the XORed array by leveraging the properties of XOR operation.
