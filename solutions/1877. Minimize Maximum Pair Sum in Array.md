title:  Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array-out
permalink: /s1877
---

Given an array `nums` of even length `n`, you need to find and return the minimum possible value of the maximum pair sum of the array. The pair sum for a pair `(a,b)` is defined as `a + b`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the elements in the array?**
   - This is not explicitly stated, but typically array elements are integers within a specified range.
   
2. **What is the range of the array length `n`?**
   - The problem states that the array length is even, but it would be useful to know the upper limits in terms of performance considerations.

3. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - The problem does not specify, but we will assume the array can contain negative numbers as it does not inherently change the problem nature.

4. **Should the solution involve modifying the input array?**
   - Ideally, the solution should preserve the input array if not explicitly allowed to alter it.

### Strategy

To minimize the maximum pair sum, we should aim to pair the smallest and the largest elements together, as this helps to distribute the values more evenly and avoids extremely high sums. 

Here is a step-by-step strategy:
1. **Sort the array**: This allows us to easily access smallest and largest remaining elements.
2. **Pair elements smartly**: Pair the smallest with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, and so on.
3. **Compute the sums**: Calculate the pair sums and keep track of the maximum pair sum.
4. **Return the result**: The smallest possible maximum pair sum is returned.

### Code

```python
def minPairSum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    max_pair_sum = 0
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        max_pair_sum = max(max_pair_sum, nums[left] + nums[right])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return max_pair_sum
```

### Explanation
- **Sorting the array**: `nums.sort()`
  - This step ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest are at the end.
  
- **Initializing the pointers and the result variable**:
  - `left` starts at the beginning of the array and `right` starts at the end.
  - `max_pair_sum` is initialized to `0`.

- **Using a while loop to form pairs**:
  - Calculate the sum of the pair `nums[left] + nums[right]`.
  - Update `max_pair_sum` if the current pair sum is greater.
  - Move `left` pointer to the right and `right` pointer to the left.

- **Returning the result**:
  - The `max_pair_sum` will be the minimized maximum pair sum possible.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)`
- **Pairing and finding maximum**: `O(n)`

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step.

This strategy should efficiently find the minimum possible value of the maximum pair sum for an even-length array.
