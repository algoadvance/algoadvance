title:  Hamming Distance-out

---
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Example:**
```python
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1 (in binary)  = 0001
4 (in binary)  = 0100
The positions where the bits are different are 1 and 3. Therefore, the Hamming distance is 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of the integers**: What are the constraints for the integers `x` and `y`?
   - The integers `x` and `y` will be non-negative and fit within the typical integer range.
   
2. **Input type**: Will the inputs always be integers?
   - Yes, we are guaranteed that `x` and `y` are integers.
  
3. **Output type**: Should the output be an integer representing the Hamming distance?
   - Yes, the output will be an integer.

With this information, we can proceed to the strategy for the solution.

## Strategy
1. **XOR Operation**: Perform an XOR operation on the two integers `x` and `y`. The XOR operation will yield a number where the bits set to `1` represent the positions where the bits of `x` and `y` differ.
2. **Count 1s**: Convert the result of the XOR operation to its binary representation and count the number of `1`s. This count represents the Hamming distance.
  
## Code
```python
def hammingDistance(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    # Perform XOR to get differing bits
    xor_result = x ^ y
    # Convert to binary string and count '1's
    distance = bin(xor_result).count('1')
    return distance
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - Explanation: The XOR operation and counting the number of `1`s in the result (which involves a fixed number of bits for integers) both take constant time. Python handles integers with a fixed bit-length, making the operations effectively `O(1)`.

This completes the solution.
