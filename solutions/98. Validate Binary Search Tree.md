title:  Validate Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s98
---

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the tree be empty? If yes, should we consider it as a valid BST?
2. Are there any constraints on the values stored in the tree nodes?
3. Is the tree guaranteed to be a binary tree?

### Strategy

To validate whether a binary tree is a binary search tree, we can use an in-order traversal. The idea is that for a binary search tree, an in-order traversal should yield values in a strictly increasing order.

Alternatively, we can use a recursive function to ensure that each node meets the BST properties by enclosing the valid range of values for each node based on its position in the tree.

- We will implement the solution using both strategies:
  1. In-order Traversal.
  2. Recursive Range Check.

### Code

#### Strategy 1: In-Order Traversal

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isValidBST(root):
    def inorder(node, arr):
        if not node:
            return
        inorder(node.left, arr)
        arr.append(node.val)
        inorder(node.right, arr)
    
    values = []
    inorder(root, values)
    
    for i in range(1, len(values)):
        if values[i] <= values[i - 1]:
            return false
    return true
```

#### Strategy 2: Recursive Range Check

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isValidBST(root):
    def validate(node, low=float('-inf'), high=float('inf')):
        if not node:
            return True
        if not (low < node.val < high):
            return False
        return (validate(node.left, low, node.val) and
                validate(node.right, node.val, high))
    
    return validate(root)
```

### Time Complexity

#### In-Order Traversal
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because each node is visited exactly once during the in-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) for storing the values of the nodes in the array, plus the space complexity of the recursive stack, which is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree.

#### Recursive Range Check
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursive stack space required.

Both methods efficiently determine whether the binary tree is a valid BST, and each has its own advantages in terms of implementation simplicity and space efficiency.
