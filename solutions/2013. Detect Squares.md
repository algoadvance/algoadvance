title:  Detect Squares-out

You are given a stream of points (x, y) on a 2D plane. Implement a data structure that supports the following operations:

1. `add(point)`: Adds the point `(x, y)` to the data structure.
2. `count(point)`: Returns the number of squares whose diagonal is parallel to the x and y axes and whose one vertex is `(x, y)` and the other three vertices are points previously added to the data structure.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the points always be integers?
   - Yes, the points are given as tuples of integers `(x, y)`.
2. Can the same point be added multiple times, and should it be counted multiple times when forming squares?
   - Yes, the same point can be added multiple times, and each occurrence should be considered when forming squares.
3. What are the constraints on the coordinates of the points?
   - Typically, the constraints could be within the range of a typical 2D grid, like 0 to 1000 for each coordinate, but let's confirm if there are specific constraints given by the problem.

### Strategy
To implement the `DetectSquares` class, we need to:
1. Maintain a count of each point added.
2. When counting squares for a given point, check all potential points that could form a square with the given point as one of its vertices.

#### Data Structure
1. We will use a dictionary `points_count` where the key will be a tuple `(x, y)` and the value will be the frequency of that point.

#### Add Operation
- Increment the count of the given point in the dictionary.

#### Count Operation
- For the given point `(x, y)`, iterate over all points `(x2, y2)` in the dictionary.
- Check for potential squares by ensuring `(x, y2)`, `(x2, y)`, and `(x2, y2)` are part of the points previously added.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class DetectSquares:

    def __init__(self):
        self.points_count = defaultdict(int)

    def add(self, point: [int, int]) -> None:
        self.points_count[tuple(point)] += 1

    def count(self, point: [int, int]) -> int:
        x1, y1 = point
        total_squares = 0
        
        for (x3, y3), cnt in self.points_count.items():
            if x1 != x3 and abs(x1 - x3) == abs(y1 - y3):  # Check for potential square diagonals
                total_squares += cnt * self.points_count[(x1, y3)] * self.points_count[(x3, y1)]
        
        return total_squares

# Example usage:
# obj = DetectSquares()
# obj.add([3, 10])
# obj.add([11, 2])
# obj.add([3, 2])
# print(obj.count([11, 10]))  # It should print 1 if there is one square
# obj.add([0, 0])
# print(obj.count([0, 0]))  # It should print 0 if there are no squares
```

### Time Complexity
- `add(point)`: O(1) because it simply increments the count in a dictionary.
- `count(point)`:
  - Let `n` be the number of unique points added so far.
  - Each coordinate pair `(x3, y3)` is iterated once, hence the time complexity is O(n).

This should be sufficient and performant within typical constraints. If there is a specific constraint on the number of points or coordinate values, optimization strategies can be adjusted accordingly.
