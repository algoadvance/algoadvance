title:  Largest 1-Bordered Square-out
permalink: /s1139
---

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix grid, where 1 represents a cell containing a 1 and 0 represents a cell containing a 0. Return the side length of the largest square containing only 1's that is bordered by 1's.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are the dimensions of the matrix `m` and `n` always positive integers?
   - What is the maximum size for `m` and `n`?
2. **Expected Output:**
   - If there is no square surrounded by 1's, should the function return 0?
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle edge cases such as an empty matrix or a matrix filled with only 0's?

With these clarifications out of the way, we can proceed to develop a strategy to solve the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Use prefix sum arrays to precompute the number of consecutive 1's up to each cell from left to right (`left`) and from top to bottom (`top`).

2. **Square Checking:**
   - Iterate through every possible square size starting from the largest possible size down to 1. For each possible square, use the prefix sum arrays to quickly check if all four borders contain only 1's.

3. **Optimization:**
   - By using prefix sum arrays, checking if a border consists only of 1's becomes efficient and can be done in constant time.

### Code

```python
def largest1BorderedSquare(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    if not m or not n:
        return 0

    # Initialize prefix sum arrays
    left = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    top = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Populate prefix sums
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                left[i][j] = left[i][j - 1] + 1 if j > 0 else 1
                top[i][j] = top[i - 1][j] + 1 if i > 0 else 1
    
    max_side = 0
    
    # Iterate from the largest possible square side to 1
    for side in range(min(m, n), 0, -1):
        for i in range(m - side + 1):
            for j in range(n - side + 1):
                if (left[i][j + side - 1] >= side and 
                    left[i + side - 1][j + side - 1] >= side and 
                    top[i + side - 1][j] >= side and 
                    top[i + side - 1][j + side - 1] >= side):
                    max_side = max(max_side, side)
                    
    return max_side**2

# Example usage
grid = [
    [1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
print(largest1BorderedSquare(grid))  # Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** `O(m * n)` to initialize and populate the prefix sum arrays.
- **Square Checking:** For each potential square size (from the largest to the smallest), in the worst-case scenario, we check all positions in the matrix. This results in a nested loop of complexity `O(m * n)` for checking each side length.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)` due to the two main phases: prefix sum calculation and square checking within those precomputed sums.

### Conclusion

This approach effectively reduces the complexity of checking the borders of squares by leveraging precomputed prefix sums, bringing the problem within feasible limits for typical input sizes.
