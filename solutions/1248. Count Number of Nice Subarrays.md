title:  Count Number of Nice Subarrays-out
permalink: /s1248
---
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of **nice subarrays**.

A **nice subarray** is defined as a subarray that contains exactly `k` odd numbers.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarrays ([1,1,2,1], [1,2,1,1]) have exactly 3 odd numbers.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the value of `k` be larger than the length of the array? 
   - This would mean no possible subarray could contain `k` odd numbers.
2. Are the elements of the array guaranteed to be integers, and can they be negative?
   - (Assuming all elements are integers based on typical problem constraints.)

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
1. **Transform the Problem**: Create a modified version of the `nums` array where each element is `0` if it is even and `1` if it is odd. This reduces our problem to a known problem of finding subarrays with a given sum (`k`).
2. **Prefix Sum and HashMap**: Utilize a prefix sum array (`prefix_counts`) to keep track of the sum of elements up to the current index and use a hashmap to store the counts of these prefix sums. This aids in efficiently finding the number of subarrays with the required sum.

### Code Implementation
Here's the Python code:

```python
def numberOfSubarrays(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sums = {0: 1}
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num % 2  # Transforms transformation of num to 0 or 1
        
        if current_sum - k in prefix_sums:
            count += prefix_sums[current_sum - k]
            
        prefix_sums[current_sum] = prefix_sums.get(current_sum, 0) + 1
        
    return count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
k = 3
print(numberOfSubarrays(nums, k))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation
1. **Transformation**: `num % 2` converts even numbers to `0` and odd numbers to `1`.
2. **Prefix Sum and HashMap**:
   - `prefix_sums` stores the frequency of each prefix sum.
   - `current_sum` tracks the cumulative sum of transformed values.
   - For each number in `nums`, the presence of `(current_sum - k)` in `prefix_sums` determines if there's a subarray ending at the current index with exactly `k` odd numbers.
   - Update `prefix_sums` with the current prefix sum after checking.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. We iterate over `nums` once and perform constant time operations per element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the prefix sums in the hashmap.

This should efficiently solve the problem within the constraints typically expected in LeetCode problems.
