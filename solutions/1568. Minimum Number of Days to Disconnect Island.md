title:  Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island-out
permalink: /s1568
---

You are given a 2D integer grid `grid` of size `m x n` where each cell is either `0` (representing water) or `1` (representing land). An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`s.

The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island.

You may change `1` to `0` to disconnect the island. Note that a disconnected grid has more than one island (or no islands but water, although this is not meaningful here as we start from exactly one island).

Return the minimum number of days to disconnect the island.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume there is exactly one initial island in the grid?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees the grid starts with exactly one island.

2. **Are there any grid size constraints?**
   - Typically, grid dimensions (m, n) are constrained to 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 30.

3. **What should we return if the grid is initially disconnected?**
   - Since the problem states the grid is initially one island, the result of disconnection should always be valid.

4. **Can we always find a solution in 1 or 2 days?**
   - Yes, either a single `1` change converts the setup into an already disconnected form, or more strategic changes might need two days.

### Strategy

1. **Check if Initial Island is Separate**
    - Using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), determine if the grid is initially one island.

2. **Single Day to Disconnect**
    - Loop through each cell. Convert land cell (`1` to `0`). After each conversion, check if the island is now disconnected.

3. **Two Days to Disconnect**
    - If a single-day change isn't enough, simulate changes by trying every land cell's conversion and then testing further with adjacent cells.

### Solution Code

```python
def minDays(grid):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    def is_connected():
        def bfs(r, c):
            queue = [(r, c)]
            visited.add((r, c))
            while queue:
                x, y = queue.pop(0)
                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                        visited.add((nx, ny))
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
        
        visited = set()
        start_found = False
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    if not start_found:
                        bfs(i, j)
                        start_found = True
                    else:
                        return False
        return len(visited) == sum(row.count(1) for row in grid)
    
    if not is_connected():
        return 0
    
    # Try flipping each land cell to water and check connectivity
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                grid[i][j] = 0
                if not is_connected():
                    return 1
                grid[i][j] = 1
    
    # If a single flip doesn't work, then perform further checks
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                grid[i][j] = 0
                for x in range(rows):
                    for y in range(cols):
                        if grid[x][y] == 1:
                            grid[x][y] = 0
                            if not is_connected():
                                return 2
                            grid[x][y] = 1
                grid[i][j] = 1
    
    return 2

# Example usage
grid = [
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1]
]
print(minDays(grid))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Connectivity Check**: O(m * n)
- **Single Day Check**: O(m * n * (m * n)) -> O(m^2 * n^2)
- **Two Days Check**: O(m * n * (m * n) * (m * n)) -> O(m^3 * n^3)

Given the constraints (m, n ≤ 30), the approach should be feasible.
