title:  Remove Stones to Minimize the Total-out
permalink: /s1962

Given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` represents the number of stones in the i-th pile, you can perform the following operation on any pile of stones:
1. Remove `⌊piles[i]/2⌋` stones from the i-th pile.

You have to perform exactly `k` operations. Your goal is to minimize the total number of stones in all piles after exactly `k` operations.

Return the minimum possible total number of stones after exactly `k` operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `piles` contain any negative numbers?
   - No, `piles` will only contain non-negative integers as they represent the number of stones.
2. Is there any upper limit on the size of `piles` or the values within `piles`?
   - Typically, `piles` and `k` will be within reasonable input constraints for a coding problem (i.e., manageable within typical limitations for arrays and integers in competitive programming).
3. What happens if a pile becomes zero due to the operations?
   - The pile remains zero and no further operations can reduce stones from it.

### Strategy
To minimize the total number of stones after `k` operations, we should continually remove half of the stones from the pile that currently has the most stones (i.e., the maximum pile). This is because removing half from the largest pile will yield the largest immediate reduction in total count.

The approach involves:
1. Using a max-heap (priority queue) to always efficiently fetch and modify the pile with the maximum stones.
2. Inserting half-of-the-max back into the heap after each removal operation.
3. Repeating this process for `k` operations.

To implement this using Python, we can utilize the `heapq` module, with a caveat: `heapq` by default is a min-heap, so to simulate a max-heap, we will store the negative values of the pile counts.

### Code
```python
import heapq

def minStoneSum(piles, k):
    # Convert piles list to a max heap by storing negative values
    max_heap = [-pile for pile in piles]
    # Convert it into a heap
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    
    for _ in range(k):
        # Remove the largest pile (negative sign to get the max value)
        largest_pile = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        # Calculate the new pile size after removing half
        reduced_pile = largest_pile - largest_pile // 2
        # Push the new reduced pile back into the heap
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -reduced_pile)
    
    # Calculate the total number of stones left
    return -sum(max_heap)

# Example usage:
piles = [5, 4, 9]
k = 2
print(minStoneSum(piles, k))  # Expected output: 12
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Heap Initialization**: Building the initial heap takes \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of piles.
2. **Operations**: Each operation involves removing the maximum element and reinserting a reduced element into the heap, both of which take \(O(\log n)\). Given `k` operations, this part takes \(O(k \log n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + k \log n)\).
