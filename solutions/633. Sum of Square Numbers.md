Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c \]

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `a` and `b` be the same number?**
   - Yes, `a` and `b` can be the same or different as long as \( a^2 + b^2 = c \).

2. **What is the range of `c`?**
   - `c` is a non-negative integer and can range from 0 to \( 2^{31} - 1 \).

3. **Do we need to consider negative numbers for `a` and `b`?**
   - No, since squaring negative numbers or positive numbers results in the same outcome, we can restrict \( a \) and \( b \) to non-negative integers only.

## Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. Initialize two pointers:
   - `a` starting at 0.
   - `b` starting at \( \sqrt{c} \).

2. Use a two-pointer technique to iterate and check:
   - Calculate the sum of squares \( a^2 + b^2 \).
   - If \( a^2 + b^2 = c \), return `True`.
   - If \( a^2 + b^2 < c \), increment `a` to increase the sum.
   - If \( a^2 + b^2 > c \), decrement `b` to decrease the sum.

3. If the loop completes without finding a solution, return `False`.

## Code

Here's the code implementing the above strategy:

```python
import math

def judgeSquareSum(c):
    # Initialize pointers
    a = 0
    b = int(math.sqrt(c))
    
    while a <= b:
        current_sum = a * a + b * b
        if current_sum == c:
            return True  # Found the integers a and b such that a^2 + b^2 = c
        elif current_sum < c:
            a += 1  # Increase the sum by increasing a
        else:
            b -= 1  # Decrease the sum by decreasing b
    
    return False  # No such integers found

# Example usage:
c = 5
print(judgeSquareSum(c))  # Output: True, since 1^2 + 2^2 = 5
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \( O(\sqrt{c}) \) because in the worst case, the `a` pointer will iterate from 0 to \( \sqrt{c} \), and the `b` pointer will iterate from \( \sqrt{c} \) back down to 0.

The space complexity is \( O(1) \) because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
