title:  Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node-out
permalink: /s1786
---

You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`. 

A path is **restricted** if, and only if, the distance from the destination node `n` to the end node is strictly less than the distance from the start node to the end node.

Return the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example:**
```python
Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each path can be enumerated as follows: 
(1 -> 2 -> 5)
(1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5)
(1 -> 3 -> 5)
```

### Clarifying Questions
- Can the graph contain self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
  - The problem statement mentions the input graph is undirected and weighted. However, it does not explicitly mention the absence of self-loops or multiple edges between the same participants. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume no self-loops and unique edges.
  
- What is the maximum value for `n` and the weights in `weights[i]`?
  - Typically, this constraint is provided in the problem statement. We assume reasonable upper bounds that can fit within runtime limits (e.g., `n` up to 10^4 and edge weights scaling likewise).

### Strategy

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Compute the shortest path from node `n` to all other nodes. This gives us the distance to node `n` for each node.
2. **Dynamic Programming with Topological Sorting**: Use a recurrence to count the restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`, leveraging the results from Dijkstra's algorithm to ensure the path is restricted.

### Steps
1. **Run Dijkstra** from node `n` to calculate shortest distances.
2. **Topological Sort** the nodes based on the distances obtained.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: 
    - Use a DP table where `dp[i]` represents the number of restricted paths from node `i` to node `n`.
    - Start filling the table from node `n` back to node `1`.

### Code

```python
import heapq

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def countRestrictedPaths(n, edges):
    # Initialize graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for u, v, w in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))

    # Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path from node `n` to all other nodes
    def dijkstra(start):
        dist = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dist[start] = 0
        pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
        while pq:
            current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if current_dist > dist[u]:
                continue
            for v, weight in graph[u]:
                if dist[v] > current_dist + weight:
                    dist[v] = current_dist + weight
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))
        return dist

    dist_n = dijkstra(n)

    # Nodes sorted by their distance to node `n`
    sorted_nodes = sorted(range(1, n + 1), key=lambda x: dist_n[x])

    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 1  # only one way to reach `n` from `n`

    for node in sorted_nodes:
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            if dist_n[node] > dist_n[neighbor]:  # restricted path condition
                dp[node] = (dp[node] + dp[neighbor]) % MOD

    return dp[1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: `O((V + E) log V)` where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges.
- **Topological Sorting**: `O(V log V)` due to sorting operation.
- **Dynamic Programming Step**: `O(V + E)` to update paths.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O((V + E) log V)`, which is efficient for `n` up to around `10^4`.
