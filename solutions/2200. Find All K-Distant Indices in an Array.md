title:  Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array-out
permalink: /s2200
---

The problem is as follows:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and two integers `key` and `k`. A k-distant index in `nums` is an index `i` such that there exists at least one index `j` in `nums` where `nums[j] == key` and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `k`.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints?**
   - Is the length of `nums` constrained to a specific range?
   - Can `key` be any integer value, and will `k` always be non-negative?

2. **Examples**
   - `nums = [3, 4, 9, 1, 3, 9, 5], key = 9, k = 2` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   - Is it guaranteed that `nums` has at least one occurrence of `key`?

### Strategy

1. **Identify key Indices**: First, go through the array to find all indices `j` where `nums[j] == key`.
2. **Mark k-Distant Indices**: For each such index `j`, mark all indices `i` in the range `[j - k, j + k]` as valid k-distant indices.
3. **Collect and Return Results**: Collect all the unique k-distant indices and return them sorted.

### Code

```python
def findKDistantIndices(nums, key, k):
    key_indices = []
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Finding all the indices where nums[j] == key
    for idx in range(n):
        if nums[idx] == key:
            key_indices.append(idx)
    
    k_distant_indices = set()
    
    # For each key index j, mark the indices i in the range [j - k, j + k]
    for j in key_indices:
        start = max(0, j - k)
        end = min(n - 1, j + k)
        for i in range(start, end + 1):
            k_distant_indices.add(i)
    
    # Return the sorted list of k-distant indices
    return sorted(k_distant_indices)

# Example Usage
nums = [3, 4, 9, 1, 3, 9, 5]
key = 9
k = 2
print(findKDistantIndices(nums, key, k))
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: Finding all key indices involves a single pass through the `nums` array.
- **O(m * k)**: Marking k-distant indices is proportional to the number of `key` occurrences (let's call it `m`), and for each key occurrence we need to mark up to `2k + 1` indices.
- **O(n log n)**: Sorting the k-distant indices.

Therefore, in the worst case, the time complexity is `O(n + m * k + n log n)`. Given typical constraints, this solution should be efficient enough for large inputs.
