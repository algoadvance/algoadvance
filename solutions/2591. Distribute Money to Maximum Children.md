title:  Distribute Money to Maximum Children-out
permalink: /s2591
---

You are given an integer `money` and another integer `children`. Distribute the given amount of money to the maximum number of children such that:
1. Each child gets at least 1 unit of money.
2. No child gets exactly 4 units of money.

Return the maximum number of children who can receive money under the specified constraints. If it is not possible to satisfy the constraints, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `money` and `children` be negative?**
   - No, both `money` and `children` are non-negative integers.
   
2. **Is it possible for the number of children to be zero while the money is non-zero?**
   - Yes, and in that case, the function should return 0, since there are no children to distribute to.

3. **What if the money is zero, but the number of children is non-zero?**
   - In this case, it's impossible to distribute money while fulfilling the constraints, so the function should return -1.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Each child should receive at least 1 unit of money. Therefore, check if the total children can get at least 1 unit each without exceeding the `money`. If not, return -1.

2. **Avoid Exact 4 Units:**
   - Next, distribute the remaining money keeping in mind that no child should end up with exactly 4 units.
   - If the remaining money after the initial allocation is distributed in a way that forms exactly 4 units for any child, adjust the distribution to avoid it.

3. **Return Max Children:**
   - If there are methods to distribute money within the constraints and cover all `children`, then return the number of children. If not, return as per constraints violation.

### Code
```python
def max_children_with_money(money, children):
    # Step 1: Ensure minimum money per child is 1 unit
    if money < children:
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: We initially assume each child gets 1 unit of money
    initial_allocation = children
    remaining_money = money - children
    
    # Step 3: Distribute the remaining money
    can_satisfy = (remaining_money // 3 + initial_allocation <= children) and \
                  (remaining_money % 3 != 1 or remaining_money > 3)
    
    if not can_satisfy:
        return -1
    
    # Step 4: Calculate maximum possible children
    return children

# Example Usage
print(max_children_with_money(20, 4))  # Expected output: 4
print(max_children_with_money(7, 2))  # Expected output: 2
print(max_children_with_money(10, 3))  # Expected output: -1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since we are using basic arithmetic operations that are essentially constant time checks irrespective of the size of `money` and `children`. There are no loops or recursive calls involved in the solution.
