title:  Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph-out
permalink: /s882
---

You are given an undirected graph (the original graph) with nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are given a two-dimensional integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, cnti]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the original graph and `cnti` is the total number of new nodes that we can place on this edge. You are also given an integer `maxMoves`, which is the maximum number of moves you can make.

Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach in the graph.

### Constraints:
- `0 <= n <= 3000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= 10000`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui < vi < n`
- `There are no multiple edges in the graph.`
- `0 <= cnti <= 10000`
- `0 <= maxMoves <= 10^9`

### Verbose Example:
Given:
- `n = 4`
- `edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,3,3]]`
- `maxMoves = 6`

Output:
- `13`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do the new nodes (subdivided nodes) created on the edges count as distinct nodes that can be reached?
2. If the maxMoves is a very large number relative to the size of `n`, should we just consider all nodes reachable as the count?
3. Do we need to consider directionality of moves or is the graph fully bidirectional?

## Strategy

1. **Model the Problem as a Graph:** We need to manage the graph's expanded structures where each edge with `cnti` intermediate nodes is expanded into multiple smaller segments.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** As we seek the shortest paths from the starting node (node 0), we will use a priority queue to always extend the smallest known path. This helps to control the maxMoves constraint efficiently.

3. **Track Nodes and Moves:** We use a dictionary to track the number of moves spent to reach each node and ensure we don't recompute unnecessary paths.

4. **Count Nodes Reachable:** Some nodes will be intermediary and possibly partial based on how many of `cnti` can be reached given the remaining moves.

Letâ€™s implement this.

## Code

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from collections import defaultdict

def reachableNodes(edges, maxMoves, n):
    graph = defaultdict(dict)
    for u, v, cnt in edges:
        graph[u][v] = cnt
        graph[v][u] = cnt
    
    pq = [(0, 0)]  # (distance_from_start, node)
    dist = {0: 0}
    used_edges = {}
    result = 0

    while pq:
        moves, u = heappop(pq)
        if moves > dist[u]:
            continue

        # Count this node as reachable
        result += 1

        # Traverse through all neighboring edges
        for v in graph[u]:
            cnt = graph[u][v]
            remain = max(0, maxMoves - moves)
            new_moves = moves + cnt + 1

            # Count new nodes that can be reached within the edge u-v
            total_new_nodes = min(cnt, remain)
            used_edges[u, v] = min(cnt, max(0, remain))

            if new_moves < dist.get(v, maxMoves + 1):
                dist[v] = new_moves
                heappush(pq, (new_moves, v))
    
    # Sum reachable intermediate nodes on all edges
    for u, v, cnt in edges:
        result += min(cnt, used_edges.get((u, v), 0) + used_edges.get((v, u), 0))
    
    return result

# Example usage
n = 4
edges = [[0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 6], [0, 3, 3]]
maxMoves = 6
print(reachableNodes(edges, maxMoves, n))  # Output: 13
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the graph:** `O(E)` where `E` is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** `O((E + V) log V)` where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges, due to maintaining the priority queue.
- **Summing reachable nodes:** `O(E)`.

Overall, the approach should handle up to the constraint limits effectively.
