title:  Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points-out
permalink: /s2058
---
You are given the head of a linked list `head` and you need to find the minimum and maximum distance between any two critical points in the linked list.

Critical points are defined as nodes in the list where the value is a local minimum or a local maximum. In other words, a node is a critical point if it satisfies one of the following:
- It has both a previous and a next node, and its value is strictly greater than both the previous and the next node's values.
- It has both a previous and a next node, and its value is strictly less than both the previous and the next node's values.

You need to return a list containing exactly two elements: 
- The minimum distance between any two critical points.
- The maximum distance between any two critical points.

If there are fewer than two critical points in the linked list, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be done if the linked list has fewer than three nodes?
   - If the linked list has fewer than three nodes, you should return `[-1, -1]` since there can be no critical points.
   
2. Are the values in the nodes guaranteed to be integers?
   - Yes, the values in the nodes are integers.

3. Can the linked list contain duplicate values?
   - Yes, the linked list may contain duplicate values.

### Strategy
1. **Traversal**: Start traversing the linked list from the head, keeping track of the previous node, current node, and next node.
2. **Identify Critical Points**: For each node, check if it is a critical point. This is done by comparing the current node's value with its previous and next nodes' values.
3. **Store Indices**: Store the indices of all critical points in a list.
4. **Calculate Distances**: If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, calculate the minimum and maximum distance between the critical points.
5. **Result**: Return the calculated minimum and maximum distances.

### Code
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(head: ListNode):
    if head is None or head.next is None or head.next.next is None:
        return [-1, -1]

    critical_points = []
    index = 1
    prev = head
    curr = head.next
    next = head.next.next
    
    while next is not None:
        if (curr.val > prev.val and curr.val > next.val) or (curr.val < prev.val and curr.val < next.val):
            critical_points.append(index)
        
        prev = curr
        curr = next
        next = next.next
        index += 1
    
    if len(critical_points) < 2:
        return [-1, -1]
    
    min_distance = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, len(critical_points)):
        min_distance = min(min_distance, critical_points[i] - critical_points[i - 1])
        
    max_distance = critical_points[-1] - critical_points[0]

    return [min_distance, max_distance]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Traversal**: The linked list is traversed once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Distance Calculation**: Calculating the distances between critical points also takes linear time, O(n), in the worst case.

Overall, the solution provides an efficient way to identify critical points and calculate the required distances.
