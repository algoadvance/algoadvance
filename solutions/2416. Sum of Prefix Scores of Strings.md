LeetCode Problem 2416: Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings

You are given an array `words` of size `n` consisting of non-empty strings.

The **score** of a string is defined as the number of strings in the `words` array that are prefixes of the string.

- A **prefix** of a string is any leading contiguous substring of the string. For example, `"abc"` and `"ab"` are prefixes of `"abcd"`, but `"bc"` is not.

You need to return an integer array `result` of size `n` where `result[i]` is the sum of scores of strings that are prefixes of `words[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the words in the list guaranteed to consist only of lowercase English letters?**
    - Yes.
2. **Can the input list `words` be empty?**
    - No, it consists of non-empty strings.
3. **How large can the input list `words` be?**
    - According to typical constraints, it can be very large (up to tens of thousands of strings).

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Trie**: We can use a trie (prefix tree) structure to count the frequency of each prefix. We will first build the trie with prefix counts using the given list of words.
  
2. **Query Trie**: For each word in the list, we will compute the sum of the scores of its prefixes by traversing the trie and summing their counts.

### Code

Let's implement the solution using the strategy described.

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.count = 0

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
            node.count += 1

    def get_prefix_scores(self, word):
        node = self.root
        score = 0
        for char in word:
            if char in node.children:
                node = node.children[char]
                score += node.count
            else:
                break
        return score

def sum_prefix_scores(words):
    trie = Trie()
    # Insert all words into the trie
    for word in words:
        trie.insert(word)
        
    # Calculate the result
    result = []
    for word in words:
        result.append(trie.get_prefix_scores(word))
    return result

# Example usage
words = ["abc", "ab", "bc", "b"]
print(sum_prefix_scores(words))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2]
```

### Strategy Explanation

- **Trie Construction**: We construct a trie where each node represents a character and keeps track of how many times a prefix that ends at that node has been seen.
- **Prefix Count Calculation**: For each word, we traverse its path in the trie and sum up the counts of the nodes we traverse.

### Time Complexity

- **Trie Construction**: Inserting each word of length `k` takes `O(k)` time. So, for `n` words, it's `O(n * k)`.
- **Prefix Score Calculation**: Calculating the prefix scores for each word takes `O(k)` time, resulting in `O(n * k)` for all words.

Overall, the time complexity of our solution is `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of the words. This should be efficient for large inputs as described in the constraints.
