title:  Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments-out
permalink: /s1621
---
You are given an integer `n` representing the length of a stick, and an integer `k` representing the number of line segments to be drawn on this stick. The stick can be divided by exactly `k` non-overlapping line segments. Each line segment must include at least one unit length, and the endpoints of each line segment must lie on the endpoints of the stick or on existing dividing points. Compute the number of ways to draw the `k` non-overlapping line segments on the stick modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example
```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 5

Example Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on `n` and `k`:**
   - Are there any limits on the values of `n` and `k` (e.g., can they be very large)?
   - Typically, constraints guide us about the feasible algorithm in terms of time complexity.

2. **Nature of Segments:**
   - Must segments be contiguous and non-overlapping within the range `[0, n]`?
   - Line segments are required to be at least of length `1`.

3. **Output Modulo:**
   - Output is to be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Utilize a DP approach to keep track of the number of ways to form segments up to a certain point.
2. **Subproblems definition:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to form `j` segments using the first `i` points.
3. **State Transition:**
   - If we decide to place the `j`-th segment ending at position `i`, it means there must be `j-1` segments in the first `i-1` points.
   - Then we count all positions between `i-1` to `j-1` that could have been the end of the previous segment.
4. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because there is exactly one way to draw 0 segments (by drawing none).
5. **Result Calculation:**
   - Sum up all configurations where exactly `k` segments are formed for up to `n` stick length.

### Code
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def numberOfSets(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    # dp[i][j] := number of sets of j segments using first i points
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1  # 1 way to draw 0 segments using first i points

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]  # without using the i-th point directly
            if i > 1:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD  # Closing a segment at point i
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 2][j - 1]) % MOD  # Considering possible segments that end before point i
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] - dp[j - 2][j - 1]) % MOD  # Exclude over-counted segments

    return dp[n][k]

# Example usage
n = 4
k = 2
print(numberOfSets(n, k))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * k)` because we process each `i` from `1` to `n` and for each `i`, we process each `j` from `1` to `k`. The space complexity is also `O(n * k)` since we store results for each subproblem in a 2-dimensional list `dp`.

This analysis ensures that the solution is efficient and feasible given typical constraints in competitive programming.
