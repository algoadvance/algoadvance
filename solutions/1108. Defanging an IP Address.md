title:  Defanging an IP Address-out
permalink: /s1108
---

Given a valid (IPv4) IP `address`, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period `.` with `[.]`.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
address = "1.1.1.1"
```

**Output:**
```
"1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q: Can the input strings contain characters other than digits and periods?**
   - A: No, the input will always be a valid IPv4 address, containing only digits and periods.

2. **Q: Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?**
   - A: The length of the input string can be up to 15 characters, as the longest IPv4 address (255.255.255.255) has 15 characters.

3. **Q: Can the input string be empty?**
   - A: No, the input will always contain a valid IPv4 address.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we simply need to replace all occurrences of the period character `.` with `[.]`.

Pythonâ€™s string `replace` method is ideal for this task, as it allows direct replacement of substrings in a straightforward and efficient manner.

### Steps:

1. Use the `replace` method on the input string `address` to replace all `.` with `[.]`.
2. Return the resulting string.

## Code:

```python
def defangIPaddr(address: str) -> str:
    # Replace all occurrences of '.' with '[.]'
    return address.replace('.', '[.]')
```

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string, because the `replace` method needs to traverse the string to replace each occurrence of `.`.

- **Time complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` additional space (the space for the new string is not counted as additional space).

This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient for the given problem constraints.
