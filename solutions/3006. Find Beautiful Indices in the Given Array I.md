title:  Find Beautiful Indices in the Given Array I-out
permalink: /s3006
---

You are given an array of integers `nums`. An index `i` is called `beautiful` if the sum of all elements to the left of `i` is equal to the sum of all elements to the right of `i`. Return a list of all beautiful indices in the given array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if there are no beautiful indices?**
   - An empty list should be returned.

2. **Are elements of the array guaranteed to be integers?**
   - Yes, all elements of the array `nums` are integers.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - No explicit constraints are given, but consider performance for large inputs.

4. **How should we handle an array with less than three elements?**
   - An array with less than three elements will not have any beautiful indices because there are not enough elements to satisfy the condition on both sides of an index.

### Strategy

To find all beautiful indices in the array, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum of the Array:** 
   - This will help us efficiently compute the sum of elements to the right of any index.

2. **Iterate through the Array:**
   - For each index, calculate the sum of elements to the left and the sum of elements to the right.

3. **Check for the Beautiful Index Condition:**
   - For each index `i`, if the sum of elements to the left of `i` equals the sum of elements to the right of `i`, consider it a beautiful index.

4. **Efficient Calculation with Prefix Sum:**
   - Use a prefix sum to efficiently calculate the sum of elements to the left of an index.
   - Subtract the prefix sum from the total sum to get the sum of elements to the right.

 **Time Complexity:** 
 The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because the array is traversed a constant number of times: once to calculate the total sum and once to find the beautiful indices.

### Code

```python
def find_beautiful_indices(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return []
    
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    left_sum = 0
    beautiful_indices = []
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums) - 1):
        left_sum += nums[i - 1]
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum - nums[i]
        
        if left_sum == right_sum:
            beautiful_indices.append(i)
    
    return beautiful_indices

# Example usage:
# nums = [2, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2]
# Output should be [2, 3]
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initial Checks:** If the array length is less than 3, immediately return an empty list because no indices can be beautiful.

2. **Calculate Total Sum:** Compute the total sum of the array elements.

3. **Initialize Left Sum:** Initialize the left sum as 0 before starting the iteration.

4. **Loop through Possible Indices:** Iterate from index 1 to `len(nums) - 2` (since the index at the edges cannot be beautiful):
   - Update the left sum by adding the element to the left of the current index.
   - Calculate the right sum by subtracting the left sum and the current element from the total sum.
   - If the left sum equals the right sum, the current index is a beautiful index.

5. **Store Beautiful Indices:** Append the beautiful indices to the result list.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently identifies all beautiful indices in the array by leveraging prefix sums, ensuring each sum computation is `O(1)`, leading to an overall time complexity of `O(n)`. This solution is suitable for large inputs due to its linear complexity.
