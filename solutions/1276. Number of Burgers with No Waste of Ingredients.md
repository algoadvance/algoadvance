title:  Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients-out
permalink: /s1276
---

You are given two integers, `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`. The `tomatoSlices` represents the number of tomato slices available, and `cheeseSlices` represents the number of cheese slices available. You need to determine the number of jumbo burgers and small burgers you can make such that:
- Jumbo burgers require 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
- Small burgers require 2 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.

Your goal is to find a way to make exactly `tomatoSlices` tomato slices and `cheeseSlices` cheese slices with no waste of ingredients. If it is possible, return `[numberOfJumboBurgers, numberOfSmallBurgers]`. Otherwise, return an empty list.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` be negative?
   - No, both `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` are non-negative integers.
2. Is there a maximum limit on the values of `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`?
   - Generally, the problem constraints will ensure that the values are within a reasonable range for computational purposes.

## Strategy

To solve this, we set up two equations based on the given problem:
- Let `J` be the number of jumbo burgers.
- Let `S` be the number of small burgers.

For the given constraints:
1. From the problem statement, the relationships can be written as:
   - `4*J + 2*S = tomatoSlices`
   - `J + S = cheeseSlices`

2. We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for `J` and `S`:
   - Substitute `S = cheeseSlices - J` into the first equation:
     `4*J + 2*(cheeseSlices - J) = tomatoSlices`
   - Simplify to find `J`:
     `4*J + 2*cheeseSlices - 2*J = tomatoSlices`
     `2*J = tomatoSlices - 2*cheeseSlices`
     `J = (tomatoSlices - 2*cheeseSlices) / 2`
   - Then we can solve for `S`:
     `S = cheeseSlices - J`

3. Check for integer solutions and feasibility:
   - `J` and `S` should be non-negative integers.

## Code

```python
def numOfBurgers(tomatoSlices, cheeseSlices):
    # Check for feasible integer solutions
    if (tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) % 2 != 0 or tomatoSlices < 2 * cheeseSlices:
        return []
    
    J = (tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) // 2
    S = cheeseSlices - J
    
    # Both should be non-negative
    if J < 0 or S < 0:
        return []
    
    return [J, S]

# Example usages:
print(numOfBurgers(16, 7))  # Output: [1, 6]
print(numOfBurgers(17, 4))  # Output: []
print(numOfBurgers(4, 17))  # Output: []
print(numOfBurgers(0, 0))   # Output: [0, 0]
print(numOfBurgers(4, 1))   # Output: [0, 1]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1), since we are merely performing a few arithmetic operations, including checking the feasibility of the solution. This operation does not depend on the size of the input and thus takes constant time.
