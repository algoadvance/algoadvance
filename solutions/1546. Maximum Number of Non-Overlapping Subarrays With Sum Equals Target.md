title:  Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target-out
permalink: /s1546
---

Given an array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the maximum number of **non-overlapping** subarrays such that the sum of elements in each subarray is equal to `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for elements in `nums` and `target`?**
   - Typically, this will follow standard constraints for array problems on LeetCode, but let's assume integers within the standard integer range.
   
2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.

3. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - Again, typical constraints apply, usually up to 10^5 elements.

4. **What should be returned if no subarrays sum to `target`?**
   - Return `0` if no such subarrays exist.

5. **Are there any restrictions on the length of the subarrays?**
   - No specific restrictions; any length is valid as long as the sum is `target`.

With these questions clarified, let's move to a strategy for solving this.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum and Hash Map:** 
   - Use a prefix sum technique along with a hash map to track the cumulative sum up to each index.
   - Maintain a set to keep track of the end indices of the subarrays we have chosen so that they do not overlap.

2. **Traverse and Count:**
   - Initialize a current sum variable to store the sum as you traverse through `nums`.
   - Use a hash map to store previously seen prefix sums.
   - When the current sum minus the target is found in the hash map, it indicates a subarray summing to `target` exists.
   - Ensure that the new subarray does not overlap with previously found ones by tracking the end index of selected subarrays.

### Code

Let's implement this strategy:

```python
def maxNonOverlapping(nums, target):
    current_sum = 0
    prefix_sums = {0}
    count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum - target in prefix_sums:
            count += 1
            prefix_sums = {current_sum}
        else:
            prefix_sums.add(current_sum)
    
    return count
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `current_sum` keeps a running total of the sum of elements as we iterate.
   - `prefix_sums` is initialized with `{0}` to handle cases where a subarray starting from index 0 itself sums to the target.
   - `count` is the number of non-overlapping subarrays found with sum equal to `target`.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each element in `nums`, add it to `current_sum`.
   - If `current_sum - target` is in `prefix_sums`, it means there is a subarray that ends at the current index with sum equal to `target`.
   - Increment `count` and reset `prefix_sums` to start tracking from the current sum to avoid overlap.
   - If no matching prefix sum is found, add the `current_sum` to `prefix_sums`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) because we are traversing the array once and performing constant-time operations during each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case due to the storage of prefix sums in the hash set.

This efficient approach ensures that we can handle large input sizes within acceptable performance limits.
