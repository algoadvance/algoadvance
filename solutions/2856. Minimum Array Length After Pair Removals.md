title:  Minimum Array Length After Pair Removals-out
permalink: /s2856
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can remove any pair of adjacent elements whose values are equal and replace them with a single element whose value is also equal to them.

For example, if you have the array `nums = [1,2,2,1]`, you can remove the pair `(2,2)` and replace it with `2`, to get `nums = [1,2,1]`.

Your task is to return the **minimum length of the array after performing reductions** for as long as possible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - No constraints against this are mentioned, so assume yes.
2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Based on typical constraints in similar problems, the array will have at least one element.
3. **Can we remove non-adjacent equal elements or only adjacent ones?**
   - Only adjacent equal elements can be paired and removed as per problem statement.
   
## Strategy
1. **Iteration and Stack Implementation:**
    - We'll use a stack to keep track of the elements after each operation.
    - Iterate over the array and for each element:
        - If the stack is empty, push the element onto the stack.
        - If the top element of the stack is equal to the current element, pop the top element (effectively removing the pair).
        - If the top element is not equal to the current, push the current element onto the stack.
    - Continue this process for the entire array.
    - The final size of the stack will be the result as it represents the reduced array.
  
## Code

```python
def minLengthAfterRemovals(nums):
    stack = []
    
    for num in nums:
        if stack and stack[-1] == num:
            stack.pop()  # Remove the pair
        else:
            stack.append(num)
    
    return len(stack)
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We are iterating through the array once, making each element interact with the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - In the worst case, none of the elements get paired and removed, so the stack could potentially hold all elements of the array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently reduce the array by removing adjacent pairs and calculating the minimum length possible.
