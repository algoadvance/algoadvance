title:  Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon-out
permalink: /s2550
---

Given a regular polygon with `n` sides, there are `n` monkeys, each one starting at a distinct vertex. Each monkey starts moving to the next vertex simultaneously. Given that all monkeys are moving to the next vertex at the same time:

- They can either move in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.
- They might collide if two or more monkeys arrive at the same vertex at the same time.

You need to return the number of distinct pairs of monkeys who collide.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a collision?**  
   A collision occurs if more than one monkey arrives at the same vertex simultaneously.

2. **Is the number of sides `n` always greater than 1?**  
   Yes, for a polygon, `n` must be at least 3 for it to be a valid polygon.

3. **Is there any restriction on the number of sides of the polygon?**  
   The problem does not specify any upper bound, so we will assume there might not be any limits beside practical computational constraints.

### Strategy

This problem can be visualized by considering the symmetry and periodicity of the movements:

1. Given a polygon with `n` sides, each monkey has exactly 2 choices: move clockwise or counter-clockwise.
2. This results in a total of `2^n` different ways all the monkeys can distribute their movements.
3. A collision will occur under certain configurations:
   - All monkeys moving in one direction will not result in a collision.
   - Mixed movements in a random fashion have a high likelihood of collision.

A key characteristic is that only two configurations exist where no collisions occur:
- All monkeys move clockwise.
- All monkeys move counter-clockwise.

### Code

Let's devise the code to solve this:

```python
def countCollisions(n: int) -> int:
    # All monkeys moving in one direction will not collide.
    # There are 2 ways that create no collision: all clockwise, all counter-clockwise.
    no_collision_cases = 2
    
    # Total is 2^n possible ways
    total_ways = 2 ** n
    
    # Collision cases are total ways minus no collision cases
    collision_cases = total_ways - no_collision_cases
    
    return collision_cases

# Example Usage
n = 3
print(f"Number of collisions with {n} monkeys on a polygon: {countCollisions(n)}")
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is \(O(1)\) since we're using direct mathematical computation without any loops or recursive calls. Calculating \(2^n\) is typically efficient and manageable within constraint limits for competitive programming.
