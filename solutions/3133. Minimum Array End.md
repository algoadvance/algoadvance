title:  Minimum Array End-out
permalink: /s3133
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where all the numbers are unique. The array has a special property: the first two numbers in it are larger than all the other numbers in the array.

Your task is to split the array into two non-empty parts, such that the sum of the first part is greater than or equal to the sum of the second part.

- Return the minimum length of the first part.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the input array?**
   - Typical constraints, like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, should be assumed unless otherwise specified.

2. **What values do the elements of the array take?**
   - Assume `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4` unless otherwise specified.

3. **Can the array be empty, or have less than two elements?**
   - The array will have at least two elements as per the problem statement, given the special property of the first two numbers.

### Strategy

1. Initialize `left_sum` to `nums[0]` and `right_sum` to the sum of the rest of the array.
2. Iterate through the elements of `nums` starting from the second element and maintain the cumulative sum (`left_sum`) for the first part and the remaining sum (`right_sum`) for the rest of the elements.
3. At each step:
   - Check if `left_sum` is greater than or equal to `right_sum`.
   - If so, return the current index + 1 since it's the length of the first part.
4. If no such split is possible in the iterative process, it guarantees that the whole array must be considered, so the return value will be the length of the array.

### Code

```python
def minimum_array_end_out(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    left_sum = nums[0]
    right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if left_sum >= right_sum:
            return i
        left_sum += nums[i]
        right_sum -= nums[i]
    
    return len(nums)

# Example usage:
print(minimum_array_end_out([10, 9, 1, -1, -2])) # Expected output: 2
print(minimum_array_end_out([12, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4])) # Expected output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once to calculate the cumulative sums and perform the necessary checks.
