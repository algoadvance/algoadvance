title:  All Elements in Two Binary Search Trees-out
permalink: /s1305
---

You are given two binary search trees (BSTs), `root1` and `root2`.

Write a function to return a list containing all the elements from both trees sorted in ascending order.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Are the inputs guaranteed to be valid BSTs? 
   - Yes, `root1` and `root2` are valid BSTs.
2. **Duplicates**: Can there be duplicate values within or between the two BSTs?
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.
3. **Output Format**: Should the output list only contain unique elements?
   - No, the output list should include all elements, including duplicates, sorted in ascending order.

## Strategy

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Perform an inorder traversal on both BSTs to obtain two sorted lists of elements.
2. **Merge**: Merge these two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
   - This can be done using a two-pointer technique similar to the merge process used in the merge sort algorithm.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def getAllElements(root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
    def inorderTraversal(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        stack, output = [], []
        current = root
        while current or stack:
            while current:
                stack.append(current)
                current = current.left
            current = stack.pop()
            output.append(current.val)
            current = current.right
        return output
    
    list1 = inorderTraversal(root1)
    list2 = inorderTraversal(root2)
    
    # Merge two sorted lists
    mergedList = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < list1 and j < list2:
        if list1[i] < list2[j]:
            mergedList.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            mergedList.append(list2[j])
            j += 1

    if i < len(list1):
        mergedList.extend(list1[i:])
    
    if j < len(list2):
        mergedList.extend(list2[j:])
    
    return mergedList
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Traversing each tree takes `O(n1 + n2)`, where `n1` and `n2` are the number of nodes in `root1` and `root2`, respectively.
2. **Merge**: Merging two sorted lists also takes `O(n1 + n2)`.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n1 + n2)`.

The space complexity is also `O(n1 + n2)` to store the elements from both trees in the final list.
