title:  Maximum Points After Collecting Coins From All Nodes-out
permalink: /s2920
---

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) where each node has some coins. You need to maximize the number of points you get after you have collected all the coins from every node, adhering to the following rules:

1. From any node, you can only move to one of its directly connected nodes.
2. You can only collect the coins from a node the first time you visit it.

Given this, you need to determine the maximum points you can collect.

**Example:**

Consider a tree with nodes and connections as such:
- Node 1 with 3 coins
- Node 2 with 2 coins
- Node 3 with 4 coins
- Edges: (1-2), (1-3)

The maximum points of 9 you can collect by visiting nodes in the order 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can nodes have zero coins? 
2. How many nodes can the tree contain?
3. Are there multiple edges between any pairs of nodes? 
4. What should be done if multiple paths yield the same maximum points?

These additional details will help understand constraints, edge cases, and performance expectations.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal:** The optimal strategy revolves around traversing the tree in such a way that all coins are collected from all nodes. This problem can be seen as a variant of a tree traversal problem where visiting nodes must follow the tree structure constraints.
2. **Dynamic Programming / DFS:** Use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore all paths from the root to the leaves. Maintain a structure to record the maximum points for sub-trees.
3. **Memoization:** Cache results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations in recursive calls.

### Code

Here's the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, numNodes, edges, coins):
        from collections import defaultdict

        # Build the graph representation
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)

        def dfs(node, parent):
            # Initialize the total points collected from this node
            total_points = coins[node]
            max_child_points = 0

            for child in graph[node]:
                if child == parent:
                    continue
                child_points = dfs(child, node)
                max_child_points = max(max_child_points, child_points)

            # Add the maximum collectible points from any child subtree
            total_points += max_child_points
            return total_points

        # Start DFS from node 0 (assuming it's 0-indexed)
        return dfs(0, -1)

# Sample Input
numNodes = 3
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2)]
coins = [3, 2, 4]

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxPoints(numNodes, edges, coins))  # Output should be 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal:** O(V + E) where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.
- **Graph Representation:** O(E) to build the adjacency list of the graph.

Thus, the overall complexity is linear concerning the number of nodes and edges, which is efficient given the constraints typically associated with tree structures.
