title:  Cheapest Flights Within K Stops-out
permalink: /s787
---
You are given a set of flights, each represented as a tuple `(source, destination, price)`, and you're tasked with finding the cheapest price from a given starting city `src` to a destination city `dst` with at most `K` stops in between. If no such route exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are negative weights allowed?**
   - No, all prices are positive integers.
2. **Can there be multiple flights between the same pair of cities?**
   - Yes, there can be multiple flights between the same pair of cities with different prices.
3. **Are the cities indexed or named?**
   - Cities are indexed as integers starting from 0 up to `n-1` where `n` is the number of cities.
4. **What if `src` equals `dst`?**
   - If `src` equals `dst`, the cheapest price is `0` since no travel is required.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm which also takes into account the number of stops. However, a more straightforward approach is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a priority queue (min-heap) to always extend the least costly route first.

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent flights as an adjacency list where each node points to a list of `(destination, price)` pairs.
2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to explore the least expensive route first.
3. **Tracking Stops**: Maintain a record of the number of stops made so far to ensure it does not exceed `K`.

### Code
```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List, Tuple

def findCheapestPrice(n: int, flights: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], src: int, dst: int, K: int) -> int:
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, price in flights:
        graph[u].append((v, price))
    
    # Min-heap priority queue
    pq = [(0, src, 0)]  # (cost, current_city, stops)
    
    # Minimum cost to a node within K stops
    dist = {}
    
    while pq:
        cost, u, stops = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # If we've reached the destination city
        if u == dst:
            return cost
        
        # If we have more stops available
        if stops <= K:
            for v, price in graph[u]:
                new_cost = cost + price
                
                # Only consider this new path if it offers a cheaper price
                # or we haven't seen this node with <= stops before
                if new_cost < dist.get((v, stops), float('inf')):
                    dist[(v, stops)] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, v, stops+1))
    
    return -1

# Example Use-case
n = 5
flights = [(0, 1, 100), (1, 2, 100), (2, 0, 100), (1, 3, 600), (2, 3, 200)]
src = 0
dst = 3
K = 1
print(findCheapestPrice(n, flights, src, dst, K))  # Output: 700
```

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**: O(E), where E is the number of flights.
- **Priority Queue Operations**: Each node could be pushed into the queue with possible stops, making it O((V + E) log(V)), where V is the number of cities.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O((V + E) log(V)). This complexity is efficient for reasonable numbers of cities and flights.
