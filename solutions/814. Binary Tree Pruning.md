title:  Binary Tree Pruning-out
permalink: /s814
---
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a `1` has been removed.

A subtree of a node `node` is `node` plus every node that is a descendant of `node`.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,0,0,1]
Output: [1,null,0,null,1]

Explanation:
Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
The diagram on the left represents the given tree [1,null,0,0,1], where "null" stands for a null node.

     1                         1
      \                         \
       0      -->     becomes    0
      / \                         \
     0   1                         1
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 200]`.
- The value of each node is either `0` or `1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there cases where the input tree might be empty?
   - No, as per the constraints, there will be at least one node.
   
2. What should be the format of the output?
   - The output should be the root of the pruned binary tree.

### Code
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pruneTree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    def contains_one(node: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not node:
            return False
        
        left_contains_one = contains_one(node.left)
        right_contains_one = contains_one(node.right)
        
        if not left_contains_one:
            node.left = None
        
        if not right_contains_one:
            node.right = None
        
        return node.val == 1 or left_contains_one or right_contains_one
    
    return root if contains_one(root) else None
```

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Use a helper function `contains_one` to determine if a subtree contains a `1`.
   - For each node, recursively check its left and right children.
   - If a subtree (left or right) does not contain a `1`, prune (remove) that subtree by setting the corresponding child to `None`.
   - The function `contains_one` returns True if the current node or any of its descendants contain a `1`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `None`, return `False` because a `null` node cannot contain a `1`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Recursively check both left and right subtrees.
   - Based on the results, prune subtrees that do not contain a `1` and return whether the current subtree contains a `1`.

4. **Return the pruned tree**:
   - Call the `contains_one` function from the root.
   - If the root itself is pruned (doesnâ€™t contain a `1`), return `None`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse each node exactly once to check and prune, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h)
  - The recursion depth will be as deep as the height `h` of the binary tree. In the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree), the height could be `n`. In a balanced tree, the height would be `log(n)`.

Hence, the solution efficiently prunes the tree with respect to both time and space.
