### Problem Statement

You are given a range of integers `[low, high]` and a digit `d`. Your task is to find out how many integers within the range `[low, high]` (inclusive) contain the digit `d`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Validity:** Can we assume that `low` is always less than or equal to `high`?
2. **Digit range:** Can we assume `d` is always a single digit from `0` to `9`?
3. **Input Types:** Are `low`, `high`, and `d` always integers?
4. **Edge Cases:** What if `low` equals `high`? Should the answer be `1` if the number contains the digit `d`?

Assuming default constraints:
- `low` and `high` are integers such that `0 <= low <= high`.
- `d` is a single digit in the range `0-9`.
- There are no cases where inputs are of incompatible types.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the Range:** Loop through each number in the range `[low, high]`.
2. **String Conversion:** Convert each number to a string to facilitate checking for the presence of the digit `d`.
3. **Count Presence:** Use the `in` keyword in Python to check if the string representation of `d` is in the string representation of the current number.
4. **Counter:** Maintain a counter that increments each time the digit `d` is found in a number.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N * M), where `N` is the number of integers in the range `[low, high]` and `M` is the number of digits in the largest number in this range. In most practical cases, `M` is quite small (since integers are bounded by typical constraints).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) additional space apart from the loop variables.

### Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def count_integers_with_digit(low: int, high: int, d: int) -> int:
    # Convert the digit to a string for easy comparison
    digit_str = str(d)
    count = 0

    # Iterate through the specified range
    for number in range(low, high + 1):
        # Check if the digit is in the current number
        if digit_str in str(number):
            count += 1

    return count

# Example usage:
low = 10
high = 25
d = 2

print(count_integers_with_digit(low, high, d))  # Output: 7
```

In this example, the numbers containing the digit `2` in the range `[10, 25]` are `12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25`, making the count 7.

Feel free to run the code with different inputs to verify its correctness!
