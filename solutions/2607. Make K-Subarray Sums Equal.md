title:  Make K-Subarray Sums Equal-out
permalink: /s2607
---

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. The task is to make the sums of every `k` consecutive elements in the array equal. Find the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this. In one operation, you can increment or decrement any element of the array by 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does picking non-overlapping subarrays from `arr` suffice?**
   - No, the subarrays are overlapping subarrays of length `k`, meaning each element might be part of multiple subarrays.

2. **What are the constraints on the array size and element values?**
   - The general constraints would guide optimizations, but usually an array `arr` with `n` elements where `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9` is common for such problems.

3. **Do we have any constraints or requirements on the value of `k`?**
   - Typically, `1 <= k <= n` where `n` is the length of the array.
  
Understanding the problem, we need every group of `k` consecutive elements to have the same sum.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate initial sums for every k consecutive elements:**
   - We can use a sliding window sum to calculate the initial sums of every k-length subarray.

2. **Calculate the target sum:**
   - The target sum for minimal operations would be the median of the `k`-sums since minimizing absolute deviations is achieved by converging to the median value.

3. **Calculate the number of operations:**
   - Iterate through elements and compute the difference from the target value, summing up the absolute differences.

Let's implement the solution.

## Code

```python
def make_k_subarray_sums_equal(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Generate rounding sums of all k-length subarrays
    window_sums = []
    current_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    window_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    for i in range(k, n):
        current_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        window_sums.append(current_sum)
        
    # Find the target sum (median)
    window_sums.sort()
    median_sum = window_sums[len(window_sums) // 2]
    
    # Calculate minimum operations needed
    operations = 0
    current_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    # Add operations for the initial window
    operations += abs(median_sum - current_sum)
    
    for i in range(k, n):
        current_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        operations += abs(median_sum - current_sum)
    
    return operations

# Example Usage
arr = [2,4,1,7]
k = 2
print(make_k_subarray_sums_equal(arr, k))  # Outputs the minimum number of operations needed
```

## Time Complexity

1. Calculating initial sums for `k` consecutive elements: **O(n)**
2. Sorting the `k`-sums to find the median: **O(n log n)**
3. Calculating the total number of operations needed: **O(n)**

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
