Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if there are no triplets that sum up to zero?**
   - Return an empty list `[]`.

2. **Do we need to consider the order of the elements in the triplets in the output?**
   - No, the order within each triplet does not matter, but the triplet should be in ascending order.

3. **Can the input array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain duplicates, but the output should not contain duplicate triplets.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting** - First, sort the array. This helps in efficiently finding the triplets and also in skipping duplicates.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique** - Use a fixed pointer to iterate through the array and use a two-pointer approach to find pairs that sum up to the negative value of the current fixed-point value.
3. **Skip Duplicates** - Ensure that we skip duplicates by checking the current value against the previous one after moving the pointers.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The two-pointer approach runs in \(O(n^2)\) because we have an outer loop iterating through each element and the inner loop using two pointers iterating through the rest of the list.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

## Code

```python
def threeSum(nums):
    nums.sort()  # Step 1: Sort the array
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:  # Skip duplicate elements
            continue
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:  # Apply two-pointer approach
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            if total == 0:
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:  # Skip duplicates
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:  # Skip duplicates
                    right -= 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif total < 0:  # Move the left pointer to increase the total sum
                left += 1
            else:  # Move the right pointer to decrease the total sum
                right -= 1
    
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
print(threeSum(nums))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]
```

This solution effectively handles the input, uses sorting and two-pointer techniques to find the required triplets, and ensures no duplicates in the output.
