Given a string expression `s` representing a mathematical expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it. The expression `s` may contain the following characters:
- Non-negative integers
- `+`, `-` operators (for addition and subtraction)
- Parentheses `(` and `)` for grouping sub-expressions

It is guaranteed that the string is a valid mathematical expression.

You need to handle:
- Arbitrary spaces within the given string which are to be ignored.
- Valid expressions which means there will be no invalid or incorrect format inputs.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any limitations on the size of the integers in the expression?
2. Should the result be an integer?
3. Do we need to account for floating point numbers or only integers?

## Strategy
We can use a stack to manage the parentheses and ensure we correctly compute the operations inside them. Here are the main steps for our approach:

1. **Initialize** a stack to keep track of computed values and their corresponding operations.
2. **Iterate** through the characters of the string:
    - **Ignore** spaces.
    - **When** a digit is encountered, parse the entire number and append it to the result.
    - **When** a `+` or `-` operator is encountered, update the current total and change the operation sign.
    - **When** a `(` is encountered, push the current total and current sign onto the stack for later retrieval.
    - **When** a `)` is encountered, pop from the stack, adjust the current total based on the sign, and update it.
3. **After** processing all characters, return the resultant total.

By leveraging a stack and basic arithmetic operations, we can correctly handle the nested expressions and compute the required result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because we process each character in the string exactly once.

## Code Implementation
Here is a Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def calculate(s: str) -> int:
    stack = []
    current_number = 0
    current_result = 0
    sign = 1  # 1 means positive, -1 means negative
    
    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        char = s[i]
        
        if char.isdigit():
            current_number = 0
            while i < len(s) and s[i].isdigit():
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(s[i])
                i += 1
            current_result += sign * current_number
            i -= 1  # to compensate the extra increment in the inner loop
        
        elif char == '+':
            sign = 1
        
        elif char == '-':
            sign = -1
        
        elif char == '(':
            # Push the current result and sign on the stack, for the new sub-expression
            stack.append(current_result)
            stack.append(sign)
            # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
            current_result = 0
            sign = 1
        
        elif char == ')':
            # Pop the sign and compute the current result
            prev_sign = stack.pop()
            prev_result = stack.pop()
            current_result = prev_result + prev_sign * current_result
        
        # ignore spaces
        
        i += 1
    
    return current_result
```

This function effectively parses and computes the result of the mathematical expression by maintaining a result and correctly handling nested expressions using a stack.
