title:  Stone Game III-out
permalink: /s1406
---
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each player takes turns taking 1, 2, or 3 stones from the row starting from the beginning. The game continues until all the stones have been taken. The player with the maximum sum of stones wins. If both players reach the same total, the game is a draw.

Alice plays first.

Given an integer array `stoneValue`, where `stoneValue[i]` is the value of the `i-th` pile of stones, return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if they get equal scores.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the `stoneValue` array have negative numbers?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can have negative values.
2. **Q**: What is the range of lengths for the `stoneValue` array?
   - **A**: The length of the `stoneValue` array is between 1 and 5 * 10^4.
3. **Q**: Are the values in `stoneValue` bounded within any specific range?
   - **A**: The values can range from -1000 to 1000.

### Strategy
This is a dynamic programming problem. To determine the winner, we need to simulate the game and evaluate the best possible outcomes for each player from each state in the game. We'll use a dynamic programming approach to store the best results starting from every possible pile.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:
1. Define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score difference that the current player can achieve starting from the `i-th` stone.
2. The base case is defined when starting from the end of the array.
3. For each position, calculate the result for taking 1, 2, or 3 stones and choose the option that maximizes the current player's score.
4. Based on the `dp` values derived, determine the winner.

### Code
```python
def stoneGameIII(stoneValue):
    n = len(stoneValue)
    dp = [-float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0  # base case: when no stones are left, the score difference is 0

    # Fill the dp array backwards
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        take = 0
        for j in range(3):
            if i + j < n:
                take += stoneValue[i + j]
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], take - dp[i + j + 1])

    if dp[0] > 0:
        return "Alice"
    elif dp[0] < 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Tie"

# Example usage:
stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
print(stoneGameIII(stoneValue))  # Output: "Bob"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of our solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `stoneValue` array. This is because we are iterating through the array once and performing a constant amount of work for each element.

### Explanation
1. We initialize a `dp` array with size `n + 1` to handle states where no stones are left.
2. We iterate backward from the end of the list to the start.
3. For each position `i`, we evaluate taking 1, 2, and 3 stones and update `dp[i]` to the best possible result we can get starting from `i`.
4. Finally, we use `dp[0]`, which represents the best score difference starting from the beginning of the list, to determine the winner.
