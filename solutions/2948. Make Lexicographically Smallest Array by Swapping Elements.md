title:  Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements-out
permalink: /s2948
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can swap any two adjacent elements in the array. Return the lexicographically smallest array that you can obtain after performing the above operation any number of times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the length of `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints would be provided but should assume reasonable sizes for a typical interview problem. Verify if constraints are available.

2. **Range of numbers in `nums`?**
   - The elements in `nums` are integers. Constraints usually clarify if they are bounded.

3. **Can `nums` contain duplicate values?**
   - Verify if there are constraints but assume duplicates are allowed unless specified otherwise.

4. **Is there a time limit for the operations?**
   - It’s important to understand if there’s a performance requirement.

### Strategy

To make the array lexicographically smallest:

1. **Bubble Sort Concept**: Since the only allowable operation is to swap adjacent elements, my approach will utilize a mechanism similar to bubble sort. Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: However, an optimized version of the bubble sort (essentially a single pass through the array making local swaps) will be implemented to progressively move smaller elements to the front until no more swaps are needed.

### Code Implementation

```python
def make_lexicographically_smallest_array(nums):
    n = nums.length
    # We'll loop and perform swaps until no more swaps can be made
    swapped = True
    while swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
                # Swap adjacent elements
                nums[i], nums[i + 1] = nums[i + 1], nums[i]
                swapped = True  # Track that we made a swap
    return nums
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case scenario occurs in a reverse-sorted list where bubble sort performs `O(n^2)` comparisons and swaps. Given the need to compare adjacent pairs and potentially bubble each element into position, the time complexity remains `O(n^2)` in the worst scenario.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` as the operations are performed in-place, requiring no additional storage.

### Test Cases

1. **Example Test Case**:
   ```python
   nums = [3, 2, 1]
   assert make_lexicographically_smallest_array(nums) == [1, 2, 3]
   ```

2. **Already Sorted Array**:
   ```python
   nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   assert make_lexicographically_smallest_array(nums) == [1, 2, 3, 4]
   ```

3. **Array With Duplicates**:
   ```python
   nums = [1, 3, 2, 1]
   assert make_lexicographically_smallest_array(nums) == [1, 1, 2, 3]
   ```

4. **Single Element Array**:
   ```python
   nums = [1]
   assert make_lexicographically_smallest_array(nums) == [1]
   ```

5. **Empty Array**:
   ```python
   nums = []
   assert make_lexicographically_smallest_array(nums) == []
   ```

These test cases ensure functionality covering typical arrays, edge cases, and confirm the sorting mechanism for duplicates or single-element arrays.
