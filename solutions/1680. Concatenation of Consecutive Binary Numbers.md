title:  Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers-out
permalink: /s1680
---

Given an integer `n`, return the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of `1` to `n` in order, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Input**: A single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5).
   - **Output**: An integer representing the decimal value of the concatenated binary strings modulo `10^9 + 7`.

2. **Example:**
   - For `n = 3`: 
     - Binary representations are `1` (1), `10` (2), `11` (3).
     - Concatenation: `11011`
     - Decimal value: `27`.
     - Output: `27`.

### Strategy

The problem necessitates the concatenation of binary representations and conversion to a decimal number. Given the constraints, a direct string concatenation will be inefficient.

We'll instead manipulate the numbers directly using bitwise operations combined with modular arithmetic to manage the length and sizes efficiently.

1. **Bit Length Calculation**:
   - Calculate the number of bits for each integer. This is `len(bin(x)) - 2` where `x` is the integer.
  
2. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - Shift the current result left by the number of bits of the current number.
   - Use bitwise OR to concatenate the current number.
   
3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Use modular arithmetic to keep the result manageable and avoid overflow.

### Example Walkthrough

For `n = 3`:
1. Start with `result = 0`.
2. Process each number from `1` to `3`:
   - For `1`: Binary `1`
     - Shift result left by 1 bit (0 << 1) and OR with 1 -> `0 | 1 = 1`
   - For `2`: Binary `10`
     - Shift result left by 2 bits (1 << 2) and OR with 2 -> `4 | 2 = 6`
   - For `3`: Binary `11`
     - Shift result left by 2 bits (6 << 2) and OR with 3 -> `24 | 3 = 27`
3. Return `27 % (10^9 + 7) = 27`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time because each iteration involves O(1) operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.

### Code

```python
def concatenatedBinary(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    result = 0
    length = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # If i is a power of 2, increase the length of bits
        if (i & (i - 1)) == 0:
            length += 1
        result = ((result << length) | i) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example Use Case
n = 3
print(concatenatedBinary(n))  # Output: 27
```

This function iteratively processes each number from 1 to n, calculates the bit length appropriately for each number, and uses bitwise operations to generate the concatenated binary number directly in decimal form while applying the modulo operation to ensure the numbers don't become too large.
