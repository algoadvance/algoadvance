title:  Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets I-out
permalink: /s2908
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is considered a mountain triplet if the following conditions hold:
- `0 <= i < j < k < n`
- `nums[i] < nums[j] > nums[k]`

Your goal is to find the **minimum** sum of a mountain triplet or return -1 if no mountain triplet exists.

## Example
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1]
Output: 5
Explanation: The triplet (0, 1, 2) is a mountain triplet with the sum 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the expected range of `n` (length of `nums`)?
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of values for elements in `nums`? Are they positive, negative, or both?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider cases where `n` is less than 3 and return -1?

Once these clarifications are made, we can proceed with the solution.

## Solution Code

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: We'll initialize two arrays, `left_min` and `right_min`, where:
   - `left_min[j]` will store the minimum value to the left of `j` for all valid `i`.
   - `right_min[j]` will store the minimum value to the right of `j` for all valid `k`.
   
2. **Fill Arrays**:
   - Traverse the `nums` array to fill up the `left_min` and `right_min` arrays.
   
3. **Finding Minimum Triplet Sum**:
   - Iterate through the array with `j` as the middle element of the triplet.
   - For each valid `j`, look at the potential values from `left_min` and `right_min` to calculate the triplet sum.
   - Track the minimum sum found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no mountain triplets are found, return -1.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) – We need to traverse the array several times but each traversal is linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) – Mainly for storing `left_min` and `right_min` arrays.

### Implementation

```python
def minimum_sum_mountain_triplet(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    if n < 3:
        return -1
    
    left_min = [None] * n
    right_min = [None] * n
    
    left_min[0] = float('inf')
    for j in range(1, n):
        left_min[j] = min(left_min[j - 1], nums[j - 1])

    right_min[n - 1] = float('inf')
    for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        right_min[j] = min(right_min[j + 1], nums[j + 1])
    
    min_sum = float('inf')
    found = False
    
    for j in range(1, n - 1):
        if left_min[j] < nums[j] and nums[j] > right_min[j]:
            found = True
            min_sum = min(min_sum, left_min[j] + nums[j] + right_min[j])
    
    return min_sum if found else -1

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1]
print(minimum_sum_mountain_triplet(nums))  # Output: 5
```

## Steps for Clarification

1. Confirm the max bounds of `n`.
2. Validate expected ranges for `nums` elements.
3. Establish that the return value for no valid triplet is indeed -1.

After the initial confirmation and understanding, the approach is optimized for both run-time and space complexity.
