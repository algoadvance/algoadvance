title:  Distribute Candies Among Children II-out
permalink: /s2929

You are given n pieces of candy and k children. The goal is to distribute the candies to the children. You start by giving 1 candy to the first child, 2 candies to the second child, and so on until you give k candies to the k-th child. Then, you start again with 1 candy to the first child, 2 candies to the second child, and so on until you run out of candies.

Write a function `distributeCandies(n, k)` that distributes the candies in this manner and returns a list of integers where the i-th element is the number of candies received by the i-th child.

#### Example:
```
Input: n = 7, k = 4
Output: [1, 2, 3, 1]
Explanation:
- You give 1 candy to the first child (0 candies left).
- You give 2 candies to the second child (0 candies left).
- You give 3 candies to the third child (0 candies left).
- You give 1 candy to the fourth child (0 candies left).
There are no candies left.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the number of candies (n) always greater than the number of children (k)?**
   - No, n could be less than k.
2. **Is there a maximum limit on n or k?**
   - The constraints might not specify this, but let's consider n and k to be reasonably large. Ensure the code is efficient.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a result array** of size `k`, filled with zeros. This array will keep track of the candies each child receives.
2. **Use a loop** that continues until all candies are distributed:
    - If remaining candies are less than the next required candy amount, assign all remaining candies.
    - Otherwise, assign the expected number of candies.
3. **Update `current_candy` and `position`** after each assignment:
   - Increment `current_candy` after each assignment.
   - Move to the next child after each assignment. Reset the position if it exceeds `k`.

### Code

```python
def distributeCandies(n, k):
    # Initialize result array with zeros
    result = [0] * k
    current_candy = 1
    position = 0

    while n > 0:
        if n >= current_candy:
            result[position] += current_candy
            n -= current_candy
        else:
            result[position] += n
            n = 0
        current_candy += 1
        position = (position + 1) % k
    
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 7
k = 4
print(distributeCandies(n, k))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n / k)**: The loop runs until all candies are distributed, and in each loop, at least one candy is given out. Therefore, the loop runs approximately `n` times. Since we use the position modulo `k`, the loop's amortized iteration complexity remains efficient even for large `k`, making the time complexity O(n/k).

This solution effectively distributes candies and ensures each child receives the correct amount as per the problem constraints.
