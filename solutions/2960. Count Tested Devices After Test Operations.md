title:  Count Tested Devices After Test Operations-out
permalink: /s2960
---

You are given the count of total devices \( n \) which are initially turned off, and an array of operations where each operation represents a range \([start, end]\) (both inclusive). Each operation will test all devices in the specified range. You need to determine how many unique devices got tested after performing all given operations.

---

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs:**
    - What are the constraints for \( n \) (number of devices)?
    - What is the range for the individual operations?
    - Are these operations guaranteed to be within bounds, i.e., \( 1 \leq start \leq end \leq n \)?
2. **Output:**
    - Do we return the count of unique tested devices?
3. **Data Types:**
    - How large can the input list of operations be?

Assuming typical constraints like \( n \leq 10^9 \) and \( len(operations) \leq 10^5 \), we focus on ensuring an efficient solution.

---

### Strategy

To determine how many unique devices were tested, we can use a set to track all the device indices that were tested.

1. **Initialization:**
    - Create an empty set to store indices of devices that were tested.
  
2. **Processing Operations:**
    - For each operation with range \([start, end]\), add all numbers in the range to the set.
  
3. **Result:**
    - The size of the set gives the count of unique devices that were tested.

This strategy ensures uniqueness inherently because sets do not allow duplicate values.

---

### Code

```python
def countTestedDevices(n, operations):
    tested_devices = set()
    for start, end in operations:
        for device in range(start, end + 1):
            tested_devices.add(device)
    return len(tested_devices)

# Example Usage
n = 10
operations = [(1, 5), (2, 6), (8, 10)]
print(countTestedDevices(n, operations))  # Output should be 8
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(k \times m) \)
  - \( k \) is the number of operations.
  - \( m \) is the average size of the ranges, but in the worst case can be as large as \( n \).

This naive approach ensures correctness, but it's important to note the potential inefficiency in case of large \( n \).

---

### Optimized Strategy

Considering the potential inefficiency, we can optimize using a more advanced approach with a **difference array** or **line sweep** technique to avoid explicitly iterating over large ranges. An efficient approach involves:

1. **Marking Start and End Points:**
    - Uses a marking strategy where additions and subtractions track the life span of the tested devices.

Here's the optimized code for efficiency using a marking strategy:

```python
def countTestedDevices(n, operations):
    if not operations:
        return 0

    tested_markers = [0] * (n + 2)

    for start, end in operations:
        tested_markers[start] += 1
        if end + 1 <= n:
            tested_markers[end + 1] -= 1

    tested_count = 0
    current_active_tests = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_active_tests += tested_markers[i]
        if current_active_tests > 0:
            tested_count += 1

    return tested_count

# Example Usage
n = 10
operations = [(1, 5), (2, 6), (8, 10)]
print(countTestedDevices(n, operations))  # Output should be 8
```

### Optimized Time Complexity

- The optimized approach has a **time complexity** of \( O(n + k) \):
  - \( O(n) \) for traversing the marker array.
  - \( O(k) \) for marking the operations.

This is much more efficient for large values of \( n \).

---

This improved approach balances both clarity and performance, making it suitable for a wide range of input sizes.
