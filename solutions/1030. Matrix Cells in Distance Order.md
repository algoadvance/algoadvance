title:  Matrix Cells in Distance Order-out
permalink: /s1030
---

Given the integers `R` and `C` representing the number of rows and columns in a matrix, and the integers `r0` and `c0` representing the coordinates of a starting cell `(r0, c0)`, return the matrix cells in distance order from `(r0, c0)`. The cells are ordered by their Manhattan distance, which is defined as:

\[ \text{Manhattan Distance} = |r1 - r0| + |c1 - c0| \]

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the starting cell `(r0, c0)` be outside the boundary of the matrix?
   - **A:** No, `(r0, c0)` will always be within the boundary of the matrix.

2. **Q:** Is the output expected to be a list of lists where each inner list represents the coordinates of a cell?
   - **A:** Yes, the output should be a list of coordinate pairs, ordered by their Manhattan distance from `(r0, c0)`.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `R` and `C`?
   - **A:** No specific constraints are mentioned, but typical constraints are that `R` and `C` are within standard problem limits (0 ≤ R, C ≤ 100).

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Cells:** Create a list of coordinates for all cells in the matrix.
2. **Calculate Manhattan Distance:** Write a function or a lambda expression that calculates the Manhattan distance of any cell `(r, c)` from the starting cell `(r0, c0)`.
3. **Sort the Cells:** Sort the list of coordinates based on their calculated Manhattan distance.
4. **Return the Sorted List:** Return the sorted list of coordinates.

### Code

```python
def allCellsDistOrder(R, C, r0, c0):
    # Step 1: Generate all coordinates in the matrix
    cells = [(r, c) for r in range(R) for c in range(C)]
    
    # Step 2: Define a function to calculate Manhattan distance
    def manhattanDist(cell):
        r, c = cell
        return abs(r - r0) + abs(c - c0)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list of cells based on their Manhattan distance
    cells.sort(key=manhattanDist)
    
    # Step 4: Return the sorted list of coordinates
    return cells

# Example usage:
R, C, r0, c0 = 2, 3, 1, 2
print(allCellsDistOrder(R, C, r0, c0))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is as follows:

1. **Generating all coordinates:** O(R * C) because we iterate through each cell in the matrix.
2. **Sorting the cells:** O((R * C) log (R * C)) due to the sorting algorithm.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is:

\[ \mathbf{O(R \cdot C) + O((R \cdot C) \log (R \cdot C))} = \mathbf{O((R \cdot C) \log (R \cdot C))} \]

This is efficient for the input size constraints typically expected in such problems.
