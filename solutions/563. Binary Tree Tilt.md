title:  Binary Tree Tilt-out
permalink: /s563
---
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.

The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null nodes have a tilt of 0.

The tilt of the whole tree is the sum of the tilts of all its nodes.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the input format?
   - You are given a binary tree represented by its root node.
   
2. What should be returned?
   - Return an integer representing the sum of all node tilts in the binary tree.
   
3. Are there any constraints on the values within the tree nodes?
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
   - -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach, which will allow us to calculate both the sum of the nodes' values and the tilt in a single pass. We'll perform the following steps recursively:

1. **Calculate the sum of the subtree rooted at each node**: This involves calculating the sum of the left and right subtrees.
2. **Compute the tilt for each node**: The tilt of a node is the absolute difference between the sum of the values in the left subtree and the sum of the values in the right subtree.
3. **Accumulate the tilt values**: We'll keep a running total of all tilt values encountered during the DFS.

### Code
Here is the Python program that implements the solution:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def findTilt(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        total_tilt = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal total_tilt
            if not node:
                return 0
            left_sum = dfs(node.left)
            right_sum = dfs(node.right)
            node_tilt = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
            total_tilt += node_tilt
            return node.val + left_sum + right_sum
        
        dfs(root)
        return total_tilt
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the above solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack space utilization. In the worst case, for a skewed binary tree, h could be equal to n, but for a balanced binary tree, h = log(n).
