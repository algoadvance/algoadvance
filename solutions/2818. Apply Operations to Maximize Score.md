title:  Apply Operations to Maximize Score-out
permalink: /s2818
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose any subarray of size `k` from the array `nums` and swap it with another subarray of size `k` such that none of the elements of the chosen subarrays overlap if the subarrays are not continuous with a distance of at least `k - 1`. 

You can apply this operation at most once. Find the maximum sum of elements corresponding to the subarray `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Subarray Size**: Confirm that we are working with subarrays of fixed size `k`.
2. **No Overlap**: Ensure understanding of the rule regarding non-overlap of swapped subarrays with a distance of at least `k - 1`.
3. **Single Operation**: Verify that the operation can be applied at most once.
4. **Objective**: The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of elements after the operation is applied (if beneficial).

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `nums`, no operation can be performed, and we simply return the sum of the array. 
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use sliding window to calculate sum of all possible subarrays of size `k`.
3. **Store Maximum Values**: Track the maximum subarray sum throughout iterations to ensure we find the highest possible value.
4. **Try Different Swaps**: Try swapping different subarrays of size `k` to see if it results in a higher total sum.

### Code
```python
def maximizeScore(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # If k is greater than the length of nums
    if k >= n:
        return sum(nums)
    
    # Helper function to calculate sums of all subarrays of size k
    def k_subarray_sums(nums, k):
        current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
        subarray_sums = [current_sum]
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        return subarray_sums

    # Calculate initial subarray sums
    subarray_sums = k_subarray_sums(nums, k)
    
    max_sum = max(nums)
    for i in range(n - k):
        for j in range(i + 2 * k - 1, n - k + 1):
            current_sum = sum(nums[:i]) + subarray_sums[i//k] + sum(nums[(i+k):j]) + subarray_sums[j//k] + sum(nums[(j+k):])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating Initial Subarray Sums**: `O(n)`, since we iterate through the list once.
- **Finding the Maximum Sum**: Nested loops result in `O((n-k)(n-2k+2))`.

Total complexity is `O(n^2)`, which can be potentially optimized.

### Summary
- Implement the `maximizeScore` function, considering the constraints provided.
- Utilize a sliding window approach to calculate sums of subarrays of a given size.
- Evaluate sum impacts by considering one-time operations to maximize the subarray sum.

We can further optimize the nested loop search or consider more advanced range sum techniques if needed for larger n.
