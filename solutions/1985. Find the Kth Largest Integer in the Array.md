title:  Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array-out
permalink: /s1985
---
Given an array of strings `nums` representing integers and an integer `k`, return the k-th largest integer in the array.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
Output: "3"

Input: nums = ["2","21","12","1"], k = 3
Output: "2"

Input: nums = ["0","0"], k = 2
Output: "0"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i].length <= 100`
- `nums[i]` consists of only digits.
- `nums[i]` will not have any leading zeros.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input size:** Whatâ€™s the maximum size of the array?
   - Up to 10,000 elements.
   
2. **Length of each string integer:** Is there a constraint on the length of each integer string?
   - Yes, each can be up to 100 digits.
   
3. **Leading zeros:** Are there any leading zeros in the integers?
   - No, there are no leading zeros.

### Strategy
1. **Comparison Handling:** Since we are dealing with strings that represent integers, directly comparing their lengths will give us an idea about which number is larger, without converting them to integers.
2. **Sorting Approach:** We can sort the array based on the integer value represented by each string. To achieve this, we can use a custom comparator.
3. **Selection:** After sorting the array, the k-th largest element will be at the index `-k` because Python supports negative indexing.

### Code
```python
def kthLargestNumber(nums: [str], k: int) -> str:
    # Sorting the list with the custom comparator
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    # Return the k-th largest element
    return nums[-k]

# Test the function
nums1 = ["3", "6", "7", "10"]
k1 = 4
print(kthLargestNumber(nums1, k1))  # Output: "3"

nums2 = ["2", "21", "12", "1"]
k2 = 3
print(kthLargestNumber(nums2, k2))  # Output: "2"

nums3 = ["0", "0"]
k3 = 2
print(kthLargestNumber(nums3, k3))  # Output: "0"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting Time Complexity:** The sorting of the array will take \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Overall Complexity:** The overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step. The selection afterward is \(O(1)\).

In essence, this approach effectively handles the problem within the constraints provided.
