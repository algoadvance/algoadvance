title:  Mice and Cheese-out
permalink: /s2611
---

You are given two arrays of positive integers `reward1` and `reward2`, each of length `n`. Each element in `reward1` represents a reward a mouse would get if it chooses a particular cheese, and the corresponding element in `reward2` represents the reward the mouse would get if it chooses another cheese. You also have an integer `k` representing the number of choices a mouse can make from `reward1`. Once chosen, another mouse will take the remaining choices from `reward2`. Your goal is to maximize the total reward for both mice combined.

Implement a function:

```python
def mice_and_cheese(reward1: List[int], reward2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

where:
1. `reward1: List[int]` - an array of positive integers representing rewards for the first choice.
2. `reward2: List[int]` - an array of positive integers representing rewards for the second choice.
3. `k: int` - the number of choices to take from `reward1`.

Return the maximum total reward that can be obtained by both mice combined.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are `reward1` and `reward2` guaranteed to be of the same length `n`?
2. Are all values in `reward1` and `reward2` positive integers?
3. Can `k` be zero or equal to `n`?

### Strategy

To maximize the total reward, we should focus on determining which `k` choices to take from `reward1` such that the total combined reward is maximized. Here's a strategic approach to solve this problem:

1. **Calculate Differences**: For each index `i`, calculate the difference `delta = reward1[i] - reward2[i]`. This `delta` represents the benefit (or loss, if negative) of choosing the reward from `reward1` over `reward2`.

2. **Sort by Benefit**: Sort the indices based on the `delta` in descending order because the higher the `delta`, the more beneficial it is to choose from `reward1`.

3. **Choose the Top k**: Choose the top `k` indices with the highest `delta`. The combined reward will be maximized by choosing the highest positive impacts from `reward1` and letting the other mouse have the `reward2` values for those indices.

4. **Sum Remaining Rewards**: Calculate the total reward for chosen indices from `reward1` and the rest from `reward2`.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy:

```python
def mice_and_cheese(reward1, reward2, k):
    # Calculate the deltas
    deltas = [(reward1[i] - reward2[i], i) for i in range(len(reward1))]
    
    # Sort indices based on delta in descending order
    deltas.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # Select top k indices from the sorted delta list
    chosen_reward1_indices = set([deltas[i][1] for i in range(k)])
    
    # Calculate the total reward
    total_reward = 0
    
    for i in range(len(reward1)):
        if i in chosen_reward1_indices:
            total_reward += reward1[i]
        else:
            total_reward += reward2[i]

    return total_reward
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating Deltas**: \(O(n)\)
- **Sorting Deltas**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Calculating Total Reward**: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for typical input size constraints.

By following this approach, we ensure that the solution maximizes the combined total reward for both mice.
