title:  Minimum Numbers of Function Calls to Make Target Array-out
permalink: /s1558
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. You have an unlimited number of `multiply-2` and `decrement` operations you can perform on elements of the array.

- The `multiply-2` operation multiplies an element by `2`.
- The `decrement` operation decreases an element by `1`.

Your goal is to make all the elements in the array equal to `0` using the least number of operations. Return the minimum number of operations needed for this purpose.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the elements in the `nums` array?
     - **Answer:** The integers in `nums` range from 0 to \(10^9\).
   
   - What is the length range of the `nums` array?
     - **Answer:** The length of `nums` can be between 1 and \(10^5\).

2. **Operation Constraints:**
   - Are the operations applied independently to each element or can we apply them to the entire array at once?
     - **Answer:** Operations are applied independently to each element in the array.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Operations:**
   - `decrement` decreases an element by 1.
   - `multiply-2` doubles an element.

2. **Observation:**
   - To make a number zero, we always need as many `decrement` operations as there are `1` bits in the binary representation of the number (since each `1` eventually needs to be decremented to `0`).
   - To reduce the number to zero, we also need to reverse the `multiply-2` steps, which traces back to the count of bitwise shifts (right shifts in binary) until the number becomes zero.

3. **Steps:**
   - For each number, the total operations will be the sum of the number of `1` bits (since each `1` needs to be decremented) and the number of bitwise shifts (right shifts in binary) we need before the number becomes zero.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - For each number in `nums`, count the number of `1` bits (using `bin(x).count('1')`).
   - Find the maximum number of bits in the binary representation of any number in the array (which gives the number of `multiply-2` or right shifts required).

5. **Result:**
   - Sum of all the counts of `1` bits plus the maximum number of bits across all numbers.

### Time Complexity
   - Counting the `1` bits requires \(O(\log n)\) time per number.
   - Thus, for `n` numbers, it requires \(O(n \log n)\) time overall.

### Code

```python
def minOperations(nums):
    total_decrements = 0
    max_shifts = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        bits = bin(num)
        total_decrements += bits.count('1')
        max_shifts = max(max_shifts, bits.rfind('1'))
    
    return total_decrements + max_shifts

# Example Test Case
nums = [1, 5, 2, 4]
print(minOperations(nums))  # Output should be 9
```

In the provided solution:
- The `total_decrements` accumulates the total number of `decrement` operations needed.
- The `max_shifts` keeps track of the most number of `multiply-2` operations required.
- The `bin()` function is used to get the binary representation, and `rfind('1')` gives the position of the last `1` in the binary string, indicating the highest bit position as an approximation for shifts required.

Remember, the primary goal is to ensure every bit of every number is handled either by decrementing individual `1` bits or through `multiply-2` operations counted as shifts.
