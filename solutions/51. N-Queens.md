The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` chess queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

Given an integer `n`, return all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

```
Example:
Input: n = 4
Output: [
  [".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],
  ["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the expected range of `n`? (For most interview scenarios, `n` is typically small enough such that `n < 20`.)
2. Can `n` be less than 1, or should we assume `n` is always a positive integer? (Usually assume `n >= 1`, but confirm the constraints.)

### Strategy

1. Use a backtracking approach to explore possible placements of queens on the board.
2. Create a helper function to check if a queen can be placed at a given row and column without being attacked by other queens.
3. Use recursive backtracking to place queens row by row and backtrack when a placement leads to a conflict.
4. Collect all valid board configurations and return them.

### Code

```python
def solveNQueens(n: int):
    def solve(row, cols, diagonals1, diagonals2, state):
        if row == n:
            result.append(state)
            return
        
        for col in range(n):
            diag1 = row - col
            diag2 = row + col
            if col in cols or diag1 in diagonals1 or diag2 in diagonals2:
                continue
            
            cols.add(col)
            diagonals1.add(diag1)
            diagonals2.add(diag2)
            solve(row + 1, cols, diagonals1, diagonals2, state + ['.' * col + 'Q' + '.' * (n - col - 1)])
            cols.remove(col)
            diagonals1.remove(diag1)
            diagonals2.remove(diag2)

    result = []
    solve(0, set(), set(), set(), [])
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 4
print(solveNQueens(n))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the N-Queens problem is quite complex to analyze due to the nature of the backtracking algorithm:

- In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible board configurations, which is `O(n^n)`.
- However, practical performance is significantly better due to pruning (as we backtrack when a placement is invalid).

Therefore, while the theoretical worst case is `O(n^n)`, the actual runtime is often much better owing to the design of the backtracking and pruning.
