title:  Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II-out
permalink: /s3197
---

Given a binary matrix `mat` where `mat[i][j]` is either 0 or 1, find the smallest rectangle that covers all 1's in `mat`. The rectangle must be aligned with the matrix rows and columns.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the matrix be empty?
    - Assume it is guaranteed that the matrix is not empty.
    
2. What should be returned if no 1's are present in the matrix?
    - We should return an area of 0 since there are no 1's to cover.

3. Is there any constraint on the size of the matrix?
    - No specific size constraint is given, but we should consider standard constraints typically found in interview problems.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Idea**: Identify the boundaries of the rectangle that covers all 1's by finding:
    - The minimum and maximum row indices (`min_row`, `max_row`) where 1's are present.
    - The minimum and maximum column indices (`min_col`, `max_col`) where 1's are present.

2. **Steps**:
   - Loop through each element of the matrix to record the positions of all 1's.
   - Compute the rectangle's dimensions as `(max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)`.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - All elements are 0's: should return 0.
   - Matrix dimensions: handle edge cases where the matrix has only one row or one column.

### Code

```python
def minArea(mat):
    if not mat or not mat[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows = len(mat)
    cols = len(mat[0])
    
    min_row = rows
    max_row = 0
    min_col = cols
    max_col = 0
    
    found_one = False
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if mat[i][j] == 1:
                found_one = True
                if i < min_row:
                    min_row = i
                if i > max_row:
                    max_row = i
                if j < min_col:
                    min_col = j
                if j > max_col:
                    max_col = j
    
    if not found_one:
        return 0
    
    return (max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)

# Example usage
mat = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1, 0]
]
print(minArea(mat))  # Should return 6
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(rows * cols)** where `rows` is the number of rows and `cols` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we traverse each element of the matrix exactly once.

The space complexity is:
- **O(1)** since we are only using a fixed number of extra variables.

This approach efficiently finds the smallest rectangle to cover all 1's in a binary matrix.
