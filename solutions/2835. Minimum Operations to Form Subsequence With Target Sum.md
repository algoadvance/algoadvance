title:  Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum-out
permalink: /s2835
---

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers, and an integer `target`. In one operation, you can remove any element from the array `nums`. The goal is to form a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of the subsequence is equal to `target` with the minimum number of operations.

Return the minimum number of operations required to get such a subsequence. If it is not possible to form the target sum, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `nums` array be empty?**
   - No, `nums` will always contain at least one positive integer.

2. **Can the `target` be zero or negative?**
   - No, `target` will always be a positive integer.

3. **Do we need to maintain any particular order in the subsequence?**
   - No, the order of elements in the subsequence does not matter as long as their sum equals `target`.

4. **What is the size constraint of the `nums` array?**
    - The length of `nums` can be up to \(10^5\).

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the `nums` array. This allows us to try adding the largest possible numbers to the subsequence first, which might reduce the number of operations needed.
   
2. **Iterate and Accumulate**: Iterate through the sorted array in reverse (starting from the largest number) and keep adding elements to a running sum.

3. **Check Running Sum**: Continue adding elements to the running sum until the running sum is greater than or equal to `target`.

4. **Determine Minimum Operations**: The number of elements added gives the number of operations required. If the running sum does not reach `target` after considering all elements, return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def minOperations(nums, target):
    nums.sort(reverse=True)  # Sort numbers in descending order
    current_sum = 0
    operations = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if current_sum >= target:
            break
        current_sum += num
        operations += 1
    
    return operations if current_sum >= target else -1

# Example usage:
# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# target = 5
# print(minOperations(nums, target))  # Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sort operation will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the array will take \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently determining the minimum number of operations needed to form a subsequence whose sum equals the target.
