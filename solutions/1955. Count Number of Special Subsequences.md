title:  Count Number of Special Subsequences-out
permalink: /s1955

You are given a list of integers `nums` consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s. You need to find the number of subsequences that are "special." A subsequence is special if it can be represented as `[0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 1, ..., 1, 2, 2, ..., 2]` where the number of each group of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s) is at least one.

Return the number of special subsequences modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Example:
1. `Input`: nums = `[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]`
   `Output`: 8

2. `Input`: nums = `[2, 2, 2]`
   `Output`: 0

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Is the input always valid, and is it guaranteed to be a list of integers consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s?
2. What is the maximum length of the input list?

## Strategy:
1. We'll use a dynamic programming approach with three counters:
    - `count_0`: to count subsequences that can be formed with any number of 0s.
    - `count_1`: to count special subsequences that include any number of 0s followed by any number of 1s.
    - `count_2`: to count special subsequences that include any number of 0s, any number of 1s, followed by any number of 2s.
2. Traverse through the list of numbers and update these counters accordingly.
3. At each number, we update the counters as follows:
    - If the number is `0`, it can start new subsequences or extend the existing subsequences containing only 0s.
    - If the number is `1`, it can extend existing subsequences that end with 0s or continue subsequences that contain 1s.
    - If the number is `2`, it completes subsequences that end with 1s or extend existing subsequences containing 2s.

## Code:

```python
def countSpecialSubsequences(nums):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    count_0 = 0
    count_1 = 0
    count_2 = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            count_0 = (2 * count_0 + 1) % MOD
        elif num == 1:
            count_1 = (2 * count_1 + count_0) % MOD
        elif num == 2:
            count_2 = (2 * count_2 + count_1) % MOD

    return count_2

# Example usage:
nums = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2]
print(countSpecialSubsequences(nums))  # Output: 8
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input list `nums`. This is because we traverse the list once and perform constant time operations for each element.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a fixed amount of extra space for the counters and not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
