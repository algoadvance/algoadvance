title:  Remove All Occurrences of a Substring-out
permalink: /s1910
---

Given two strings, `s` and `part`, you need to remove all occurrences of the string `part` from the string `s` until `part` can no longer be found in `s`. Output the final string after all possible removals.

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "daabcbaabcbc"`, `part = "abc"`
- Output: `"dab"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the substring `part` overlap with itself in the string `s`?
   - **A:** No, each removal of `part` from `s` is considered independently; once `part` is found and removed, the process continues with the modified string.
  
2. **Q:** What should be done if `part` is an empty string?
   - **A:** It can be assumed that `part` will not be an empty string as per general problem constraints. If it is empty, the problem definition would need to be revisited.

3. **Q:** Can the string `part` be longer than `s`?
   - **A:** Yes, in which case there will be no occurrences and `s` will remain unchanged.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a simple loop that repeatedly finds and removes the substring `part` from `s` until `part` can no longer be found. This is achieved using Pythonâ€™s `str.replace` method, which allows for straightforward substitution.

*Steps:*
1. Continuously check for the presence of `part` in `s`.
2. Use the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of `part`.

*Termination Condition:*
- When `part` is no longer found in `s`.

### Code

```python
def removeOccurrences(s: str, part: str) -> str:
    while part in s:
        s = s.replace(part, '', 1)
    return s

# Example usage
s = "daabcbaabcbc"
part = "abc"
print(removeOccurrences(s, part))  # Output should be "dab"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Each iteration of `replace`**: O(n), where n is the length of `s`, as a single traverse of the string might be needed.
- **Number of iterations**: Dependent on the structure of `s` and `part`, but in the worst case, it can be as high as O(n/m), where `m` is the length of `part`.
- **Overall complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is O(n^2/m), as for each operation linear time is spent, and this operation could theoretically occur n/m times.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(1) for extra space beyond the input strings `s` and `part`. However, strings in Python are immutable, so each replacement generates a new string, implicating temporary auxiliary space usage proportional to the length of `s`.
