Given a 2D integer array `matrix`, return the **transpose** of `matrix`.

The **transpose** of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

### Example:
```python
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q: Is the input always a valid 2D list of integers, or do we need to handle invalid inputs?**
   A: For this problem, you can assume that the input is always a valid matrix.

2. **Q: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix?**
   A: The dimensions of the matrix will be such that `1 <= rows, columns <= 1000`.

3. **Q: Can the matrix be non-square?**
   A: Yes, the matrix can have different numbers of rows and columns.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize an Empty Matrix**:
   - First, we'll initialize a new matrix `transpose` with dimensions swapped. For example, if the input matrix is `m x n`, then the transposed matrix will be `n x m`.

2. **Populate the Transpose Matrix**:
   - Iterate through the rows and columns of the original matrix.
   - For each element in the original matrix at position [i][j], place it in the transposed matrix at position [j][i].

3. **Return the Transposed Matrix**.

### Code

```python
def transpose(matrix):
    # Getting the dimensions of the original matrix
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    
    # Creating a new matrix with swapped dimensions
    transpose_matrix = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]
    
    # Populating the transpose matrix
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            transpose_matrix[c][r] = matrix[r][c]
    
    return transpose_matrix

# Test cases
print(transpose([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]))  # Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
print(transpose([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]))         # Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through each element of the original matrix exactly once to build the transposed matrix.

The space complexity is **O(m * n)** as well because we are creating a new matrix to store the transpose with `n` rows and `m` columns.
