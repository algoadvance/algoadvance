title:  Can Place Flowers-out
permalink: /s605
---

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing 0's and 1's, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of the `flowerbed` array?
   - The length of the flowerbed will be in the range `[1, 2 * 10^4]`.

2. Will the `flowerbed` array always be valid (containing only 0s and 1s)?
   - Yes.

3. Can we solve this problem in-place, or is additional space allowed?
   - Preferably in-place, but using extra space is allowed if necessary.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the flowerbed array and try to plant flowers in the available spots. To determine if a flower can be planted at a specific index `i`, we need to check three conditions:
1. `flowerbed[i] == 0`: The current spot is empty.
2. `i == 0 or flowerbed[i-1] == 0`: Either we are at the beginning of the array or the previous spot is empty.
3. `i == len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0`: Either we are at the end of the array or the next spot is empty.

If all three conditions above are fulfilled, we can plant a flower at index `i` and increment our counter for planted flowers. If at any point the number of planted flowers meets or exceeds `n`, we return `True`. If we finish iterating through the array and haven't planted enough flowers, we return `False`.

## Code

```python
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n):
    count = 0  # Counter for planted flowers
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(flowerbed):
        if flowerbed[i] == 0:
            # Check if left and right positions are empty or at boundary
            empty_left = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i-1] == 0)
            empty_right = (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i+1] == 0)
            
            if empty_left and empty_right:
                flowerbed[i] = 1  # Plant a flower
                count += 1
                if count >= n:
                    return True
                # Skip the next spot as we can't plant adjacent
                i += 2
                continue
        
        i += 1
    
    return count >= n
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the `flowerbed`. This is because we iterate through the array once, making constant time checks and updates.

The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are modifying the input array in-place and only using a few additional variables.
