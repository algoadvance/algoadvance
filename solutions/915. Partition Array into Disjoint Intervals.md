title:  Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals-out
permalink: /s915
---

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to partition the array into two disjoint (non-overlapping) intervals `left` and `right` such that every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.

- `left` will have at least one element.
- `left` and `right` can also be empty, but they must cover the whole array.

Return the minimum length of `left` after such a partitioning. Note that there is a solution guaranteed.

### Strategy

1. **Clarifying Questions:**
    - What is the expected input range?
    - Are there any constraints we should be aware of regarding the values within the input array?

2. **Approach:**
    - We need to ensure that every element in the left partition is less than or equal to every element in the right partition.
    - To achieve this, we will maintain two arrays: one to track the maximum values in the left partition (`left_max`), and another to track the minimum values in the right partition (`right_min`).
    - Iterate through the array and update the `left_max` for each index from the start and `right_min` from the end.
    - Finally, find the partition point where the maximum value in `left_max` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `right_min`.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def partitionDisjoint(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    left_max = [0] * n
    right_min = [0] * n
    
    left_max[0] = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], nums[i])
    
    right_min[n-1] = nums[n-1]
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], nums[i])
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if left_max[i-1] <= right_min[i]:
            return i

# Example usage
nums = [5, 0, 3, 8, 6]
print(partitionDisjoint(nums)) # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Creating `left_max` array:** O(n)
- **Creating `right_min` array:** O(n)
- **Finding the partition point:** O(n)

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the extra storage used for the `left_max` and `right_min` arrays.
