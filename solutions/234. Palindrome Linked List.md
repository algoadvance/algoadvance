title:  Palindrome Linked List-out
permalink: /s234
---
Given the head of a singly linked list, return `true` if it is a palindrome or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the expected input and output?
   - **Input:** The head of a singly linked list.
   - **Output:** A boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the linked list is a palindrome.

2. What is the range of input values?
   - The list can be empty or very large, up to the constraints of the problem's definition.

3. Can we modify the linked list during the operations?
   - It is generally safer to assume that we should not modify the linked list unless explicitly allowed by the problem statement.

### Strategy
1. **Find the middle of the linked list.**
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique where the `slow` pointer moves one step at a time and the `fast` pointer moves two steps. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will reach the middle of the list.

2. **Reverse the second half of the list.**
   - Once the middle is found, reverse the second half of the linked list.

3. **Check for palindrome.**
   - Compare the elements from the start of the list and the start of the reversed second half.

4. **Restore the list.**
   - Optionally, restore the list back to its original state by reversing the second half again.

5. **Return the result.**

### Code
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True
        
        # Function to reverse a linked list
        def reverse(head):
            prev = None
            current = head
            while current:
                next_node = current.next
                current.next = prev
                prev = current
                current = next_node
            return prev
        
        # Find the middle of the linked list
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Reverse the second half of the linked list
        second_half = reverse(slow)
        
        # Compare the first and second half nodes
        first_half, second_half_copy = head, second_half
        result = True
        while result and second_half_copy:
            if first_half.val != second_half_copy.val:
                result = False
            first_half = first_half.next
            second_half_copy = second_half_copy.next
        
        # Optional: Restore the list
        reverse(second_half)
        
        return result
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding the middle of the linked list:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
- **Reversing the second half of the linked list:** `O(n/2)` which is simplified to `O(n)`.
- **Comparing the nodes:** `O(n/2)` which is simplified to `O(n)`.
- **Restoring the list (optional):** `O(n/2)` which is simplified to `O(n)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n)` since all operations contribute linearly.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using only a few pointers, and no additional data structures that grow with the input size.
