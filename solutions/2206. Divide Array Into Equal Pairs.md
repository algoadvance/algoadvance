title:  Divide Array Into Equal Pairs-out
permalink: /s2206
---

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers. You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that:
- Each pair consists of exactly two elements.
- Both elements in a pair are equal.

Return `true` if you can divide the array into `n` pairs, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Will the length of the array always be even? Given the problem states it is `2 * n`, we can assume it is.
   - What range of numbers can appear in the array?

2. **Output:**
   - We need to return a boolean value, `true` or `false`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the array contains negative numbers?
   - What should we return if the array is empty? Though given the constraints, it's implied it will always contain elements.

### Strategy
To determine if it is possible to divide the array into pairs where each pair contains two equal elements, we can use the following approach:

1. **Count Frequencies:** Count the frequency of each element using a dictionary.
2. **Check Pairs:** Iterate through the frequency dictionary and check if each frequency is even. If all the frequencies are even, it is possible to form pairs of equal elements.

### Code

```python
def divideArray(nums):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Utilize Counter to get the frequency of each element
    freq_dict = Counter(nums)
    
    # Check if all frequencies are even
    for frequency in freq_dict.values():
        if frequency % 2 != 0:
            return False
        
    return True
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Frequencies:** 
   - `Counter(nums)` creates a dictionary where keys are the elements from the array and values are their corresponding counts.

2. **Checking Each Frequency:**
   - The loop `for frequency in freq_dict.values()` iterates over the count of each element.
   - The condition `if frequency % 2 != 0:` checks if the frequency is odd. If any frequency is odd, it returns `False` since it will not be possible to form pairs with that element.

3. **Returning the Result:**
   - If the loop completes without finding any odd frequency, the function returns `True`, indicating it is possible to divide the array into pairs of equal elements.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This includes the time to count the elements and the time to iterate through the frequency dictionary.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the frequency count in a dictionary.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the problem constraints.
