title:  Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k-out
permalink: /s3070
---

You are given a matrix `mat` of integers and an integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of submatrices whose top-left corner element is `mat[0][0]` and the sum of all their elements is less than or equal to `k`.

### Inputs:
1. `mat`: A list of lists of integers representing the matrix.
2. `k`: An integer representing the threshold sum.

### Output:
- An integer representing the number of submatrices that meet the given criteria.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Dimensions of the Matrix**:
   - What are the sizes of the matrix (`n` x `m`)? Are they guaranteed to be non-zero?
   
2. **Matrix Values**:
   - Are there any constraints on the integers inside the matrix? (e.g., negative numbers?)

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if no valid submatrix is found? (Assuming the count will be 0)

With these questions clarified, we can proceed to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Initialize a counter to track the number of valid submatrices.
   - Iterate over all possible submatrix sizes starting from `(1x1)` up to `(n x m)`, and always anchoring the top-left corner at `mat[0][0]`.
   - For each submatrix, compute the sum of its elements.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `k`, increment the counter.

The brute force approach is computationally expensive, but let's start with it.

## Code

Here's the Python code implementing the brute force approach:

```python
def count_submatrices_with_topleft_element_and_sum_less_than_k(mat, k):
    def submatrix_sum(r, c):
        total = 0
        for i in range(r+1):
            for j in range(c+1):
                total += mat[i][j]
        return total
    
    n = len(mat)
    m = len(mat[0])

    count = 0
    
    for row in range(n):
        for col in range(m):
            if submatrix_sum(row, col) <= k:
                count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
mat = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
k = 15
print(count_submatrices_with_topleft_element_and_sum_less_than_k(mat, k))
```

## Time Complexity

- The above brute force approach involves iterating over all submatrix sizes `(O(n^2 * m^2))`.
- For each submatrix, summing up the elements takes `O(n * m)` operations.

Thus, the total time complexity for the brute force approach is `O(n^3 * m^3)`, which is not efficient for large matrices.

**Optimization** can be achieved by utilizing prefix sums for more efficient submatrix sum calculations. This will allow us to compute the sum of any submatrix in constant time.

Let's outline the optimized approach using prefix sums.

```python
import itertools

def count_submatrices_with_topleft_element_and_sum_less_than_k(mat, k):
    n = len(mat)
    m = len(mat[0])

    # Compute prefix sum matrix
    prefix_sum = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            prefix_sum[i][j] = (
                mat[i-1][j-1]
                + prefix_sum[i-1][j]
                + prefix_sum[i][j-1]
                - prefix_sum[i-1][j-1]
            )
    
    count = 0
    
    for row in range(n):
        for col in range(m):
            submatrix_sum = prefix_sum[row + 1][col + 1]
            if submatrix_sum <= k:
                count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
mat = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
k = 15
print(count_submatrices_with_topleft_element_and_sum_less_than_k(mat, k))
```

This optimized approach using prefix sums computes the sum in `O(1)` time for each submatrix, leading to an overall time complexity of `O(n * m)`.
