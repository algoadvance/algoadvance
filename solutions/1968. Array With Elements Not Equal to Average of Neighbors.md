title:  Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors-out
permalink: /s1968
---

The problem is defined as follows:

Given an integer array `nums`, rearrange the elements of `nums` such that no element in the rearranged array is equal to the average of its neighbors.

More formally, for every index `i` in the rearranged array, the condition `nums[i] != (nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2` must hold true.

Return any rearrangement of `nums` that meets the condition.

**Example**:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,4,5,3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the expected length of the input array?
   **A**: The problem does not specify the maximum length, but typically constraints in such problems vary from a small number to thousands of elements.

2. **Q**: Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   **A**: Yes, the problem does not specify that all elements are unique, so duplicates are allowed.

3. **Q**: Should the rearranged array be unique?
   **A**: No, any valid rearrangement that satisfies the condition is acceptable.

4. **Q**: What data types are allowed in the array?
   **A**: The array contains only integer values.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to rearrange the elements such that the condition `nums[i] != (nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) / 2` holds for every index `i`. Here is a step-by-step strategy we can follow:

1. **Sorting**: Sort the array. The sorted array helps to ensure that by properly interleaving elements, we can avoid situations where an element becomes the average of its neighbors.
  
2. **Rearranging**: Split the sorted array into two halves. In one configuration, place the larger half into the odd indexes of the result array and the smaller half into the even indexes, ensuring that they are not directly comparable by their average.

3. **Merging**: Merge these two halves alternatively to get the desired result.

4. **Verification**: Ensure that the resultant array satisfies the condition. 

5. **Return**: Return the rearranged array.

## Code

Below is a Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
from typing import List

def rearrangeArray(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    
    result = []
    left = nums[:n//2]
    right = nums[n//2:]
    
    # Interleave left and right elements
    j = 0
    for i in range(len(left)):
        result.append(right[i])
        if j < len(right):
            result.append(left[i])
  
    # Check if the result array satisfies the condition
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if result[i] == (result[i-1] + result[i+1]) / 2:
            return rearrangeArray(nums)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(rearrangeArray(nums))
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Interleaving elements**: `O(N)` for creating the result array.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is `O(N log N)` due to the sorting step.

This implementation ensures that we get a valid rearrangement that meets the criteria of the problem.
