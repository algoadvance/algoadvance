title:  Sliding Window Median-out
permalink: /s480
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, representing the size of the sliding window. The sliding window can only move one position at a time. We need to find the median of the elements inside the sliding window each time it moves to the right.

Return an array of the medians.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the input array (`nums`)?**
   - This will help determine the efficiency required for the solution.
   
2. **What should we do if `k` is greater than the length of the array `nums`?**
   - We need to ensure that valid `k` will be provided.

3. **What if there are duplicates in the `nums` array?**
   - The algorithm should handle duplicates appropriately when calculating the median.

4. **What is the expected output format?**
   - An array of floats representing the medians of the sliding window.

### Example

```python
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [1,-1,-1,3,5,6]
```

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use two heaps (a max-heap for the left half of the numbers, and a min-heap for the right half).
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize two heaps, one for the left half of the sliding window and the other for the right half. Ensure that the max-heap (left half) contains the smaller half of the numbers and the min-heap (right half) contains the larger half.

3. **Maintaining Balance:**
   - Rebalance the heaps after every insertion and deletion to ensure that the left half can contain at most one more element than the right half.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - For each new element, add it to the appropriate heap and remove the element that is sliding out.
   - After every insertion and deletion, adjust the heaps to maintain the balance.

5. **Finding Median:**
   - If the number of elements is odd, the median is the root of the max-heap. If even, it is the average of the roots of both heaps.

### Code

```python
import heapq
from heapq import heappush, heappop

class Solution:
    def medianSlidingWindow(self, nums, k):
        if not nums or k == 0:
            return []
        
        def add_num(num):
            if not max_heap or num <= -max_heap[0]:
                heappush(max_heap, -num)
            else:
                heappush(min_heap, num)
            balance_heaps()
        
        def remove_num(num):
            if num <= -max_heap[0]:
                max_heap.remove(-num)
                heapq.heapify(max_heap)
            else:
                min_heap.remove(num)
                heapq.heapify(min_heap)
            balance_heaps()
        
        def balance_heaps():
            if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1:
                heappush(min_heap, -heappop(max_heap))
            elif len(min_heap) > len(max_heap):
                heappush(max_heap, -heappop(min_heap))
        
        def get_median():
            if len(max_heap) > len(min_heap):
                return float(-max_heap[0])
            return (-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2.0
        
        max_heap = []
        min_heap = []
        result = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            add_num(nums[i])
            if i >= k - 1:
                result.append(get_median())
                remove_num(nums[i - k + 1])
        
        return result

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.medianSlidingWindow([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], 3))  # Output: [1,-1,-1,3,5,6]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Adding/Removing Elements:** \( O(\log{k}) \) due to heap operations.
- **Rebalancing Heaps:** \( O(\log{k}) \)
- **Finding Median:** \( O(1) \)

Given this, the overall time complexity per sliding window operation is \( O(\log{k}) \). The total time complexity for the entire array is \( O(n \log{k}) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input array `nums`.
