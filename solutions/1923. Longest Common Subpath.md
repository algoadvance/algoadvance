title:  Longest Common Subpath-out
permalink: /s1923
---

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of cities, and an array of arrays `paths` where `paths[i]` is an array representing the path taken by the `i-th` friend. Each path consists of integers representing the cities visited in that order. 

Your task is to return the length of the longest common subpath that can be found in every friend's path. If there is no such subpath, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value for `n` and the length of any path?
   - Are there any constraints on the values of the cities? For example, can cities have negative numbers or are they all positive integers?

2. **Values in cities:**
   - Are the cities uniquely identified by integers? Do they start from `1` to some maximum?

3. **Expected Input/Output:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `paths = [[1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]]`
   - Output: `2`, since `[3,4]` is the longest common subpath.

   - Input: `n = 3`, `paths = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]`
   - Output: `0`, as there is no common subpath.


## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called **Rabin-Karp hash** combined with a binary search approach. The basic steps are as follows:

1. **Binary Search on Length:**
   - We'll perform binary search on the length of the subpath. The range will be from `0` to the length of the shortest path in `paths`.

2. **Rabin-Karp Hashing:**
   - For each length `L` we test, we'll use a Rabin-Karp rolling hash to check all subpaths of length `L` in each path.
   - We'll compare these hashed values to find a common subpath in all paths.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Use a set to store the hashed values of subpaths for quick lookup.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def longestCommonSubpath(n, paths):
    def rabin_karp(L, paths):
        base = 10**4 + 7
        mod = 2**63-1
        
        def hash_path(path):
            h, p = 0, 1
            for i in range(L):
                h = (h * base + path[i]) % mod
                p = (p * base) % mod
            yield h, p
            
            for i in range(L, len(path)):
                h = (h * base + path[i] - path[i - L] * p) % mod
                yield h, p
        
        common_hashes = set(hash_path(paths[0]))
        
        for path in paths[1:]:
            current_hashes = set(hash_path(path))
            common_hashes &= current_hashes
            if not common_hashes:
                return False
        
        return bool(common_hashes)
    
    left, right = 0, min(len(path) for path in paths)
    result = 0
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if rabin_karp(mid, paths):
            result = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return result

# Example usage
n = 5
paths = [[1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]]
print(longestCommonSubpath(n, paths))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log(min_length)), where `min_length` is the length of the shortest path.
- **Rabin-Karp Hashing**: O(K * N * log(min_length)), where `K` is the average length of each path and `N` is the number of paths.

This combined gives a time complexity of O(K * N * log(min_length) * log(min_length)), which should be efficient enough for moderate input sizes.
