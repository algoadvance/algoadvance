title:  Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K-out
permalink: /s1461
---
Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` if every binary code of length `k` is a substring of `s`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example
- Example 1:
    - Input: `s = "00110110"`, `k = 2`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10", and "11". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 2, and 4 respectively.
- Example 2:
    - Input: `s = "0110"`, `k = 1`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", and they can be all found as substrings at indices 0 and 1 respectively.
- Example 3:
    - Input: `s = "0110"`, `k = 2`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: The binary code "00" is missing.

### Constraints
1. `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
2. `s[i]` is either '0' or '1'.
3. `1 <= k <= 20`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider the substrings to be case-sensitive?
    - No, all characters are binary digits ('0' or '1').
2. Is there any specific range for k and the length of string s?
    - Yes, constraints are provided in the problem statement.

## Strategy
1. **Generate all binary codes of length `k`:** 
    - There are `2^k` possible binary codes.
2. **Check all substrings of length `k` within `s`:**
    - Use a sliding window approach to extract all substrings of length `k` from `s`.
3. **Use a set to keep track of seen substrings:**
    - Add each extracted substring to the set.
4. **Comparison:** 
    - If the size of the set equals `2^k`, then the string contains all binary codes of size `k`.
    - Otherwise, it doesn't, and we return `false`.

## Code
```python
def hasAllCodes(s: str, k: int) -> bool:
    # Early exit if the string is too short to contain all possible k-length binaries
    if len(s) < (1 << k):
        return False
    
    seen = set()
    total_codes = 1 << k  # 2^k

    # Extract all substrings of length k
    for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):
        substring = s[i:i + k]
        seen.add(substring)
        
        # If we've seen all possible codes, return True early
        if len(seen) == total_codes:
            return True
    
    # Finally, check if we've seen all possible codes
    return len(seen) == total_codes
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time complexity:** 
  - Extracting substrings and adding them to the set: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
  - Checking the size of the set is O(1) in the average case.
- **Space complexity:** 
  - The set can hold up to `2^k` elements in the worst case, so it's O(2^k).

Thus, the approach efficiently handles the inputs considering both time and space complexities.
