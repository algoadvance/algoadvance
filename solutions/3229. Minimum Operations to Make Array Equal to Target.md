title:  Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target-out
permalink: /s3229
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`. In one operation, you can either add or subtract any power of 2 to/from any element in `nums`. The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make every element in `nums` equal to `target`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums` and `target`?**
   - This will help us understand if there are any specific edge cases or optimizations needed.
2. **Is there a limit to the number of elements in `nums`?**
   - This will help us determine the efficiency of our approach.
3. **What should we return if it's not possible to make all elements equal to `target`?**
   - Clarifying this helps us understand how to handle edge cases or impossible scenarios (if any).

### Code

Let's devise a solution for finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve the target for all elements in `nums`.

### Strategy

Here's a step-by-step strategy:
1. **Initialize a Counter:** To count the number of operations required.
2. **Bitwise Manipulation:** As we can add or subtract powers of 2, consider the binary representation of the numbers to determine the operations required.
3. **Iterate over `nums`:** For each element in `nums`, compare it to `target` and decide the minimum number of operations required to make them equal using powers of 2.
4. **Calculate Difference:** Each difference can be resolved in `O(log X)` operations, where `X` is the difference.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def minOperations(nums, target):
    def countOps(x):
        ops = 0
        while x > 0:
            if x % 2 == 1:  # If x is odd there will be a 1 in the binary representation
                ops += 1
            x //= 2
        return ops

    total_ops = 0
    for num in nums:
        diff = abs(num - target)
        if diff > 0:
            total_ops += countOps(diff)
    
    return total_ops

# Test cases
print(minOperations([1, 3, 5], 7))  # Example test case
print(minOperations([4, 8, 16], 0))  # Example test case
```
    
### Time Complexity

The time complexity is calculated as follows:
- **countOps Function:** This function runs in `O(log X)` time, where `X` is the value of the difference between a number and the target.
- **Overall Complexity:** As we iterate over each element in `nums` and perform the `countOps` for each element, the overall complexity is `O(n * log D)`, where `D` is the maximum difference between any element in `nums` and the `target`.

Thus, the solution is efficient given typical input sizes for such problems.
