title:  Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II-out
permalink: /s117
---

Given a binary tree:

```plaintext
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all `next` pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"4"},"right":{"$id":"5"},"val":2},"right":{"$id":"3","right":{"$id":"7"},"val":3},"val":1}
Output: {"$id":"1","left":{"$id":"2","left":{"$id":"4"},"next":{"$id":"3"},"right":{"$id":"5"},"val":2},"next":null,"right":{"$id":"3","next":null,"right":{"$id":"7"},"val":3},"val":1}
```

**Note:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the tree can have any number of levels?
2. Should we handle cases where the input binary tree is empty?

## Strategy

1. **Level Order Traversal using Pointers:** We will use a level-order traversal approach (similar to breadth-first search) to connect each node to the next right node.
2. **Dummy Node:** The main idea is to use a dummy node that helps us connect nodes at the current level. We will iterate through the current level and establish connections for the next level.
3. **Pointer Manipulation:** We will use a `current` node to traverse through the current level and a `tail` pointer to build the `next` pointers for the next level.
4. **Upstream to Next Level:** Once the iteration of the current level is done, we move to the next level using the dummy's next pointer.

### Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not root:
            return root
        
        # Start with the root node
        current = root
        
        while current:
            # Use a dummy node to establish the 'next' connections of the next level
            dummy = Node(0)
            tail = dummy
            
            # Iterate over the current level
            while current:
                if current.left:
                    tail.next = current.left
                    tail = tail.next
                if current.right:
                    tail.next = current.right
                    tail = tail.next
                # Move to the next node in the current level
                current = current.next
            
            # Move to the next level
            current = dummy.next
        
        return root
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the algorithm itself as we are using a constant amount of extra space. However, the recursion stack space will be O(h) where h is the height of the tree.

This solution efficiently uses pointers to perform the level-order traversal while maintaining the requirement of constant space.
