title:  Maximum Number of Removable Characters-out
permalink: /s1898
---

You are given two strings `s` and `p` where `p` is a subsequence of `s`. You are also given an array `removable` which is an array of indices in `s`. You want to determine the maximum number of characters you can remove from `s` such that `p` is still a subsequence of `s`.

Example:

```python
s = "abcacb"
p = "ab"
removable = [3, 1, 0]

Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `s` and `p` be empty?**
   - No, the problem guarantees that `p` is a subsequence of `s`, which means `s` and `p` have to contain characters for `p` to be a subsequence.
   
2. **Are the indices in `removable` unique?**
   - Yes, they are unique according to the problem description.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the length of the strings and the array?**
   - It usually would be something reasonable. Let's assume:
     - Length of `s` can be up to `10^5`.
     - Length of `p` and `removable` will be up to `10^5` as well.

### Strategy

To tackle this problem, we can use the binary search algorithm along with a helper function that checks if `p` is a subsequence of a modified version of `s` given a certain number of removals.

1. **Helper Function (`is_subsequence`):**
   - This function will check if `p` is a subsequence of `s` after removing the first `k` indices as specified in `removable`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - We will use binary search to find the maximum `k` such that `p` is still a subsequence after removing `k` characters.

### Code

Here's how we can do this in Python:

```python
def maximumRemovals(s: str, p: str, removable: list[int]) -> int:
    
    def is_subsequence(s, p, k):
        # Create a set of removed indices
        removed = set(removable[:k])
        si, pi = 0, 0

        while si < len(s) and pi < len(p):
            if si in removed:
                si += 1
                continue
            if s[si] == p[pi]:
                pi += 1
            si += 1

        return pi == len(p)

    left, right = 0, len(removable)
    max_removal = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if is_subsequence(s, p, mid):
            max_removal = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return max_removal

# Example usage
s = "abcacb"
p = "ab"
removable = [3, 1, 0]
print(maximumRemovals(s, p, removable))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

1. **is_subsequence Function:**
   - This function takes \(O(n + m)\) time where \(n\) is the length of `s` and \(m\) is the length of `p`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Binary search runs in \(O(\log r)\) where \(r\) is the length of `removable`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O((n + m) \log r)\), which should be efficient for the given constraints.
