title:  Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator-out
permalink: /s2642
---

You are tasked with designing a weighted, directed graph data structure that supports the following operations:

1. **Add an edge** between two nodes with a given weight.
2. **Find the shortest path** between two nodes using a shortest path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).

Implement a class called `Graph` that has the following methods:
- `add_edge(node1: int, node2: int, weight: int) -> None`: Adds an edge from `node1` to `node2` with a specified `weight`.
- `shortest_path(start: int, end: int) -> int`: Returns the weight of the shortest path from `start` node to `end` node. If there is no path, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the weight of the edges be negative?**
   - No, for simplicity we assume all weights are non-negative.

2. **Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   - Yes, but we will keep only the smallest weight for any direct connection.

3. **Can the graph have cycles?**
   - Yes, the graph can have cycles.

### Strategy

#### Data Structures
- Use a dictionary to represent the graph, where keys are node identifiers and values are lists of tuples representing connected nodes and the edge weights.

#### Algorithms
- Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path for any query regarding the shortest path between two nodes.

#### Graph Representation
```python
{
    node1: [(neighbor1, weight1), (neighbor2, weight2), ...],
    node2: [(neighbor1, weight1), (neighbor3, weight3), ...],
    ...
}
```

### Code

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict, deque

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)

    def add_edge(self, node1: int, node2: int, weight: int) -> None:
        # Add (node2, weight) to the adjacency list of node1
        self.graph[node1].append((node2, weight))

    def shortest_path(self, start: int, end: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the min-heap and the distance dictionary
        heap = [(0, start)]
        distances = {start: 0}
        
        while heap:
            current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)

            if current_node == end:
                return current_distance

            if current_distance > distances.get(current_node, float('inf')):
                continue

            for neighbor, weight in self.graph[current_node]:
                distance = current_distance + weight
                if distance < distances.get(neighbor, float('inf')):
                    distances[neighbor] = distance
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, neighbor))

        return -1

# Example usage:
# g = Graph()
# g.add_edge(1, 2, 1)
# g.add_edge(2, 3, 2)
# g.add_edge(1, 3, 4)
# print(g.shortest_path(1, 3))  # Output: 3
# print(g.shortest_path(1, 4))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **`add_edge(node1, node2, weight)`**:
  - Time Complexity: \(O(1)\) - Constant time to append to the adjacency list.

- **`shortest_path(start, end)`**: 
  - Time Complexity: \(O((V + E) \log V)\) where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges. This follows from Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue.

The provided algorithm is efficient for sparse graphs typically seen in many practical situations. If the graph is more dense, the performance impact will primarily stem from the \(E \log V\) part of the complexity.
