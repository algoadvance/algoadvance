title:  The k Strongest Values in an Array-out
permalink: /s1471
---

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, the **strongest** values in an array are defined as follows:
1. If the median of the array is `m`, the strength of a value `arr[i]` is calculated as the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `m`.
2. If two values have the same strength, the stronger value is the greater value.

You need to return an array of the `k` strongest values in the array. The median is determined based on the sorted order of the array and is described as:
- Median of an array of odd length is the middle element.
- Median of an array of even length is the smaller of the two middle elements.

### Example:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: Median is 3. Strength of values compared to median are as follows: [2, 1, 0, 1, 2].
The strongest values are 5 and 1.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= arr.length`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the values be returned in any particular order?
2. Can the input array contain duplicate values?
3. How do we handle the situation if there are multiple elements with the same strength and value?

Given these assumptions, we can proceed to write the code.

## Strategy
1. Sort the input array to find the median.
2. Define a custom sorting function to compute the strength of each element based on the median.
3. Sort the array based on the custom strength function, with ties broken by the value itself.
4. Return the first `k` elements from the sorted list.

## Code

Here is a Python function to solve the problem:

```python
from typing import List

def getStrongest(arr: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    # Step 1: Sort the array to find the median
    arr.sort()
    n = len(arr)
    median = arr[(n - 1) // 2]
    
    # Step 2: Define a custom sorting key based on strength comparison
    def strength(x):
        return (abs(x - median), x)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the array by the custom key
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, key=strength, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 4: Return the first k elements
    return sorted_arr[:k]

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 2
print(getStrongest(arr, k))  # Output: [5, 1]
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Sorting with the custom key also takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution is efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq arr.length \leq 10^5\). The sorting step dominates the complexity, making the solution feasible within the provided limits.
