title:  Previous Permutation With One Swap-out
permalink: /s1053
---
Given an array of integers `arr`, your task is to return the largest permutation that is smaller than the given array `arr`. You are allowed to make only one swap, where a swap means exchanging two **distinct** positions in the array.

If it is not possible to obtain any permutation smaller than `arr` with exactly one swap, return the same array.

Example:
```
Input: arr = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]

Input: arr = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,1,5]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the elements of the array be negative?
   - **A:** Yes, the elements can be negative.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of the number of elements in the array?
   - **A:** The length of the array can range from 1 to \(10^4\).

3. **Q:** Can the array be sorted in ascending order?
   - **A:** Yes, if the array is in ascending order, the answer would be the same array since we cannot find a permutation smaller with one swap.

### Strategy
1. **Find Decreasing Point:** Traverse the array from the end to find the first index `i` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`. This identifies the point where the order breaks and needs to be adjusted to get a smaller permutation.
2. **Find Swap Candidate:** From elements to the right of `i`, find the largest element that is smaller than `arr[i]`. This ensures the smallest decrement.
3. **Perform Swap:** Swap the identified elements.
4. **Return Result:** Return the modified array.

### Code
```python
def prevPermOpt1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Step 1: Find the first element (from the end) that is larger than the next one
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Step 2: Find the largest element that is smaller than arr[i]
            max_j = i + 1
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if arr[j] < arr[i] and arr[j] > arr[max_j]:
                    max_j = j
            # Step 3: Swap arr[i] and arr[max_j]
            arr[i], arr[max_j] = arr[max_j], arr[i]
            break

    return arr

# Examples
print(prevPermOpt1([3, 2, 1]))  # Output: [3, 1, 2]
print(prevPermOpt1([1, 1, 5]))  # Output: [1, 1, 5]
```

### Explanation
1. **Find Decreasing Point (`i`):** Start from the end of the array and move leftwards to find the first instance where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Find Suitable Swap Candidate (`max_j`):** From the indices to the right of `i`, locate the largest element that is smaller than `arr[i]`.
3. **Execute Swap:** Perform the swap and break the loop to prevent further changes.
4. If no such `i` is found, it indicates the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and is already the smallest permutation with given elements.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array:
- We traverse the array once to find the breaking point `i`.
- Traverse the array once more to find a suitable candidate for the swap.
This ensures the algorithm is efficient even for larger values of `n`.
