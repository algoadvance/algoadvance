title:  Subsequence With the Minimum Score-out
permalink: /s2565
---

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. You want to find the length of the shortest subsequence of `s` that is not a subsequence of `t`. 

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 

A string `a` is a subsequence of another string `b` if it can be derived from `b` by deleting some or no characters of `b` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Return an integer representing the length of the shortest subsequence of `s` that is not a subsequence of `t`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What are the lengths of `s` and `t`?
   - Do both strings consist strictly of lowercase English letters?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should we return the length of the shortest non-subsequence, or the subsequence itself?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - We will maintain two arrays, `left` and `right`, where `left[i]` gives the length of the longest subsequence of `s[:i]` that is a subsequence of `t` and `right[i]` gives the length of the longest subsequence of `s[i:]` that is a subsequence of `t`.

2. **Left Array Construction:**
   - Iterate through `s` and update the `left` array by checking if removing the current character still results in a subsequence.

3. **Right Array Construction:**
   - Iterate through `s` in reverse to construct the `right` array similarly.

4. **Combining Left and Right Arrays:**
   - Iterate through `left` and `right` arrays to find the minimum length subsequence that is not a subsequence of `t`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Return the minimum length of such a subsequence.

### Code

```python
def min_subsequence_length(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    
    # Edge cases
    if m == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 0:
        return 1

    # left[i] will store the smallest length of subsequence in s[:i] that is not in t
    left = [float('inf')] * (m + 1)
    # right[i] will store the smallest length of subsequence in s[i:] that is not in t
    right = [float('inf')] * (m + 1)

    # left to right pass to fill left array
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        seq = s[:i]
        if not is_subsequence(seq, t):
            left[i] = len(seq)
        else:
            left[i] = min(left[i], left[i-1])
    
    # right to left pass to fill right array
    for i in range(m - 1, -1, -1):
        seq = s[i:]
        if not is_subsequence(seq, t):
            right[i] = len(seq)
        else:
            right[i] = min(right[i], right[i+1])

    # Find the minimum value from left and right array
    min_len = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, m):
        min_len = min(min_len, left[i-1] + right[i])
    
    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else -1

def is_subsequence(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    it = iter(t)
    return all(c in it for c in s)

# Example usage
s = "abc"
t = "ahbgdc"
print(min_subsequence_length(s, t))  # Output the minimum subsequence length
```

### Time Complexity

- **is_subsequence function:** O(n)
- **Main processing:** O(m * n)
  - Constructing the `left` and `right` arrays involves iterating through `s` and checking subsequences, which is O(m) operations.
  - Each `is_subsequence` check takes O(n), so the overall complexity is O(m*n).

Small optimizations or different strategies may be necessary depending on specific problem constraints and input sizes.
