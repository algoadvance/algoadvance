title:  Sum of Unique Elements-out
permalink: /s1748
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of all the unique elements of `nums`. Unique elements are those elements that appear exactly once in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array contain negative numbers? 
   - Yes, the input array can contain negative numbers.
2. What should be returned if all elements are duplicates?
   - If there are no unique elements, the function should return 0.
3. Can the array be empty?
   - Yes, if the array is empty, the function should return 0.

### Strategy

1. **Use a dictionary to count occurrences**:
   - Traverse through the array and use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary.
   - For each element in the array, increment its count in the dictionary.

2. **Sum unique elements**:
   - Iterate through the dictionary.
   - Sum the keys which have a value of 1 (indicating they are unique).

This method ensures that we count in a single pass through the array (O(n)), and then sum by iterating through the dictionary (O(u), where u is the number of unique elements).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because counting elements and summing unique elements can both be done in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the frequency of all elements in the dictionary.

### Code

```python
def sum_of_unique(nums):
    frequency = {}
    
    # Traverse through the array and count the frequency of each element
    for num in nums:
        if num in frequency:
            frequency[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency[num] = 1
    
    # Sum up the keys where the count is 1 (unique elements)
    unique_sum = 0
    for num, count in frequency.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_sum += num
    
    return unique_sum
```

### Example

Let's go through an example:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 2]
print(sum_of_unique(nums))  # Expected output: 4, since 1 and 3 are unique and their sum is 4.
```
