466. Count The Repetitions

Define a function `getMaxRepetitions` to find the maximum number of times `S2` can be obtained from `S1`. 

Here's the input:
- `s1`, `n1`: A string `s1` repeated `n1` times, represented as `S1 = s1 * n1`.
- `s2`, `n2`: A string `s2` repeated `n2` times, represented as `S2 = s2 * n2`.

The goal is to find how many times `S2` can be formed from `S1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are both strings non-empty and purely lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, both `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
   
2. **What should be returned if `S2` cannot be formed from `S1` at all?**
   - Return `0` in that case.
   
3. **Is performance a significant concern?**
   - Yes, we should optimize for performance considering potentially large values of `n1` and `n2`.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Observation**: 
   - The direct approach of repeating and constructing `s1` n1 times and checking for `s2` n2 times would be infeasible for large inputs due to memory and time constraints.

2. **Optimization Insight**:
   - Instead of constructing the full strings, we can leverage the idea of simulating the process by iterating through characters of `s1` and `s2`.
   - We aim to track how many times we can iterate through `s2` while iterating through the repeated sequence of `s1`.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If the sequence of repetitions starts to repeat, we can use this cyclic pattern to jump over many iterations, reducing the problem size significantly.

## Code

```python
def getMaxRepetitions(s1, n1, s2, n2):
    if n1 == 0:
        return 0

    s1_count, s2_count, index_s2 = 0, 0, 0
    memo = {}

    while s1_count < n1:
        for char in s1:
            if char == s2[index_s2]:
                index_s2 += 1
                if index_s2 == len(s2):
                    s2_count += 1
                    index_s2 = 0
        
        s1_count += 1
        
        if (index_s2, s2_count) in memo:
            (prev_s1_count, prev_s2_count) = memo[(index_s2, s2_count)]
            cycle_length = s1_count - prev_s1_count
            cycle_s2_count = s2_count - prev_s2_count
            
            remaining_cycles = (n1 - s1_count) // cycle_length
            
            s1_count += remaining_cycles * cycle_length
            s2_count += remaining_cycles * cycle_s2_count
            
        memo[(index_s2, s2_count)] = (s1_count, s2_count)

    return s2_count // n2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n1 * len(s1)), where we need to iterate `s1` up to `n1` times and each character in `s1` is compared.
- **Space Complexity**: O(len(s2) * n1), due to the storage in the memo dictionary but in practice, the cycles reduce this, avoiding large values of n1 traversal.

This approach ensures that we leverage cyclic patterns to optimize our solution, making it feasible for significant input sizes.
