Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

For example:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```
The above binary tree is symmetric.

However, the following binary tree is not:
```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of values do the nodes contain?**
   - The nodes contain integer values.

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - Yes, an empty tree is considered symmetric.

3. **What is the definition of symmetry in the context of this problem?**
   - A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

4. **Is there a specific tree structure (like binary search tree or complete binary tree)?**
   - No, the tree can be any binary tree structure.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Create a helper function to compare the left and right subtrees.
   - Base case: If both nodes are `None`, return `True`. If only one is `None`, return `False`.
   - Recursive case: 
     - The values of the nodes should be equal.
     - The left subtree of the left node should be a mirror of the right subtree of the right node and vice versa.

2. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Use a queue to perform breadth-first search (BFS) to compare nodes level by level.
   - Enqueue the left and right children of the nodes in the required order to compare symmetry.

We'll implement the recursive approach here for simplicity.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSymmetric(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    def isMirror(left: TreeNode, right: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if left is None and right is None:
            return True
        if left is None or right is None:
            return False
        return (left.val == right.val and 
                isMirror(left.left, right.right) and 
                isMirror(left.right, right.left))
    
    return isMirror(root.left, root.right) if root else True

# Example Usage:
# root = TreeNode(1)
# root.left = TreeNode(2)
# root.right = TreeNode(2)
# root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
# root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
# root.right.left = TreeNode(4)
# root.right.right = TreeNode(3)
# print(isSymmetric(root))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), the height `h` could be `n`.

This solution efficiently checks whether a binary tree is symmetric by leveraging a recursive helper function to compare the left and right subtrees for mirror properties.
