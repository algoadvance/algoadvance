title:  Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing-out
permalink: /s801
---

Given two integer arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, of the same length, you are allowed to swap elements `arr1[i]` and `arr2[i]`. Note that swapping is only allowed on the same index `i`.

Your goal is to make both sequences strictly increasing with the minimum number of swaps (if possible).

- `arr1` and `arr2` can only be swapped at the same index `i`.
- Both arrays have the same length.
- Initial arrays are not necessarily sorted.

Return the minimum number of swaps required.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: arr1 = [1,3,5,4], arr2 = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Swap elements at index 3: arr1 = [1,3,5,7] and arr2 = [1,2,3,4]. Both sequences are now strictly increasing.

Constraints:
- 1 <= arr1.length == arr2.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 2 * 10^4
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can arr1 and arr2 have the same elements?**
   - Yes, they can have the same elements depending on the initial configuration.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that a solution exists?**
   - No, the arrays might have configurations where it’s impossible to make both sequences strictly increasing.

3. **What should be returned if no valid sequence can be achieved?**
   - In case it's impossible to make the sequences strictly increasing, return an appropriate signal (e.g., return -1).

4. **Can elements be negative?**
   - According to the problem constraints, elements are non-negative.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize dynamic programming with two states:
1. **Keep**: Minimum swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing without swapping the current elements.
2. **Swap**: Minimum swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing with swapping the current elements.

We initialize two arrays `keep` and `swap` to hold these values with the following initial values:
- `keep[0] = 0`: No swaps needed for the first pair if we don't swap.
- `swap[0] = 1`: One swap needed for the first pair if we swap `arr1[0]` and `arr2[0]`.

For each subsequent index `i`:
- Determine if it’s valid to keep the elements as is from the previous state.
- Determine if it’s valid to swap the elements from the previous state.

Finally, the result will be the minimum value between `keep[n-1]` and `swap[n-1]`.

## Code

```python
def minSwap(arr1, arr2):
    n = len(arr1)
    keep = [float('inf')] * n
    swap = [float('inf')] * n
    
    keep[0] = 0
    swap[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr1[i] > arr1[i - 1] and arr2[i] > arr2[i - 1]:
            keep[i] = keep[i - 1]
            swap[i] = swap[i - 1] + 1
        
        if arr1[i] > arr2[i - 1] and arr2[i] > arr1[i - 1]:
            keep[i] = min(keep[i], swap[i - 1])
            swap[i] = min(swap[i], keep[i - 1] + 1)
    
    return min(keep[-1], swap[-1])

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 4]
arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 7]
print(minSwap(arr1, arr2))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)** where `N` is the length of the input arrays since we're only iterating through the arrays once.
- The space complexity is **O(N)** due to the `keep` and `swap` arrays used for dynamic programming.

This approach efficiently manages the states and transitions to solve the problem optimally.
