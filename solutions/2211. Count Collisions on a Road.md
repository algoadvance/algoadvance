title:  Count Collisions on a Road-out
permalink: /s2211
---
Given a string `directions` where each character in the string represents the direction of a car on a road:
- 'L' indicates the car is moving to the left,
- 'R' indicates the car is moving to the right,
- 'S' indicates the car is stationary.

The cars are moving in such a way that:
- `RL` results in a collision causing both cars to stop (`SS`).
- `RS` results in a collision causing the right-moving car to stop (`SS`).
- `SL` results in a collision causing the left-moving car to stop (`SS`).

You need to count the total number of collisions that occur.

### Clarifying Questions
1. How long can the input string be?
2. Are there any additional edge cases to be aware of?
3. Will the input always be non-empty?
4. Can multiple cars move within the same second?

### Strategy
1. This problem can be approached by traversing the string while keeping track of collisions.
2. We need to look for patterns like 'RL', 'RS', and 'SL' since these indicate collisions.
3. Each time such a pattern is found, we convert the characters into `S` and count the collision.
4. A stack-based approach or an index-based approach could be used to effectively manage and transform the string.

### Code
```python
def count_collisions(directions: str) -> int:
    n = len(directions)
    collisions = 0
    
    # Convert the string to a list for easier mutation.
    directions = list(directions)
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if directions[i] == 'L' and directions[i-1] == 'R':
            # Case RL
            collisions += 2
            directions[i] = 'S'
            directions[i-1] = 'S'
        elif directions[i] == 'S' and directions[i-1] == 'R':
            # Case RS
            collisions += 1
            directions[i-1] = 'S'
        elif directions[i] == 'L' and directions[i-1] == 'S':
            # Case SL
            collisions += 1
            directions[i] = 'S'
    
    return collisions

# Example usage:
directions = "RLRSLL"
print(count_collisions(directions))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `directions` string. This is because we are traversing the string once.
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) in the worst case because we are converting the string to a list for easier mutation. However, if we do in-place modifications and count using indexes, it can be optimized to \(O(1)\).
