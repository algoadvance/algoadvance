title:  Minimum Number of Food Buckets to Feed the Hamsters-out
permalink: /s2086
---
You are given a string `hamsters` where:
- '.' represents an empty space,
- 'H' represents a hamster.

Food buckets can be placed in empty spaces ('.') to feed adjacent hamsters. You need to determine the minimum number of food buckets to place such that each hamster ('H') can access at least one food bucket from any adjacent space (left or right).

Return the minimum number of food buckets needed. If it's not possible to feed all the hamsters, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed with the solution, here are a few clarifying questions to make sure we understand the problem correctly:
1. If a space has a hamster adjacent to it on both sides, does a single food bucket placed there suffice to feed both hamsters?
2. Are there any constraints on the placement of the food buckets in terms of distance, i.e., how far can a hamster reach out for a food bucket?

Answering these questions:
1. Yes, a single food bucket placed between two hamsters will suffice to feed both.
2. A food bucket can only feed hamsters that are directly adjacent (left or right) to it.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will iterate through the string and intelligently place buckets in empty spaces to maximize the number of fed hamsters. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a counter for the number of buckets needed.
2. Iterate through the string:
   - If we find an 'H', check the left side first if possible (i.e., if the current hamster can be fed by a previous bucket).
   - If the left side check fails, check the right side for placing a bucket.
   - If neither side can host a bucket, return `-1` as it's impossible to feed this hamster.
3. Count and return the total number of buckets placed.

### Code
Hereâ€™s a possible implementation of the strategy in Python:

```python
def min_food_buckets(hamsters: str) -> int:
    n = len(hamsters)
    buckets = 0
    i = 0
    
    while i < n:
        if hamsters[i] == 'H':
            if i > 0 and hamsters[i - 1] == '.':
                # Place bucket on the left of current 'H'
                buckets += 1
                i += 1 # Skip the hamster that has been taken care of
                
            elif i < n - 1 and hamsters[i + 1] == '.':
                # Place bucket on the right of current 'H'
                buckets += 1
                i += 2 # Skip the next space and the hamster
                
            else:
                # It's not possible to place a bucket to feed this hamster
                return -1
        else:
            i += 1 # Move to the next position if current is not 'H'

    return buckets

# Example usage
hamsters = ".H.H..H"
print(min_food_buckets(hamsters))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(n) where n is the length of the string `hamsters`, because we traverse the string once. Each operation within the loop is O(1).

This approach ensures that we efficiently place the minimum number of buckets required to feed all the hamsters according to the given constraints.
