title:  Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings-out
permalink: /s1960
---

Given a string `s`, partition the string into two non-overlapping substrings such that the product of the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings in each of the two substrings is maximized. Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic substrings.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range for the string `s`?
   - Are there any character constraints (e.g., is it just lowercase English letters)?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the function return an integer which is the maximum possible product?

3. **Substrings Definition:**
   - Are substrings defined as contiguous segments of the original string?

4. **Palindrome Definition:**
   - Are we considering any special characters or mixed cases, or assuming that the input string will be in lowercase?

## Code

Here is a Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def maxProduct(s: str) -> int:
    n = s.length
    left_pal = [0] * n
    right_pal = [0] * n

    def longest_palindrome(connected):
        length = len(connected)
        max_len = 0
        res = [0] * length
        dp = [[False] * length for _ in range(length)]
        for i in range(length):
            dp[i][i] = True
            res[i] = 1
        for i in range(length - 1):
            if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                dp[i][i + 1] = True
                res[i + 1] = 2
        for k in range(2, length):
            for i in range(length - k):
                j = i + k
                if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = True
                    res[j] = max(res[j], k + 1)
        max_len = max(res)
        return max_len
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_pal[i - 1] = longest_palindrome(s[:i])
        right_pal[i] = longest_palindrome(s[i:])
    
    max_product = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_product = max(max_product, left_pal[i - 1] * right_pal[i])

    return max_product
```


## Strategy

1. **Generate Palindrome Length Arrays:**
   - Create two arrays `left_pal` and `right_pal` where:
     - `left_pal[i]` stores the length of the longest palindromic substring considering the first `i` characters of `s`.
     - `right_pal[i]` stores the same information but considering the substring starting at index `i`.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Palindrome Detection:**
   - Use dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic substring for all possible segments of the string. 

3. **Calculate Product:**
   - For each possible partition of the string into two non-overlapping substrings, compute the product of palindrome lengths stored in `left_pal` and `right_pal`.

4. **Find Maximum Product:**
   - Iterate through the partitions and keep track of the maximum product encountered.

## Time Complexity

- **Dynamic Programming Grids:** 
  - Filling out the DP table is \(O(n^2)\)
  - Determining the palindrome lengths is \(O(n)\)
- **Total Time:** 
  - The two DP grid constructions run individually, and iterating through each partition breaks does not add additional significant complexity beyond linear scanning, resulting in \(O(n^2)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).
