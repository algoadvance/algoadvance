title:  Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String-out
permalink: /s1807
---

You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair having a key inside the brackets. You are also given a dictionary `knowledge` where each key-value pair denotes a key and its respective value. You need to evaluate all the bracket pairs by replacing the keys inside the brackets with the corresponding values from the `knowledge` dictionary. If a key does not exist in the `knowledge` dictionary, replace it with a question mark `?`.

Return the resulting string after evaluating all the bracket pairs.

### Example
```python
s = "(name)is(age)yearsold"
knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]

Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there nested brackets?**
   - No, the problem states there are no nested brackets.

2. **What should be returned if multiple keys are missing in knowledge?**
   - Each missing key should independently be replaced by `?`.

3. **Does the input string `s` always have valid and balanced brackets?**
   - Yes, we can assume the input string has balanced brackets as per the problem description.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the String:** Iterate over the string `s` and look for opening and closing brackets to identify keys.
2. **Replace Keys:** Use the `knowledge` dictionary to replace identified keys. If a key is not found, replace it with `?`.

### Code

```python
def evaluate(s: str, knowledge: List[List[str]]) -> str:
    # Convert knowledge list to a dictionary for fast lookup
    knowledge_dict = {k: v for k, v in knowledge}
    
    result = []
    i = 0
    while i < s.length():
        if s[i] == '(':
            # Find the corresponding closing bracket
            j = i + 1
            while s[j] != ')':
                j += 1
            key = s[i+1:j]
            # Replace with value from dictionary or fallback to '?'
            result.append(knowledge_dict.get(key, '?'))
            # Move the cursor past the closing bracket
            i = j + 1
        else:
            result.append(s[i])
            i += 1
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of this approach is O(N + M), where:
- N is the length of the string `s`.
- M is the length of the knowledge list. 

1. **O(N): Iteration over the string `s` to identify and process brackets.
2. **O(M): Construction of the dictionary from knowledge list.

This guarantees that the solution is efficient enough for typical input sizes encountered in such problems.
