title:  Redundant Connection II-out

---

In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node which has no parents.

The given graph is a `2D-array` of `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `u_i` to node `v_i`. Find an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted tree of `n` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of values for `n` (number of nodes in the graph)?
   - **A:** The constraints typically follow the problem requirements, please assume \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).

2. **Q:** Can the edges be initially disconnected?
   - **A:** No, the edges form a connected graph.

3. **Q:** Can nodes be numbered non-continuously or start from 0 instead of 1?
   - **A:** Nodes are typically numbered continuously starting from 1.

### Strategy

To solve the problem of finding the redundant connection in a tree with potentially two different issues (a node with two parents and/or a cycle), we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify Indegree of Nodes:**
   - Traverse the edges to identify any node with indegree 2. This node has two parents, and one of these incoming edges must be removed.

2. **Union-Find for Cycle Detection:**
   - Use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to detect cycles in the graph. If adding an edge forms a cycle, that edge might be the one to remove.

3. **Candidate Edges:**
   - If a node has two parents, consider both edges as potential candidates for removal.
   - If no such node exists, then simply use Union-Find to find the extra edge forming a cycle.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
def findRedundantDirectedConnection(edges):
    parent = {}
    candidate1 = candidate2 = None
    
    # Step 1: Find the node with two parents and remember those two edges as candidates.
    for u, v in edges:
        if v in parent:
            candidate1 = (parent[v], v)
            candidate2 = (u, v)
            u, v = None, None
        else:
            parent[v] = u
    
    # Union-Find to check the cycle
    def find(x):
        if parent.get(x) != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent.get(x, x))
        return parent[x]

    parent = {}
    for u, v in edges:
        if u is None or v is None:  # skip the removed edge in the first step
            continue
        if find(u) == find(v):
            if candidate1 is None:
                return [u, v]
            else:
                return candidate1
        parent[find(u)] = find(v)
    
    return candidate2

# Example usage
edges = [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
print(findRedundantDirectedConnection(edges)) # Output should be: [2,3]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of edges. This is because:

1. Finding and processing each edge takes constant time.
2. The Union-Find operations (union and find) are nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank, making them effectively \(O(\alpha(n))\), where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function.

Thus, the overall time complexity is efficient for typical problem constraints.
