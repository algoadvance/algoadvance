[LeetCode Problem 2141 - Maximum Running Time of N Computers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-running-time-of-n-computers/)

You have `n` computers and `m` batteries. You are given the integer `n` and a 0-indexed integer array `batteries` where the `i`-th battery can run a computer for `batteries[i]` minutes. You are interested in running all `n` computers simultaneously using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and any point in time, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery that has been removed from another computer. You may assume that inserting and removing a battery from a computer takes no time.

Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the `n` computers simultaneously.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any constraint on the number of switches between batteries?**
   - No, switching batteries can happen an unlimited number of times as per the problem statement.

2. **Are the values in `batteries` sorted?**
   - No, the array `batteries` may not be sorted.

3. **What are the constraints on `n` and the length of `batteries`?**
   - Constraints are as follows:
     * `1 <= n <= m <= 10^5`
     * `1 <= batteries[i] <= 10^9`

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the minimum running time during which all `n` computers can be simultaneously operating. 

1. **Binary Search Approach**: 
   - Use binary search to determine the maximum possible time `T` that all `n` computers can run simultaneously.
   
2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For each midpoint `mid` during the binary search, check if it's possible to run all `n` computers for `mid` minutes.
   - This can be checked by aggregating the total available battery life and ensuring that it's enough to sustain `n` computers for `mid` minutes each.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def maxRunTime(n, batteries):
    def canRunFor(minutes):
        total_power = sum(min(battery, minutes) for battery in batteries)
        return total_power >= minutes * n
    
    low, high = 1, sum(batteries) // n
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (high + low + 1) // 2
        if canRunFor(mid):
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return low

# Example use case:
n = 2
batteries = [3, 3, 3]
print(maxRunTime(n, batteries))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is determined by:
1. **Binary Search**: O(log(T)), where `T` is the maximum possible time, roughly `sum(batteries) // n`.
2. **Feasibility Check (canRunFor)**: O(m), where `m` is the number of batteries, as it sums battery capacities capped by the current midpoint.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is **O(m * log(T))**, which is efficient for the given constraints.
