title:  Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points-out
permalink: /s1595
---

You are given two groups of points where the first group consists of `size1` points and the second group consists of `size2` points. The cost of connecting point `i` from the first group with point `j` from the second group is given by a `cost` matrix, where `cost[i][j]` is the cost of connecting `i` from the first group to `j` from the second group.

You need to connect every point in the first group to at least one point in the second group and vice versa, such that the total cost is minimized. Return the minimum cost to make the connections.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints of the array sizes?**
   - We need to clarify the maximum possible sizes of the two groups.
2. **Is the cost matrix always guaranteed to be a `size1 x size2` matrix?**
   - Confirming this ensures that indexing will be handled correctly.
3. **Are the cost values non-negative integers?**
   - Understanding the range of costs might help decide on any necessary checks or handling of special cases.
4. **Does each group necessarily need to be connected to all points in the other group?**
   - Confirm that each point in one group must be connected to at least one point in the other group, which can guide the approach to solving the problem.

## Strategy

We are dealing with a cost matrix where `cost[i][j]` gives the cost of connecting point `i` from the first group to point `j` from the second group. We need to ensure every point in both groups is connected to at least one point in the other group with the minimum total cost.

This can be thought of as a minimum-cost bipartite matching problem, yet slightly different because every node from both groups must be covered.

### Detailed Approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming State:**
   - `dp[mask1][mask2]`: This represents the minimum cost to connect the subset of points represented by `mask1` from the first group and `mask2` from the second group.

2. **Transition:**
   - We compute the minimum cost by iterating through all possible subsets (masks) of the two groups and updating the cost while ensuring each point is connected properly.

3. **Initialization and Iteration:**
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` because the cost of connecting no points from either group is zero.
   - Iterate through all possible combinations of masks for the two groups.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The answer will be found in the state where all points in both groups have been connected.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution should be considered in terms of the number of possible masks (subsets for each group) and the transitions. It's roughly O((2^size1) * (2^size2) * size1 * size2), which is feasible for relatively small sizes of the groups.

Now, letâ€™s proceed with the implementation:

## Code

```python
def connectTwoGroups(cost):
    size1, size2 = len(cost), len(cost[0])
    max_mask1 = 1 << size1
    max_mask2 = 1 << size2
    
    # Initialize dp array with infinite cost
    dp = [[float('inf')] * max_mask2 for _ in range(max_mask1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for mask1 in range(max_mask1):
        for mask2 in range(max_mask2):
            for i in range(size1):
                if mask1 & (1 << i) == 0:
                    # if i-th point from group1 is not yet considered in this mask1
                    continue
                for j in range(size2):
                    if mask2 & (1 << j) == 0:
                        # if j-th point from group2 is not yet considered in this mask2
                        continue
                    
                    # Try connecting point i from group1 to point j from group2
                    dp[mask1][mask2] = min(dp[mask1][mask2],
                                           dp[mask1 & ~(1 << i)][mask2 & ~(1 << j)] + cost[i][j])
                    
                    # Check the new state after making the connection
                    dp[mask1][mask2] = min(dp[mask1][mask2],
                                           dp[mask1 & ~(1 << i)][mask2] + cost[i][j],  # New potential connection
                                           dp[mask1][mask2 & ~(1 << j)] + cost[i][j])  # Another new potential connection
    
    return dp[max_mask1 - 1][max_mask2 - 1]

# Example Usage
cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]
print(connectTwoGroups(cost))  # Output should be 17
```

This code provides a solution to connect every point in both groups with the minimum total cost using a dynamic programming approach.
