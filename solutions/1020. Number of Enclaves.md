You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where `0` represents a sea cell and `1` represents a land cell.

A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the `grid`.

Return the number of land cells in the `grid` for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the `grid` in any number of moves.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Is it guaranteed that `m` and `n` will be at least 1?**
   A: Yes.

2. **Q: Is it possible for the grid to have all sea cells (0s)?**
   A: Yes, in this case, the output should be 0.

3. **Q: Can the grid have all land cells (1s)?**
   A: Yes, but we need to determine if any of the land cells can be reached from the boundary.

### Strategy

1. **Flood Fill Boundary Cells:**
   - We will start by identifying all land cells (`1`s) that are connected to the boundary.
   - We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to mark all these boundary-connected land cells as visited or different.

2. **Count Non-Boundary Land Cells:**
   - After marking boundary-connected land cells, we will go through the entire grid to count the remaining land cells that were not marked.

### Code

```python
def numEnclaves(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    def dfs(x, y):
        if x < 0 or y < 0 or x >= m or y >= n or grid[x][y] == 0:
            return
        grid[x][y] = 0  # Mark the cell as visited
        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
        for dx, dy in directions:
            dfs(x + dx, y + dy)
    
    # Start DFS from boundary cells
    for i in range(m):
        for j in [0, n-1]:  # First and last column
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                dfs(i, j)
    for j in range(n):
        for i in [0, m-1]:  # First and last row
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                dfs(i, j)
    
    # Count remaining land cells
    enclave_count = sum(grid[i][j] == 1 for i in range(m) for j in range(n))
    
    return enclave_count

# Example usage:
# grid = [
#     [0,0,0,0],
#     [1,0,1,0],
#     [0,1,1,0],
#     [0,0,0,0]
# ]
# print(numEnclaves(grid))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Marking Boundary-Connected Cells:** O(m * n) because, in the worst case, we might have to visit every cell in the matrix using DFS.
- **Counting Remaining Land Cells:** O(m * n) since we need to iterate through the entire grid once.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(m * n)

This solution efficiently handles the problem of counting land cells that are not connected to the boundary, ensuring the time complexity is manageable even for larger grids.
