53. Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The array contains only one element.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum = 23.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   **A:** No, the input array will contain at least one element.
2. **Q:** Can the input array contain only negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain all negative numbers.
3. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the input array?
   **A:** Typically up to 10^5 for most competitive programming problems, but we should assume it can be quite large.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use Kadane's Algorithm. This is a classic dynamic programming approach with the following steps:
1. Initialize two variables: `current_subarray` to keep track of the current subarray sum and `max_subarray` to store the maximum sum found so far.
2. Iterate through the array elements:
   - Update `current_subarray` to be the maximum of the current element itself or the sum of `current_subarray` and the current element.
   - Update `max_subarray` to be the maximum of `max_subarray` and `current_subarray`.
3. Return `max_subarray` as the result.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    # Initialize the current subarray sum to the first element
    current_subarray = nums[0]
    # Initialize the maximum subarray sum to the first element
    max_subarray = nums[0]
    
    # Start iterating from the second element
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # Update current subarray sum: do we create a new subarray starting from current element
        # or do we continue with the existing subarray
        current_subarray = max(num, current_subarray + num)
        # Update the maximum subarray sum found so far
        max_subarray = max(max_subarray, current_subarray)
    
    return max_subarray
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we only pass through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and works well even for large inputs.
