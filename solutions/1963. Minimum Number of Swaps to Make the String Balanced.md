title:  Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced-out
permalink: /s1963
---
You are given a string `s` of even length consisting of characters `'['` and `']'` only. The string is considered balanced if there is no such index `i` that `0 <= i < len(s)` and `0 <= j < len(s)` such that:
- `i < j`
- `s[j] == '['`
- `s[i] == ']'`

In other words, for every closing bracket `']'`, there should be a corresponding opening bracket `'['` before it.

Return the minimum number of swaps necessary to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it always possible to balance the string given its characteristics (even length of balanced characters)?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that you can balance the string by swapping.
2. **Should the function always return a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, since we are measuring the number of swaps, it will always be a non-negative integer.
3. **Can there be edge cases with strings of minimum possible length (like empty or having only two characters)?**
   - Strings will always have an even length, and the smallest length string (2 characters) is inherently balanced.

### Strategy
1. **Count Unbalanced Brackets:**
   - Traverse through the string and keep a count of unbalanced brackets. Specifically, keep a running count of excess closing brackets `']'` that do not yet have matching opening brackets `'['`.
2. **Determine Swaps Needed:**
   - Whenever we encounter a closing bracket and the running balance goes negative (indicating more closing brackets than opening brackets up to that point), we know a swap is needed. The number of swaps required will be half of the number of such situations encountered, as each swap fixes two unbalanced brackets.

### Code
Let's implement the strategy.

```python
def minSwaps(s: str) -> int:
    balance = 0  # Keep track of the balance between '[' and ']'
    max_unbalance = 0  # Track the maximum depth of imbalance
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '[':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        # We only care about the points where balance goes negative
        # This is where we have more ']' than '[' up to that point
        max_unbalance = min(max_unbalance, balance)
    
    # The number of swaps needed is (max depth of imbalance) // 2
    return (-max_unbalance + 1) // 2

# Example usage:
s = "]]][[["
print(minSwaps(s))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are only iterating through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space.

This ensures an efficient solution to determine the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string.
