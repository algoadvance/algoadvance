Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `t`?
   - Are the strings case-sensitive?
   
2. **Character Set**:
   - Do the input strings contain only lowercase alphabets?

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using a two-pointer technique where we iterate through the characters of both strings simultaneously. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` for `s` and `j` for `t`, both starting from the beginning (index 0).
2. Iterate through string `t` with the pointer `j`.
   - If `s[i]` equals `t[j]`, increment `i`.
   - Always increment `j` irrespective of whether `s[i]` matches `t[j]`.
3. If `i` reaches the length of `s` before or when `j` reaches the end of `t`, then all characters of `s` have been found sequentially in `t`, so return `true`.
4. If the end of `t` is reached and `i` is not equal to the length of `s`, return `false`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of strings `s` and `t` respectively. This is because we are iterating through each string at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of additional space.

### Code

```python
def isSubsequence(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    while i < m and j < n:
        if s[i] == t[j]:
            i += 1
        j += 1
    
    return i == m

# Example Usage
print(isSubsequence("abc", "ahbgdc"))  # Expected output: True
print(isSubsequence("axc", "ahbgdc"))  # Expected output: False
```
