title:  Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range-out
permalink: /s2827
---

You are given a range of integers represented by two numbers `low` and `high`, both inclusive. An integer in this range is considered *beautiful* if it meets the following criteria:
1. It has an equal number of even and odd digits.
2. Sum of its digits is a prime number.

Write a function to count how many beautiful integers exist in the range \([low, high]\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the range values?**
   Usually, constraints on problems like these would specify a maximum value for `low` and `high`. Knowing this helps optimize the solution.

2. **Are leading zeros considered in digits' counting?**
   Generally, leading zeros are not counted in the sum of digits or digit parity counts, but clarification helps.

3. **Should I consider edge cases like very large numbers, or single-digit ranges?**
   Handling single-digit ranges or cases where `low` equals `high` might be simpler and needs clarification.

### Strategy

1. **Range Iteration**: Iterate through the range from `low` to `high`.
2. **Digit Counting**: For each number in the range, count the number of even and odd digits.
3. **Prime Check**: Calculate the sum of the digits and check if the sum is a prime number.
4. **Check Beautiful Condition**:
    - Equal number of even and odd digits.
    - Sum of digits is a prime number.
5. **Prime Optimization**: Use a helper function to check for prime numbers to reduce computation time.

### Code

```python
def count_beautiful_integers(low: int, high: int) -> int:
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True
    
    def count_even_odd_digits(n):
        even_count = 0
        odd_count = 0
        digit_sum = 0
        while n > 0:
            digit = n % 10
            digit_sum += digit
            if digit % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
            n //= 10
        return even_count, odd_count, digit_sum

    beautiful_count = 0
    for num in range(low, high + 1):
        even_count, odd_count, digit_sum = count_even_odd_digits(num)
        if even_count == odd_count and is_prime(digit_sum):
            beautiful_count += 1
    
    return beautiful_count
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Range Iteration**: \(O(high - low + 1)\). We iterate through each number in the given range.
2. **Digit Counting**: \(O(\log_{10}(n))\) for counting digits per number where `n` is the number itself.
3. **Prime Check**: \(O(\sqrt{m})\) for checking if the digit sum `m` is prime.
4. **Total Complexity**: Combining all, the worst-case time complexity is \(O((high - low + 1) \cdot (\log_{10}(n) + \sqrt{m}))\).

This solution is efficient for reasonably sized ranges and should handle typical problem constraints effectively.
