The problem is described below:

The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of `m x n` rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons who will inflict damage (negative integers). Other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

You are given an `m x n` integer grid dungeon where `dungeon[i][j]` represents the health points in that room. The knight needs to reach the bottom-right room (`dungeon[m-1][n-1]`) with at least 1 health point.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is there any constraint on the values in the dungeon grid?
   - Yes, the values can be negative, zero, or positive integers.
2. Can the knight move only rightward or downward?
   - Yes, the knight can only move rightward or downward.

### Strategy

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we keep track of the minimum health required at each cell starting from the bottom-right corner. We need a table to store the minimum health required at each cell for the knight to survive and reach the target.

The approach is as follows:
1. Start from the bottom-right corner and move backwards to the top-left corner.
2. For each cell, the minimum health required would be the minimum health required for the next step (either right or down) minus the health points of the current cell. 
3. If at any step the health required is less than or equal to zero, we need at least 1 health point to continue.

### Code
```python
def calculateMinimumHP(dungeon):
    if not dungeon or not dungeon[0]:
        return 0

    m, n = len(dungeon), len(dungeon[0])

    # dp[i][j] represents the minimum HP required to reach the bottom-right corner from (i, j)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[m][n-1] = dp[m-1][n] = 1

    for i in range(m-1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            min_health_on_exit = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
            dp[i][j] = max(1, min_health_on_exit - dungeon[i][j])

    return dp[0][0]

# Example usage
dungeon = [
    [-2, -3, 3],
    [-5, -10, 1],
    [10, 30, -5]
]
print(calculateMinimumHP(dungeon))  # Output should be 7
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)` because we are iterating through each cell of the matrix.
- The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` for storing the DP table. However, it can be optimized to `O(n)` if we use only two rows at a time.

This solution iterates from the bottom-right to the top-left, computing the minimum health required for each cell so that the knight survives the journey to the bottom-right corner.
