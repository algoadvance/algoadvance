title:  Get the Maximum Score-out
permalink: /s1537
---

You are given two sorted arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`.

The task is to find the maximum possible sum of a path to reach the end of either array. You can start from either array and move to the other array only at the common elements.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the path you take.

Return the maximum sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Example:**
```
Input: nums1 = [2,4,5,8,10], nums2 = [4,6,8,9]
Output: 30
Explanation: The path that maximizes the sum is 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 10. So the maximum sum is 30.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if one or both arrays are empty?**
   - If one array is empty, the sum should be the total sum of the other array.
   - If both arrays are empty, the sum is 0.

2. **Is there any restriction on the array elements?**
   - The arrays contain integers, and they are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
3. **How do we handle the transition between arrays at common elements?**
   - At common elements, we continue from the one which has the maximum accumulated sum up to that point.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two pointers for both arrays and two sums `sum1` and `sum2` to keep track of the accumulated sums for both arrays.
2. Traverse both arrays using the pointers:
   - If the elements at both pointers are equal, choose the path with the maximum accumulated sum and reset the accumulated sum for the currently active path.
   - If the element in `nums1` is smaller, add it to `sum1` and move the `nums1` pointer.
   - If the element in `nums2` is smaller, add it to `sum2` and move the `nums2` pointer.
3. Once one of the pointers reaches the end of its array, add the remaining elements of the other array to its corresponding sum.
4. The result will be the maximum of both sums, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code

```python
def maxSum(nums1, nums2):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    n, m = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    i, j = 0, 0
    sum1, sum2 = 0, 0
    result = 0
    
    while i < n and j < m:
        if nums1[i] < nums2[j]:
            sum1 += nums1[i]
            i += 1
        elif nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            sum2 += nums2[j]
            j += 1
        else:
            result += max(sum1, sum2) + nums1[i]
            sum1 = sum2 = 0
            i += 1
            j += 1
            
    while i < n:
        sum1 += nums1[i]
        i += 1
        
    while j < m:
        sum2 += nums2[j]
        j += 1
        
    result += max(sum1, sum2)
    
    return result % MOD

# Example usage:
nums1 = [2, 4, 5, 8, 10]
nums2 = [4, 6, 8, 9]
print(maxSum(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 30
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums1` and \(m\) is the length of `nums2`. We traverse each array only once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

With this strategy, we efficiently calculate the maximum possible sum while taking advantage of the sorted property of the input arrays.
