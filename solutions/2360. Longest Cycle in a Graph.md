title:  Longest Cycle in a Graph-out
permalink: /s2360
---

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has at most one outgoing edge. The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from the node `i` to `edges[i]`. If there is no outgoing edge from node `i`, `edges[i] == -1`.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a node point to itself?**
   - Yes, it is possible for a node to have an edge pointing to itself, forming a cycle of length 1.
   
2. **What is the maximum size of the graph (value of `n`)?**
   - The graph size `n` can be up to `10^5` as per the problem constraints.

3. **Are there multiple edges or just one edge per node?**
   - Each node has at most one outgoing edge.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph and determine their lengths. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Maintain a `visited` array to mark nodes as visited.
   - Maintain a `stack` array to keep track of nodes in the current path.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - For each node, if it is not visited, initiate DFS from that node.
   - During DFS, mark nodes as part of the current path.
   - If a node is revisited within the same path, a cycle is detected.
   - Compute the length of the cycle when detected by tracing back to the revisited node.

3. **Track the Longest Cycle**:
   - Keep updating the maximum cycle length if a longer cycle is found.
   - After completing the DFS traversal for all nodes, return the longest cycle length found.

### Code

```python
def longestCycle(edges):
    n = len(edges)
    visited = [-1] * n  # -1 indicates unvisited, other values indicate the visit order/time
    max_cycle_length = -1

    def dfs(node, visit_time):
        nonlocal max_cycle_length
        current_time = visit_time
        stack = []
        
        while node != -1 and visited[node] == -1:
            visited[node] = current_time
            stack.append(node)
            node = edges[node]
            current_time += 1
        
        if node != -1 and node in stack:
            cycle_length = current_time - visited[node]
            max_cycle_length = max(max_cycle_length, cycle_length)
        
        for n in stack:
            visited[n] = float('inf')  # Mark nodes in this path as finished
        
    for i in range(n):
        if visited[i] == -1:
            dfs(i, 0)

    return max_cycle_length

# Example usage:
edges = [3, 3, 4, 2, 3]
print(longestCycle(edges))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes. This is because each node is visited at most once during the DFS traversal. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the `visited` array and the recursion stack.

### Summary

- A DFS approach is used to detect cycles and calculate their lengths.
- The `visited` array keeps track of visit order and helps in cycle detection.
- The algorithm ensures each node is visited only once, resulting in an efficient solution.
