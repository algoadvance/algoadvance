title:  Maximum Star Sum of a Graph-out
permalink: /s2497
---
You are given a weighted, undirected graph consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and an integer `k`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` with weight `w_i`.

A **node star** is a subset consisting of a node `i` and some (possibly all or none) of the edges incident to `i`. The **sum** of a node star is the sum of `w_i` for all edges in the set, plus the value of the node `i`.

Return the maximum star sum of any node star in the graph.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What are the values associated with each node in the node star?
   - The value of each node might be given explicitly in the problem description, or if not specified, we assume it's zero.
  
2. Is it guaranteed that `k` is smaller than the total number of incident edges for any node?
   - This information would align our strategy, but if not specified, we'll handle cases where `k` might be larger than the number of incident edges.

3. Can the weights of the edges be negative?
   - This is important to understand if we should consider excluding certain edges to maximize the sum.

### Strategy:
1. Create a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of tuples, each representing the edge weights and the neighboring node.
2. For each node, sort the list of edge weights in descending order.
3. Calculate the star sum for each node by adding the top `k` weights (or fewer if there are fewer than `k` edges).
4. Keep track of the maximum star sum encountered.

### Time Complexity:
- Parsing and storing the edges will take \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- Sorting the edges for each node could take \(O(E \log E)\) in the worst case if we consider all nodes could be interconnected.
- Finding the top `k` edges for each node and computing their sums will take \(O(V \cdot k)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.
- Overall, the time complexity could be approximated as \(O(V \cdot (E \log E+ k))\).

Let's implement this strategy in Python:

### Code Implementation:
```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def maxStarSum(n, edges, k):
    # Dictionary to hold edges for each node
    node_edges = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Populate the edges for each node
    for u, v, w in edges:
        node_edges[u].append(w)
        node_edges[v].append(w)
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    for node in range(n):
        # Get the top k weights for the current node
        top_k_weights = heapq.nlargest(k, node_edges[node]) if len(node_edges[node]) > k else node_edges[node]
        
        # Compute the sum with the current node's own value (assuming node value is 0)
        star_sum = sum(top_k_weights)
        
        # Update the maximum sum found
        max_sum = max(max_sum, star_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 5], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 2], [3, 4, 1]]
k = 2

print(maxStarSum(n, edges, k))  # Example output
```

This code initializes an edge list for each node, finds the top `k` weights for each node, and computes the maximum star sum within the constraints of the problem.
