Given an integer `n`, return a string representation of this integer with commas as the thousand separators.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 987
Output: "987"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1234
Output: "1.234"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of the integer `n`?
   **A:** `n` can range from `0` to all possible integer values in Python, but typically we would expect non-negative integers.

2. **Q:** Is any specific format required when the integer is zero?
   **A:** `0` should simply be represented as `"0"` with no additional formatting needed.

3. **Q:** Are negative numbers expected in the input?
   **A:** Based on typical scenarios for this problem, we assume only non-negative integers are expected unless otherwise specified.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize Python string manipulation:

1. Convert the integer to a string.
2. Reverse the string to group digits easily.
3. Insert a dot `'.'` every three digits while iterating through the reversed string.
4. Reverse the result again to get the final formatted string.

### Code

Here is the Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def thousandSeparator(n: int) -> str:
    s = str(n)[::-1]
    parts = [s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]
    return '.'.join(parts)[::-1]

# Example Usage:
print(thousandSeparator(987))   # Output: "987"
print(thousandSeparator(123456789))   # Output: "123.456.789"
print(thousandSeparator(1000))    # Output: "1.000"
```

### Explanation

1. **Convert integer to string and reverse:** 
   - `str(n)[::-1]` converts the integer to a string and reverses it.
   
2. **Split reversed string into 3-char parts:** 
   - `[s[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(s), 3)]` uses a list comprehension to split the reversed string into parts of length 3.
   
3. **Join parts with dot and reverse again:** 
   - `'.'.join(parts)[::-1]` joins the parts with dots and then reverses the resultant string to get the final output.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of digits in the integer. Each step (reversing the string, splitting into parts, joining, and reversing back) is linear in terms of the number of digits.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for storing the intermediate results (reversed string, parts list, and the final string).

This solution is efficient and should handle large integers within typical constraints comfortably.
