title:  Minimize Deviation in Array-out
permalink: /s1675
---

You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers. You can perform two types of operations on any element of the array any number of times:
- If the element is even, you can divide it by 2.
- If the element is odd, you can multiply it by 2.

The deviation of the array is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Return the minimum deviation the array can have after performing some number of operations.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can transform the array to [1,2,3,2], where the deviation is 3-1 = 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the length of the input array `nums`?
   **A:** The length `n` will be between 2 and \(10^5\).
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?
   **A:** The elements of `nums` will be between 1 and \(10^9\).

3. **Q:** Can we assume that the given array will always have at least one even and one odd number?
   **A:** The array can have any combination of even and odd numbers, including all even or all odd.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's break down the strategies:

1. **Normalization**: First, transform all numbers to their possible maximum values. This involves multiplying all odd numbers by 2, as we can only multiply them once to possibly reduce the deviation later.

2. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap)**: Utilize a max-heap to efficiently retrieve and manipulate the current maximum value in the array.
   - Push all numbers into the heap with a negative sign (since Python's heapq is a min-heap by default, and we need max-heap functionality).
   - Track the minimum value found during this phase.

3. **Minimize Deviation**:
   - Continuously extract the maximum value, record the potential deviation (current max - current min).
   - If the extracted maximum is even, divide it by 2 and push it back into the heap.
   - Update the minimum value in the array if the new value is smaller.

4. **Termination**: Stop the process when the maximum element (which will be a minimized one when all elements are minimized) is odd because we can't reduce it further.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def minimumDeviation(nums):
    # Initialize a max-heap using negative values for max-heap simulation
    heap = []
    min_value = float('inf')
    
    # Step 1: Normalize the array
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 1:
            num *= 2  # multiply odd numbers by 2 to maximize their value
        heapq.heappush(heap, -num)  # push the negative value to simulate max-heap
        min_value = min(min_value, num)
        
    # Initialize the minimum deviation found so far
    min_deviation = float('inf')
    
    # Step 2: Reduce deviation
    while True:
        max_value = -heapq.heappop(heap)  # get the max value (turn it to positive)
        min_deviation = min(min_deviation, max_value - min_value)
        
        # Stop condition: if the max value is odd, we can't divide it further
        if max_value % 2 == 1:
            break
        
        # Even number case: divide by 2 and push back into the heap
        next_value = max_value // 2
        heapq.heappush(heap, -next_value)
        min_value = min(min_value, next_value)
    
    return min_deviation

# Example
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(minimumDeviation(nums))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Normalization step**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array because we push each element into the heap.
- **Reduction step**: Each element can be divided at most \(\log(\text{MAX})\) times, where \(\text{MAX}\) is the maximum value in the initial array. Since each operation involving heap is \(O(\log n)\), the overall complexity is \(O(n \log(\text{MAX}) \log n)\).

Hence, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n + n \log n \log \text{MAX})\), which is efficient for the input size constraints.
