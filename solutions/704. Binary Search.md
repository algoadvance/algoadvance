704. Binary Search

Given a sorted array of `n` integers and a target value, write a function to search for the target in the array. If the target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```
#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements in the array guaranteed to be in ascending order?**
   - Yes, the array is sorted in ascending order.
   
2. **What should be returned if the target value appears multiple times in the array?**
   - The problem statement implies to return the index of any occurrence of the target, but since it's a sorted array, usually the first occurrence found will be returned.

3. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers as illustrated in the examples.

4. **What is the maximum size of the array?**
   - While the problem statement does not explicitly state a maximum size, typically constraints will be provided in the associated online judge problem. For simplicity, we can assume the array size to be within a practical limit.

### Strategy
To achieve the required `O(log n)` runtime complexity, the solution should use the binary search algorithm. Binary search works as follows:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` starting at index `0` and `right` starting at the last index of the array.
2. Calculate the `mid` index.
3. Compare the element at the `mid` index with the target.
   - If the element at `mid` is the target, return `mid`.
   - If the target is less than the element at `mid`, adjust the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - If the target is greater than the element at `mid`, adjust the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
4. Repeat the process until `left` exceeds `right`.

### Code
Here is the Python implementation of the binary search algorithm:

```python
def search(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is `O(log n)`, as each iteration of the loop halves the search space. This meets the problem's requirement for an efficient search.

### Explanation with an Example
Let's go through the example `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9`:
1. Initially, `left=0`, `right=5` (last index), `mid = 2` (`nums[2] = 3`), `target = 9`.
2. Since `3 < 9`, update `left = 3`.
3. Now, `left=3`, `right=5`, `mid = 4` (`nums[4] = 9`).
4. `9` matches the `target`, so return `4`.

With this approach, the function successfully returns the index of the target value if it exists, or `-1` if it doesn't.
