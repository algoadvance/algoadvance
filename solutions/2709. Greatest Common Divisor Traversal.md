**2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal**

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, and you are allowed to perform operations on it. In one operation, you are able to pick any two indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j` and perform any of the following operations:
- Replace `nums[i]` with `nums[i] % nums[j]` (modulo operation).

Your task is to determine the maximum number of elements you can make equal by performing any number of these operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the resultant common value of the modified elements matter?
2. Is it possible or beneficial to sort the array before performing operations?
3. Are negative numbers allowed in the array?
4. What should be returned if all elements are already equal?

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 6, 9, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose nums[2] and nums[3], and apply the operation nums[2] % nums[3], we get new nums = [2, 3, 3, 9, 5]
Repeat the operation several times to achieve maximum 3 equal elements.
```

## Strategy

The goal of the problem is to maximize the number of elements that can be made equal by repeatedly performing the modulo operation. 

**Key Insight**:
- The modulo operation will never increase the value of an element. Over repeated applications, this tends to reduce elements towards the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the array elements.

### Steps:
1. **Find Potential GCD Candidates**:
   - The common value will typically be the GCD of the elements in the array.
   
2. **Check the Frequency of GCDs**:
   - Compute the GCD of the entire array.
   - For each element in the array, compute the GCD with the computed overall GCD.
   - Track how many elements can be reduced to the overall GCD.

## Code

Here's the Python solution for the problem using the strategy outlined above:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def findGCD(nums):
    # Utility to find the GCD of an array
    return reduce(gcd, nums)

def maxEqualElements(nums):
    overall_gcd = findGCD(nums)
    
    gcd_count = sum(1 for num in nums if gcd(num, overall_gcd) == overall_gcd)

    return gcd_count

# Example usage
nums = [2, 3, 6, 9, 5]
print(maxEqualElements(nums))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation**: Each `gcd` operation takes \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\), and computing the GCD for the entire array using `reduce` takes \(O(n \log(\min(a, b)))\).
- **Summing Up Equal GCD Elements**: \(O(n)\) where `n` is the length of the array.

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log(\min(a, b)))\) where `n` is the number of elements in the array, and \(a\), \(b\) are any two elements of the array (in the worst case, smallest elements).
