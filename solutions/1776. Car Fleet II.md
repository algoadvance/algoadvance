You are given an array `cars` where `cars[i] = [position[i], speed[i]]` represents the position and speed of the i-th car on a one-lane road. Cars are traveling to the right and will never pass each other.

If two cars have the same position, the faster car will slow down to match the speed of the slower car.

Don't settle or worry about the cars until they are at the same position. Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the time at which the i-th car will meet the next car. If the car does not meet the next car, set `answer[i]` to -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the input array?**
    - The length can vary but usually stays within constraints manageable by typical algorithmic complexity (e.g., up to 10^5).

2. **What should we prioritize, speed or accuracy?**
    - Both are important, but having an accurate solution within reasonable runtime constraints is key.

3. **Is the list of cars always sorted by the position?**
    - Yes, the cars are sorted by their position in ascending order.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize `answer` array**: Start by setting every element to `-1`.
2. **Use a stack**: Use a stack to store cars, tracking their positions and speeds to calculate meeting times.
3. **Iterate from the end**: To effectively calculate the collision times, iterate the cars in reverse order.
4. **Calculate meeting times**:
   - When checking if two cars will meet, compare their speeds and positions.
   - Calculate the time they will meet and update the stack for further comparisons.
5. **Pop Stack**: Use the stack to track meeting car pairs and their meeting times efficiently.

```python
from typing import List

def getCollisionTimes(cars: List[List[int]]) -> List[float]:
    n = len(cars)
    answer = [-1.0] * n
    stack = []
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack:
            j = stack[-1]
            # Calculate the time when car i catches up with car j
            t = (cars[j][0] - cars[i][0]) / (cars[i][1] - cars[j][1])
            if cars[i][1] <= cars[j][1] or (answer[j] > 0 and answer[j] < t):
                stack.pop()
            else:
                break
        if stack:
            answer[i] = (cars[stack[-1]][0] - cars[i][0]) / (cars[i][1] - cars[stack[-1]][1])
        stack.append(i)
    
    return answer

# Example Usage:
# cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
# print(getCollisionTimes(cars))  # Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
```

### Time Complexity
The overall time complexity is **O(n)** because each car is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. The stack operations ensure that each car interaction is processed efficiently.
