Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated following these rules:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are denoted by the character `'.'`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: True
```

### Note:

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the board contain invalid characters outside '1'-'9' and '.'?
   - No, the board will only contain the characters '1'-'9' and '.'.

2. Is the size of the board always fixed to 9x9?
   - Yes, the given Sudoku board is always 9x9 in size.

## Strategy

To validate the board, we need to check three main constraints:

1. Each row should have unique digits.
2. Each column should have unique digits.
3. Each 3x3 sub-box should have unique digits.

We can achieve this by using three sets of hash sets:
- One for tracking digits in each row.
- One for tracking digits in each column.
- One for tracking digits in each 3x3 sub-box.

We'll iterate over each cell in the 9x9 board, and for each non-empty cell, we'll check the constraints. If any constraint fails, we return `False`. If no constraints fail, we return `True`.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```python
def isValidSudoku(board):
    rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]
    
    for r in range(9):
        for c in range(9):
            if board[r][c] == '.':
                continue
            val = board[r][c]
            box_index = (r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)
            
            if val in rows[r] or val in cols[c] or val in boxes[box_index]:
                return False
            
            rows[r].add(val)
            cols[c].add(val)
            boxes[box_index].add(val)
            
    return True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) because we are only iterating through the cells of a fixed 9x9 board, resulting in a constant number of operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the same reason. The space used by the sets and other variables does not scale with input size, as it is fixed at 9x9.
