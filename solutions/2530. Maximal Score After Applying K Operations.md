title:  Maximal Score After Applying K Operations-out
permalink: /s2530
---
You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your goal is to perform exactly `k` operations on the list to maximize the final score. In a single operation, you can select any integer `num` from the list, increase this integer by `1`, and this will contribute `num + 1` to your final score.

Write a function `maximalScore(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int` that returns the maximum achievable score after exactly `k` operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `k` be larger than the length of `nums`?
   - **A:** Yes, `k` can be larger or smaller than the length of `nums`.

2. **Q:** Are the numbers in the list allowed to be negative or zero?
   - **A:** Yes, the numbers can be negative, zero, or positive.

3. **Q:** Can the same number be incremented more than once?
   - **A:** Yes, you can choose the same number repeatedly for the operations.

### Strategy
To maximize the final score, we should repeatedly increment the smallest number in the list for each of the `k` operations. This is because increasing a smaller number yields a higher incremental increase in score compared to increasing a larger number due to diminishing returns.

We can implement this strategy using a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently get and update the smallest number in each operation.

### Code
Here's the code to solve the problem:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop

def maximalScore(nums, k):
    # Convert nums to a min-heap
    heapify(nums)
    
    # Perform exactly k operations
    for _ in range(k):
        # Pop the smallest element
        smallest = heappop(nums)
        # Increment the smallest element by 1 and push it back to the heap
        heappush(nums, smallest + 1)
        
    # After k operations, the total score is the sum of the elements in the heap
    return sum(nums)

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 3
print(maximalScore(nums, k))  # Should output 9
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Heap Operations:** Each of the `k` operations involves a pop and a push operation on the heap. Both operations take `O(log n)` time.
2. **Summing Up the Elements:** After the `k` operations, summing the elements takes `O(n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
* **O(k log n + n)**

Given that `k` can be much larger than `n`, the dominant term is `O(k log n)`.
