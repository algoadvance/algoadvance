title:  Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree-out
permalink: /s2846
---

You are given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, weight_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` with weight `weight_i`.

You will also be given a 2D array `queries` where each `queries[j] = [u_j, v_j]` consists of two nodes `u_j` and `v_j`. For each query, find the minimum edge weight needed to be added such that the path between `u_j` and `v_j` has all edges with equal weights or determine if it is not possible.

**Return** an array of answers, one for each query, such that `ans[j]` is the minimum weight to be added for `queries[j]` or `-1` if it's not possible.

### Example:
```python
edges = [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 2], [1, 3, 3]]
queries = [[2, 3], [1, 2]]
# Expected output: [2, 3]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the number of nodes `n`?
2. Can the weights of edges be negative?
3. Are all edge weights distinct?
4. Can the queries be performed on non-existing paths?

## Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**: To solve this problem, we need a way to represent the tree and process the queries efficiently. We can use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will perform a DFS traversal to capture the path weights from the root to each node and store these weights in an array.
3. **Processing Queries**: Using the precomputed path weights, for each query, we can compute the required weight to be added such that all edges in the path have equal weight.
4. **Edge Weights Calculation**: For any two nodes, we will determine the difference in their cumulative path weights and compute the required weight to equalize their path weights.

## Code

```python
def minimum_edge_weight_equilibrium_queries(n, edges, queries):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Create graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
    
    # Initialize
    path_weights = [-1] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    
    def dfs(node, weight):
        stack = [(node, weight)]
        while stack:
            curr_node, curr_weight = stack.pop()
            if visited[curr_node]:
                continue
            visited[curr_node] = True
            path_weights[curr_node] = curr_weight
            for neighbor, w in graph[curr_node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    stack.append((neighbor, curr_weight + w))
    
    # Start DFS from root node 0
    dfs(0, 0)
    
    results = []
    for u, v in queries:
        diff = abs(path_weights[u] - path_weights[v])
        results.append(diff if diff > 0 else -1)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
edges = [[0, 1, 4], [0, 2, 2], [1, 3, 3]]
queries = [[2, 3], [1, 2]]
print(minimum_edge_weight_equilibrium_queries(4, edges, queries))
# Expected output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Tree Representation (Graph Construction)**: `O(n)`
- **DFS Traversal**: `O(n)`
- **Query Processing**: `O(m)` where `m` is the number of queries
  - Each query can be processed in `O(1)` time using the precomputed path weights.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`

This solution is efficient given the constraints generally seen in tree and graph problems, making it feasible for large data sets.
