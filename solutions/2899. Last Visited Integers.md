title:  Last Visited Integers-out
permalink: /s2899

This problem asks you to implement a data structure that can record and report the last `k` integers that have been visited. The operations that need to be supported are: 

1. `insert(val)`: Insert an integer `val` into the data structure.
2. `get_last(k)`: Get the last `k` visited integers.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any constraints on the integers (e.g., negative/positive, range)?
2. How should the `get_last(k)` function behave if `k` is larger than the number of elements inserted so far?
3. Can I always assume that `insert()` will be called before `get_last(k)`?

### Example:
If you first call `insert(1)`, `insert(2)`, `insert(3)`, then `get_last(2)` should return `[3, 2]`.

### Strategy:
1. Use a circular buffer or a deque to manage the last `k` elements efficiently.
2. The `deque` from the `collections` module is suitable because it allows fast appends and pops from both ends, making it ideal for this problem.

### Code:
```python
from collections import deque

class LastVisitedIntegers:
    def __init__(self, k):
        self.k = k
        self.data = deque(maxlen=k)
    
    def insert(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.data.append(val)
    
    def get_last(self, k: int):
        if k > len(self.data):
            return list(self.data)[::-1]
        else:
            return list(self.data)[-k:][::-1]

# Example Usage
# lvi = LastVisitedIntegers(k=3)
# lvi.insert(1)
# lvi.insert(2)
# lvi.insert(3)
# print(lvi.get_last(2))  # Output: [3, 2]
# lvi.insert(4)
# print(lvi.get_last(3))  # Output: [4, 3, 2]
```

### Time Complexity:
- `insert(val)` takes O(1) time because appending to a deque with a fixed max length is O(1).
- `get_last(k)` takes O(k) time for slicing the list and reversing it (in the worst case, k is the maximum length of the deque).

This approach ensures that both insertion and retrieval of the last `k` elements are efficient and straightforward, leveraging the capabilities of the `deque` in Python's `collections` module.
