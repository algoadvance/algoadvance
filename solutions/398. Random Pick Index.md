title:  Random Pick Index-out
permalink: /s398

You need to implement the `Solution` class which has a method `pick` that randomly picks an index of a given target number from an integer array.

* Implement the `Solution` class:
  * `Solution(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the array `nums`.
  * `int pick(int target)` Picks a random index from `nums` where `nums[index] == target`. If there are multiple valid indices, each index should have an equal probability of being returned.

## Example  
```
Input
["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
[[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]
Output
[null, 4, 0, 2]
```
*Explanation*:
```plaintext
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
solution.pick(3);     // Returns index 2, 3, or 4 randomly.
solution.pick(1);     // Returns index 0.
solution.pick(3);     // Returns index 2, 3, or 4 randomly.
```
Note that any index with `nums[index] == target` should be returned with equal probability.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size and values of the input array?
   - **Answer:** The array `nums` will have a length between `1` and `10^4`. Each element will be an integer within the range `[âˆ’10^7, 10^7]`.
2. **Target Occurrence:** Can the target occur multiple times, or can it be absent in `nums`?
   - **Answer:** The target can occur multiple times. It won't be guaranteed that the target is always present.

## Strategy
1. **Class Initialization (`__init__` method):**
   - Store the input list `nums`.
2. **Random Index Picking (`pick` method):**
   - Traverse the stored `nums` array to collect all indices where the element equals the target.
   - Randomly select one index from the collected list of valid indices.

For randomness, Python's `random` module, specifically the `random.choice` method, will be useful for selecting a random index from the list of valid indices.

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** O(n) where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Pick Method:** O(n) in the worst case, where we traverse the entire array when there is no early termination condition.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import random

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nums = nums
    
    def pick(self, target: int) -> int:
        # Collect all indices where nums[index] == target
        valid_indices = [i for i, num in enumerate(self.nums) if num == target]
        # Randomly pick one of these indices
        return random.choice(valid_indices)
```
The above solution should implement the requirements efficiently and correctly, leveraging list comprehension and random choice for simplicity and performance.
