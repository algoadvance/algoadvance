title:  Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words-out
permalink: /s2131
---

You are given an array of strings `words` where each string is exactly two characters long. Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed by concatenating these strings. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the number of elements in `words`?
   - Typically, for LeetCode problems, the number of elements can be up to \(10^5\).
  
2. **Characters**: Are the characters only lower-case English letters?
   - Yes, for simplicity, we can assume they are lower-case English letters.

3. **Output**: Do we need to return the constructed palindrome or just its length?
   - We need to return just the length of the longest palindrome.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need a strategy to utilize pairs of two-letter words that read the same forwards and backwards when concatenated:

1. **Word Pairing**:
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each word.
  
2. **Palindrome Pairs**:
   - For a word `"ab"`, we need to check if the reverse of it (`"ba"`) exists in the dictionary.
  
3. **Center Piece**:
   - Some words like `"aa"`, `"bb"`, etc., can act as center pieces and should be counted differently as they don't need a pair to form a part of the palindrome.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Accumulate the palindrome length by counting pairs and also considering a possible central piece.

### Code

```python
def longestPalindrome(words):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    word_count = defaultdict(int)
    for word in words:
        word_count[word] += 1
    
    palindrome_length = 0
    center_piece_found = False
    
    for word, count in list(word_count.items()):
        if word[0] == word[1]:  # Words like "aa", "bb", etc.
            if count % 2 == 0:
                palindrome_length += count * 2
            else:
                palindrome_length += (count - 1) * 2
                center_piece_found = True
        else:
            reverse_word = word[::-1]
            if reverse_word in word_count:
                matched_pairs = min(count, word_count[reverse_word])
                palindrome_length += matched_pairs * 4
                word_count[reverse_word] -= matched_pairs
                word_count[word] -= matched_pairs
    
    if center_piece_found:
        palindrome_length += 2
        
    return palindrome_length

# Example usage:
words = ["ab", "ty", "yt", "aa", "aa"]
print(longestPalindrome(words))   # Output: 8
```

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the `word_count` dictionary takes \(O(n)\).
- Iterating through the dictionary to calculate the palindrome's length also takes \(O(n)\).
- The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of words in the input list.

### Explanation

- We first count the occurrences of each word.
- We check each word and determine if it can form pairs with its reverse. For words like "aa", we handle them separately.
- We keep track of the longest possible palindrome by summing up the lengths from valid pairs.
- Finally, we add 2 to the length if there's any central piece that can be used in the middle of the palindrome.
