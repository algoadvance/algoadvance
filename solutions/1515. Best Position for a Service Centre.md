title:  Best Position for a Service Centre-out
permalink: /s1515
---
You are given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the position `(xi, yi)` of the `i-th` customer on a 2D map. The distances between the service centre and the customers are calculated using Euclidean distance formula:

```
Distance = sqrt((x_center - xi)^2 + (y_center - yi)^2)
```

Return the minimum possible sum of the Euclidean distances between the service centre and the customers.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4.00000
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]
Output: 2.82843
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= positions.length <= 50`
- `0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Number of positions**: Is the length of `positions` fixed to a certain number, or can it vary?
2. **Data range constraints**: Are the coordinates limited to non-negative integers as given in the constraints?
3. **Precision of output**: What level of precision is required for the output distance?

## Strategy
The optimal solution for finding the best position for the service center turns out to be a geometric median problem, especially finding the "Fermat-Weber point" of the positions on a 2D plane. This problem does not have a straightforward closed-form solution and is generally approached using iterative methods.

A popular approach to solve this problem is using **Weiszfeld's algorithm**, which is an iterative method to approximate the location of the geometric median.

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for the center. Usually, the arithmetic mean of coordinates is a good starting point.
2. **Iterate**: Update the position iteratively using weights proportional to the reciprocal of the distances to the current guess.
3. **Convergence**: Stop when the change in the position is smaller than a tiny threshold.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is mainly dependent on the number of iterations it takes to converge. Each iteration involves calculating distances to all points and updating the center, so for `n` positions and `k` iterations, the complexity is `O(n * k)`.

## Code
Here's how you can implement the solution using Weiszfeld's algorithm in Python:

```python
import math

def get_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return math.sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)

def best_position(positions):
    x_center = sum([p[0] for p in positions]) / len(positions)
    y_center = sum([p[1] for p in positions]) / len(positions)
    
    epsilon = 1e-7
    while True:
        num_x, num_y, den = 0, 0, 0
        for x, y in positions:
            dist = get_distance(x_center, y_center, x, y)
            if dist > epsilon:  # Avoid division by zero
                weight = 1 / dist
                num_x += x * weight
                num_y += y * weight
                den += weight
        
        new_x_center = num_x / den
        new_y_center = num_y / den
        
        if get_distance(x_center, y_center, new_x_center, new_y_center) <= epsilon:
            break
        
        x_center, y_center = new_x_center, new_y_center
    
    total_distance = sum(get_distance(x_center, y_center, x, y) for x, y in positions)
    return total_distance

# Example usage
positions1 = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
positions2 = [[1,1],[3,3]]

print(f"Example 1 Output: {best_position(positions1):.5f}")
print(f"Example 2 Output: {best_position(positions2):.5f}")
```

### Summary
1. **Initialization**: Start with an average of points.
2. **Iteration**: Update the center using Weiszfeld's formula.
3. **Convergence**: Stop when the position change is minimal.

This implementation ensures the optimal placement of the service center to minimize the sum of Euclidean distances to all customers with desired precision.
