title:  Sort the Students by Their Kth Score-out
permalink: /s2545
---

Given a list of students where each student is represented by a list of their scores in different subjects, sort the students by their scores in the `k`th subject in descending order.

**Constraints:**
- `scores` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers.
- `k` is an integer representing the index of the subject by which we need to sort the students.
- The list can have up to `10^5` students, and each student can have scores in up to `100` subjects.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of the scores?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but we can assume scores are non-negative integers for simplicity.
   
2. **Can `k` be assumed to be a valid index within the range of subjects each student has scores for?**
   - Yes, `k` is always valid, i.e., `0 <= k < number of subjects`.

3. **Does the order of the subjects need to be preserved within each studentâ€™s list?**
   - Yes, we sort students based on `k`th score, but each student's list of scores should remain intact.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting by Key:**
   - Python offers a very handy way to sort lists using the `sorted()` function, where we can pass a custom key function. 
   - We'll use a lambda function to specify that sorting should be based on the `k`th element of each student's scores.
2. **Descending Order:**
   - Use the `reverse=True` parameter to sort in descending order.

### Code

```python
def sort_students_by_kth_score(scores, k):
    return sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[k], reverse=True)

# Example Usage
scores = [
    [70, 80, 90],  # Student 1
    [88, 92, 85],  # Student 2
    [90, 85, 88]   # Student 3
]
k = 2

sorted_students = sort_students_by_kth_score(scores, k)
print(sorted_students)
# Output: [[70, 80, 90], [90, 85, 88], [88, 92, 85]]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Complexity:** The time complexity for sorting is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of students.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` for the sorted output list.

In this approach, the lambda function for extracting the `k`th score runs in constant time `O(1)` and it's used `n log n` times during the sorting process. Therefore, the overall time complexity remains `O(n log n)`.

Feel free to ask if there is any further clarification or additional requirement!
