title:  Lexicographical Numbers-out
permalink: /s386
---
Given an integer `n`, return `1` through `n` in lexicographical order.

### Example 1:
```python
Input: n = 13
Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

### Example 2:
```python
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the input range limitations for `n`?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify, but typical competitive programming constraints would mean assuming `1 <= n <= 5000` is reasonable unless specified otherwise.

2. **Q:** Should the solution handle large inputs efficiently?
   - **A:** Yes, it should be efficient enough for larger values within typical constraints.

3. **Q:** Do we need to handle invalid inputs for `n`?
   - **A:** We can assume `n` is always a positive integer according to the problem.

## Strategy
1. **Brute-force Approach:** 
   - Generate the numbers from 1 to `n` and then sort them lexicographically.
   - This solution works but is not optimal given its \(O(n \log n)\) complexity due to sorting.

2. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Utilize a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to generate numbers in lexicographical order directly.
   - This approach avoids the requirement to sort, thereby optimizing the solution.
   - We will initiate DFS from every digit from `1 to 9`.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize an empty result list.
2. Perform DFS starting from each digit `1 to 9`.
    - In each step of DFS, append the current number to the result list.
    - Recursively append each digit from `0 to 9` as the next digit unless it exceeds `n`.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n)` since each number from `1 to n` is processed exactly once.
- The space complexity is primarily `O(n)` for storing the result.

---

## Code
Here is the Python implementation of the described approach:

```python
def lexicalOrder(n: int) -> list:
    def dfs(current):
        if current > n:
            return
        result.append(current)
        for i in range(10):
            if 10 * current + i <= n:
                dfs(10 * current + i)
            else:
                break

    result = []
    for i in range(1, 10):
        dfs(i)
    return result

# Example Usage
n = 13
print(lexicalOrder(n))  # Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

This code will generate the lexicographical order of numbers from 1 to `n` by using DFS starting from each number `1` through `9` and recursively building upon those.

This approach ensures that the numbers are naturally constructed in lexicographical order without needing an extra sort step, providing an efficient solution.
