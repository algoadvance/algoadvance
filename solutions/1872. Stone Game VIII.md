Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `stones` whose length is `n` and you initially have the score of `sum(stones)`.

On each player's turn, that player can remove the leftmost element of the array, in which case the new score is the old score minus the element removed. If the length of the array is now down to 1, then the game ends and the player with the higher score wins.

Bob will always choose the optimal strategy to minimize Alice's score.

Return the maximum score Alice can achieve if both Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions
To clarify the problem thoroughly:
1. Is there a guarantee that the stone array is non-empty?
   - Yes, the length is `n`.
2. Can the sum of the initial elements be negative?
   - Yes.

### Strategy
We need to find a strategy for Alice to maximize her score given Bob's optimal responses.

The key insight is to recognize that the game is about maximizing the prefix sum minus the suffix sum for Alice, considering Bobâ€™s optimal responses, since Bob will always try to minimize Alice's score.

1. Calculate the prefix sums.
2. Use dynamic programming to track the best possible outcome for Alice from the rightmost index to the left.

Key idea: If we always look ahead and choose the optimal value that Alice can move to, influenced by Bob's optimal moves, Alice will be making the best possible decisions.

### Code Implementation
Let's implement the solution using the described strategy.

```python
def stoneGameVIII(stones):
    n = len(stones)
    # Compute the prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] * n
    prefix_sums[0] = stones[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + stones[i]

    # Initialize DP array
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[-1] = prefix_sums[-1]  # Base case

    # Fill the DP array from the end to the start
    for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], prefix_sums[i] - dp[i + 1])
        
    return dp[1]

# Example usage:
stones = [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]
print(stoneGameVIII(stones))  # Output should be adapted based on the input provided
```

### Time Complexity
- Prefix sums calculation: \(O(n)\)
- Dynamic Programming computation: \(O(n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal maximum score Alice can achieve by leveraging dynamic programming and prefix sums.
