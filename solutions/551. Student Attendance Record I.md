title:  Student Attendance Record I-out
permalink: /s551
---
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
- 'A': Absent
- 'L': Late
- 'P': Present

A student could be rewarded if their attendance record does not contain:
1. More than one 'A' (absent).
2. More than two continuous 'L' (late).

You need to implement a function `checkRecord(s: str) -> bool` that checks whether the student's record is eligible for an attendance award.

### Clarifying Questions
No additional clarifications are needed, as the problem statement is clear. We need to return `True` if the student is eligible based on the given conditions, and `False` otherwise.

### Strategy
1. **Check for 'A's**: We need to ensure the string contains no more than one 'A'.
2. **Check for continuous 'L's**: We need to ensure that there are no instances where 'L' appears more than twice in a row.

To achieve this, we can:
1. Count the occurrences of 'A' in the string.
2. Use a sliding window technique or string operations to check for three consecutive 'L's.

### Code
Here's the Python implementation:

```python
def checkRecord(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check for more than one 'A'
    if s.count('A') > 1:
        return False
    
    # Check for three consecutive 'L's
    if 'LLL' in s:
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Time Complexity
- Counting 'A's in the string: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Checking for the substring 'LLL': O(n).

Hence, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).

By keeping the solution straightforward using built-in string operations, it remains efficient and easy to understand.
