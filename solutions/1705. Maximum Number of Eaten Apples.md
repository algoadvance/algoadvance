title:  Maximum Number of Eaten Apples-out
permalink: /s1705
---
You have an apple tree that grows apples every day. For the i-th day, you know how many apples grew on the i-th day and how many days it will take for those apples to rot, given by two arrays `apples` and `days`, both of length `n`. You can eat at most one apple each day, and you cannot eat apples that have gone bad. Determine the maximum number of apples you can eat.

- `apples[i]` is the number of apples that grew on the i-th day.
- `days[i]` is the number of days (starting from the i-th day) before the apples on the i-th day rot and can't be eaten.

### Example
- **Input:**
  ```python
  apples = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2]
  days = [3, 2, 1, 4, 2]
  ```

- **Output:** 7

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the number of apples (`apples[i]`) or the number of days before they rot (`days[i]`) be zero?
2. Is there a constraint on the number of days (`n`) for which apples grow?

## Code:
```python
import heapq

def eatenApples(apples, days):
    # Create a min-heap to keep track of apples and their rot days
    heap = []
    max_apples_eaten = 0
    current_day = 0
    
    while current_day < len(apples) or heap:
        # If there are apples growing today, add them to the heap with their rot day
        if current_day < len(apples) and apples[current_day] > 0:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (current_day + days[current_day], apples[current_day]))
        
        # Remove rotten apples from the heap
        while heap and (heap[0][0] <= current_day or heap[0][1] == 0):
            heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        # Eat one apple if there are any fresh ones
        if heap:
            rot_day, apple_count = heapq.heappop(heap)
            apple_count -= 1
            max_apples_eaten += 1
            if apple_count > 0:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (rot_day, apple_count))
        
        current_day += 1

    return max_apples_eaten

# Example Test Case
apples = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2]
days = [3, 2, 1, 4, 2]
print(eatenApples(apples, days))  # Output: 7
```

## Strategy:
1. **Use a min-heap** to keep track of apples and their expiration days.
2. For each day, push the number of apples and their expiration day (calculated as `current_day + days[current_day]`) into the heap.
3. At the start of each day, pop the heap to remove any rotten apples.
4. If the heap has non-rotten apples, pop the heap to get the apple with the closest expiration day, and eat one apple (decrease the count of that apple). If there are apples remaining from that batch, reinsert the batch with updated count.
5. Continue this until all days have been processed and there are no more apples left in the heap.

## Time Complexity:
- **Insertion and removal from heap**: O(log n)
- **Traversal of days and heap operations**: O(n log n)
Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** where `n` is the total number of days.
