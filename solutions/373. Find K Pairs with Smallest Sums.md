title:  Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums-out
permalink: /s373
---
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in ascending order and an integer `k`.

Define a pair `(u, v)` which consists of one element from `nums1` and one element from `nums2`.

Return the k pairs `(u1, v1), (u2, v2), ..., (uk, vk)` with the smallest sums.

## Clarifying questions:
1. **What if one of the arrays is empty?**
   - If either of the arrays is empty, the output should be an empty list because no pairs can be formed.
2. **What if `k` is greater than the total number of possible pairs?**
   - Return all possible pairs sorted by their sums.
3. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - Typically, these arrays can be quite large, up to 10^3 to 10^4 elements.
4. **Are there any constraints on the values of `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - Values in these arrays can range between -10^9 and 10^9.

## Strategy:
1. **Utilize a Min-Heap:**
   - Use a Min-Heap to keep track of pairs with the smallest sums. In Python, we can use the `heapq` module.
   - Push pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` into the Min-Heap with their sums as the priority.
2. **Initial Heap Population:**
   - We start by pairing the first element of `nums1` with every element from `nums2` (or vice versa) and push these pairs into the Min-Heap.
   - This ensures that we consider pairs with the minimum possible sums first.
3. **Iterate to Gather Results:**
   - Extract the smallest sum pairs from the heap up to `k` times or until the heap is exhausted.
4. **Avoid Redundant Pairs:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the indices to prevent reprocessing already considered pairs.

## Code:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def kSmallestPairs(nums1, nums2, k):
    if not nums1 or not nums2 or k == 0:
        return []
    
    min_heap = []
    res = []
    
    # Initialize the heap
    for i in range(min(len(nums1), k)):
        heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i] + nums2[0], i, 0))
    
    # Extract the smallest pairs
    while min_heap and len(res) < k:
        sum_val, i, j = heappop(min_heap)
        res.append((nums1[i], nums2[j]))
        if j + 1 < len(nums2):
            heappush(min_heap, (nums1[i] + nums2[j + 1], i, j + 1))
    
    return res
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Heap Initialization:**
  - We push the first `min(len(nums1), k)` elements into the heap.
  - This takes O(min(len(nums1), k) log(min(len(nums1), k))).
- **Extracting from Heap:**
  - In the worst case, we perform `k` heap operations, each taking O(log(min(len(nums1), k))).
  - Thus, the total time complexity is O(k log(min(len(nums1), k))).

The overall time complexity is O(k log(min(len(nums1), k))), making this approach efficient for the given problem.
