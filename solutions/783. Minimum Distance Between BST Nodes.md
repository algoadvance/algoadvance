title:  Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes-out
permalink: /s783
---

The problem requires you to find the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST). 

The structure of BST ensures that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key, and the right subtree only contains nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the BST contain duplicate values?**
   - No, by definition a BST does not contain duplicate values.
   
2. **What is the range of values for the nodes in the BST?**
   - Nodes' values are generally within the range of typical 32-bit integers.
   
3. **Is the BST guaranteed to have at least two nodes?**
   - Yes, because we need to find the minimum distance between any two nodes, there must be at least two nodes.

### Strategy:

1. **Inorder Traversal:** An inorder traversal of a BST gives nodes in sorted order.
   
2. **Store Values:** As we perform an inorder traversal, we will keep track of the previous node's value.
   
3. **Calculate Min Difference:** By comparing the current node's value with the previous node's value and updating our minimum difference whenever we find a smaller one.

### Code:

Here is the Python function to solve this problem:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def minDiffInBST(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    # Initialize previous value as None and min_diff as a large number
    pre_val = None
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    def inorder(node: TreeNode):
        nonlocal pre_val, min_diff
        if node:
            # Traverse the left subtree
            inorder(node.left)
            
            # If previous value exists, calculate the difference and update min_diff
            if pre_val is not None:
                min_diff = min(min_diff, node.val - pre_val)
                
            # Update the previous value to the current node's value
            pre_val = node.val
            
            # Traverse the right subtree
            inorder(node.right)
    
    # Start inorder traversal from the root
    inorder(root)
    
    return min_diff
```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class:** This is the basic structure of a node in a BST, with attributes `val`, `left`, and `right`.
   
2. **minDiffInBST Function:** Initializes `pre_val` to `None` and `min_diff` to infinity. The nested `inorder` function performs an in-order traversal of the BST.
   
3. **Inorder Traversal:**
   - As we traverse the left subtree, we keep updating our `pre_val` with the current node's value.
   - For each newly visited node, we calculate the difference between the current node's value and `pre_val`.
   - Update the `min_diff` whenever we find a smaller difference.
   
4. **Return Result:** After the complete traversal, we return `min_diff`, which holds the smallest difference between any two nodes in the BST.

### Time Complexity:

- **Traversal:** The function performs an in-order traversal over the nodes of the BST, visiting each node exactly once.
- Thus, the time complexity is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the BST.
   
- **Space Complexity:** The extra space used is primarily for the recursion stack during the in-order traversal, so the space complexity is **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the tree. In the worst case, **H** could be **N** (for a completely unbalanced tree), but for a balanced tree, it would be **log(N)**.
