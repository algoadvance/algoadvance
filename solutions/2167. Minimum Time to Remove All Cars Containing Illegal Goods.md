title:  Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods-out
permalink: /s2167
---

You are given a binary string `s` in which `1` represents a car containing illegal goods and `0` represents an empty car. If you remove a car containing illegal goods (`1`), you need 1 unit of time. If you remove an empty car (`0`), it takes no time.

You can remove the cars either from the front or from the back of the string. You need to find the minimum time required to remove all cars containing illegal goods.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can I remove multiple cars in one operation?
   - **A:** No, each removal operation is performed one at a time from either end.
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the binary string `s`?
   - **A:** The problem does not provide specific constraints on the length, but we can assume it can be up to `10^5` elements as per typical LeetCode constraints.
3. **Q:** Can the string be empty?
   - **A:** No, the problem describes operations for non-empty strings specifically.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a two-pointer technique to determine the minimum time to remove all illegal cars. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left` starts at the beginning of the string and `right` starts at the end of the string.

2. **Iterate to Find Time from Both Ends:**
   - Iterate through the string from both ends (`left` moving right and `right` moving left), and keep track of the minimum time required to clear the illegal cars.
   
3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window technique to track the sum of illegal cars in a segment and calculate the minimum time needed.

4. **Consider Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where there are no illegal cars (`1`s) in the string.

## Code

Here's the code to implement the strategy:

```python
def minimumTime(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    # Early exit if there are no '1's in the string
    if s.count('1') == 0:
        return 0

    # Find the prefix and suffix removing times
    prefix_time = [0] * (n + 1)
    suffix_time = [0] * (n + 2)
    
    # Calculate prefix time (removal costs from the start)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_time[i + 1] = prefix_time[i] + (1 if s[i] == '1' else 0)
    
    # Calculate suffix time (removal costs from the end)
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        suffix_time[i + 1] = suffix_time[i + 2] + (1 if s[i] == '1' else 0)

    # Minimum time to clear all illegal cars
    min_time = float('inf')
    
    # Consider splitting point where prefix `i` and suffix `i+1`
    for i in range(n + 1):
        min_time = min(min_time, prefix_time[i] + suffix_time[i + 1])
    
    return min_time

# Example usage
s = "1100101"
print(minimumTime(s))  # Expected output is 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n). We make a single pass through the string to calculate the prefix and suffix times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). We store the `prefix_time` and `suffix_time` arrays, which requires extra space proportional to the length of the string.
