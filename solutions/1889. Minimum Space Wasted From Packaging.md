title:  Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging-out
permalink: /s1889
---

You have `n` packages you are trying to place in boxes, each package has a `weight` representing its weight. You have `m` box sizes, and each box size has its own `weight` limit. You are allowed to discard some packages if necessary, and your objective is to minimize the total wasted space. Wasted space for a box is defined as the weight limit of the box minus the sum of the weights of the packages it contains.

Given:
- An array `packages` of `n` integers.
- An array of lists `boxes` where each sub-list indicates the weight limits of the boxes of a certain vendor.

Return the minimum total space wasted or `-1` if it is impossible to fit all the packages into the given boxes.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will the packages be sorted in increasing order?
2. Can boxes from multiple vendors be used simultaneously, or do we choose one vendor's boxes?
3. Should we minimize wasted space for each box independently?
4. Is there an upper limit on the number of packages or the weight of packages and boxes?

## Strategy
1. **Sorting the Packages:** Since the weights of packages are arbitrary, sorting them can simplify the problem.
2. **Vendor Boxes:** Each vendorâ€™s boxes should be sorted to facilitate easier allocation to packages.
3. **Greedy Fit:** For each vendor, attempt to fit the packages into the boxes while keeping track of the wasted space.
4. **Result Compilation:** Return the minimum wasted space across all vendors, or -1 if no vendor can accommodate all packages.

## Code

```python
def minWastedSpace(packages, boxes):
    packages.sort()
    total_weight = sum(packages)
    min_waste = float('inf')
    
    for vendor_boxes in boxes:
        vendor_boxes.sort()
        if vendor_boxes[-1] < packages[-1]:
            continue
        
        waste = 0
        prev = 0
        for box in vendor_boxes:
            idx = bisect.bisect_right(packages, box, prev)
            waste += box * (idx - prev)
            prev = idx
            if prev == len(packages):
                break
        
        min_waste = min(min_waste, waste - total_weight)
    
    return -1 if min_waste == float('inf') else min_waste

# Example usage
packages = [2,3,5]
boxes = [[4,8], [2,8]]
print(minWastedSpace(packages, boxes))  # Output should be 6
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Sorting:** Sorting the packages takes `O(n log n)`, and sorting each vendor's boxes takes `O(mlog m)` where `m` is the number of vendors.
2. **Greedy Fit:** For each vendor, fitting takes `O(n log m)` using binary search for each package reference for every box size.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + P * m log m)` where P is the total number of boxes across all vendors. The worst-case complexity is manageable for moderate inputs and ensures an efficient solution.
