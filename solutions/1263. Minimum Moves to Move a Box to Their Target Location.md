title:  Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location-out
permalink: /s1263
---

You are given a `m x n` grid grid representing a warehouse where:

- `'.'` is an empty cell.
- `'#'` is a wall.
- `'B'` is the box.
- `'S'` is the player.
- `'T'` is the target.

The player can push the box to adjacent cells (forming a new state) if those cells are empty. The player can also move to adjacent cells (without pushing the box) if those cells are empty.

Return the minimum number of pushes needed to move the box 'B' to the target 'T'. If it is not possible to move the box, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the player walk through walls?**
   - No, walls obstruct movement.
  
2. **Can the player occupy the same cell as the box?**
   - No, they must be on adjacent cells to push the box.

3. **Are we guaranteed that there is exactly one 'B', one 'S', and one 'T' in the grid?**
   - Yes, this is guaranteed.

4. **Can the grid be of varying dimensions (e.g., non-square)?**
   - Yes, the grid can vary in dimensions.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to simulate both the player's movements and the box's movements. The player can only push the box if they are adjacent to it and the next cell in the direction of the push is empty.

We'll approach this using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Parse the input grid to find the initial positions of `B`, `S`, and `T`.
   - Use a queue to manage the BFS traversal. The state in the queue will include the box's position, the player's position, and the number of pushes taken.
   - Use a set to track visited states to avoid revisiting.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   - For each state in the queue, determine all possible movements for the player.
   - For each possible movement, if it results in pushing the box, ensure the next cell in the direction of the push is empty and update the state.
   - Continue until the box reaches the target position or the queue is exhausted.

3. **Check and Return Result**:
   - If the target `T` is reached, return the number of pushes.
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching `T`, return `-1`.

## Code:

```python
from collections import deque

def minPushBox(grid):
    def is_valid(x, y):
        return 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and grid[x][y] != '#'

    # find initial positions of S, B, and T
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 'S':
                s_pos = (i, j)
            elif grid[i][j] == 'B':
                b_pos = (i, j)
            elif grid[i][j] == 'T':
                t_pos = (i, j)
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Up, Down, Left, Right
    queue = deque([(b_pos[0], b_pos[1], s_pos[0], s_pos[1], 0)])
    visited = set([(b_pos[0], b_pos[1], s_pos[0], s_pos[1])])

    while queue:
        bx, by, px, py, pushes = queue.popleft()
        if (bx, by) == t_pos:
            return pushes
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nbx, nby = bx + dx, by + dy
            npx, npy = bx - dx, by - dy
            if is_valid(nbx, nby) and is_valid(npx, npy):
                if (nbx, nby, bx, by) not in visited and bfs(grid, (px, py), (npx, npy), bx, by):
                    visited.add((nbx, nby, bx, by))
                    queue.append((nbx, nby, bx, by, pushes+1))
    return -1

def bfs(grid, start, goal, bx, by):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == goal:
            return True
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] != '#' and (nx, ny) not in visited and (nx, ny) != (bx, by):
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return False
```

## Time Complexity:
- **BFS complexity**: Typically O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (cells in the grid) and E is the number of edges (possible movements).
- **Nested BFS Calls**: There is an O(m * n) BFS call within the primary BFS.
- Overall, the time complexity can be approximated as O((m * n)^2 * 4), considering the nested BFS.

The space complexity is O(m * n * m * n) to accommodate the visited states.

This solution ensures all possible paths are explored in the minimum number of steps to reach the target.
