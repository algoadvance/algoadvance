title:  Squares of a Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s977
---
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can I assume that the input array will always contain at least one element as per the constraints?
2. Are there any specific inputs that I should consider, like arrays that only contain non-negative or non-positive numbers?

## Strategy:
1. **Two-Pointer Approach:** 
   - Since the array is sorted, negative numbers, when squared, will become positive and might end up larger than some of the positive numbers.
   - Use two pointers: one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
   - Compare the absolute values of the elements at these pointers.
   - Place the larger square at the current end of the result array and move the corresponding pointer inward.
   - Continue this process until all elements have been processed.
   
This method is efficient and ensures that we only pass through the array once, making it an `O(n)` time complexity solution.

## Code:
```python
def sortedSquares(nums):
    # Two pointers
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    result = [0] * len(nums)
    position = len(nums) - 1
    
    # Process the elements from both ends towards the middle
    while left <= right:
        left_square = nums[left] * nums[left]
        right_square = nums[right] * nums[right]
        
        if left_square > right_square:
            result[position] = left_square
            left += 1
        else:
            result[position] = right_square
            right -= 1
        position -= 1
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We traverse the entire array once with two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` - We use an additional array to store the squared values.
