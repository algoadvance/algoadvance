title:  Graph Connectivity With Threshold-out
permalink: /s1627
---

Given `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given an integer `threshold` and an undirected graph where there is an edge between all pairs of nodes whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is greater than `threshold`.

You have to determine the connectivity of the graph. For each query, find out if the two nodes `u` and `v` are connected or not.

The queries are in the form of a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]`.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if `u_i` and `v_i` are connected and `false` otherwise.

### Example

**Input:**
- `n = 6`
- `threshold = 2`
- `queries = [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]`

**Output:** `[false, false, true]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
    - `1 <= n <= 10^4`
    - `0 <= threshold <= n`
    - `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
    - `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
    - `u_i != v_i`

2. **Explanation:**
    - An edge exists between two nodes if and only if their GCD is greater than `threshold`.

## Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
    - This problem can effectively be solved using the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to manage connectivity queries efficiently.
    - The Union-Find data structure efficiently supports two operations:
        - **Find:** Determine which component a particular element is in.
        - **Union:** Merge two components into a single component.

2. **Building the Graph:**
    - Iterate through pairs of nodes and add an edge if the GCD of the nodes is greater than `threshold`.
    - This can be streamlined by recognizing that for any node `i`, the nodes that it can connect directly (based on the GCD condition) follow a specific pattern.

3. **Union Operation for Multiple Connections:**
    - Given a threshold `t`, for each node `i` (from `1` to `n`), we need to connect `i` to all its multiples where `i > t`.

4. **Processing Queries:**
    - Use the Find operation in Union-Find to verify if two nodes are in the same connected component.

## Code

```python
from math import gcd
from collections import defaultdict

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.root = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.root[x] != x:
            self.root[x] = self.find(self.root[x])  # Path compression
        return self.root[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        
        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

def areConnected(n, threshold, queries):
    if threshold == 0:
        return [True] * len(queries)  # All nodes are connected if threshold is 0
    
    uf = UnionFind(n + 1)  # Initialize Union-Find for nodes 1 to n
    
    for i in range(threshold + 1, n + 1):
        for multiple in range(2 * i, n + 1, i):
            uf.union(i, multiple)
    
    results = []
    for u, v in queries:
        if uf.find(u) == uf.find(v):
            results.append(True)
        else:
            results.append(False)
    
    return results
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of Union-Find:** \( O(n) \)
- **Union Operations:**
  - For each node `i` from `threshold + 1` to `n`, connecting `i` to its multiples involves \(O(n \log n)\) operations due to iterating over multiples and union operations.
- **Query Processing:** \( O(q \alpha(n)) \) where \( q \) is the number of queries and \( \alpha \) is the inverse Ackermann function.

Overall, the approach is efficient given the constraints. The most expensive part is the union operations, but they are manageable within the given limits.
