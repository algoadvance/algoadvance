title:  Arranging Coins-out

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should I handle negative inputs or non-integer inputs?
   - No need. Assume `n` is always a non-negative integer.

2. Can `n` be zero?
   - Yes, in which case the output should be `0`.

## Strategy

To determine the number of complete rows that can be built with `n` coins, we need to find the maximum `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + k`) is less than or equal to `n`.

The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Sum}(k) = \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \]

We need to solve the inequality:

\[ \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \leq n \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ k^2 + k \leq 2n \]

Which is a quadratic equation in the form:

\[ k^2 + k - 2n = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( k = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -2n \), we get:

\[ k = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} \]

Since `k` must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:

\[ k = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} \]

The largest integer value of `k` that satisfies this will be the number of complete rows.

## Code

```python
import math

def arrangeCoins(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    # Quadratic formula to solve for k
    k = int((-1 + math.isqrt(1 + 8 * n)) // 2)
    return k
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above approach is \( O(1) \) because we are performing a constant number of arithmetic operations, including a square root calculation.

- **Input Size:** \( n \)
- **Operations:** Constant operations, including arithmetic calculations and integer square root.
