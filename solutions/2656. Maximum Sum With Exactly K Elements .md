title:  Maximum Sum With Exactly K Elements -out
permalink: /s2656

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of `k` elements from the array `nums` where every element in the array can be chosen only once. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input Length**
   - What is the size range of the input list `nums`?
2. **Element Values**
   - What range of values can the elements in `nums` have?
3. **Exact K Elements**
   - Should the sum always be computed using exactly `k` elements? (assuming the answer is yes)

### Example
If `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, the maximum sum obtained by choosing exactly 2 elements is `4 + 5 = 9`.

### Strategy
To maximize the sum using exactly `k` elements from the array `nums`:
1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the `nums` array in non-decreasing (ascending) order.
2. **Select Largest Elements**: Select the largest `k` elements from the sorted array. These will be the last `k` elements after sorting.
3. **Sum the Selected Elements**: Sum these `k` largest elements to get the required maximum sum.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) if you do in-place sorting, \(O(n)\) if the sorting creates a new list.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def maxSumWithKElements(nums, k):
    # Sort the array in ascending order
    nums.sort()
    # Sum of the largest k elements
    return sum(nums[-k:])

# Test case
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 2
print(maxSumWithKElements(nums, k))  # Output: 9
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting the Array**: We first sort the array `nums` to arrange the elements in ascending order.
2. **Selecting K Elements**: Using `nums[-k:]`, we extract the last `k` elements from the sorted array, which are the largest `k` elements.
3. **Summing Up**: Finally, we sum up these selected elements to get the maximum sum.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum sum using exactly `k` elements from the given array.
