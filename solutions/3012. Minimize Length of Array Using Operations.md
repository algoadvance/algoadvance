title:  Minimize Length of Array Using Operations-out
permalink: /s3012
---

You are given an array `nums`. At each operation, you can remove two identical numbers from the array. The goal is to minimize the length of the array after performing a series of operations. Find the minimum possible length of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array is guaranteed to contain at least one element.

2. **What is the range of the array elements?**
   - The problem does not specify, so assume any integer values.

3. **Can we assume there are always an even number of duplicates to remove?**
   - No, some numbers can have an odd frequency, leaving one element behind after removing pairs.

4. **What should be the output if there are no duplicates or no operations can be performed?**
   - The output should be the length of the array as it cannot be reduced further.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash table to count the frequency of each element.
2. **Remove Pairs**: For each element, calculate how many pairs we can remove.
3. **Remaining Elements**: Compute the number of elements that will still remain in the array after all possible pairs are removed.

### Code

Here's the implementation based on the outlined strategy:

```python
from collections import Counter

def minimizeLength(nums):
    # Step 1: Count frequencies of each number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate remaining elements after removing all possible pairs
    remaining = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        remaining += count % 2
    
    return remaining

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3]
print(minimizeLength(nums))  # Output should be 1
```

### Explanation

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `nums`.
2. **Calculate Remaining Elements**: Iterate through the frequency counts. For each count, add the remainder when divided by 2 to a `remaining` count. This effectively counts the elements that can't be paired up.
3. Return the `remaining` count, which represents the minimized length of the array.

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: This operation takes O(n) time where n is the number of elements in `nums` since we iterate through the list once.
- **Calculating Remaining Elements**: This involves iterating through the frequencies which in the worst case (distinct elements) would be O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
