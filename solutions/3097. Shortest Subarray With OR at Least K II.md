title:  Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K II-out
permalink: /s3097
---

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to find the length of the shortest non-empty subarray such that the OR of each element in this subarray is at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. The OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the elements in the array.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 7
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The subarray [3,4] gives us 3 OR 4 = 7 which is >= k but it is not the shortest. The subarray [2,3,4] gives us 2 OR 3 OR 4 = 7 which is >= k. Thus, this is the shortest subarray which gives OR >= k.

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [9,6,8], k = 5
    Output: 1
    Explanation: Any single element can be taken from the array because OR of any element from the array is itself which will be >= k.

**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 7
    Output: -1
    Explanation: No possible subarray exists with OR at least 7.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`?**
   - `nums` is an array of integers where the length is between 1 and 100,000. Each integer is between 1 and 10^9. `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
   
2. **Are there any constraints or special conditions on the values in `nums`, such as being sorted?**
   - No, `nums` can be in any order. 

3. **Should we consider individual elements as subarrays?**
   - Yes, individual elements are considered subarrays, and if they meet the condition, they should be considered.
   
4. **Is there a maximum length to the subarray we are concerned with?**
   - Practically, the entire array can be a subarray, but we are interested in finding the shortest possible.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**: We need to track the minimum length found. We'll use a variable `min_len` set to infinity initially to hold the minimum length of the subarray that meets the criterion. We'll also use a deque to help maintain sliding window properties.
   
2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window to find the subarrays. The idea is to expand the window by adding elements to it until the OR condition is met and then try to contract it from the left to find the shortest subarray while still meeting the condition.
   
3. **Check OR Condition**: For each new element added to the window, update the OR result of the window. Once the OR result is at least `k`, the current window length is a candidate for the minimum length.
   
4. **Edge Case**: If no subarray meets the condition, return `-1`.

## Code

```python
def shortest_subarray_with_or_at_least_k(nums, k):
    from collections import deque

    n = len(nums)
    min_len = float('inf')
    
    for start in range(n):
        curr_or = 0
        
        for end in range(start, n):
            curr_or |= nums[end]
            
            if curr_or >= k:
                min_len = min(min_len, end - start + 1)
                break # No need to continue with the same start as the subarray will only get longer

    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else -1

# Examples
print(shortest_subarray_with_or_at_least_k([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7))  # Output: 3
print(shortest_subarray_with_or_at_least_k([9, 6, 8], 5))        # Output: 1
print(shortest_subarray_with_or_at_least_k([1, 2, 3], 7))        # Output: -1
```

## Time Complexity

The current solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) because in the worst case, the inner loop runs \(O(n)\) times for each iteration of the outer loop. This is not optimal for very large arrays.

To improve, consider optimizing the OR computation with efficient window maintenance using deque or binary search techniques.
