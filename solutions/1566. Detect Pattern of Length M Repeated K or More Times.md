title:  Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times-out
permalink: /s1566
---
Given an array of positive integers `arr`,  find a pattern of length `m` that is repeated at least `k` times in the array. The pattern must be consecutive, which means that between consecutive appearances of the same pattern, there cannot be any other elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:**
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `m` and `k`?
   - Can `arr` be empty or have very few elements?

2. **Expected output:**
   - Should the function return a boolean indicating if the pattern exists or not?
   - Should any other information be returned?

Let's assume:
- The minimal length of `m` and `k` is 1.
- The array is not empty and contains at least one element.
- The function should return a boolean indicating if there exists a repeated pattern of length `m` repeated at least `k` times consecutively.

### Code
```python
def contains_pattern(arr, m, k):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n - m * k + 1):
        pattern = arr[i:i + m]
        matches = 0
        
        for j in range(i, n - m + 1, m):
            if arr[j:j + m] == pattern:
                matches += 1
            else:
                break
            
            if matches == k:
                return True
                
    return False
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Calculate the length of the array `n`. Iterate over the array, checking for potential patterns starting at each index `i`.
2. **Pattern formation:** For each index `i`, define a sub-array of length `m` as the pattern.
3. **Pattern checking:** Use a nested loop to check for consecutive patterns:
   - Start another loop from the current index `i`, stepping by `m` to check the next segment of length `m`.
   - Compare this segment to the initial pattern.
   - Count consecutive matches. If the count reaches `k`, return `True`.
4. **Early termination:** If the matches do not reach `k` and the consecutive checking breaks, continue to the next starting index until all possibilities are exhausted.
5. **Return False:** If no pattern of length `m` is found `k` or more times consecutively, return `False`.

### Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** \(O(n)\) when a pattern is found early.
- **Worst Case:** \(O((n - m * k + 1) * m)\) where `n` is the length of the array. In the worst case, every possible start index could be checked, each time comparing up to `m` elements `k` times. 
Thus, the complexity is approximately \(O(n \cdot m)\).
