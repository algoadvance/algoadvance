title:  Binary Tree Coloring Game-out
permalink: /s1145
---
In a binary tree, given three colors red, blue, and green, you are playing a game with your friend where you take turns coloring nodes in the tree. Initially, you color a given node `x` with red. Your friend will then color a node with blue, and then you color another node with green.

The game follows these rules:
1. Players alternate turns.
2. Players can only color nodes that aren't colored already.
3. Once a node is colored, all its descendants are locked (cannot be colored in future turns).
4. A player loses if they are unable to make a move.

Given the root of the binary tree and the node `x` you will initially color, determine if your friend can guarantee a win by choosing an optimal strategy.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Is `x` guaranteed to be a valid node within the tree?
2. Can the blue and green nodes be chosen freely by each player, as long as they follow the rules?
3. Should we assume the tree is balanced or could it have any structure?

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Subtrees:**
   - When you pick a node `x` and color it red, your friend has essentially three choices: 
     * the left subtree of `x`
     * the right subtree of `x`
     * the rest of the tree (excluding the subtree rooted at `x`)
     
2. **Count Nodes in Subtrees:**
   - Count the number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of `x`, as well as the remaining nodes in the rest of the tree.

3. **Determine Optimal Strategy for Friend:**
   - Your friend should choose the largest subtree (including the portion outside the x subtree) to maximize their chances.
   - Calculate the size of these parts:
     * If any subtree or the remaining tree has more than half of the total nodes, your friend can win by choosing that part.
     
4. **Decision Making:**
   - The tree is efficiently traversed using Depth-First Search (DFS) to count nodes.

### Code:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def btreeGameWinningMove(self, root: TreeNode, n: int, x: int) -> bool:
        self.left_count = 0
        self.right_count = 0
        
        def count_nodes(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            left = count_nodes(node.left)
            right = count_nodes(node.right)
            if node.val == x:
                self.left_count = left
                self.right_count = right
            return left + right + 1
        
        total_nodes = count_nodes(root)
        
        parent_count = total_nodes - (self.left_count + self.right_count + 1)
        
        # Maximize the number of nodes Blue can color
        max_blue_score = max(self.left_count, self.right_count, parent_count)
        
        # Blue wins if it controls more than half of the total nodes
        return max_blue_score > total_nodes // 2

```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)**: Where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We perform a DFS to count the total number of nodes and identify the size of sub-trees, which takes linear time.

This solution ensures that we can efficiently check if the second player (friend) has a guaranteed winning strategy by analyzing the sizes of the tree's subdivided regions.
