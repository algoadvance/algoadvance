title:  Kth Distinct String in an Array-out
permalink: /s2053
---

The problem is to find the kth distinct string in an array. A distinct string is a string that appears exactly once in the array. You need to return the kth distinct string in the array. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string `""`.

**Example:**
```text
Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
Output: "a"
Explanation: The only distinct strings in the array are "d" and "a". Return "a" since it is the 2nd distinct string.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of the length of the input array `arr`?
   - What is the maximum length of each string in the array?
   - What characters can the strings in the array have (e.g., only lowercase English letters)?

   **Assumptions based on common LeetCode constraints:**
   ```text
   - The length of `arr` is in the range [1, 1000].
   - Each string in `arr` has a length in the range [1, 100].
   - The strings consist of lowercase English letters.
   ```

2. **Output**: 
   - If there are fewer than `k` distinct strings, return `""`.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `k` is larger than the number of distinct strings?
   - What if `arr` has only one element?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, use a dictionary to count the occurrence of each string in the array.
2. **Collect Distinct Strings**: Iterate through the array and collect strings that appear exactly once in the order they first appear.
3. **Find the kth Distinct**: Return the kth distinct string if it exists; otherwise, return an empty string.

### Code

```python
def kthDistinct(arr, k):
    count = {}
    
    # Count the occurrences of each string
    for string in arr:
        if string in count:
            count[string] += 1
        else:
            count[string] = 1
            
    # Collect the distinct strings
    distinct_strings = [string for string in arr if count[string] == 1]
    
    # Return the kth distinct string (1-indexed)
    if k <= len(distinct_strings):
        return distinct_strings[k - 1]
    
    return ""

# Example usage:
arr = ["d", "b", "c", "b", "c", "a"]
k = 2
print(kthDistinct(arr, k))  # Output: "a"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Occurrences**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `arr`. We iterate through the array once to count the occurrences of each string.
- **Collecting Distinct Strings**: O(n), since we again iterate through the array to check which strings have a count of 1.
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(n).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the kth distinct string with clear steps and meets the problem requirements.
