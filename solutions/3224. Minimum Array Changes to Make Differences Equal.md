title:  Minimum Array Changes to Make Differences Equal-out
permalink: /s3224
---

You are given an array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers and an integer `k`. Your task is to make all adjacent differences in the array equal by changing the values of the array. The difference between two adjacent elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` is `nums[i+1] - nums[i]`.

Determine the minimum number of changes required to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`?**
   - Typically, in interview problems like this, arrays can range in length from very small (1-2 elements) to quite large (potentially up to 10^5 elements). The values within `nums` are specified as non-negative integers.

2. **Can elements be changed to any integer value?**
   - Yes, elements can be changed to any integer value.

3. **What constitutes a change?**
   - A change is defined as modifying any element in the array to another integer.

4. **What if the array length is 1?**
   - If the array length is 1, no changes are needed since there are no adjacent pairs.

### Strategy

To make all adjacent differences the same, one efficient strategy involves dynamic programming (DP) combined with the use of a frequency map:

1. **Identify the Adjacent Differences:** First, compute the differences between adjacent elements.
2. **Memoization:** Use a dictionary to track the count of each adjacent difference.
3. **Frequency Analysis:** The most frequently occurring difference will be our target difference.
4. **Adjust as Needed:** Calculate the number of changes needed to make all differences equal to the target difference.

This way, we minimize the number of changes by aligning the differences with the most common existing difference.

### Code

Here's the python implementation to solve the problem:

```python
def min_operations(nums, k):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return 0
    
    n = len(nums)
    diff_count = {}
    
    for i in range(n-1):
        diff = nums[i+1] - nums[i]
        if diff not in diff_count:
            diff_count[diff] = 0
        diff_count[diff] += 1
    
    # Find the most frequent difference
    target_diff = max(diff_count, key=diff_count.get)
    max_freq = diff_count[target_diff]
    
    # Total pairs of adjacent elements
    total_pairs = n - 1
    
    # Changes needed will be total pairs minus the count of pairs having the target difference
    min_changes = total_pairs - max_freq
    
    return min_changes

# Example Usage:
nums = [3, 6, 9, 4]
k = 3
print(min_operations(nums, k))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Differencing and Counting (O(n)):** We iterate through the list of `nums` once, calculating differences and counting their frequencies. This takes O(n) time.
- **Finding Maximum Frequency (O(d)):** The time taken to find the most frequent difference, where `d` is the number of distinct differences (in the worst case `d = n-1`).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, making the solution efficient even for large inputs.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(d) due to the dictionary storing the frequencies of differences. In the worst case, `d` could be n-1, giving us O(n) space complexity.
