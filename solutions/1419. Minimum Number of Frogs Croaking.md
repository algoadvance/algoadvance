title:  Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking-out
permalink: /s1419
---

You are given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the sound of multiple frogs croaking `croak` at the same time. Since multiple frogs can croak at the same time, `croakOfFrogs` can be formed by multiple interleaved sequences of the string `croak`.

Return the minimum number of different frogs to finish all the croakings in the string `croakOfFrogs`. If the string is not a valid combination of croakings, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input string `croakOfFrogs`?**
   - The input string can be relatively long, up to 100,000 characters.

2. **What characters can the input string contain?**
   - The input string contains only the characters from the word `croak`.

3. **Are there any edge cases to consider?**
   - If the string length is not a multiple of 5 or if the sequence is not valid, we should return `-1`.

### Strategy

The strategy here involves tracking the state of multiple frogs through the sequence `croak`. Each character in `croak` must follow the previous character, and any deviation violates the sequence.

1. **Track the states:** Use an array to keep track of the count of characters `croak` at each stage.
2. **Count the number of active frogs:** We maintain a counter for the number of active croaking frogs.
3. **Validate the sequence:** As we traverse the string, we check if the sequence is valid and update the states accordingly.
4. **Final check:** Ensure at the end of the string there are no incomplete croaking sequences.

### Code

Here's the possible Python implementation:

```python
def minNumberOfFrogs(croakOfFrogs: str) -> int:
    if len(croakOfFrogs) % 5 != 0:
        return -1
    
    counts = [0] * 5  # c, r, o, a, k
    croak_index = {'c': 0, 'r': 1, 'o': 2, 'a': 3, 'k': 4}
    current_frogs = 0
    max_frogs = 0
    
    for char in croakOfFrogs:
        index = croak_index[char]
        
        if index == 0:  # Encountering 'c'
            counts[index] += 1
            current_frogs += 1
            max_frogs = max(max_frogs, current_frogs)
        else:
            if counts[index - 1] == 0:
                return -1  # Invalid sequence
            counts[index - 1] -= 1
            counts[index] += 1
            if char == 'k':  # Ending a "croak"
                current_frogs -= 1
                
    if current_frogs != 0:
        return -1  # Incomplete croaking sequence
    
    return max_frogs

# Example usage
print(minNumberOfFrogs("croakcroak"))  # Expected output: 1
print(minNumberOfFrogs("crcoakroak"))  # Expected output: 2
print(minNumberOfFrogs("croakcrook"))  # Expected output: -1
print(minNumberOfFrogs("croakcroa"))   # Expected output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. We only traverse the string once, performing constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we use a fixed-size array and a few variables regardless of the input size.
