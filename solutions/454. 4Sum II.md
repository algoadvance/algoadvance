Given four integer arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` all of length `n`, return the number of tuples `(i, j, k, l)` such that:

- `0 <= i, j, k, l < n`
- `nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the integers in the arrays be negative? 
     - Yes.
   - What is the range of the length `n` of each array?
     - Typically, the problem constraints might be `1 <= n <= 200`.
   
2. **Output:**
   - Return a single integer representing the number of valid tuples `(i, j, k, l)`.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate through all possible tuples (i, j, k, l) and check if the sum of their corresponding values in the arrays equals 0.
   - Time Complexity: \(O(n^4)\), which will be inefficient for larger values of `n` (e.g., if `n = 200`, then \(200^4 = 1.6 \times 10^{10}\) operations).

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - We can reduce the complexity to \(O(n^2)\) using a hash map.
   - Create a hash map to store the sums of all pairs from `nums1` and `nums2` and their counts.
   - Then for each pair in `nums3` and `nums4`, check if the negative of their sum exists in the hash map.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the optimized approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def fourSumCount(nums1, nums2, nums3, nums4):
    count_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Store sums of all pairs from nums1 and nums2
    for a in nums1:
        for b in nums2:
            count_map[a + b] += 1
    
    count = 0
    
    # Check sums of all pairs from nums3 and nums4
    for c in nums3:
        for d in nums4:
            target = -(c + d)
            if target in count_map:
                count += count_map[target]
    
    return count

# Example usage
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [-2, -1]
nums3 = [-1, 2]
nums4 = [0, 2]
print(fourSumCount(nums1, nums2, nums3, nums4))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Step:** 
  - Storing sums of pairs `(a+b)` in `count_map` from `nums1` and `nums2` takes \(O(n^2)\).
- **Query Step:** 
  - Checking sums of pairs `(c+d)` from `nums3` and `nums4` against `count_map` also takes \(O(n^2)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\).

This approach leverages hash map lookups for efficient counting and ensures we can handle larger inputs more effectively.
