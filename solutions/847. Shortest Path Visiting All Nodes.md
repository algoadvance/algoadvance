title:  Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes-out
permalink: /s847
---

The problem is: 

You have an undirected, connected graph of \( n \) nodes labeled from \( 0 \) to \( n - 1 \). You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i` by an edge. 

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, and you may revisit nodes multiple times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any cycles in the graph?**
   - The graph is undirected and connected, so there can be cycles.
   
2. **Can the graph be disconnected?**
   - No, the graph is connected as per the problem statement.
   
3. **What's the size constraint for `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` can be as large as 12, but handling cases around this constraint efficiently is crucial.
   
4. **Is the graph symmetric?**
   - Yes, since the graph is undirected, if `a` is connected to `b`, then `b` is also connected to `a`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) with bitmasking to keep track of visited nodes. The detailed strategy is:

1. **Bitmask Representation**: Use a bitmask to represent the set of visited nodes. If `n = 4`, and nodes `0` and `2` are visited, we represent this state as `0101` in binary (or `5` in decimal).

2. **BFS Traversal**: Perform BFS, starting from all nodes simultaneously. Each state in the BFS queue will be represented by a tuple `(current_node, visited_mask)`, where:
   - `current_node` is the current node.
   - `visited_mask` is the bitmask representing the set of visited nodes.

3. **Check Completion**: During BFS, if the `visited_mask` equals `2^n - 1` (which means all nodes are visited), we return the number of steps taken.

4. **Tracking States**: Use a set to track already visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def shortestPathLength(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    
    # All nodes have been visited when visited_mask == goal_mask
    goal_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    
    # Queue for BFS: (current_node, visited_bitmask, step_count)
    queue = deque((i, 1 << i, 0) for i in range(n))
    
    # Set to keep track of visited states (current_node, visited_bitmask)
    visited = set((i, 1 << i) for i in range(n))
    
    while queue:
        current, visited_mask, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        # If all nodes are visited, return the number of steps.
        if visited_mask == goal_mask:
            return steps
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            new_mask = visited_mask | (1 << neighbor)
            if (neighbor, new_mask) not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, new_mask, steps + 1))
                visited.add((neighbor, new_mask))
    
    return -1  # Just a fallback, although the problem guarantees a solution.

```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:

- **State Space**: There are \( n \) nodes and \( 2^n \) possible bitmasks representing the visited states. Therefore, the total state space is \( O(n \times 2^n) \).
  
- **BFS Steps**: In the worst case, we might need to process each state, and each state can enqueue new states proportional to \( n \).

So, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2 \times 2^n)**, but this should be efficient for \( n \leq 12 \).
