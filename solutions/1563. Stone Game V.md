### Problem Statement:
Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones. There are an even number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to maximize the number of stones Alex can get. Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first. However, the twist in this particular problem (1563. Stone Game V) can be summarized as follows:

1. Alex and Lee can only collect stones from the extreme ends of the row.
2. They continue until there are no more stones left to collect.
3. Both players play optimally.

Return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are the number of stones in each pile always positive integers?
2. What are the constraints on the number of piles (`n`)? This helps to determine the most efficient approach.
3. Since both players are playing optimally, are there any specific strategies both players are adhering to?

### Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score Alex can achieve for the subarray starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`.
   - Base case: when the subarray length is 1 (i.e., `i == j`), Alex can only take the single pile.
   - Transition: Alex can choose the left or right pile and the remaining subproblem is reduced. The problem can be split into considering both players' optimal moves.
   
2. **Minimax Strategy**:
   - Use memoization to store previously computed results of the subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
   - Consider the recursive nature of the problem and optimal substructure.

### Code Implementation:

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def stoneGameV(piles):
    n = len(piles)
    # Prefix sums to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + piles[i]

    # dp[i][j] will be the maximum score Alex can get from subarray piles[i:j+1]
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Function to get subarray sum
    def get_sum(i, j):
        return prefix_sums[j + 1] - prefix_sums[i]
    
    # Fill the dp array
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # subarray lengths from 2 to n
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            max_score = 0
            for k in range(i, j):
                left_sum = get_sum(i, k)
                right_sum = get_sum(k + 1, j)
                if left_sum > right_sum:
                    max_score = max(max_score, right_sum + dp[k + 1][j])
                elif left_sum < right_sum:
                    max_score = max(max_score, left_sum + dp[i][k])
                else:
                    max_score = max(max_score, left_sum + dp[i][k], right_sum + dp[k + 1][j])
            dp[i][j] = max_score

    # Our answer will be the maximum score Alex can get from the whole array
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Example usage
piles = [6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]
print(stoneGameV(piles))  # Output should be the maximum stones Alex can collect
```

### Time Complexity:
- Constructing the prefix sums takes O(n) time.
- Filling the DP table involves considering all subarrays of different lengths. This can be done in O(n^3) in the worst case due to the nested loops:
  - The outer `length` loop runs O(n) times.
  - The `i` loop also runs O(n) times.
  - The `k` loop runs in proportion to the subarray length, hence O(n) in the worse case.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^3).
