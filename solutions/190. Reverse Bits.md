Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Example 1:**

Input: `00000010100101000001111010011100` (binary representation of 43261596)  
Output: `00111001011110000010100101000000` (binary representation of 964176192)  
Explanation: The input binary string `00000010100101000001111010011100` represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is `00111001011110000010100101000000`.

**Example 2:**

Input: `11111111111111111111111111111101` (binary representation of 4294967293)  
Output: `10111111111111111111111111111111` (binary representation of 3221225471)  
Explanation: The input binary string `11111111111111111111111111111101` represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is `10111111111111111111111111111111`.

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.

- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in **Example 2** above the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always 32 bits?**
   - Yes, the input is always a fixed-width 32-bit unsigned integer.

2. **Can the input integer be negative?**
   - No, the problem specifies the input is an unsigned integer, so it is always non-negative.

3. **Is there a need to handle input and output in formats other than integers?**
   - No, input and output are to be handled as integers, even though the problem describes them in binary for clarity.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Output**: Start with a result variable set to 0.
2. **Iterate Over Bits**: Iterate over each bit position from 0 to 31:
   - Extract the least significant bit (LSB) from the input number.
   - Append this bit to the result by shifting the result left and adding the extracted bit.
   - Right shift the input number to process the next bit.
3. **Return Result**: After processing all bits, return the reversed result.

This approach directly manipulates the bits using bitwise operations which is efficient and easy to understand.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(32):
            # Extract the LSB of n
            bit = n & 1
            # Shift result left and add the bit
            result = (result << 1) | bit
            # Shift n right to process the next bit
            n >>= 1
        return result
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - This is because the number of operations is fixed at 32, regardless of the input value. We always loop exactly 32 times.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The memory usage does not grow with the input size, only a few integer variables are used.

This solution should efficiently handle the reversal of all 32 bits in a fixed time.
