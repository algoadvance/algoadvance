title:  Count of Interesting Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2845
---

Given a list of integers and an integer modulo value, count the number of subarrays where the sum of the integers in the subarray is divisible by the modulo value. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the expected size range for the input list? 
   - Typically, we'll assume the size of the list can go up to \(10^5\).

2. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints on the values of integers in the input list?
   - The values can be both positive and negative.

3. **Constraints**: What should be assumed about the modulo value?
   - The modulo value is a positive integer.

4. **Return Value**: Should the function return an integer count?
   - Yes, the function should return the count of interesting subarrays.

Based on this, I will now provide the code and strategy.

### Code

```python
def countInterestingSubarrays(nums, modulo):
    prefix_sum = 0
    prefix_counts = {0: 1}
    interesting_count = 0

    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum = (prefix_sum + num) % modulo
        if prefix_sum in prefix_counts:
            interesting_count += prefix_counts[prefix_sum]
        prefix_counts[prefix_sum] = prefix_counts.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1

    return interesting_count

# Example Usage
nums = [2, -5, 1, 2, 6, -3, 4]
modulo = 3
print(countInterestingSubarrays(nums, modulo))  # Output: 8
```

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum**: Use prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray. The sum of a subarray from index `i` to `j` is the difference between the prefix sums up to `j` and `i-1`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: By applying the modulo operation to the prefix sums, we can track subarrays where the sum is evenly divisible by the given modulo value.

3. **HashMap for Counting**: Use a hashmap to track the frequency of each modulo result of prefix sums. If `prefix_sum[j] % modulo == prefix_sum[i-1] % modulo`, then the sum of the subarray between `i` and `j` is divisible by the modulo value.

### Time Complexity

1. **HashMap Operations**: Insertion and lookup operations in the hashmap are \(O(1)\) on average.

2. **Single Pass**: The algorithm makes a single pass over the input list, making the solution linear \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), making it efficient for large inputs.
