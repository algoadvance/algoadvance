title:  Make Number of Distinct Characters Equal-out
permalink: /s2531

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You need to return `true` if you can swap the characters of `word1` and `word2` such that both strings have the same number of distinct characters. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** What is the maximum length for `word1` and `word2`?
   - **Answer:** Typically, in interview scenarios there is no explicit maximum length, but for coding challenges, assume reasonable constraints, such as lengths up to `10^4`.

2. **Question:** Are the strings composed only of lowercase English letters?
   - **Answer:** Yes, the problem implicitly assumes this, but it is good to confirm.

3. **Question:** Can `word1` or `word2` be empty?
   - **Answer:** Explicitly handling empty string cases might be necessary, but typically, edge cases should be handled based on the problem constraints (in this scenario, assume non-empty strings unless stated otherwise).

## Strategy

1. **Step 1:** Calculate the distinct character counts for both `word1` and `word2`.
2. **Step 2:** Check the character composition and possible swaps that maintain string validity.
3. **Step 3:** Based on the checks, determine if swapping yields two strings with an equal number of distinct characters.

## Code

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the solution:

```python
def make_strings_equal(word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter

    # Get distinct character counts
    count1 = Counter(word1)
    count2 = Counter(word2)
    
    # Get the number of distinct characters
    distinct1 = len(count1)
    distinct2 = len(count2)
    
    # If already equal, return True
    if distinct1 == distinct2:
        return True
    
    # Create sets of characters for quick access
    set1 = set(word1)
    set2 = set(word2)
    
    for char1 in set1:
        for char2 in set2:
            # Calculate new distinct counts if we hypothetically swap these characters
            new_count1 = Counter(word1.replace(char1, char2))
            new_count2 = Counter(word2.replace(char2, char1))
            
            new_distinct1 = len(new_count1)
            new_distinct2 = len(new_count2)
            
            if new_distinct1 == new_distinct2:
                return True

    return False

# Example usage
word1 = "ab"
word2 = "cd"
print(make_strings_equal(word1, word2))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting distinct characters:** \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`.
- **Nested loop for swaps:** \(O(k \times l)\), where \(k\) and \(l\) are the number of unique characters in `word1` and `word2`. Note that \(k, l \leq 26\) (number of possible distinct lowercase English letters).

The overall complexity mainly hinges on distinct character operations, making this approach efficient given reasonable constraints.

## Final Note

The provided solution checks for the possibility of character swaps that might equalize the number of distinct characters in both strings. It offers a comprehensive approach to evaluating such transformations based on distinct character counts and practical condition handling.
