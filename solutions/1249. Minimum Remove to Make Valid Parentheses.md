title:  Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses-out
permalink: /s1249
---

Given a string `s` of `(`, `)`, and lowercase English characters, your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses (either `(` or `)`, in any positions) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

A string is considered valid if:
1. It is an empty string, contains only lowercase letters, or
2. It can be written as `AB`, where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
3. It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, the input string can be empty.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - The length of the string can be up to 10^5.

3. **Do we need to consider characters other than `(`, `)`, and lowercase English letters?**
   - No, the string only contains these characters.

### Strategy

1. **First Pass (Left to Right):** 
   - Traverse the string from left to right to identify and flag `)` without matching `(`.
   
2. **Second Pass (Right to Left):**
   - Traverse the string from right to left to identify and flag `(` without matching `)`.
   
3. **Construct Result:**
   - Use the flags from the above passes to construct the result string with minimal removals.

### Code

```python
def minRemoveToMakeValid(s: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: First pass to remove unnecessary `)`
    open_stack = []
    s = list(s)
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            open_stack.append(i)
        elif s[i] == ')':
            if open_stack:
                open_stack.pop()
            else:
                s[i] = ''  # Mark invalid `)`
    
    # Step 2: Clear remaining unmatched `(` from the stack
    while open_stack:
        s[open_stack.pop()] = ''
    
    # Step 3: Construct and return the final valid string
    return ''.join(s)

# Example usage
print(minRemoveToMakeValid("lee(t(c)o)de)"))  # Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
print(minRemoveToMakeValid("a)b(c)d"))        # Output: "ab(c)d"
print(minRemoveToMakeValid("))(("))           # Output: ""
print(minRemoveToMakeValid("(a(b(c)d)"))      # Output: "a(b(c)d)"
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm performs two linear scans of the string, one from left to right and one from right to left.
- Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the stack and list operations.
