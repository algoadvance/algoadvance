title:  Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls-out
permalink: /s1467
---

Given two boxes with the same number of distinct balls, and each box containing at least one ball, calculate the probability that these two boxes will end up with the same distinct numbers of balls when the balls are randomly distributed into the two boxes.

You are given an array of integers `balls` where `balls[i]` is the number of balls of the ith color. You should return the probability as a string in the format of scientific notation accurate to at least five decimal places.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints?**
   - The number of balls does not exceed 8.
   - Number of distinct colors does not exceed 50.

2. **Output Format?**
   - The answer must be in the format of a string representing a floating-point number in scientific notation accurate to five decimal places.

3. **Is full partitioning required in both boxes?**
   - Yes, each ball must be placed in one of the two boxes without any leftover.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
    - We need to create two groups out of balls such that both have the same number of distinct balls and calculate the probability of such an arrangement.

2. **Dynamic Programming / Backtracking Approach:**
    - Use DFS with memoization to explore all possible ways to distribute balls into two boxes.
    - Count valid distributions where both boxes have the same distinct number of colors.

3. **Mathematical Representation:**
    - Ensure that each distribution is balanced in terms of the count of distinct colors.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
    - The result is the number of valid distributions divided by the total number of distributions.

5. **Implementation Steps:**
    - Implement a recursive function to distribute balls.
    - Count valid distributions and total ways for the probability calculation.

### Code
Here is the detailed code for solving the problem:

```python
from math import comb
from functools import lru_cache

def getProbability(balls):
    n = len(balls)
    total_balls = sum(balls)
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(i, box1, box2, distinct1, distinct2):
        if i == n:
            if box1 == box2 and distinct1 == distinct2:
                return 1, 1
            else:
                return 0, 1
        
        valid_counts = 0
        total_counts = 0
        for k in range(balls[i] + 1):
            new_distinct1 = distinct1 + (1 if k > 0 else 0)
            new_distinct2 = distinct2 + (1 if (balls[i] - k) > 0 else 0)
            valid, total = dfs(i + 1, box1 + k, box2 + (balls[i] - k), new_distinct1, new_distinct2)
            valid_counts += valid * comb(balls[i], k)
            total_counts += total * comb(balls[i], k)
        return valid_counts, total_counts

    valid, total = dfs(0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    return "{:0.5e}".format(valid / total)

# Example Usage
balls = [2, 1, 1]
print(getProbability(balls))
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^sum(balls)) given the state-space with consideration to multiple ball choices per color.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * sum(balls)) due to memoization storage.

This approach should be efficient given the constraints of the problem and ensures that we traverse each possible state with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
