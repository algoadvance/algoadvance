title:  Minimum Additions to Make Valid String-out
permalink: /s2645
---

You are given a string `word` that consists of lowercase English letters. You need to determine the minimum number of characters you must add to `word` to make it a valid string.

A valid string is defined as a string where every character appears the same number of times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length of the string `word`?
    - Can the string be empty?

2. **Output Constraints:**
    - Are there any specific constraints on time or space complexity?

3. **Character Set:**
    - Do we only consider lowercase English letters?

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Frequency Count:** 
    - Calculate the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Find Target Frequency:**
    - Determine the target frequency, which would be the maximum occurring character frequency. This is because a valid string needs to have the maximum repetition minimized by adding minimal characters.
3. **Calculate Minimum Additions:**
    - Sum the difference between the target frequency and the current frequency for characters that are less frequent than the target frequency.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def min_additions_for_valid_string(word: str) -> int:
    if not word:
        return 0
    
    # Step 1: Calculate frequencies of each character
    char_count = Counter(word)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the most frequent character count
    max_frequency = max(char_count.values())
    
    # Step 3: Calculate minimum additions required
    additions = 0
    for frequency in char_count.values():
        additions += max_frequency - frequency
    
    return additions

# Example usage:
word = "aabbcc"
print(min_additions_for_valid_string(word))  # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string `word`. This is because we:
1. Calculate character frequencies in \(O(n)\).
2. Find the maximum frequency among characters in \(O(1)\) since the operation involves a fixed set of 26 lowercase letters.
3. Calculate the total minimum additions in \(O(1)\) for the same reason.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\). The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since the frequency counter stores at most 26 entries for lowercase English letters.
