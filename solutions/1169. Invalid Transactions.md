title:  Invalid Transactions-out

A transaction is invalid if:

1. The amount exceeds $1000, or;
2. If it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.

You are given a list of strings `transactions` where each string `transactions[i]` consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the transactions?**
   - Each transaction is in the following format: "name,time,amount,city"

2. **Are the transactions sorted by time or any other criteria?**
   - No, transactions are not necessarily sorted.

3. **How to handle transactions with the same timing and city?**
   - Even if they have the same timing and city, if they differ by name and/or amount, we still consider them.

4. **What is the range of inputs?**
   - There's no fixed limit mentioned for the length of the transactions list, but the approach should consider the efficiency to handle multiple transactions.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Input:**
   - Split each transaction into components: name, time, amount, and city.
   - Store these in a list of tuples for easier comparison and sorting.

2. **Identify Invalid Transactions:**
   - Iterate through the transactions.
   - Check if the amount exceeds $1000.
   - Use a nested loop to find other transactions with the same name within 60 minutes in different cities.

3. **Use Data Structures:**
   - A dictionary to map names to their respective transactions for easier lookup.
   - This way, we can quickly find and compare transactions by the same person.

4. **Compile Results:**
   - Collect all invalid transactions and return them.

### Code

```python
def invalidTransactions(transactions):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Parse transactions into a usable form
    parsed_transactions = []  # each entry will be (name, time, amount, city, original)
    for transaction in transactions:
        name, time, amount, city = transaction.split(',')
        parsed_transactions.append((name, int(time), int(amount), city, transaction))
    
    # Dictionary to collect transactions by name
    name_to_transactions = defaultdict(list)

    # Categorize transactions by name
    for trans in parsed_transactions:
        name_to_transactions[trans[0]].append(trans)
    
    # To store invalid transactions
    invalid = set()

    # Check for invalid transactions
    for name, trans_list in name_to_transactions.items():
        for i, t1 in enumerate(trans_list):
            if t1[2] > 1000:
                invalid.add(t1[4])
            for j in range(len(trans_list)):
                if i != j:
                    t2 = trans_list[j]
                    if abs(t1[1] - t2[1]) <= 60 and t1[3] != t2[3]:
                        invalid.add(t1[4])
                        invalid.add(t2[4])

    return list(invalid)

# Example usage
transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
print(invalidTransactions(transactions))  # Output: []
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n^2)** where `n` is the number of transactions. This is because for each transaction, we potentially compare it with every other transaction for the same name, leading to a nested loop structure.

- Parsing transactions: **O(n)**
- Categorizing by names: **O(n)**
- Checking for invalid transactions: **O(n^2)** for the nested comparisons

Overall, this can handle most practical sizes of input efficiently, though for very large inputs optimizations might be necessary.
