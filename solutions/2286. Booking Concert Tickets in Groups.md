title:  Booking Concert Tickets in Groups-out
permalink: /s2286

This is a problem (#2286) from LeetCode where you need to design a system for booking concert tickets in groups.

**Detailed Statement:**
You have a concert hall with `n` seats. Each seat belongs to one row. You are given a range of queries where each query is asking to book `k` consecutive seats in a specified row if possible. If it's not possible to book consecutive seats, you should return `False`.

Your task is to implement the `BookingTicketSystem` class:

1. `BookingTicketSystem(int n, int m)`: Initializes the object with `n` rows and `m` seats per row.
2. `bool book_seats(int row, int k)`: Returns `True` if `k` consecutive seats can be booked in the specified row, otherwise returns `False`.
3. `int[] available_seats()`: Returns the number of available seats in each row.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the row and seat numbers 1-indexed or 0-indexed?
2. Can we assume all queries will have valid row numbers within the range?
3. How should we handle edge cases like asking for more seats than available in a row?

Assuming:
- The rows and seats are 1-indexed.
- All queries will have valid row numbers within the range.
- You should return `False` if more seats are requested than available in a row.

Let's proceed to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
    - We initialize a 2D list (or dictionary) to maintain the status of seats in each row.

2. **Booking Seats**:
    - For each booking request, we check if there are `k` consecutive seats available in the specified row.
    - If available, we mark these seats as booked and return `True`.
    - Otherwise, we return `False`.

3. **Available Seats**:
    - This method checks the number of available (unbooked) seats in each row and returns a list indicating the same.

## Code

```python
class BookingTicketSystem:
    def __init__(self, n: int, m: int):
        self.rows = n
        self.seats_per_row = m
        self.seats = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]  # False means the seat is available
    
    def book_seats(self, row: int, k: int) -> bool:
        row -= 1  # Adjust for 0-indexed row
        if row < 0 or row >= self.rows:
            return False
        
        consecutive_count = 0
        for i in range(self.seats_per_row):
            if self.seats[row][i] == False:
                consecutive_count += 1
                if consecutive_count == k:
                    # Mark these k seats as booked
                    for j in range(i - k + 1, i + 1):
                        self.seats[row][j] = True
                    return True
            else:
                consecutive_count = 0  # Reset the count if a booked seat is found
        
        return False  # Not enough consecutive seats found
    
    def available_seats(self) -> list:
        available_counts = []
        for row in self.seats:
            available_counts.append(row.count(False))
        return available_counts
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    - The time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\) due to the creation of the 2D list with all seats set to `False`.

2. **Booking Seats (`book_seats`)**:
    - The time complexity is \(O(m)\) in the worst case, where `m` is the number of seats in a row, as we may need to traverse through all the seats in a row to check for consecutive availability.

3. **Available Seats (`available_seats`)**:
    - The time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\) as it involves counting the number of `False` seats (available seats) in each row.

This solution should efficiently handle booking and availability queries within the provided constraints.
