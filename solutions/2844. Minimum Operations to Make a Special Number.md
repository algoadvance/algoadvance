title:  Minimum Operations to Make a Special Number-out
permalink: /s2844
---

You are given a string `num` representing a non-negative integer. `num` can have leading zeros. The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make it a "special number." A "special number" is defined as a number that's divisible by 25. 

An operation consists of either removing a digit from the string or leaving it as is. You cannot change the order of the digits. You can, however, remove any digits you need to.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `num` a "special number."

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string `num`?**
   - The string `num` can have a length up to 10^5.

2. **Can the string have all zeros?**
   - Yes, since leading zeros are allowed, it could potentially be all zeros.

3. **Should we ensure the final number has no leading zeros?**
   - Yes, the final "special number" should be a valid number and hence should not have leading zeros unless the number itself is 0.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Possible Patterns**: Numbers divisible by 25 end in either '00', '25', '50', or '75'.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We will use a two-pointer approach to find the minimum deletions needed to make the number end in one of the above patterns.
3. **Traverse and Compare**: For each possible pair (pattern) calculate the deletions required and take the minimum across all possible pairs.

### Code
```python
def min_operations_to_special_number(num: str) -> int:
    patterns = ["00", "25", "50", "75"]
    
    def min_deletions_to_form_pattern(num, pattern):
        p_index = len(pattern) - 1
        i = len(num) - 1
        deletions = 0
        
        while i >= 0:
            if num[i] == pattern[p_index]:
                p_index -= 1
                if p_index < 0:
                    break
            else:
                deletions += 1
            i -= 1
        
        if p_index >= 0:
            return float('inf')
        
        return deletions
    
    min_deletions = float('inf')
    for pattern in patterns:
        min_deletions = min(min_deletions, min_deletions_to_form_pattern(num, pattern))
    
    return min_deletions

# Example usage:
print(min_operations_to_special_number("2908305"))  # Output should be minimum deletions to get number ending with '25' or '50', etc.
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Patterns Identification**: We look for the patterns "00", "25", "50", "75".
2. **Helper Function**: Define a helper function `min_deletions_to_form_pattern(num, pattern)` to calculate the minimum deletions required for each pattern.
    - Initialize pointers for both `num` and `pattern`.
    - Use a backward search from the end of the string to the start.
    - Count deletions until the pattern can be formed.
3. **Minimum Across Patterns**: Iterate over all valid patterns and record the minimum deletions required to form any of the "special numbers."

### Time Complexity

- **Helper Function**: The helper function `min_deletions_to_form_pattern` has a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string `num`.
- **Overall Complexity**: Given that we are checking 4 patterns, the total time complexity is O(4 * n) = O(n).

This efficient linear time complexity should be suitable for the input constraints, making the algorithm robust for large input sizes.
