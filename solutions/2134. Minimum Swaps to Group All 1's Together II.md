title:  Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II-out
permalink: /s2134
---

You are given a binary array `data` where `data[i]` is either `0` or `1`. We want to arrange all the `1's` into a single contiguous segment of `1's`. You are allowed to make any number of swaps between any two elements in the array.

Return the minimum number of swaps needed to group all the `1's` together in any place in the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the sequence wrap around the array (i.e., is it circular)?**
   - Yes, the problem involves circular array considerations.

2. **What is the expected input size?**
   - Typically, binary arrays with lengths ranging from \(1 \leq data.length \leq 10^5\).

3. **What should the function return if there are no `1`s in the array?**
   - The function should return `0` in that case.

## Strategy

Given the nature of this problem, we can employ a sliding window strategy with a focus on the circular array property:

1. **Count all `1`s in the array:** This gives us the required window size that needs to be filled with ones.
2. **Sliding Window over the Circular Array:** Use a sliding window of the size equal to the count of `1`s and slide it across the array accounting for the circular behavior.
3. **Track the number of `1`s within the current window:** The goal is to find the window with the maximum number of `1`s, because the fewer `1`s within this segment, the more swaps would be required.
4. **Calculate Minimum Swaps:** The minimum number of swaps required will be the total `1`s count minus the maximum `1`s found in any window.

## Code

Let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def minSwaps(data):
    total_ones = sum(data)
    if total_ones == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Extend data to simulate circular array with wrap-around
    extended_data = data + data[:total_ones-1]
    
    # Initial count of 1's in the first window of length `total_ones`
    current_ones = sum(extended_data[:total_ones])
    
    max_ones_in_window = current_ones
    
    for i in range(total_ones, len(extended_data)):
        current_ones += extended_data[i] - extended_data[i - total_ones]
        max_ones_in_window = max(max_ones_in_window, current_ones)
    
    return total_ones - max_ones_in_window

# Example Usage:
data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
print(minSwaps(data))  # Expected output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the `data` array. This is because we traverse the array to count the `1`s initially and then use a sliding window over an array of size \(2n-1\).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the creation of the extended array for circular sliding window simulation.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum swaps required to group all `1`s together in a circular array context.
