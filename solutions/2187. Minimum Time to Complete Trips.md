title:  Minimum Time to Complete Trips-out
permalink: /s2187
---

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the time taken by the \(i^{th}\) bus to complete a trip. Each bus can make multiple trips successively. 

Return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips in total.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= time.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= time[i], totalTrips <= 10^7`

2. **Output:**
   - We need to return a single integer representing the minimum time required.

3. **Example:**
   ```python
   time = [1, 2, 3]
   totalTrips = 5
   # Expected output: 3
   ```

4. **Clarifications:**
   - Can each bus make more than one trip? Yes, buses can make multiple trips successively.
   - Is the total time assuming that multiple buses can run concurrently? Yes, they can run concurrently.
   
Given these points, we can move on to formulating a strategy.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the minimum time required.

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - We need to find the minimum time `T` such that the sum of the number of trips made by all buses at time `T` is at least `totalTrips`.
   - For a given time \( T \), we can calculate the number of trips made by each bus using \( \text{floor}(T / \text{time}[i]) \).

2. **Bounds for Binary Search:**
   - Lower bound (`left`): 1 (minimum time to start).
   - Upper bound (`right`): \( \max(\text{time}) \times \text{totalTrips} \), assuming the worst case where only the slowest bus is working to meet the trip count.

3. **Check Feasibility:**
   - For each mid-point in our binary search, compute the total number of trips by:
   ```python
   totalTripsMade = sum(mid // busTime for busTime in time)
   ```
   - If `totalTripsMade` is at least `totalTrips`, then we might have found a potential minimum, and we try with a smaller time; otherwise, we need more time.

### Code

Now let's implement this strategy in code:

```python
def minimumTime(time, totalTrips):
    def canComplete(totalTime):
        return sum(totalTime // t for t in time) >= totalTrips
    
    left, right = 1, max(time) * totalTrips
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canComplete(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Example usage:
time = [1, 2, 3]
totalTrips = 5
print(minimumTime(time, totalTrips))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for checking if a specific time can complete the required trips is \(O(n)\), where \( n \) is the length of the `time` array.
- The binary search will run in \(O(\log(max(time) \times \text{totalTrips}))\) iterations.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is:

\[ O(n \log(\max(\text{time}) \times \text{totalTrips})) \]
