title:  Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order-out
permalink: /s1839
---

We are given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters. A substring is considered to be a "vowel substring" if it contains each of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in the given order and each vowel appears at least once in the substring. We need to return the length of the longest vowel substring. If there is no such substring, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the `word`?**
   - The length of the `word` will be between 1 and 10^5.
   
2. **How should we handle substrings that do not contain all the vowels in order?**
   - Such substrings should be ignored.

3. **Does the problem need the substring to contain consecutive vowels, or can there be other characters in between?**
   - The vowels need not be consecutive, but they must occur in the order 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' without skipping or reordering any vowels.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
    - Initialize variables to keep track of the longest valid substring's length.
    - Initialize pointers and counters for managing the current substring.

2. **Traversal**:
    - Iterate over each character in the string.
    - Use state variables to track how many of each required vowel we've encountered in the correct order.

3. **State Management**:
    - Ensure the current character respects the order of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
    - If a character breaks the order, reset the counters to start a new potential substring.

4. **Update Longest Length**:
    - Whenever a valid vowel substring (containing all vowels in order) is found, check its length, and update the maximum length if it's longer than previously recorded.

5. **Edge Cases**:
    - Consider strings that don't contain all vowels.
    - Handle edge cases like very short strings.

## Code

```python
def longestBeautifulSubstring(word: str) -> int:
    longest_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    current_vowel_set = set()
    vowels = "aeiou"
    current_vowel_index = 0

    i = 0
    while i < len(word):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            # Check if we are progressing in vowel order correctly
            if current_vowel_index < len(vowels) and word[i] == vowels[current_vowel_index]:
                current_vowel_set.add(word[i])
                current_length += 1
            elif word[i] == vowels[current_vowel_index-1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                # If the order is broken, reset the counters
                if word[i] == 'a':
                    current_length = 1
                    current_vowel_set = {'a'}
                    current_vowel_index = 0
                else:
                    current_vowel_set.clear()
                    current_length = 0
                    current_vowel_index = 0

            # Move to the next vowel in sequence if current vowel is correct and all previous have been seen
            if len(current_vowel_set) == current_vowel_index + 1:
                current_vowel_index += 1

            # If all vowels present, update the longest length
            if current_vowel_index == len(vowels):
                longest_length = max(longest_length, current_length)
        else:
            # Reset if a non-vowel character is encountered
            current_length = 0
            current_vowel_set.clear()
            current_vowel_index = 0

        i += 1

    return longest_length

# Example usage:
print(longestBeautifulSubstring("aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"))
```

## Time Complexity

The solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input `word`. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once in a single pass. The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a constant amount of extra space for counters and sets.
