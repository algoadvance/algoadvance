title:  Count Valid Paths in a Tree-out
permalink: /s2867

We will solve the Leetcode problem 2867 titled "Count Valid Paths in a Tree." The problem description is as follows:

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and exactly `n-1` edges.

A valid path in the tree is a path that starts at any node and ends at any leaf node.

Given the number of nodes `n` and the edges, return the number of valid paths in the tree.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range:** What are the minimum and maximum values for `n`?
   - Typically, for tree problems, `n` ranges from 1 to very large values like $10^5$ to $10^6$.

2. **Output Definition:** What is considered a valid path?
   - A valid path is any path that starts at any node and ends at a leaf node. A leaf node is a node with only one connection (degree 1), except when it is the root.

3. **Edge Cases:** Are single-node trees considered in the input?
   - Yes, in such cases, the single node is both the root and a leaf, making it the only valid path.

## Strategy
1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Construct the tree using an adjacency list representation for efficient traversal.

2. **Leaf Identification:**
   - Identify all leaf nodes in the tree (nodes with a degree of 1).

3. **DFS/BFS Traversal:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to count the possible paths from the root to all leaf nodes.

4. **Path Counting:**
   - Since any node to any leaf node path is valid, we can consider paths from non-leaf nodes to leaf nodes as valid paths.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The solution needs to efficiently handle up to large values of n, ensuring O(n) complexity for construction and traversal.

## Code

Here is a straightforward implementation using an adjacency list and counting paths to leaf nodes:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_valid_paths(n, edges):
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # Only one node means one valid path (the node itself)

    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # Identify leaf nodes
    leaf_nodes = {node for node in range(n) if len(graph[node]) == 1}

    # BFS/DFS to count paths to leaf nodes
    def bfs_count_paths(root):
        visited = [False] * n
        queue = deque([root])
        visited[root] = True
        path_count = 0

        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node in leaf_nodes:
                path_count += 1
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append(neighbor)

        return path_count

    # Choose any node as the root (0 is chosen here) and count paths to leaves
    root = 0
    path_count = bfs_count_paths(root)

    return path_count

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
print(count_valid_paths(n, edges))  # Output should be the number of valid paths
```

## Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction:** O(n) given that there are n-1 edges.
- **BFS/DFS Traversal:** O(n) since each node and edge is visited once.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n)

This ensures the solution is efficient and handles large trees within reasonable time limits.
