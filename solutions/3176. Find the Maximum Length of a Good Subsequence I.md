title:  Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence I-out
permalink: /s3176
---

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, your task is to find the maximum length of a good subsequence. A subsequence is called **good** if it can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence without changing the relative positions of the same elements it contains.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the integers in the array?**
    - Typically constrained by the problem or example data. Let's assume they are within a reasonable range for typical integer operations.

2. **What constitutes a good subsequence specifically?**
    - A good subsequence rearranged should maintain the relative positions of identical elements and must form a non-decreasing sequence.
    
3. **Are we allowed to use any kind of additional data structures like sets or dictionaries?**
    - Yes, within typical constraints of memory usage and processing time.

### Strategy

1. **Understand What Constitutes a Good Subsequence:**
    - A subsequence that can be rearranged into a non-decreasing sequence without altering the relative positions of identical elements.

2. **Frequency Count:**
    - Use a dictionary or a Counter to count the frequency of each element in `nums`.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Good Subsequence Length:**
    - For each integer (key) in the frequency dictionary:
        - The maximum number of this integer we can take is the minimum between its count and the number of distinct elements before this integer including itself.
   
4. **Implementation:**
    - Sort the unique elements of the array.
    - Use a combination of a loop and comparisons to accurately determine the maximum length.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def max_length_of_good_subsequence(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    freq = Counter(nums)
    unique_elements = sorted(freq.keys())
    
    good_subseq_length = 0
    current_distinct_count = 0
    
    for elem in unique_elements:
        current_distinct_count += 1
        good_subseq_length += min(freq[elem], current_distinct_count)
    
    return good_subseq_length
```

### Explanation:

1. **Frequency Count:**
   - We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in `nums`.
   
2. **Sort Unique Elements:**
   - We sort the unique elements to process them in non-decreasing order.
   
3. **Calculate Maximum Length:**
   - We keep a counter `current_distinct_count` to keep track of distinct elements processed so far.
   - For each element in the sorted unique elements, add to the length of the good subsequence the smaller of the frequency of the element or the number of distinct elements seen so far.
   - This ensures we are adhering to the rules of forming a non-decreasing sequence with the constraints given.

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Counting:** \( O(n) \) where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Sorting:** \( O(k \log k) \) where `k` is the number of unique elements in `nums`.
- **Looping through Unique Elements:** \( O(k) \).

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n + k \log k) \).

This ensures efficient handling even for reasonably large arrays, making this approach suitable for a variety of practical application scenarios.
