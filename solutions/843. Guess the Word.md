title:  Guess the Word-out

You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend:

1. You write down a secret word `secret`.
2. Your friend tries to guess the word by providing guesses, and you give feedback for each guess. Your feedback tells your friend how many characters in the guess match characters in the secret word with the exact positions (called "bulls").

The game ends when your friend guesses the secret word.

Here's a method to simulate the process:

```python
class Master:
    def guess(self, word: str) -> int:
        # The guess function provided by the game environment
        pass
```

You want to use the `Master` class to guess the `secret` word. The `Master` class has a `guess` function that returns the number of bulls (characters that match in the exact position).

You will be given a list of words `wordlist` that contains the possible secret words.

Your task is to implement a function `findSecretWord` that tries to guess the secret word using the fewest possible guesses.

```python
def findSecretWord(wordlist: List[str], master: 'Master') -> None:
    pass
```

You can call `master.guess(word: str)` to get the number of bulls for your guess. The function you implement does not return any value.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum length of the word?
   - The length of each word is fixed and small (e.g., 6 characters).
2. What is the maximum size of the `wordlist`?
   - The `wordlist` can contain up to 1000 words.
3. Can the `wordlist` contain duplicates?
   - No, `wordlist` contains only unique words.

### Strategy

To efficiently guess the secret word, we will use a minimax strategy to minimize the worst-case number of guesses. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Matching Scores**: For each word in the list, count how many words in the list have the same number of matching (bull) characters.
2. **Choosing Guesses**: The word that can minimize the maximum group size of remaining possibilities for the next guess would be chosen.
3. **Iterative Guesses and Filtering**: Iterate this process, filtering out words that do not match the number of bulls reported by `Master`.

### Code

Below is the implementation:

```python
from typing import List
import collections

class Solution:
    def findSecretWord(self, wordlist: List[str], master: 'Master') -> None:
        def count_matches(word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
            # Helper function to count bulls (exact matches)
            return sum(1 for a, b in zip(word1, word2) if a == b)
        
        n = len(wordlist[0])
        attempts = 0
        
        while wordlist:
            # Select a candidate
            count = collections.Counter()
            
            for word1 in wordlist:
                for word2 in wordlist:
                    if word1 != word2:
                        count[word1] += self.match(word1, word2)
            
            guess_candidate = min(wordlist, key=lambda w: count[w])
            attempts += 1
            
            # Guess the candidate
            bulls = master.guess(guess_candidate)
            
            if bulls == n:
                return
            
            # Filter the words based on the number of bulls
            wordlist = [word for word in wordlist if self.match(word, guess_candidate) == bulls]
    
    def match(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        return sum(a == b for a, b in zip(word1, word2))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial matching scores calculation**: \(O(N^2 \cdot L)\), where \(N\) is the number of words and \(L\) is the length of each word (which is 6 here).
- **Guess and filtering**: Worst case, we may guess \(N\) times, each time filtering the list of \(N\) words.

The average time complexity should be slightly better due to filtering reducing the list size.

**Overall**, this approach aims to balance efficiency and effectiveness by minimizing the worst-case number of guesses and should work well within the provided constraints.
