Given an array of integers `arr`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array. In one step you can jump from index `i` to index `i + 1`, `i - 1`, or any index `j` where `arr[i] == arr[j]` and `i != j`.

Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

If it's not possible to reach the last index, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that all elements in the array are integers?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can the array contain negative integers?**
   - Yes.

3. **Can the array contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, this is a key part of the problem because jumping to the same value is allowed.

4. **What should be returned if the array has only one element?**
   - The result should be `0` since you're already at the last index.

5. **What is the maximum length of the array?**
   - This is typically understood to be within the constraints of an interview problem (e.g., up to `10^5` or `10^6`), but we'll proceed with the assumption that it's a reasonably large size suitable for optimization.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. BFS is suitable here because it explores all possible jumps level by level in the fewest number of steps:

1. **Building the Graph:**
   - Use a dictionary to map each value in the array to all the indices where that value occurs.

2. **BFS Initialization:**
   - Use a queue to initialize the BFS with the starting index (0).
   - Use a visited set to keep track of the indices we have already processed to avoid revisits.

3. **Processing the Queue:**
   - For each index, consider jumps to `i + 1`, `i - 1`, and all indices `j` where `arr[i] == arr[j]`.
   - Enqueue the new indices if they haven't been visited yet and mark them as visited.
   - Increase the step count whenever we finish processing all nodes at the current level.

4. **Termination Condition:**
   - If we reach the last index, return the current step count.
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the last index, return `-1`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` where `N` is the length of the array, since each index and transition is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for the queue and the visited set.

## Code

Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def minJumps(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return 0
    
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i, val in enumerate(arr):
        graph[val].append(i)
    
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])  # (index, steps)
    visited = set()
    visited.add(0)
    
    while queue:
        index, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if index == len(arr) - 1:
            return steps
        
        # Check the adjacent positions
        for neighbor in [index - 1, index + 1]:
            if 0 <= neighbor < len(arr) and neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))
        
        # Check all indices with the same value
        while graph[arr[index]]:
            neighbor = graph[arr[index]].pop()
            if neighbor != index and neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))
    
    return -1
```

This code will help you determine the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array, considering all allowed moves. If itâ€™s not possible to reach the last index, the function will return `-1`.
