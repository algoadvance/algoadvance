title:  Search a 2D Matrix II-out
permalink: /s240
---

The `240. Search a 2D Matrix II` problem on LeetCode requires you to search for a given target value in an `m x n` integer matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

You need to write a function `searchMatrix(matrix, target)` to determine if `target` is in the matrix.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],
                 [2,5,8,12,19],
                 [3,6,9,16,22],
                 [10,13,14,17,24],
                 [18,21,23,26,30]],
       target = 5
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],
                 [2,5,8,12,19],
                 [3,6,9,16,22],
                 [10,13,14,17,24],
                 [18,21,23,26,30]],
       target = 20
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix?
   - Yes, typically `m` and `n` can be large, like up to 300.

2. Can the matrix contain duplicate elements?
   - No, according to problem description each element appears only once.

## Strategy

1. **Leveraging Matrix Properties**: Start from the bottom-left corner of the matrix.
2. **Comparison and Move**: At each step, compare the current element with the target:
    - If the current element is greater than the target, move up (decrease row index).
    - If the current element is less than the target, move right (increase column index).
3. **Termination**: Continue the above steps until you either find the target or move out of the bounds of the matrix.

## Code

```python
def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    
    rows = len(matrix)
    cols = len(matrix[0])
    
    row = rows - 1  # Start from the bottom-left corner
    col = 0
    
    while row >= 0 and col < cols:
        if matrix[row][col] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[row][col] > target:
            row -= 1
        else:
            col += 1
    
    return False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n)
  - In the worst case, you might traverse all the way from the bottom-left to the top-right, hence visiting `m + n` elements.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The solution uses a constant amount of extra space.
