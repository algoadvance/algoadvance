title:  Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations-out
permalink: /s1959
---

Given an array `nums` that represents the sizes of files and an integer `k`, you need to minimize the total wasted space after exactly `k` resizes. Each resize allows you to choose a subarray and increase every size within it to some maximum value chosen for that subarray (which can be higher than any of the current sizes). Your task is to return the minimum total space wasted.

**Waste** refers to the difference between the maximum size used in resizing and each of the sizes in the subarray. Summing this across all subarrays after resizing should be minimized.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: 
Choosing [10, 20, 30] increases each to 30. Waste = (30-10) + (30-20) = 20
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` have zero-length? No.
2. Are elements in `nums` always positive integers? Yes.
3. What is the maximum allowed size of `nums`? 2000.
4. What is the maximum allowed value of `k`? 200.
5. Is it guaranteed that the output will always fit in a 32-bit integer? Yes.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** 
   - Use `dp[i][j]` to represent the minimum waste for the first `i` elements of `nums` with exactly `j` resizes.
   - Build the DP table by exploring each possible subarray for the current segment.
   - For each `dp[i][j]`, consider the best possible previous subarray ending at `i` with one fewer resize.
   - Compute the waste for the current subarray and determine the optimal partition plan.

2. **Iterate Over Subarrays and Track Wastage:**
   - For each segment, compute the maximum and sum, then derive the wastage and update the dp table.

### Code

```python
def minSpaceWastedKResizing(nums, k):
    n = nums.length
    INF = float('inf')

    # Initialize dp with large values
    dp = [[INF] * (k + 2) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 2):
            max_val, sum_val = 0, 0
            for h in reverse(i, max(-1, i - 2000) - 1):
                max_val = max(max_val, nums[h])
                sum_val += nums[h]
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[h][j-1] + max_val * (i - h) - sum_val)

    return dp[n][k + 1]

# Example usage
nums = [10, 20, 30]
k = 1
print(minSpaceWastedKResizing(nums, k))  # Expected Output: 10
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** \(O(n(k+2))\)
- **DP Update:** \(O(n^2(k+2))\), where each subarray calculation can be considered to iterate over all previously considered elements.

In practical terms, \(O(n^2(k+2))\) can be computationally intensive, but given the constraints (\(n\le2000\) and \(k\le200\)), it's feasible. Further optimizations may require more sophisticated techniques like smarter prefix sums or improved state transitions.
