title:  Path with Maximum Gold-out
permalink: /s1219
---
You are given an `m x n` grid grid of these values:

- `0` represents an empty cell,
- `1` represents a cell with a gold piece.

Your objective is to find the path that collects the maximum amount of gold. You can start and stop collecting gold at any point in the grid. However, you cannot visit the same cell more than once in a single path. Your possible movements are: left, right, up, or down. 

Write a function that returns the maximum amount of gold you can collect.

### Example
```python
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
One possible such path is 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

### Function Signature
```python
def getMaximumGold(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    pass
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Movement restrictions?**: Can we start and stop at any cell?
   - Yes, you can start and stop at any cell containing gold.
   
2. **Grid constraints?**: What is the size of the grid we are dealing with?
   - Let's assume `1 <= m, n <= 15` where m and n are the dimension of the grid.

3. **Content of the grid?**: Are all non-gold cells guaranteed to be `0`?
   - Yes, other cells will have the value `0`.

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to explore all possible paths from each cell containing gold.
   - Keep track of the gold collected and the maximum gold found so far.
   - To avoid revisiting cells, mark them as visited by setting their value temporarily to 0 during recursion.

2. **Start from each gold cell**:
   - For each cell containing gold, initiate a DFS traversal to find the maximum gold that can be collected starting from that cell.

3. **Boundary Checks**:
   - Make sure to handle boundary conditions to avoid going out of the grid.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - After exploring all paths from a cell, revert the changes (backtracking) to ensure other paths can reuse this cell if needed.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(4^(m*n))` in the worst case because from each cell, there are 4 possible directions, and we might end up exploring many paths.

### Code
```python
from typing import List

def getMaximumGold(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Grid dimensions
    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    def dfs(x, y):
        # Base case: if out of bounds or at a 0 cell, stop the path
        if x < 0 or x >= n or y < 0 or y >= m or grid[x][y] == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Collect the gold in the current cell and mark it as visited
        current_gold = grid[x][y]
        grid[x][y] = 0
        
        # Explore all 4 possible directions
        max_gold = 0
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            max_gold = max(max_gold, dfs(x + dx, y + dy))
        
        # Backtrack: revert the current cell's state
        grid[x][y] = current_gold
        
        # Return the collected gold from current cell plus max gold from neighbors
        return current_gold + max_gold
    
    max_gold = 0
    
    # Start a DFS from each cell that contains gold
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] != 0:
                max_gold = max(max_gold, dfs(i, j))
    
    return max_gold

# Example usage for testing
grid = [
    [0, 6, 0],
    [5, 8, 7],
    [0, 9, 0]
]
print(getMaximumGold(grid))  # Expected output: 24
```

### Explanation
- We iterate through each cell in the grid.
- For each cell that contains gold, we perform a DFS to explore all reachable paths while collecting gold.
- The maximum gold collected from any starting point is updated.
- Finally, the maximum collected gold is returned.
