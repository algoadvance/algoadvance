title:  Super Washing Machines-out
permalink: /s517
---

You have `n` super washing machines on a line. Initially, each washing machine has some dresses in it. When you move a dress from one washing machine to another, it takes one move.

You want to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

Given an integer array `machines` representing the number of dresses in each washing machine from left to right on the line, you should find the minimum number of moves to make all the washing machines have the same number of dresses.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: machines = [1,0,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st move: 1 -> 0 => [0,1,5]
2nd move: 5 -> 1 => [0,2,4]
3rd move: 4 -> 1 => [0,3,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: machines = [0,3,0]
Output: 2
Explanation:
1st move: 3 -> 0 => [1,2,0]
2nd move: 2 -> 0 => [1,1,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: machines = [0,2,0]
Output: -1
Explanation:
It's impossible to make all the three washing machines have the same number of dresses.
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == machines.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `0 <= machines[i] <= 10^5`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarify constraints:** The array length and maximum values are within acceptable ranges for a solution that may involve iterative comparisons or cumulative sums.
2. **Define "move":** A move involves transferring a single dress from one washing machine to an adjacent one.

### Strategy
1. **Check for Feasibility:** First, calculate the total number of dresses. If `total_dresses % n != 0`, it's impossible to balance the dresses because we cannot have an equal division per machine.
2. **Calculate Result:** If balancing is possible, the goal is to find the minimum moves. Use an approach that:
   - Tracks the dresses needed to balance each machine relative to the average number of dresses per machine.
   - Keeps a running balance to handle surplus or deficit from left to right.
   - Computes the maximum value among the absolute cumulative surplus/deficit and individual excess moves required at each step.

### Code

```python
def findMinMoves(machines):
    total_dresses = sum(machines)
    n = len(machines)
    
    if total_dresses % n != 0:
        return -1
    
    target = total_dresses // n  # target number of dresses per machine
    max_moves = 0  # track maximum moves required
    current_balance = 0  # cumulative balance of moves needed

    for dresses in machines:
        # Compute the surplus or deficit at the current machine
        balance = dresses - target
        current_balance += balance
        # We need to ensure that both the current balance and the absolute move needed are checked
        max_moves = max(max_moves, abs(current_balance), balance)
    
    return max_moves
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` since we are making a single pass through the machines array to compute balances and the maximum moves needed.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` because we use a fixed amount of additional space irrespective of the input size.

The proposed approach effectively ensures that we track the necessary moves to balance the array in optimal time.
