Leetcode Problem 2070: **Most Beautiful Item for Each Query**

**Description:**
You have an array of items where `items[i] = [pricei, beautyi]` denotes the price and beauty of the `i`th item, respectively. You are also given a list of queries where `queries[j]` is the maximum price of the item that can be afforded by the individual who is making the `j`th query. 

For each query, determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to the specified price in the query. If no such item exists, the answer for that query should be 0.

**Return:** An array of integers answer where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j`-th query.

**Example:**
```python
items = [[2, 4], [3, 6], [5, 3]]
queries = [1, 4, 5]
# Output: [0, 6, 6]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the items have duplicate prices or beauties?
   - Yes, the items can have duplicate prices or beauties.
   
2. What are the constraints on price and beauty values?
   - Each price and beauty value can range from 1 to 10^9.
   
3. Are the queries guaranteed to have any specific order?
   - No, the queries can be in any order.

4. What are the constraints on the input sizes?
   - The length of `items` and `queries` can be up to 10^5.

## Strategy

1. **Sort Items by Price:** 
   - Sort the items based on their prices. This helps in leveraging efficient searching later.

2. **Maximize Beauty over Price:**
   - Preprocess the items to keep track of the maximum beauty achievable for each price up to that point. 

3. **Binary Search for Each Query:**
   - For each query, use binary search to find the highest price in the preprocessed list that is less than or equal to the query price.
   
4. **Result Compilation:**
   - Collect the results based on the binary search result for each query.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```python
def maximumBeauty(items, queries):
    # Step 1: Sort items by price
    items.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Create a list to store max beauty up to the current price
    max_beauty = []
    current_max = 0
    
    for price, beauty in items:
        current_max = max(current_max, beauty)
        max_beauty.append((price, current_max))
    
    # Step 3: Answer each query using binary search
    from bisect import bisect_right
    results = []
    
    for query in queries:
        index = bisect_right(max_beauty, (query, float('inf'))) - 1
        if index >= 0:
            results.append(max_beauty[index][1])
        else:
            results.append(0)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
items = [[2, 4], [3, 6], [5, 3]]
queries = [1, 4, 5]
print(maximumBeauty(items, queries)) # Output: [0, 6, 6]
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting items: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of items.
- Building the `max_beauty` list: `O(n)`.
- Answering queries: Each query requires a binary search, `O(m log n)` where `m` is the number of queries.
- Overall time complexity: `O(n log n + m log n)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently preprocess the items and provide quick responses to each query.
