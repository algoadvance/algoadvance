Given a 2D integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` is a list of integers, return a list containing all the integers that are present in each and every array of `nums` sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected input format and constraints?**
   - **Input:** `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
   - **Constraints:**
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
     - `1 <= nums[i].length, nums[i][j] <= 1000`

2. **What should be the output if there is no common integer in all arrays?**
   - **Output:** An empty list if no common integer is found in all arrays.

3. **Can the integers within each sub-array be negative or are they only positive?**
   - The constraints imply only positive integers since it is given `nums[i][j] <= 1000`.

4. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - Based on the constraints (`1 <= nums.length` and `1 <= nums[i].length`), no subarray or the main array will be empty.

### Strategy
1. **Create a Function:** Create a function called `intersection_of_arrays` which will take a list of lists as input.
2. **Using Sets:** Utilize Pythonâ€™s `set` to keep track of the intersection:
   - Start with the first sub-array converted to a set.
   - Iterate through the remaining sub-arrays, updating the set by taking an intersection with each new sub-array.
3. **Sorting:** Convert the final set to a sorted list before returning it.

### Code
```python
from typing import List

def intersection_of_arrays(nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not nums:
        return []

    # Start with the set of the first list
    intersection_set = set(nums[0])

    # Find the intersection with all remaining lists
    for arr in nums[1:]:
        intersection_set &= set(arr)

    # Return the sorted list of the result
    return sorted(intersection_set)

# Example usage:
nums = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 2], 
    [2, 8, 9]
]
print(intersection_of_arrays(nums))  # Output: [2]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Conversion to set for each sub-list:** O(N) per sub-array of size N (since the length can be at most 1000).
- **Intersection operation:** O(N) for each intersection (again using max sub-array length N).
- **Sorting the final result:** O(M log M) where M is the size of the intersection set.
  - In the worst case, M is the smallest size of any sub-array.

Thus, the total complexity is:
- Best case: O(M log M), when all the numbers intersect quickly.
- General case: O(K * N + M log M), where K is the number of arrays and N is the maximum length of any sub-array.

The approach efficiently handles the problem within constraints.
