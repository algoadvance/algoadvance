title:  Letter Tile Possibilities-out
permalink: /s1079
---
You have a set of `tiles`, where each tile has one letter `tiles[i]` printed on it. You can arrange these tiles in any order. Each arrangement of tiles forms a sequence. You need to return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can form.

### Example
- Example 1:
    - Input: `tiles = "AAB"`
    - Output: `8`
    - Explanation: The possible sequences are "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA".

- Example 2:
    - Input: `tiles = "AAABBC"`
    - Output: `188`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the tiles have any characters other than capital English letters?
   - No, the problem specifies capital English letters only.
   
2. Do we consider different permutations of the same set of letters as distinct sequences?
   - Yes, "AB" and "BA" are considered different sequences.

3. Can the input `tiles` be empty? If so, what should be the output?
   - No, the constraints guarantee that the length of `tiles` will be between 1 and 7.

4. Do the sequences need to be contiguous substrings of the `tiles`?
   - No, any re-arrangement (permutation) of the tiles counts.

## Strategy
We need to find all possible sequences that can be formed by arranging the `tiles` in any order. This is essentially finding all possible permutations of any length from 1 to the length of the `tiles`.

### Steps
1. Use recursive backtracking to explore all permutations of the tiles.
2. Keep track of permutations already seen using a set to avoid counting duplicates.
3. Recursively generate permutations by picking each tile and reduce the problem size accordingly.

### Code Implementation
Here's a Python implementation using recursive backtracking:

```python
from collections import Counter

def numTilePossibilities(tiles: str) -> int:
    def backtrack(counter):
        count = 0
        for tile in counter:
            if counter[tile] > 0:
                count += 1
                counter[tile] -= 1
                count += backtrack(counter)
                counter[tile] += 1
        return count

    tile_counter = Counter(tiles)
    return backtrack(tile_counter)

# Test
print(numTilePossibilities("AAB"))  # Output: 8
print(numTilePossibilities("AAABBC"))  # Output: 188
```

### Explanation
- We use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the available tiles.
- The `backtrack` function computes the number of sequences recursively:
  - For each tile, we check if it can be used (i.e., its count is greater than 0).
  - We decrement the count of the chosen tile and recursively call the `backtrack` function with the updated counter.
  - We increment the count of the tile back after the recursive call to restore its state for subsequent iterations.
- Finally, the function returns the total count of possible sequences.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(N * N!)`, where `N` is the length of the input string `tiles`. This is due to the fact that we generate all possible permutations (there are `N!` permutations) and for each permutation, we need to make `N` calls to handle each tile decrement/increment.
