title:  Move Pieces to Obtain a String-out
permalink: /s2337
---
You are given two strings `start` and `target`, both of the same length. Each string consists of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' only. 'L' indicates a "player" that can move to the left, 'R' indicates a "player" that can move to the right, and '_' denotes an empty space.

In one move, you can:
1. Move a player 'L' from an index `i` to `i-1` if the index at `i-1` is empty (and within the bounds of the string).
2. Move a player 'R' from an index `i` to `i+1` if the index at `i+1` is empty (and within the bounds of the string).

Your goal is to return `True` if you can transform the `start` string into the `target` string by doing the above moves any number of times, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the strings have mixed arrangements of 'L', 'R', and '_'?
   - Yes, the strings `start` and `target` can have any arrangement of 'L', 'R', and '_'.
2. Do both strings have the same length?
   - Yes, both strings are of the same length.
3. Can `L` or `R` characters move multiple times?
   - Yes, the characters can move multiple times as long as they abide by the movement rules.

### Strategy
1. **Remove Spaces Check**: The key insight is that the relative order and the count of 'L' and 'R' must match in both strings after removing the '_' characters.
2. **Relative Position Validation**: Additionally, we need to ensure that:
   - 'L' characters in `start` can only move leftward, so for each 'L' in `start` at index `i`, it should have a corresponding 'L' in `target` at index `j` where `j <= i`.
   - 'R' characters in `start` can only move rightward, so for each 'R' in `start` at index `i`, it should have a corresponding 'R' in `target` at index `j` where `j >= i`.

If both conditions hold, we return `True`; otherwise, `False`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution will be `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the given strings. This is because we are primarily iterating through the strings a couple of times (removing characters and checking indices).

### Code
```python
def canChange(start: str, target: str) -> bool:
    # Filter out the '_' characters
    filtered_start = [(ch, i) for i, ch in enumerate(start) if ch != '_']
    filtered_target = [(ch, i) for i, ch in enumerate(target) if ch != '_']
    
    # Quick check: lengths of filtered lists should be the same
    if len(filtered_start) != len(filtered_target):
        return False
    
    # Iterate and check character match and valid index movement
    for (s_char, s_index), (t_char, t_index) in zip(filtered_start, filtered_target):
        if s_char != t_char:
            return False
        if s_char == 'L' and s_index < t_index: # 'L' can only move left
            return False
        if s_char == 'R' and s_index > t_index: # 'R' can only move right
            return False
    
    return True

# Test cases
print(canChange("R_L_", "__RL"))  # Expected output: True
print(canChange("_L__R__R_", "L______RR"))  # Expected output: True
print(canChange("_R", "R_"))  # Expected output: False
print(canChange("_____", "_____"))  # Expected output: True
print(canChange("R_L", "L_R"))  # Expected output: False
```

This implementation follows the described strategy step-by-step. It ensures that characters can move according to the rules and verifies the transformations allowed.
