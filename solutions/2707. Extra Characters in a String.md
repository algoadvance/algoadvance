title:  Extra Characters in a String-out
permalink: /s2707
---

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `dictionary`. You want to break `s` into as few extra characters as possible that are not part of any string in `dictionary`.

You should return the number of extra characters left after breaking `s` this way.

#### Example:
```python
s = "leetscode"
dictionary = ["leet", "code", "leetcode"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break the string into "leet" + "s" + "code".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the dictionary words overlap in the string `s`?**
   - No, once a part of the string is covered by a dictionary word, it cannot be reused.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - Let's assume the length of `s` is n and can go up to 5000.
   
3. **What is the maximum number of words in the dictionary?**
   - Let's assume the dictionary can have up to 1000 words, and each word can be as long as 100 characters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP).

1. **Define `dp[i]`** as the minimum number of extra characters from breaking the substring `s[0:i]` efficiently.

2. Initialize `dp[0]` to `0` because an empty substring has no extra characters.

3. Iterate through the string `s` and for each position `i`, iterate through the dictionary to check if any word in the dictionary ends at position `i`. If `s[j:i]` forms a word in `dictionary`, update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[j]`.

4. Finally, `dp[n]` will have the minimum number of extra characters left after breaking the entire string.

### Code Implementation

```python
def minExtraChar(s, dictionary):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    dict_set = set(dictionary) # Convert dictionary to a set for faster lookups
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1 # initially assume the character at i is extra
        for word in dict_set:
            l = len(word)
            if l <= i and s[i - l:i] == word:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - l])
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage:
s = "leetscode"
dictionary = ["leet", "code", "leetcode"]
print(minExtraChar(s, dictionary)) # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m * l)`
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `m` is the number of words in the dictionary.
   - `l` is the maximum length of the words in the dictionary.
   - The worst-case scenario involves checking each position `i` against each word in the dictionary.

2. **Space Complexity**: `O(n + k)`
   - `n` for the `dp` array.
   - `k` for storing the dictionary in set form for efficient lookups (`k` is the total length of all dictionary words combined).
