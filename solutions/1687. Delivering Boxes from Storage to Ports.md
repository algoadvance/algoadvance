title:  Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports-out
permalink: /s1687
---
You have `boxes` arranged in a row, where each `boxes[i] = [ports[i], weight[i]]`.

- `ports[i]` is the port at which the box needs to be delivered.
- `weight[i]` is the weight of the box.

You have a truck with two limits:

1. A `portsCount` limit, which is the maximum number of ports that the truck can deliver boxes to in one trip.
2. A `maxBoxes` limit, which is the maximum number of boxes that the truck can carry in one trip.
3. A `maxWeight` limit, which is the maximum weight of the boxes that the truck can carry in one trip.

The truck delivers the boxes in the following way:

- The truck will deliver the boxes in order.
- The truck will end up back at storage after delivering boxes to all the ports.

Return the minimum number of trips the truck needs to take to deliver all the boxes to their respective ports.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the number of boxes?
   - What is the maximum value for `portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, and `maxWeight`?

2. **Trip Strategy**:
   - Should the truck always return to storage after delivering to the specified number of ports, even if there is remaining capacity for weight and boxes?

### Strategy
To determine the minimal number of trips, we need to keep track of:
- The current port being delivered to.
- The number of distinct ports encountered.
- The number of boxes.
- The cumulative weight of the boxes on the truck.

We'll use a greedy approach where for each box, we attempt to load it onto the truck if it doesn't exceed the given constraints (`portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, `maxWeight`). If adding a box would violate any of these constraints, we record a trip and start a new one.

### Key Steps:
1. Traverse through the list of `boxes` and keep track of:
   - Current weight.
   - Current number of boxes.
   - Ports visited.

2. Whenever adding another box would exceed `maxBoxes`, `maxWeight`, or `portsCount`, make a trip.
3. Add the extra trip needed to return to storage after delivering all boxes.

### Time Complexity:
The solution will run in O(n) time, where n is the number of boxes, as each box is processed exactly once.

### Code

```python
def boxDelivering(boxes, portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight):
    n = len(boxes)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    j = 0
    kPorts = 0
    currentWeight = 0

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        while j < i and (
            currentWeight + boxes[i - 1][1] > maxWeight or
            i - j > maxBoxes or
            (kPorts > 0 and dp[j] - dp[j - 1] + 1 > portsCount)
        ):
            currentWeight -= boxes[j][1]
            if j > 0 and boxes[j][0] != boxes[j - 1][0]:
                kPorts -= 1
            j += 1
        
        currentWeight += boxes[i - 1][1]

        if i > 1 and boxes[i - 1][0] != boxes[i - 2][0]:
            kPorts += 1

        trips = dp[j] + kPorts + 2
        dp[i] = min(dp[i], trips)
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]]
portsCount = 2
maxBoxes = 3
maxWeight = 3
print(boxDelivering(boxes, portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight))
```

This code initializes a dp array and iterates through the list of boxes to determine the number of distinct trips needed, accounting for the constraints provided.
