title:  Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s236
---

You are given a binary tree and two nodes `p` and `q`. Your task is to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of these two nodes in the tree.

The definition of the lowest common ancestor is as follows:
- The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Here's the function signature you need to implement:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    pass
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if one or both of the nodes `p` or `q` are not present in the tree?**
   - Assume that `p` and `q` will always exist in the tree.

2. **Can the binary tree contain duplicate values?**
   - No, all the values in the binary tree are unique.

3. **Is the binary tree a binary search tree (BST)?**
   - No, assume it's a regular binary tree, not necessarily a BST.

## Strategy

To find the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree, a recursive approach is quite effective. Here's the plan:

1. **Base Case**: If the current node is `None`, return `None`. If the current node is either `p` or `q`, return the current node.
2. **Recursive Case**: Recurse on the left and right subtrees.
3. **Post-processing**:
   - After recursion, if both left and right recursion calls return non-`None` values, it means `p` and `q` are found in different subtrees of the current node. Therefore, the current node is their LCA.
   - If only one of the left or right returns a non-`None` value, return that non-`None` value because that indicates that both `p` and `q` are found in the subtree rooted at that returned node.

## Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    # Base case
    if root is None or root == p or root == q:
        return root

    # Search in left and right subtree
    left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
    right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
    
    # If both left and right are non-null, the current node is the LCA
    if left and right:
        return root
    
    # Otherwise, return the non-null subtree
    return left if left is not None else right
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)** where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because in the worst case, we need to visit all the nodes to find `p` and `q`.

The space complexity is **O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this can be up to O(N). For a balanced tree, this would be O(log N).
