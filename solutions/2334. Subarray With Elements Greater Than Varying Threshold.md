title:  Subarray With Elements Greater Than Varying Threshold-out
permalink: /s2334
---

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `threshold`. Find the maximum length of a subarray with elements all greater than the threshold. If no such subarray exists, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, the problem guarantees a non-empty array.
  
2. **What are the constraints on the array length and element values?**
   - Typically for such problems, constraints could range from `1 <= n <= 10^5` for the length of the array, and element values could be within the range of standard 32-bit or 64-bit integers. (But confirm from the specific problem constraints if available.)

3. **What if all elements in the array are greater than the threshold?**
   - Return the length of the array since the entire array is a valid subarray.

4. **How do we handle negative numbers or zero?**
   - Treat them like any other element when comparing against the threshold.

### Strategy

The problem can be handled using a single pass through the array to find the lengths of consecutive subarrays where every element is greater than the threshold. Hereâ€™s the approach:

1. **Initialize a counter** to keep track of the current valid subarray length.
2. **Traverse through the array** while maintaining the maximum length of subarrays found so far.
3. **Reset the counter** whenever an element is not greater than the threshold.
4. **Update the maximum length** whenever a new valid subarray is found.

### Code

```python
def longest_subarray(nums, threshold):
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num > threshold:
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 0

    return max_length

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
threshold = 3
print(longest_subarray(nums, threshold))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we're using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This method ensures we efficiently find the maximum length subarray with minimal overhead.
