title:  Pancake Sorting-out
permalink: /s969
---

Given an array of integers `arr`, perform a series of pancake flips that sort the array. A pancake flip consists of choosing an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length` and reversing the order of the first `k` elements of the array. We need to return the k-values of the flips to sort the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the elements in `arr`? 
     - All elements in `arr` are integers and unique.
   - How many elements can `arr` have? 
     - The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100.
   - What is the range of the values in `arr`?
     - Since the elements are unique, they're in the range from `1` to `arr.length`.

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - How should the k-values be returned? 
     - As a list of integers.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be done if the array is already sorted?
     - Return an empty list, as no flips are needed.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Largest Unsorted Element:**
   - Find the largest unsorted element and its index.
   
2. **Move the Largest Element to Correct Position:**
   - If it's not already at the end of the unsorted portion, we need two flips:
     1. Flip to move it to the front if it is not already at the front (flip index + 1).
     2. Flip to move it to the correct sorted position (length of the unsorted portion).
   
3. **Repeat:**
   - Reduce the considered portion of the array and repeat until the entire array is sorted.

4. **Return the List of Flips:**
   - Collect all the values of `k` used in the flips and return them.

## Code

Here is the code to solve the problem:

```python
def pancakeSort(arr):
    def flip(sublist, k):
        sublist[0:k] = reversed(sublist[0:k])
    
    result = []
    n = len(arr)
    
    for size in range(n, 1, -1):
        # find the index of the max number in the current unsorted portion of the array
        max_index = arr.index(size)
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            # flip the max number to the front if it is not already the front
            if max_index != 0:
                flip(arr, max_index + 1)
                result.append(max_index + 1)
            
            # flip it to its final position
            flip(arr, size)
            result.append(size)
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(pancakeSort([3, 2, 4, 1]))  # Output should be like [3, 4, 2, 3, 2]
print(pancakeSort([1, 2, 3]))    # Output should be [] since the array is already sorted
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the maximum element in the array**: O(n) for each pass.
- **Flipping the array part**: O(n).
- Overall complexity: O(n^2), since we do this for each element size from n to 1.

This approach effectively sorts the array using "pancake flips" and returns the sequence of flips as required.
