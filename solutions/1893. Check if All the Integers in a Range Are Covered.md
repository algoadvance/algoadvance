title:  Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered-out
permalink: /s1893
---

You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents an inclusive interval.

Return `true` if each integer in the inclusive interval `[left, right]` is covered by at least one interval in `ranges`. Return `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the range intervals in `ranges` be sorted or unordered?**
   - The intervals can be unordered.
   
2. **Are the intervals in `ranges` distinct or can they overlap?**
   - The intervals can overlap.

3. **What is the size limit for `ranges` and the range for `left` and `right`?**
   - We assume they fit within the constraints typical for a competitive programming problem (e.g., a few thousand intervals).

### Strategy

Our goal is to check if every integer from `left` to `right` is included in at least one of the intervals in `ranges`. Here is a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Create a boolean list `covered` initialized to `False` with a size covering from `left` to `right`.**
2. **Iterate through each interval in `ranges` and mark the corresponding elements in `covered` as `True`.**
3. **Check if all elements in the `covered` list corresponding to the range `[left, right]` are `True`.**

We can initialize a boolean array representing the coverage status of each number in the range `[left, right]`. For each range in `ranges`, mark the appropriate indices as `covered`. Finally, validate that all indices corresponding to `[left, right]` are `True`.

### Code

```python
def isCovered(ranges, left, right):
    # Create a list to keep track of which numbers from left to right are covered.
    covered = [False] * (right - left + 1)
    
    # Mark the numbers covered by the ranges
    for start, end in ranges:
        for num in range(max(start, left), min(end, right) + 1):
            covered[num - left] = True
    
    # Check if all numbers from left to right are covered
    return all(covered)

# Example usage:
ranges = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
left = 2
right = 5
print(isCovered(ranges, left, right))  # Output: True
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Creating `covered` List:**
   - The length of the `covered` list is the size of the interval `[left, right]`, hence it has `(right - left + 1)` elements.
2. **Marking Coverage:**
   - For each interval `[start, end]`, we iterate only over the intersection with `[left, right]`.
   - `max(start, left)` ensures we don’t start before `left`.
   - `min(end, right)` ensures we don’t go past `right`.
   - Mark `covered[num - left]` as `True` where `num` is within the intersection.
3. **Checking Coverage:**
   - The `all(covered)` function checks if all elements in the `covered` list are `True`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N * R), where `N` is the number of intervals in `ranges` and `R` is the average size of the intersection between `[start, end]` and `[left, right]`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(R), where `R` is the length of the interval `[left, right]`.

This solution should be efficient enough given typical problem constraints.
