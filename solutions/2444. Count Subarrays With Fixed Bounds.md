title:  Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds-out
permalink: /s2444
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `minK` and `maxK`.

A fixed-bound subarray of `nums` is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:
- The minimum value in the subarray is equal to `minK`.
- The maximum value in the subarray is equal to `maxK`.

Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,7,5], minK = 1, maxK = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The fixed-bound subarrays are [1,3,5] and [1,3,5,2].
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range for the input array `nums`?** 
   - The array can be relatively large, up to 10^5 elements.
2. **Can `minK` be equal to `maxK`?**
   - Yes, `minK` can be equal to `maxK`.
3. **Should we consider negative values in the array?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` can contain negative values.
4. **What if the array `nums` is empty?**
   - For an empty array, the output should be 0 as there are no subarrays to consider.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using a single pass with two pointers. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy:

1. **Setup Pointers and Counters:**
   - Use pointers to track occurrences of `minK` and `maxK`.
2. **Iterate through the Array:**
   - For each element, maintain the range of valid subarrays that can form fixed-bound subarrays.
   - Track the latest positions of `minK` and `maxK`.
   - Determine the minimum extendable subarray length valid up to the current position.
3. **Count Valid Subarrays:**
   - Count subarrays that can be formed between `minK` and `maxK` while ensuring any elements between them do not invalidate the subarray.

## Code

```python
def countSubarrays(nums, minK, maxK):
    n = len(nums)
    min_pos = max_pos = -1
    left_bound = -1
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] < minK or nums[i] > maxK:
            left_bound = i
        
        if nums[i] == minK:
            min_pos = i
        
        if nums[i] == maxK:
            max_pos = i
            
        valid_left_bound = min(min_pos, max_pos)
        if valid_left_bound > left_bound:
            count += valid_left_bound - left_bound
    
    return count
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) because we are iterating through the array only once, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This solution is optimal for the input size constraints given.

## Summary

With this approach, we efficiently count the number of subarrays that respect the fixed bounds of `minK` and `maxK` using a linear pass through the input array. The use of pointers and boundary checks ensures minimal overhead, thus achieving the desired result within acceptable performance limits.
