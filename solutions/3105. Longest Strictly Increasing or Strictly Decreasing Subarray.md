title:  Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray-out
permalink: /s3105
---

You are given an array `arr` of integers. You need to find the length of the longest subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Do the elements of the subarray need to be contiguous?**
   - Yes, the subarray should be contiguous.

2. **What is the range of values for the elements in the array?**
   - The elements could be any integer, positive, negative, or zero.

3. **What should be returned if the array is empty or contains one element?**
   - If the array is empty, the length should be 0. If the array contains one element, the length should be 1.

4. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements, but strictly increasing or decreasing subarrays cannot have consecutive duplicate elements.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and keep track of the lengths of the currently observed strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarrays. We can maintain a few state variables:
1. `curr_inc_length` for the length of the current strictly increasing subarray.
2. `curr_dec_length` for the length of the current strictly decreasing subarray.
3. `max_length` to store the maximum length observed so far of either type of subarray.

We will iterate through the array from the second element and for each element, we will:
- Check if it is greater than the previous element (i.e., increasing).
  - If increasing, increment `curr_inc_length`, reset `curr_dec_length` to 1.
- Check if it is smaller than the previous element (i.e., decreasing).
  - If decreasing, increment `curr_dec_length`, reset `curr_inc_length` to 1.
- If neither, reset both `curr_inc_length` and `curr_dec_length` to 1.
- Update `max_length` accordingly.

### Code:

```python
def longest_strictly_inc_or_dec_subarray(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return 1

    curr_inc_length = 1
    curr_dec_length = 1
    max_length = 1

    for i in range(1, arr.length):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            curr_inc_length += 1
            curr_dec_length = 1
        elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            curr_dec_length += 1
            curr_inc_length = 1
        else:
            curr_inc_length = 1
            curr_dec_length = 1

        max_length = max(max_length, curr_inc_length, curr_dec_length)

    return max_length

# Example usage:
# arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0, -1, -2]
# print(longest_strictly_inc_or_dec_subarray(arr))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We only need one pass through the array to compute the longest subarray length.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently finds the length of the longest strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarray using a single traversal of the input array and constant additional space.
