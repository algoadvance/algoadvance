title:  Maximum Sum Queries-out
permalink: /s2736
---

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`, and an integer array `queries` of length `m`.

The function needs to perform `m` queries, where for each query `qi`, you need to find two indices `i` and `j` (i != j) such that:

- `i < j`
- `nums1[i] + nums1[j] >= qi`
- `nums2[i] + nums2[j] <= qi`

For each query `qi`, return the maximum possible sum `nums1[i] + nums1[j]`.

If no such indices exist for a query, return -1 for that query.

The solution needs to return an array of length `m` where the i-th value represents the result of the i-th query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the values in nums1 or nums2 be negative?
   - Yes, all integers can be both positive and negative.
   
2. Are the lengths of the provided arrays nums1, nums2, and queries constant, or can they be large?
   - They can be large, so the solution needs to be efficient.

3. If there are multiple pairs `(i, j)` satisfying the conditions for a query, which pair should we select?
   - We need to select the pair that results in the maximum sum `nums1[i] + nums1[j]`.

4. Can the same pair `(i, j)` be used for different queries?
   - Yes, each query is independent of the others.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Iterate through each query `qi`.
2. For each query, look for pairs `(i, j)` such that:
   - `i < j`
   - `nums1[i] + nums1[j] >= qi`
   - `nums2[i] + nums2[j] <= qi`
3. Track the maximum sum of `nums1[i] + nums1[j]` for each query.
4. If no valid pairs are found for a query, return `-1` for that query.

To efficiently find valid pairs, sorting the sums of `nums1` and `nums2` combined with a two-pointer technique or binary search might be helpful. This ensures we reduce the potential number of comparisons.

### Time Complexity

The naive approach involves checking all pairs `(i, j)` for each query, leading to a time complexity of \(O(m \times n^2)\), which might not be efficient for large `n` and `m`. Using more advanced techniques like sorting and binary search can potentially reduce the complexity.


### Python Code

Here's a simple implementation using a nested loop to iterate through pairs `(i, j)` for each query. Due to time complexity, this approach works efficiently for moderately sized inputs but might need optimization for larger inputs.

```python
def maximumSumQueries(nums1, nums2, queries):
    results = []

    for q in queries:
        max_sum = -1
        for i in range(len(nums1)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums1)):
                if nums1[i] + nums1[j] >= q and nums2[i] + nums2[j] <= q:
                    max_sum = max(max_sum, nums1[i] + nums1[j])
        results.append(max_sum)

    return results

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 2, 3]
nums2 = [4, 5, 6]
queries = [5, 7, 10]

print(maximumSumQueries(nums1, nums2, queries)) 
# Output should be [5, 5, 9] based on given conditions.
```

### Potential Optimization

For larger arrays:
- Precompute and sort the sums.
- Use binary search to quickly find qualifying pairs.
- Consider storing cumulative results to reduce redundant calculations.

The goal would always be to reduce the brute-force nature of the nested loops while ensuring all constraints are checked properly.
