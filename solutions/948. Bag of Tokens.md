title:  Bag of Tokens-out

---

You are given an integer array `tokens` that represent the values of tokens, and an integer `power`.

Your goal is to maximize the number of tokens you can play. Each time you play a token, you either gain or lose points and power: 
- If you have at least as much power as the value of the token, you can play the token face up, losing `token[i]` power and gaining 1 point.
- If you have at least 1 point, you can play the token face down, gaining `token[i]` power and losing 1 point.

Each token can be played at most once and in any order. Return the largest number of points you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

Example 1:
- Input: `tokens = [100, 200, 300, 400]`, `power = 200`
- Output: `2`

Example 2:
- Input: `tokens = [100]`, `power = 50`
- Output: `0`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can tokens have negative values?**
   - No, tokens have positive integer values as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Is the order of playing tokens fixed?**
   - No, you can play the tokens in any order you choose to maximize your points.

3. **What happens if we run out of power or points?**
   - If you run out of power, you cannot play any token face-up. If you run out of points, you cannot play any token face-down. The goal is to achieve the maximum points possible with the given constraints.

4. **Can the power start as a negative value?**
   - No, the initial power is always a non-negative integer.

## Strategy

We can use a greedy strategy along with sorting to solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Sort the tokens** in ascending order.
2. Use two pointers: one starting from the lowest value token (`low`) and the other from the highest value token (`high`).
3. Use a variable `points` initialized to `0` to store the maximum points achieved.
4. Use a while loop to traverse through the tokens array:
   - If the current token can be played face-up (`power >= tokens[low]`), play it face-up to maximize points.
   - If not, try to play the highest value token face-down if it can provide enough power to play more tokens face-up.
5. Keep track of the maximum points achieved during these plays.

## Code

Here is the Python implementation following the described strategy:

```python
def bagOfTokensScore(tokens, power):
    # Sort the tokens array to facilitate the greedy approach
    tokens.sort()
    
    # Initialize pointers and variables
    points = 0
    max_points = 0
    low, high = 0, len(tokens) - 1
    
    # Traverse the tokens array with the two pointers
    while low <= high:
        if power >= tokens[low]:
            # Play the token face-up
            power -= tokens[low]
            points += 1
            low += 1
            # Update maximum points
            max_points = max(max_points, points)
        elif points > 0:
            # Play the token face-down if we have points
            power += tokens[high]
            points -= 1
            high -= 1
        else:
            # No valid move can be made
            break
            
    return max_points

# Example Usage
print(bagOfTokensScore([100, 200, 300, 400], 200))  # Output: 2
print(bagOfTokensScore([100], 50))  # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the tokens**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Two-pointer traversal and operations**: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
