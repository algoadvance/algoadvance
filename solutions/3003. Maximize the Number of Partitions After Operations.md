title:  Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations-out
permalink: /s3003
---

You are given an array of non-negative integers `nums` and two integers `m` and `k`. You can perform at most `m` operations on the array where in each operation you can increment one element of the array by one. Your goal is to maximize the number of partitions of the array into continuous subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is at least `k`.

Return the maximum number of partitions you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements of the array guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
    - Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement.

2. **What are the constraints on the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`?**
    - Generally, LeetCode problems involve constraints like 1 <= `nums.length` <= 10^5, 1 <= `m`, `k` <= 10^9 or similar. But specific constraints need to be checked in the problem description.

3. **Can multiple operations be performed on the same element?**
    - Yes, each operation allows incrementing one element of the array by one, and this process can be repeated for the same element.

4. **Is there a time limit for solving the problem?**
    - Typically in a LeetCode context, the solution has to run efficiently within a few seconds.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Prefix Sum Computation**:
    - Calculate the prefix sums of the array `nums`. This helps in quickly computing the sum of any subarray.

2. **Binary Search on the Number of Partitions**:
    - We'll use binary search to determine the maximum number of partitions we can achieve. For each mid value in the binary search, we'll check if we can form that many partitions with the given operations.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
    - For each candidate partition count, calculate the minimum additional operations needed to ensure each partition's sum is at least `k`. If the required operations exceed `m`, adjust the binary search range.

### Code

Here's the Python solution to achieve the above strategy:

```python
def maximizePartitions(nums, m, k):
    def canPartition(partitions):
        operations = 0
        current_sum = 0
        count = 0
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum >= k:
                count += 1
                current_sum = 0
            else:
                need = k - current_sum
                operations += min(m, need)
                current_sum = k if operations <= m else current_sum
                if operations > m:
                    return False
        return count >= partitions
    
    low, high = 0, len(nums)
    result = 0
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if canPartition(mid):
            result = mid
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return result
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Definition**:
    - `maximizePartitions(nums, m, k)`: Main function to maximize the number of partitions.
    
2. **Helper Function**:
    - `canPartition(partitions)`: Determines if `partitions` number of partitions with sums >= `k` can be achieved with at most `m` operations.
    
3. **Binary Search**:
    - Binary search applied on the number of partitions from 0 to `len(nums)`.

4. **Prefix Sum and Partition Check**:
    - Iterates over `nums`, accumulating sum, and checks if a partition sum reaches or exceeds `k`. If not, it adds operations to try to make up the difference.

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \(O(n)\)
- **Binary Search**: Up to \(O(\log n)\) iterations.
- **Feasibility Check**: \(O(n)\) for each iteration of binary search.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), making it efficient given typical input constraints.
