title:  Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating-out
permalink: /s1888
---

You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string:

1. Choose any single character of the string and flip it (i.e., change '0' to '1' or vice versa).
2. Choose any substring of the string and reverse it.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the string alternating. A string is alternating if no two adjacent characters are the same.

A binary string `s` is given, where `s` consists only of '0's and '1's.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?
    - **Answer**: The length of the string `s` will typically range from 1 to 10^5.
    
2. **Output**: Should we return the minimum number of operations as an integer?
    - **Answer**: Yes, the task is to return the minimum number of flip operations required.

3. **Example**: Can you illustrate with an example?
    - Example: 
        - Input: `s = "01001011"`
        - Output: `2`
        - Explanation: We can flip the 6th and 7th characters to make the string "01010101" which is alternating.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Generate target strings**: Consider two ideal alternating strings:
    - `alternating1`: "010101..."
    - `alternating2`: "101010..."

2. **Calculate mismatches**:
    - Calculate the number of positions where `s` does not match `alternating1`.
    - Calculate the number of positions where `s` does not match `alternating2`.

3. **Sliding window**:
    - Use a sliding window over the string `s` to consider the scenario where `s` can be circular. Compare the number of mismatches in a window of length `n` (length of `s`).

4. **Minimum flips**:
    - The minimum number of flips required will be the minimum of the mismatch counts in the sliding windows for both `alternating1` and `alternating2`.

### Code

```python
def minFlips(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    s_ext = s + s  # Extend the string to handle circular nature
    alt1 = "".join(['0' if i % 2 == 0 else '1' for i in range(2 * n)])
    alt2 = "".join(['1' if i % 2 == 0 else '0' for i in range(2 * n)])
    
    diff1 = 0
    diff2 = 0
    
    # Initial count for the first window of size n
    for i in range(n):
        if s_ext[i] != alt1[i]:
            diff1 += 1
        if s_ext[i] != alt2[i]:
            diff2 += 1
    
    min_flips = min(diff1, diff2)
    
    # Sliding window from 1 to n
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        if s_ext[i - n] != alt1[i - n]:
            diff1 -= 1
        if s_ext[i] != alt1[i]:
            diff1 += 1
        
        if s_ext[i - n] != alt2[i - n]:
            diff2 -= 1
        if s_ext[i] != alt2[i]:
            diff2 += 1
        
        min_flips = min(min_flips, diff1, diff2)
    
    return min_flips

# Example usage
s = "01001011"
print(minFlips(s))  # Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating target strings**: `O(n)`
- **Initial Diff Count for First Window**: `O(n)`
- **Sliding Window Calculation**: `O(n)`

Total Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

This is efficient enough given the constraints, since we must handle up to 100,000 characters.
