title:  Maximum Length of Pair Chain-out
permalink: /s646
---
You are given an array of `n` pairs `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [left_i, right_i]` and `left_i < right_i`.

A pair `(c, d)` can follow another pair `(a, b)` if and only if `b < c`. A chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Return the length of the longest chain which can be formed.

### Example
#### Example 1:
- Input: `pairs = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The longest chain is `[1,2] -> [3,4]`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `pairs = [[1,2], [7,8], [4,5]]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The longest chain is `[1,2] -> [4,5] -> [7,8]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all pairs guaranteed to have `left_i < right_i`?**
   - Yes, the problem statement guarantees it.
2. **Can pairs have duplicate elements?**
   - The problem does not specify, so we assume it is possible.
3. **What is the expected time complexity?**
   - Typically problems related to dynamic programming or greedy algorithms aim for O(n^2) or O(n log n) complexities.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. Here's the strategy:

1. **Sort Pairs by Ending Element**: This helps to always consider the earliest possible end for chaining which maximizes the chance of forming a longer chain.
2. **Iterate and Form the Chain**:
   - Initialize `cur_end` to negative infinity and `chain_length` to 0.
   - Iterate through the pairs.
   - If the current pair can follow the last picked pair (i.e., current pair's start is greater than `cur_end`), update `cur_end` to the end of the current pair and increment the chain length.
   
This ensures that we are always trying to extend the chain with the earliest possible end, making our solution both optimal and efficient.

### Code
```python
def findLongestChain(pairs):
    # Sort pairs by their ending element
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    cur_end = float('-inf')
    chain_length = 0
    
    for pair in pairs:
        if cur_end < pair[0]:
            cur_end = pair[1]
            chain_length += 1
            
    return chain_length

# Test cases
print(findLongestChain([[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]))  # Output: 2
print(findLongestChain([[1,2], [7,8], [4,5]]))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting Step**: O(n log n)
- **Iteration Step**: O(n)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, which is quite efficient for this problem.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently determine the maximum length of a chain that can be formed using the given pairs.
