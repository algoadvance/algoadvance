title:  Tweet Counts Per Frequency-out
permalink: /s1348
---

You need to design a class to calculate the number of tweets in a specific time interval. Implement the `TweetCounts` class:

1. `TweetCounts()` Initializes the TweetCounts object.
2. `void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time)`: Stores the `tweetName` at the recorded `time` (in seconds).
3. `List<Integer> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime)`: Returns an array of the tweet counts per frequency interval for the given `tweetName` in the specified time range `[startTime, endTime]` (inclusive).

Frequency intervals are defined as follows:
- "minute" consists of 60 seconds,
- "hour" consists of 3600 seconds, and
- "day" consists of 86400 seconds.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should we account for tweets that occur at the `endTime` boundary?
2. Can we assume `recordTweet` and `getTweetCountsPerFrequency` with the same tweetName will be called on the same `TweetCounts` object?
3. How should we handle times that are outside the given interval in `getTweetCountsPerFrequency`?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create a dictionary to store tweets by `tweetName`.
2. **Record Tweet**: Append the tweet time to the list associated with `tweetName`.
3. **Get Tweet Counts Per Frequency**:
   - Determine the interval length based on the `freq` parameter.
   - Calculate the start and end time buckets.
   - Create a result list and initialize all intervals with count zero.
   - Traverse the tweet times and count the occurrences within each bucket.

### Code

```python
class TweetCounts:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tweets = {}

    def recordTweet(self, tweetName: str, time: int) -> None:
        if tweetName not in self.tweets:
            self.tweets[tweetName] = []
        self.tweets[tweetName].append(time)

    def getTweetCountsPerFrequency(self, freq: str, tweetName: str, startTime: int, endTime: int) -> List[int]:
        if freq == 'minute':
            interval = 60
        elif freq == 'hour':
            interval = 3600
        elif freq == 'day':
            interval = 86400
        else:
            return []

        result_size = ((endTime - startTime) // interval) + 1
        result = [0] * result_size

        if tweetName in self.tweets:
            times = self.tweets[tweetName]
            for time in times:
                if startTime <= time <= endTime:
                    index = (time - startTime) // interval
                    result[index] += 1

        return result
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We maintain a dictionary `self.tweets` where keys are `tweetName`s and values are lists of times when the tweets were recorded.

2. **Record Tweet**:
   - Check if the tweet name exists in the dictionary; if not, create an entry.
   - Append the tweet time to the list of times.

3. **Get Tweet Counts Per Frequency**:
   - Determine the interval length based on the given frequency.
   - Calculate the number of intervals between `startTime` and `endTime`.
   - Initialize a list `result` with zeros to store counts for each interval.
   - Traverse through the list of tweet times for the given `tweetName` and increment the corresponding interval count.

### Time Complexity

- **recordTweet**: `O(1)` on average because appending to a list is amortized O(1).
- **getTweetCountsPerFrequency**: `O(N)` where `N` is the number of recorded tweets for the particular `tweetName`, since we potentially need to traverse all the recorded times to count them per interval.
