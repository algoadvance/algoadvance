title:  Find Median from Data Stream-out
permalink: /s295
---

The problem you are trying to solve is "295. Find Median from Data Stream" from LeetCode. The problem statement is as follows:

The `MedianFinder` class should be implemented to find the median of a data stream. Specifically, you need to:

- Implement two methods: 
  - `addNum(int num)`: Adds a number to the data stream.
  - `findMedian()`: Returns the median of all elements so far.

The median is the middle value in an ordered list of integers. If the size of the list is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

The implementation should handle the following:

- Adding numbers to the data stream efficiently.
- Retrieving the median in O(1) time complexity.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** Is there any restriction on the size of the input stream?
2. **Input Range:** What is the range of integers that the data stream can contain?
3. **Concurrency:** Will the class need to handle concurrent access, or is it safe to assume single-threaded usage?
4. **Performance Requirements:** Are there specific performance requirements or constraints we should meet?

Let's proceed to the strategy and coding.

## Strategy

To efficiently find the median from the data stream, we can use two heaps:
1. **Max heap** (to store the smaller half of the numbers).
2. **Min heap** (to store the larger half of the numbers).

Here's how the approach works:

1. **Max heap (Left side):** Stores the smaller half of the numbers (inverted to act as a max heap using negative values).
2. **Min heap (Right side):** Stores the larger half of the numbers.

We ensure that:
- The max heap will always have the same number of elements or one more element than the min heap.
- The root of the max heap will be the largest element in the smaller half.
- The root of the min heap will be the smallest element in the larger half.

**Adding a number:**

When adding a number, the decision is made whether it goes into the max heap or the min heap to maintain the balance condition.

1. If the max heap is empty or the number is less than or equal to the maximum element in the max heap, it goes into the max heap.
2. Otherwise, it goes into the min heap.

After adding the number, we might need to rebalance the heaps to maintain the size property.

**Finding the median:**

- If the heaps are of the same size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.
- If the max heap has more elements, the median is the root of the max heap.

## Code

```python
import heapq

class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        # max heap for the smaller half (using negative values to simulate a max heap in Python)
        self.max_heap = []
        # min heap for the larger half
        self.min_heap = []

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        # Add number to max heap (invert to simulate max heap)
        heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, -num)
        
        # Ensure the max heap property, i.e., max_heap's root <= min_heap's root
        if self.max_heap and self.min_heap and (-self.max_heap[0] > self.min_heap[0]):
            val = -heapq.heappop(self.max_heap)
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)

        # Balance the heaps to ensure size property
        if len(self.max_heap) > len(self.min_heap) + 1:
            val = -heapq.heappop(self.max_heap)
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        elif len(self.min_heap) > len(self.max_heap):
            val = heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
            heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, -val)

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        if len(self.max_heap) == len(self.min_heap):
            # If heaps are of equal size, median is the average of the roots
            return (-self.max_heap[0] + self.min_heap[0]) / 2.0
        else:
            # Max heap has one more element, so the root of max heap is the median
            return -self.max_heap[0]

# Example usage:
# medianFinder = MedianFinder()
# medianFinder.addNum(1)
# medianFinder.addNum(2)
# print(medianFinder.findMedian())  # Output: 1.5
# medianFinder.addNum(3)
# print(medianFinder.findMedian())  # Output: 2.0
```

## Time Complexity

1. **addNum()**: The insertion operation for each heap (max heap and min heap) is O(log n), where n is the number of elements currently in the heap.
2. **findMedian()**: The median retrieval operation is O(1) because it only involves peeking at the top elements of the heaps.

This solution offers efficient operations for both adding numbers and finding the median, meeting the required time complexity constraints.
