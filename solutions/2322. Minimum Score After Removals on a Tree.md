title:  Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree-out
permalink: /s2322
---
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and exactly `n-1` edges. Each tree node's value is represented by a value array `nums` of length `n`, where `nums[i]` is the value of the i-th node.

Remove two distinct edges from the tree, forming three connected components. Let the value of a component be the bitwise XOR of all the node values in that component. The score of the resulting partition is the maximum value of these three components' values.

Return the minimum possible score obtainable among all possible ways to partition the tree.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: 9
```
Explanation:
- Remove edges [1, 3] and [1, 2] to form three components with node values:
  - Component 1: [1,5] which has XOR value = 1 ^ 5 = 4.
  - Component 2: [4,11] which has XOR value = 4 ^ 11 = 15.
  - Component 3: [5] which has XOR value = 5.
  - The score is max(4, 15, 5) = 15.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - The tree size `n` could significantly impact the approach due to performance considerations.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values inside `nums`?**
   - Knowing the range of values helps in optimizing the solution, especially when dealing with bitwise operations.
3. **Are we guaranteed that the input forms a valid tree?**
   - Ensuring the input is a tree (no cycles and connected) is crucial for leveraging properties of trees in the solution.

### Strategy:
1. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Perform a DFS traversal to compute the XOR of values of the subtree rooted at each node, which helps quickly determine the value of any component resulting from edge removal.
  
2. **Process Edges:**
   - Consider each pair of edges, remove them, and evaluate the score of the resulting three components.
  
3. **Minimize the Score:**
   - Track the minimum score across all possible partitions.

Here's how the solution can be constructed:

### Code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def minimumScore(nums, edges):
    n = len(nums)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # Step 1: Calculate the XOR for all subtrees
    xor = [0] * n
    def dfs(node, parent):
        xor[node] = nums[node]
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue
            dfs(neighbor, node)
            xor[node] ^= xor[neighbor]

    # Initial DFS to calculate the full tree's XOR (root at node 0)
    dfs(0, -1)    
    total_xor = xor[0]  # This is the XOR of entire tree

    def find_scores():
        min_score = float('inf')
        # Try removing each pair of edges and calculate score
        for i in range(n):
            for neighbor in graph[i]:
                if xor[neighbor] == xor[i]:
                    continue

                xor1 = xor[neighbor]
                xor2 = total_xor ^ xor[neighbor]

                remaining = [1 for j in range(n) if xor[j] == xor1]
                for j in range(len(remaining) - 1):
                    cmp1 = xor1
                    cmp2 = xor[remaining[j]]
                    cmp3 = xor2 ^ xor[remaining[j]]

                    max_val = max(cmp1, cmp2, cmp3)
                    min_score = min(min_score, max_val)
                
        return min_score
    
    return find_scores()

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 5, 5, 4, 11]
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4]]
print(minimumScore(nums, edges))  # Output to be expected after implementing the algorithm
```

### Time Complexity:
- **DFS Calculation:** \(O(n)\)
- **Edge Pair Evaluation:** \(O(n^3)\) in the worst case scenario, evaluated individually.
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(n) + O(n^3)\) which simplifies to **O(n^3)** in the worst case.

The overall complexity highlights the importance of improving the evaluation of edge pairs, potentially focusing on more efficient edge pair evaluations and subtree checks.
