title:  Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition-out
permalink: /s2383
---

You are a contestant in a competition where you need to achieve certain skills in `energy` and `experience` to win a series of matches.

You are given:
- An integer `initialEnergy` representing your initial energy.
- An integer `initialExperience` representing your initial experience.
- Two integer arrays `energy`, and `experience` where:
  - `energy[i]` is the energy needed to win the i-th match.
  - `experience[i]` is the experience needed to win the i-th match.

To win a match, you need to have strictly more energy than `energy[i]` and strictly more experience than `experience[i]`.

You have to train before each match. Training increases:
- Your experience by one unit for each hour of training.
- Your energy by one unit for each hour of training.

Find the minimum number of training hours required to win all the matches.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What happens if `initialEnergy` is already more than enough to cover all energy requirements cumulatively?
   - You might still need to train to ensure you have strictly more energy than required for each individual match.

2. What if `initialExperience` is already sufficient for all matches?
   - Training is unnecessary for `experience` if the initial experience is adequate for each match, provided it is strictly more for each match.

### Strategy

1. **Energy Calculation:**
   - Compute the total energy required to win all matches (sum of `energy` array plus one extra unit per match to ensure strictly more energy).
   - If `initialEnergy` is less than this total, calculate the difference to find the required training hours for energy.

2. **Experience Calculation:**
   - Iterate through the `experience` array.
   - For each match, if `initialExperience` is less than or equal to `experience[i]`:
     - Train to increase `experience` to one more than `experience[i]`.
   - Update `initialExperience` by adding `experience[i]` after each match (since experience increases after winning the match).

3. **Sum of Training Hours:**
   - Aggregate the training hours for both energy and experience.

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the total energy requirement takes O(n) time.
- Iterating through each match to ensure `initialExperience` is sufficient also takes O(n) time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Code

```python
def minNumberOfHours(initialEnergy, initialExperience, energy, experience):
    totalEnergyRequired = sum(energy) + 1
    additionalEnergyNeeded = max(0, totalEnergyRequired - initialEnergy)

    trainingHours = additionalEnergyNeeded
    currentExperience = initialExperience

    for exp in experience:
        if currentExperience <= exp:
            trainingHours += (exp - currentExperience + 1)
            currentExperience = exp + 1
        currentExperience += exp

    return trainingHours

# Example usage:
print(minNumberOfHours(5, 3, [1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]))  # You may adjust parameters for testing
```

In this implementation, we first determine the additional energy needed to ensure an overall win. Then, we adjust for experience by iterating through each match's requirement and summing the necessary training hours.
