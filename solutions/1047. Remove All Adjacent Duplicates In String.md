title:  Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String-out
permalink: /s1047
---
Given a string `s`, a **duplicate removal** consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

#### Example:
1. Input: `s = "abbaca"`
   Output: `"ca"`
   Explanation: 
   - For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move. 
   - The resulting string is "aaca", of which only "aa" are possible moves. 
   - Finally, we remove "aa" to obtain "ca".

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input string contain non-alphabetic characters?
   - For this problem, assume the string only contains lowercase English letters.
2. What should be returned if the input string is empty?
   - An empty string should be returned.

### Strategy:
1. **Using a Stack:**
   - Use a stack to process the string. Traverse through each character in the string.
   - For each character:
     - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same as the current character, pop the top of the stack (i.e., remove the adjacent duplicates).
     - Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
   - After processing all characters, the stack will contain the resulting string with no adjacent duplicates.
2. **Return the string formed by the characters in the stack**.

### Code:

```python
def removeDuplicates(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if stack and stack[-1] == char:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(stack)

# Example usage
s = "abbaca"
print(removeDuplicates(s))  # Output: "ca"
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We traverse the string only once where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
  
### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)** in the worst case where none of the characters are adjacent duplicates, resulting in all characters being pushed on the stack.
