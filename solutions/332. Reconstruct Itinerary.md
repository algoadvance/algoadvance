title:  Reconstruct Itinerary-out
permalink: /s332
---

You are given a list of airline tickets where `tickets[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents the departure and the arrival airport of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK". Hence, the itinerary must begin with "JFK".

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

### Example:

**Input:**
```python
tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
```

**Output:**
```python
["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned in case of multiple valid itineraries with the same lexical order?**
   - There will be a unique answer with the smallest lexical order by problem statement constraints.
   
2. **How many tickets can there be?**
   - Constraints do not specify an upper limit, but we can assume reasonably large input sizes since it's a LeetCode problem.

## Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use a dictionary to represent the graph where the key is the departure airport and the value is a min-heap (priority queue) containing the arrival airports. The min-heap ensures that we always process the smallest lexical order first.

2. **Hierholzer's Algorithm:**
   - This algorithm finds an Eulerian path in a given graph. We will implement the iterative version using a stack because it is more straightforward for an interview setting.
   
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Perform DFS starting from "JFK", using a stack. When visiting a node, we recursively visit all its neighbors, and then append the current node to the result itinerary. This results in a post-order traversal, meaning we need to reverse the itinerary at the end.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Ensure all airports are used exactly once, hence the stack approach and the use of a min-heap will handle the multiple paths correctly.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the graph: O(E log E) where E is the number of tickets (due to heap operations).
- DFS Traversal: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (airports) and E is the number of edges (tickets).
- Overall: O(E log E).

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def findItinerary(tickets):
    # Create graph using defaultdict of lists
    graph = defaultdict(list)

    # Populate the graph with edges in a min-heap
    for src, dest in tickets:
        heapq.heappush(graph[src], dest)
    
    # Result array to store the itinerary
    result = []
    
    # Define recursive DFS function
    def dfs(node):
        # Explore all reachable airports in lexical order
        while graph[node]:
            next_node = heapq.heappop(graph[node])
            dfs(next_node)
        result.append(node)
    
    # Start DFS from 'JFK'
    dfs("JFK")
    
    # The result is in reverse order of the actual itinerary
    return result[::-1]

# Example usage
tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
print(findItinerary(tickets))  # Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]
```

This code correctly implements the algorithm to find the itinerary starting from "JFK" and assembles it in the smallest lexical order by leveraging a priority queue for the graph representation and a recursive DFS for traversal.
