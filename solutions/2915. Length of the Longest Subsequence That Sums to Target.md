title:  Length of the Longest Subsequence That Sums to Target-out
permalink: /s2915
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`. Return the length of the longest subsequence in `nums` that sums to `target`. If there is no such subsequence, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: 
   - What are the possible ranges for the values of elements in `nums` and for `target`?
   - Can `nums` have negative numbers?

2. **Subsequence Definition**: 
   - Does the subsequence need to be contiguous or can it consist of any set of elements in the original order?

3. **Output**: 
   - Should the function return `-1` if there is no subsequence that adds up to `target`?

### Given Constraints

1. 1 <= n <= 1000 (where n is the length of the array `nums`)
2. -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
3. -10^9 <= target <= 10^9

Given the constraints, we need to ensure our approach is efficient.

### Strategy

Given the constraints, a brute-force approach (examining all possible subsequences to find the longest one that sums up to the target) will likely be computationally infeasible. Instead, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP) along with memoization to achieve better performance.

#### Steps:

1. **DP Array**: We'll use a dictionary `dp` where `dp[i, current_sum]` will store the maximum length of a subsequence that achieves the sum `current_sum` using elements from the first `i` elements of `nums`.

2. **Transition**: For each element in `nums`, we decide whether to include it in the subsequence or not.

3. **Initialization**: Initially, `dp[0, 0]` is `0` because using `0` elements to make the sum `0` has a length of `0`.

4. **Result**: We iterate through the elements updating our DP table. Finally, if `dp[len(nums), target]` is populated, it gives us the longest subsequence length; otherwise, we return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def longest_subsequence_sum(nums, target):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # dp dictionary to keep track of maximum length for each sum
    dp = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
    dp[(0, 0)] = 0  # using 0 elements to form sum 0 has length 0

    for num in nums:
        # Create a temporary dictionary to update dp in the end of each iteration
        current_dp = dp.copy()
        for (i, curr_sum), length in dp.items():
            # If we include the current num
            new_sum = curr_sum + num
            new_index = i + 1
            current_dp[(new_index, new_sum)] = max(current_dp[(new_index, new_sum)], length + 1)
        
        dp = current_dp
    
    # Find the maximum length for the target sum
    max_length = -1
    for (i, curr_sum), length in dp.items():
        if curr_sum == target:
            max_length = max(max_length, length)
            
    return max_length

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 9
print(longest_subsequence_sum(nums, target))  # Output: 3 (subsequence [2, 3, 4] sums to 9)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n * T)`, where `n` is the length of `nums` and `T` is the range of possible sums, which could be from `-10^5` to `10^5` (dependent on the sums we explore). The space complexity is also likely `O(n * T)`, given the number of states we maintain in the `dp` dictionary. This ensures the solution is much more feasible than a brute-force approach.

The solution is efficient given the constraints, and uses memoization to prevent recomputation and handle overlapping subproblems, following principles of dynamic programming.
