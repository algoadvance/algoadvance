title:  Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I-out
permalink: /s3065
---
Given an array of integers `nums` and a threshold value `target`, we need to find the minimum number of elements we need to add up from `nums` to exceed the `target` value. If it is not possible to exceed the `target`, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the numbers in the array positive, negative, or both?**
   - The numbers can be both positive and negative.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values within the array?**
   - Assume typical constraints for LeetCode problems: array length can be up to \(10^5\) and values within the array can be as large as \(10^4\).

3. **Is the array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

4. **Can elements be used more than once?**
   - No, each element can be used only once.

### Strategy:
1. Sort the array in descending order to start with the largest elements, as this will give us the largest sums with the fewest elements.
2. Initialize a `current_sum` to 0 and a counter to keep track of the number of elements added.
3. Iterate over the sorted array and keep adding elements to the `current_sum` and increment the counter until `current_sum` exceeds the `target`.
4. If after iterating through the array the `current_sum` does not exceed the `target`, return -1.

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting the array:** \(O(N \log N)\)
- **Iterating through the array:** \(O(N)\)
- The total time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the array.

### Code:
```python
from typing import List

def min_operations(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    nums.sort(reverse=True)  # sort the array in descending order
    current_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        count += 1
        if current_sum > target:
            return count
    
    return -1  # if we exhaust the array and never exceed the target

# Example usage:
# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# target = 11
# Expected output: 3 (we can pick 5, 4, and 3 to exceed 11)
print(min_operations([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 11))
```

### Explanation of the Example:
Let's take the sample array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the target `11`.
1. After sorting in descending order: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
2. Start adding from the start and keep track of the sum:
   - Add 5, current_sum = 5, count = 1
   - Add 4, current_sum = 9, count = 2
   - Add 3, current_sum = 12, count = 3 
   - Since `current_sum` (12) now exceeds the `target` (11), we return the count, which is 3.

This approach ensures we find the minimal number of operations required to exceed the target efficiently.
