title:  Matchsticks to Square-out
permalink: /s473
---

You are given an integer array `matchsticks` where `matchsticks[i]` is the length of the `i-th` matchstick. You want to use all the matchsticks to form a square. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

Return `true` if you can make this square and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can matchsticks have zero length?**
   - No, the lengths of the matchsticks are positive integers.

2. **Can the length of matchsticks be very large?**
   - The lengths can be as large as typical integer values within the system constraints.

3. **Is the order of matchsticks in the input array significant?**
   - No, the order does not matter.

4. **Can we assume that the input list will not be empty?**
   - Yes, the input list will have at least one matchstick.

5. **Is it guaranteed that the number of matchsticks will be within a manageable range for brute force or backtracking solutions?**
   - Yes, generally the number of matchsticks will be in a range that can be handled with these techniques.

## Strategy:

To determine if the matchsticks can form a square, we can follow these steps:

1. **Check Basic Criteria:** 
   - Calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to form a square.
   - Let's call the side length of the square `side_length = total_length / 4`.

2. **Sorting for Optimization:**
   - Sort matchsticks in descending order, which helps to place longer matchsticks first and prune the search space more efficiently.

3. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - Use backtracking to try and place each matchstick into one of the 4 sides of the square. Track the lengths of the current sides being formed.
   - If at any point a side exceeds the required side length, backtrack.

4. **Implementation:** 

   Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def makesquare(matchsticks: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not matchsticks:
        return False

    total_length = sum(matchsticks)
    if total_length % 4 != 0:
        return False

    side_length = total_length // 4
    matchsticks.sort(reverse=True)  # Sorting matchsticks to optimize the backtracking part

    sides = [0] * 4

    def backtrack(index):
        if index == len(matchsticks):
            # Check if all sides are equal to required side length
            return all(side == side_length for side in sides)
        
        for i in range(4):
            if sides[i] + matchsticks[index] <= side_length:
                sides[i] += matchsticks[index]
                if backtrack(index + 1):
                    return True
                sides[i] -= matchsticks[index]
            
            # If this stick didn't fit in any of the previous sides and the current side is zero, no need to try further.
            if sides[i] == 0:
                break

        return False

    return backtrack(0)
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Sorting:** The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of matchsticks.
- **Backtracking:** In the worst case, the backtracking explores all combinations, which is \(O(4^n)\). However, sorting and placing larger matchsticks first greatly reduces the number of paths explored.

Thus, while the worst-case time complexity is high, practical performance is often acceptable due to optimizations from sorting and pruning unnecessary paths.
