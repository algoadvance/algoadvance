title:  Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles-out
permalink: /s2218
---

You are given `n` piles of coins, where each pile consists of a positive integer number of coins. The piles are represented by a 2D list `piles`, where `piles[i]` is a list of integers, representing the coins in the i-th pile. You can pick up the topmost coins from any of the piles. You need to find the maximum value of coins you can get if you are allowed to pick up `k` coins in total.

For example:
- Input: `piles = [[1,100,3],[7,8,9]], k = 2`
- Output: `101`
Explanation: You can pick up 1 coin from the first pile and 1 coin from the second pile. The maximum value you can get is 1 + 100.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the numbers of coins in the piles and their values distinct?
   - Answer: The problem doesn't state that they are distinct, so assume they can be any positive integers.
2. Can the value of `k` be larger than the total number of coins in all piles?
   - Answer: The problem implies that `k` will be a valid count, meaning it's feasible within the number of available coins.
3. Should we take the order of coin selection in a pile into consideration?
   - Answer: Yes, you can only take the topmost coins in each pile.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP):

1. **Define the DP Table:**
   - Let `dp[i][k]` represent the maximum value of coins we can obtain from the first `i` piles, by picking exactly `k` coins.

2. **Transitions:**
   - For each pile, we can decide the number of coins to take from 0 up to the minimum of the size of the pile or the remaining coins we need to take.
   - The transition will be to pick `j` coins from the current pile and the remaining `k - j` coins from the previous piles.

3. **Initialization and Result Extraction:**
   - Initialize `dp[0][j]` for varying `j` based on the first pile.
   - Our result will ultimately be in `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the total number of piles.

### Code

```python
def maxValueOfCoins(piles, k):
    # Number of piles
    n = len(piles)
    
    # Precompute prefix sums for each pile to quickly compute sums of top j coins
    prefix_sums = [[0] * (len(pile) + 1) for pile in piles]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(1, len(piles[i]) + 1):
            prefix_sums[i][j] = prefix_sums[i][j - 1] + piles[i][j - 1]
    
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Compute the dp values
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for coins in range(k + 1):
            dp[i][coins] = dp[i - 1][coins]  # Case: Take 0 coins from the current pile
            for j in range(1, min(coins, len(piles[i - 1])) + 1):
                dp[i][coins] = max(dp[i][coins], dp[i - 1][coins - j] + prefix_sums[i - 1][j])
    
    return dp[n][k]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity:** `O(n * k * m)` where `n` is the number of piles, `k` is the number of coins to pick, and `m` is the average number of coins in each pile. This is because we traverse through each pile, for each pile check up to `k` coins, and for each possible number of coins, calculate the maximum value which involves checking all possible number of coins `j` from the pile.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n * k)` for storing the DP table plus the space needed for storing prefix sums.
