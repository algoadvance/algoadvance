title:  Multiply Strings-out

---
The problem requires you to multiply two non-negative integers represented as strings and return the product, also as a string. You should not use any built-in libraries for large integers such as Python's `int` or `decimal`. The input strings consist of numeric characters only and do not contain any leading zeros, except when the input string is "0".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Size Limits**: Is there a constraint on the size of the input strings?
   - Response: Typical constraints can involve up to a few thousand digits.
   
2. **Input Validation**: Do we need to handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric characters?
   - Response: No, we may assume inputs are always valid.

3. **Leading Zeros**: How should we handle leading zeros in the result?
   - Response: The result string should not have leading zeros unless the result itself is "0".

## Strategy
To simulate the multiplication of two large integers represented as strings, we can employ a technique that mimics the manual multiplication taught in elementary school:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Treat each digit in the input strings individually.
   - Use an array to store the intermediate results of the multiplication.

2. **Multiplication**:
   - Multiply each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number.
   - Store the results in the correct position in the result array, taking into account the offset due to the positions of the digits.

3. **Handling Carry**:
   - If a position in the result array exceeds 9 (i.e., it has a carry), propagate this carry to the next position.

4. **Convert to String**:
   - Convert the result array back into a string, skipping any leading zeros in the process.

5. **Edge Case**:
   - If both inputs are "0", return "0".

## Code
```python
def multiply(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    if num1 == "0" or num2 == "0":
        return "0"
    
    len1, len2 = len(num1), len(num2)
    # Result can be at most len1 + len2 digits
    result = [0] * (len1 + len2)
    
    # Reverse both strings to simplify position handling
    num1, num2 = num1[::-1], num2[::-1]
    
    # Multiply each digit and add to result
    for i in range(len1):
        for j in range(len2):
            digit_mul = int(num1[i]) * int(num2[j])
            result[i + j] += digit_mul
            # Handle carry over to the next position
            result[i + j + 1] += result[i + j] // 10
            result[i + j] %= 10
    
    # Convert result to string and remove leading zeros
    while len(result) > 1 and result[-1] == 0:
        result.pop()
    
    return ''.join(map(str, result[::-1]))

# Example usage
num1 = "123"
num2 = "456"
print(multiply(num1, num2))  # Output: "56088"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `num1` and \(m\) is the length of `num2`. This is because we have nested loops iterating over each digit of both numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\) to store the intermediate results and the final product.
