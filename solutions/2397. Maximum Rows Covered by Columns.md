title:  Maximum Rows Covered by Columns-out
permalink: /s2397
---

You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix `mat` and an integer `cols`, which denotes the number of columns you must choose. Suppose you select the set of `cols` columns. A row is covered if it contains at least one '1' in the selected set of columns.

Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by a selection of `cols` columns.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints on `m` and `n`:**
   Could you provide the range of values for `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns)?

2. **Input guarantees:**
   Can we assume the input matrix `mat` always contains valid binary entries (0 or 1)?

3. **Output details:**
   Should the output be the exact number of rows covered as an integer?

Assuming typical constraints for LeetCode problems, such as `1 <= m, n <= 15` and `1 <= cols <= n`.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we should explore all possible combinations of selecting `cols` columns from the `n` columns available. For each combination of columns, we can check how many rows are covered.

Steps:

1. **Generate All Possible Column Combinations:**
   We need to generate all possible ways to select `cols` columns from `n` columns. This can be done using combinations from the `itertools` module.

2. **Count Covered Rows:**
   For each combination of columns, we will count how many rows have at least one `1` in the selected columns.

3. **Track Maximum Rows Covered:**
   Keep track of the maximum number of rows that can be covered by any combination of selected columns.

### Code:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def maximumRows(mat, cols):
    m = len(mat)
    n = len(mat[0])
    
    max_covered_rows = 0
    
    # Iterate over all combinations of selecting `cols` columns out of `n` columns
    for columns in combinations(range(n), cols):
        covered_rows = 0
        
        for row in mat:
            # Check if the row is covered by any of the chosen columns
            if any(row[col] == 1 for col in columns):
                covered_rows += 1
        
        max_covered_rows = max(max_covered_rows, covered_rows)
    
    return max_covered_rows

# Example usage
mat = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
]
cols = 2
print(maximumRows(mat, cols))  # Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Combination Generation:** There are `C(n, cols)` (binomial coefficient) ways to choose `cols` columns out of `n`.
- **Row Checking:** For each combination, we need to check all `m` rows, where each check involves `cols` comparisons.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(C(n, cols) \times m \times cols)\), where `C(n, cols)` represents the binomial coefficient.

Considering the constraints (with n typically being up to 15), this approach should be efficient and manageable within typical limits for combinatorial problems.
