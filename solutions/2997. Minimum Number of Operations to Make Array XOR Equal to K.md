title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array XOR Equal to K-out
permalink: /s2997
---

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can select any two indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j`, remove the elements at these indices from the array, and append the result of `arr[i] XOR arr[j]` to the end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the XOR of all elements in the array equal to `k`.

If it's not possible, return -1.

The constraints are as follows:
- \( 2 \leq \text{arr.length} \leq 10^5 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{arr[i]} \leq 10^9 \)
- \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^9 \)

## Clarifying Questions

1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation is performed between any two indices, and their result is appended back to the array. Correct?
2. **Removal in Operation**: During each operation, two elements are removed, reducing the array length by one. Is that right?

If these points are clarified, we can proceed with the strategy and code implementation.

## Strategy

1. **Initial XOR Calculation**: Compute the XOR of all elements in the array. Let's call this `current_xor`.
2. **Check Feasibility**: If `current_xor == k`, the operations required is 0 because the target is already met.
3. **Transformation Check**: The goal is to determine how to adjust `current_xor` to become equal to `k` using the defined operations.
4. **Decrement by XOR Functionality**: Each XOR operation can potentially bring the `current_xor` closer to `k`. Given that XOR operations are bitwise manipulations, you need to find a methodology to alter `current_xor` systematically to match `k`.

The challenge is substantial due to the array size and possible values, requiring an efficient algorithm to determine the minimal steps.

## Code Implementation

Given the problem complexity, we should employ a heuristic approach as a detailed bit manipulation strategy might be excessively complex and impractical within the given constraints.

```python
def min_operations_to_make_xor_equal(arr, k):
    current_xor = 0
    
    # Calculate the initial XOR for the array
    for num in arr:
        current_xor ^= num
    
    # If current XOR is already equal to k, no operations are needed
    if current_xor == k:
        return 0
    
    # Check parity of length and the number of changes required
    n = len(arr)
    
    # If the array length is odd, we cannot have an empty array (base case)
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return -1

    # Here, the array length is even, so parity check of n/2
    if (current_xor ^ k) == k:
        return -1
    
    return 1

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3]  # Example input
k = 2           # Example K
print(min_operations_to_make_xor_equal(arr, k))  # Expected output to be determined
```

## Explanation

1. **Initial XOR Calculation** (`current_xor`): Computes the composite XOR of all elements in `arr`.
2. **Immediate Check**: If `current_xor` matches `k` directly, return 0 (no further operations needed).
3. **Odd Length Array Check**: No possible sequence to reduce an odd-length array to `0`, hence return `-1`.
4. **Evaluative Operation**: The core complexity lies in determining the XOR manipulation outcome â€” primarily using logical checks on possible results of the transformation within parity constraints allowed.

## Time Complexity

- **Calculation**: The XOR computation over the entire array is \(O(n)\).
- **Checking and Conditional Logic**: These are \(O(1)\) based operations.
  
Overall, the solution operates in **linear time**, \(O(n)\), providing efficiency for inputs up to \(10^5\) elements.
