Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Example:**
```
Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string has a total of three '1' bits.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Type and Format:**
   - What is the type of input? Is it a binary string or an integer?
   - Will the input always have exactly 32 bits?
   
2. **Expected Output:**
   - Is the expected output an integer indicating the count of '1' bits?

Once clarified, let's assume:
- The input is a non-negative integer.
- We need to count the number of '1' bits in its binary representation.

### Strategy
1. **Bit Manipulation Approach - Using Python's Built-in Functions:**
   - Convert the integer to its binary representation using the `bin()` function.
   - Count the number of '1's in the string representation of the binary number.

2. **Loop and Bitwise Operation Approach:**
   - Use a loop to repeatedly check the least significant bit and use a right shift to process the number bit by bit.
   - Use the bitwise AND operation to check if the least significant bit is '1'.

### Code
```python
def hammingWeight(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\) because the maximum number of bits to check is constant (32 bits for a standard unsigned integer in most programming environments).
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as well, since we are using a constant amount of space irrespective of the input size.

### Explanation
- `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of '1' bits.
- In the while loop:
  - `n & 1` checks if the least significant bit of `n` is '1' (this is the bitwise AND operation).
  - If it is '1', we increment `count`.
  - `n >>= 1` shifts the bits of `n` to the right by 1, effectively removing the least significant bit.
- The loop continues until all bits of `n` have been processed (i.e., `n` becomes 0).
- Finally, we return the count of '1's.
