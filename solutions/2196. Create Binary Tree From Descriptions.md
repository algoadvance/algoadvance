title:  Create Binary Tree From Descriptions-out
permalink: /s2196
---

You are given a 2D integer array `descriptions` where each `descriptions[i] = [parent_i, child_i, isLeft_i]` indicates that `parent_i` is the parent of `child_i` in a binary tree and `isLeft_i` is `1` if `child_i` is the left child of `parent_i`, and `0` if `child_i` is the right child of `parent_i`.

Your task is to create the binary tree and return the root node of the tree.

**Constraints:**
1. The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
2. `descriptions[i].length == 3`
3. `1 <= parent_i, child_i <= 10^5`
4. `0 <= isLeft_i <= 1`
5. All `parent_i` and `child_i` are unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should we return if the `descriptions` array is empty? 
   - Typically, an empty array would mean there is no tree to create, hence we return `None`.

2. Are all node values positive integers?
   - Yes, according to the constraints.

3. Can we assume there are no cycles in the input descriptions?
   - Yes, since it should form a valid binary tree.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a dictionary to map each value to its corresponding `TreeNode`.
   - Use a set to keep track of all child nodes.

2. **Tree Construction**:
   - Iterate over each description:
     - Retrieve/create the `parent` and `child` nodes.
     - Link the `child` to the `parent` according to `isLeft`.
     - Record the `child` in the set of children.
   
3. **Finding the Root**:
   - The root will be the node which is not present in the set of all children as it is never a `child`.

4. **Return the Root**:
   - Traverse the map to find the one node not in children set and return it.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def createBinaryTree(descriptions):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    nodes = {}
    children = set()
    
    # Creating all nodes and relationships
    for parent_val, child_val, isLeft in descriptions:
        if parent_val not in nodes:
            nodes[parent_val] = TreeNode(parent_val)
        if child_val not in nodes:
            nodes[child_val] = TreeNode(child_val)
        
        parent_node = nodes[parent_val]
        child_node = nodes[child_val]
        
        if isLeft == 1:
            parent_node.left = child_node
        else:
            parent_node.right = child_node
        
        children.add(child_val)
    
    # The root is the one node that is not a child of any node
    root = None
    for node_val in nodes:
        if node_val not in children:
            root = nodes[node_val]
            break
    
    return root
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Lookup**: Each insertion and lookup operation in a dictionary is \(O(1)\).
- **Construction of Tree**: Iterating through the `descriptions` list takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes.
- **Finding the Root**: Takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case to find the root.
- **Overall**: The total time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This is efficient considering the constraints given.
