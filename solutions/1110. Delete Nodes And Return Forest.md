title:  Delete Nodes And Return Forest-out
permalink: /s1110
---

Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value. After deleting all nodes with a value in the given integer array `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees). Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
Explanation: The nodes with values 3 and 5 are deleted. The resulting forest will be:
         1           6     7
       /   \
      2     4
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
- Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `to_delete.length` <= 1000

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `to_delete` array be empty?**
   - Yes, and in that case, the original tree should be returned as-is in the result.
   
2. **Do we need to maintain the original order of nodes in the forest?**
   - No, the order of the trees in the return list does not matter.

3. **Can we assume that the values in `to_delete` are guaranteed to be present in the tree?**
   - No, and we need to check and only delete if the node exists in the tree.

## Strategy
1. **Convert `to_delete` Array to Set**:
   - Convert the `to_delete` list to a set for faster lookups.
   
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Implement DFS to traverse the tree.
   - Use recursion to check each node:
     - If the node is to be deleted, recursively check its children and add them to the result forest if they are not deleted.
     - If the node is not deleted, ensure it's properly connected in the resulting forest.
     
3. **Root Handling**:
   - Start the DFS from the root.
   - Add the root to the result list if it is not deleted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `to_delete` is empty, return the original root.
   - If the tree is empty (root is `None`), return an empty list.
   
## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N + D)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree and `D` is the number of nodes to delete.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N + D)` due to the recursion stack, the `to_delete` set, and the result list.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def delNodes(root, to_delete):
    to_delete_set = set(to_delete)
    forest = []

    def dfs(node, is_root):
        if not node:
            return None
        
        # This node needs to be a root if it is not deleted
        node_is_deleted = node.val in to_delete_set
        if is_root and not node_is_deleted:
            forest.append(node)
        
        # Recur for children
        node.left = dfs(node.left, node_is_deleted)
        node.right = dfs(node.right, node_is_deleted)
        
        return None if node_is_deleted else node
    
    dfs(root, True)
    return forest
```

This code will perform DFS, remove the necessary nodes while ensuring the correct roots are added to the result forest and handle edge cases appropriately.
