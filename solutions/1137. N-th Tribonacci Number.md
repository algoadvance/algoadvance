title:  N-th Tribonacci Number-out
permalink: /s1137
---

The Tribonacci sequence Tn is defined as follows: 

T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1, and Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0.

Given `n`, return the value of Tn.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
T_3 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
T_4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 25
Output: 1389537
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:**
   - What is the range of `n`? 
     - The range of `n` is 0 <= n <= 37.
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - Is there any constraint on time complexity we need to meet?
     - Although not explicitly stated, the solution should be efficient to handle the upper bound.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we have a few approaches:

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Directly implement the recursive definition. However, this might be inefficient due to repeated calculations.

2. **Memoization:**
   - Use a dictionary or list to store previously computed values to avoid repeated calculations.
   
3. **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up):**
   - Iteratively compute values starting from base cases up to `n`. This approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of recursion.

### Time Complexity

- **Recursive Approach:** Without memoization, the time complexity is exponential, specifically O(2^n), which is impractical for larger values of `n`.
- **Memoization:** Reduces the time complexity to O(n) with a space complexity of O(n).
- **Dynamic Programming:** Provides O(n) in both time and space complexity, which is the most optimal for this problem.

Given that `n` can go up to 37, we will use the dynamic programming approach for an efficient solution.

### Code

```python
def tribonacci(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the base values
    trib = [0] * (n + 1)
    trib[0] = 0
    trib[1] = 1
    trib[2] = 1
    
    # Fill the tribonacci series values up to nth
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        trib[i] = trib[i - 1] + trib[i - 2] + trib[i - 3]
        
    return trib[n]

# Example usage:
print(tribonacci(4))  # Output: 4
print(tribonacci(25))  # Output: 1389537
```

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases:**
   - We handle the simplest cases where `n` is 0, 1, or 2 directly by returning their known values.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization:**
   - Create an array `trib` where `trib[i]` holds the value of the i-th Tribonacci number.
   
3. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - Begin from index 3 and iteratively compute `trib[i]` using the formula `trib[i] = trib[i - 1] + trib[i - 2] + trib[i - 3]`.
   
4. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, return `trib[n]` as the result.

By following this approach, we ensure that we compute the Tribonacci number efficiently and within optimal time and space complexity.
