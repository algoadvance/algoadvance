title:  Painting the Walls-out
permalink: /s2742
---

You are given an integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of painting the `i-th` wall. Additionally, you can only paint one wall in each day. However, you have a constraint that after painting a wall, you cannot paint the next `days` walls due to drying time.

Your goal is to find the maximum number of walls you can paint given the constraints. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the array `costs`?**
   - This will help us determine the scalability of the solution, i.e., whether it will run within a reasonable time frame.
2. **Can the costs be zero or negative?**
   - This will help us understand if we need to handle special cases.
3. **Is the constraint for the next `days` walls always the same?**
   - This will determine the simplicity or complexity of our algorithm.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of walls that can be painted up to the `i-th` wall.
   - We'll iterate through each wall and try to paint it while respecting the constraints.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a DP array `dp` of length `n` (where `n` is the length of the `costs` array) to `0`.
2. Iterate through each wall:
   - For each wall `i`, compute the maximum walls that can be painted if we decide to paint this wall.
   - Update the DP array accordingly by checking previous walls that respect the `days` constraint.
3. Return the maximum value in the `dp` array at the end.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach will be `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of walls. We iterate through each wall and make constant-time updates based on previous results.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def maxNumberOfWalls(costs, days):
    n = len(costs)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize dp array to store the maximum number of walls painted up to each wall.
    dp = [0] * n
    
    # Iterate through each wall
    for i in range(n):
        # If painting the first wall, we start from zero constraints.
        if i == 0:
            dp[i] = 1
        else:
            # If we paint this wall, we can't paint the next `days` walls
            if i > days:
                # Include current wall and the best option of the wall before considering `days` constraint.
                dp[i] = max(dp[i - days - 1] + 1, dp[i - 1])
            else:
                # If days constraint can't apply, we just increment since there's no `days` walls to skip.
                dp[i] = 1
        
        # Max of not handling the current wall and the previous walls.
        if i > 1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1])
    
    # Return the maximum value up to the last wall.
    return dp[-1]

# Example Usage
costs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
days = 2
print(maxNumberOfWalls(costs, days))  # Output will depend on the constraints
```

This code initializes the `dp` array and iterates through each wall, updating the number of walls painted considering the `days` constraint. The result is the maximum number of walls that can be painted given these constraints.
