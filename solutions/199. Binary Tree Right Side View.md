title:  Binary Tree Right Side View-out
permalink: /s199

### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. Imagine yourself standing on the right side of it; you should return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the tree is empty?**
   - Return an empty list.

2. **Can nodes have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, nodes can have duplicate values.

3. **What is the expected output for a right-skewed tree or a left-skewed tree?**
   - For a right-skewed tree, all nodes will be visible. For a left-skewed tree, only one node per level will be visible, as no nodes obscure the view from the right side.

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Level-order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)**:
   - Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
   - For each level of the tree, keep track of the last node's value, since that will be the one visible from the right side.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def rightSideView(root: TreeNode) -> list[int]:
    if not root:
        return []

    right_view = []
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        level_length = len(queue)
        for i in range(level_length):
            node = queue.popleft()
            if i == level_length - 1:
                # the rightmost element of this level
                right_view.append(node.val)
                
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
                
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

    return right_view
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(N)**, where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we're visiting each node exactly once during the traversal.

The space complexity is also **O(N)** in the worst case. This is due to the queue used for the breadth-first search, which in the worst case can store up to half the number of nodes at the last level of a complete binary tree.
