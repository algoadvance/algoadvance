You are given a list of non-negative integers, `nums`. Arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it. Since the result may be very large, you need to return a string representation of the number.

### Examples:
1. Input: `nums = [10, 2]`
   Output: `"210"`

2. Input: `nums = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]`
   Output: `"9534330"`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can the numbers in the list be very large?
   **A:** Yes, that's why the final result has to be a string.
   
2. **Q:** Should the solution handle cases with leading zeros in the output?
   **A:** Yes, the solution should handle and remove any unnecessary leading zeros.

3. **Q:** What should the function return if all elements in the list are zeros?
   **A:** It should return "0".

## Strategy:
1. **Custom Sorting**: The primary challenge is the sorting order. To decide the order between two numbers, compare the concatenation results of both possible orders. For example, to decide between `3` and `30`, compare `330` (3+30) and `303` (30+3). Since `330` is greater, `3` should come before `30`.
2. **String Conversion**: Convert the integers to strings for easy concatenation and comparison.
3. **Sorting Implementation**: Use Pythonâ€™s built-in sorting functions with a custom comparator based on the concatenation result.
4. **Edge Handling**: After sorting and concatenation, handle any leading zeros by converting the final result to an integer and back to string.

## Code:

```python
from functools import cmp_to_key

def largestNumber(nums):
    # Custom comparator function
    def compare(x, y):
        if x + y > y + x:
            return -1
        elif x + y < y + x:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

    # Convert integers to strings
    str_nums = list(map(str, nums))
    
    # Sort based on custom comparator
    str_nums.sort(key=cmp_to_key(compare))
    
    # Join sorted strings
    largest_num = ''.join(str_nums)
    
    # Handle leading zeros
    return '0' if largest_num[0] == '0' else largest_num

# Example usage:
nums1 = [10, 2]
print(largestNumber(nums1))  # Output: "210"

nums2 = [3, 30, 34, 5, 9]
print(largestNumber(nums2))  # Output: "9534330"
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Sorting Complexity**: Sorting the strings takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input list.
- **Comparison Complexity**: Each string comparison runs in \(O(1)\) time due to the fixed maximum length of 18 digits (since `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9` and each number is concatenated at most twice).

Overall, the algorithm runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints.
