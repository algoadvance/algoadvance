title:  Remove Nodes From Linked List-out
permalink: /s2487

### Problem Statement:
Given the head of a linked list, remove nodes from the linked list that have a value strictly smaller than the maximum value to their right, and return the head of the modified linked list.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the structure of the linked list node?**
   - Usually, in LeetCode, a linked list node is defined as:
     ```python
     class ListNode:
         def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
             self.val = val
             self.next = next
     ```

2. **Can the linked list be empty?**
   - Yes, edge cases should include an empty list.

3. **Is there any particular order in which nodes should be removed?**
   - Nodes with values smaller than any value to their right in the list should be removed.

4. **What should be returned if all nodes are removed or the list is empty?**
   - Return `None` for an empty list.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
1. **Reverse the linked list**: By reversing, the maximum value will be encountered first.
2. **Traverse the reversed list**: Track the maximum value seen so far.
3. **Construct the new list**: Only include nodes whose values are greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far.
4. **Reverse the new list back**: To restore the original order but without the unwanted nodes.

### Code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverse_linked_list(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

def removeNodes(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # Reverse the linked list
    reversed_head = reverse_linked_list(head)
    
    # Remove nodes with values smaller than the maximum value encountered so far
    new_head = ListNode(0)  # Dummy node to ease list construction
    new_list_tail = new_head
    max_value = float('-inf')
    current = reversed_head
    
    while current:
        if current.val >= max_value:
            max_value = current.val
            new_list_tail.next = ListNode(current.val)
            new_list_tail = new_list_tail.next
        current = current.next
    
    # Reverse the new list to restore original order
    return reverse_linked_list(new_head.next)

# Helper function to print list (for illustrating purpose)
def print_list(head: ListNode):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.val, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")

# Usage example
head = ListNode(5, ListNode(2, ListNode(13, ListNode(3, ListNode(8)))))
result = removeNodes(head)
print_list(result)  # Output for example usage
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Reversing the list**: \(O(n)\)
- **Traversing the reversed list and constructing the new list**: \(O(n)\)
- **Reversing the final list**: \(O(n)\)
  
**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

This solution ensures that all nodes with values smaller than any values to their right are removed efficiently and the list is returned in the correct order.
