title:  Minimum Levels to Gain More Points-out
permalink: /s3096
---

You are given a list of integers representing the points you gain from completing a series of levels in a game. You can complete the levels in any order you want. Your objective is to determine the minimum number of levels you need to complete in order to gain more points than a given threshold.

Formally, given a list of integers `points` and an integer `threshold`, find the minimum number of levels you need to complete such that the sum of the points from these levels is greater than `threshold`. If it's not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the points for the levels be negative?**
   - No, all points are non-negative.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that the threshold will be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, the threshold will always be positive.

3. **Can the input list be empty?**
   - Yes, the input list can be empty. If the list is empty and the threshold is positive, it's impossible to gain any points, so we should return -1.

### Strategy

1. **Sort and Greedy Approach**: 
    - Sort the list of points in descending order.
    - Iterate through the sorted list and keep a running total of the points.
    - Keep track of the number of levels completed.
    - Stop iterating as soon as the running total exceeds the threshold.
    - If the end of the list is reached without surpassing the threshold, return -1.

### Code Implementation

```python
def min_levels_to_gain_points(points, threshold):
    # Edge case: if the list is empty and the threshold is positive, return -1
    if not points:
        return -1
    
    # Sort the points in descending order
    points.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_points = 0
    num_levels = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list and accumulate points
    for point in points:
        total_points += point
        num_levels += 1
        if total_points > threshold:
            return num_levels
    
    # If we finish the loop and haven't surpassed the threshold, return -1
    return -1

# Example usage:
points = [1, 5, 2, 3, 9]
threshold = 10
print(min_levels_to_gain_points(points, threshold))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the list takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of levels.
- Iterating through the sorted list takes \(O(n)\) time.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution should be efficient for typical problem constraints you might find in a coding interview.
