title:  XOR Queries of a Subarray-out
permalink: /s1310

### Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` of positive integers and an array `queries` where `queries[i] = [L_i, R_i]`. For each query, compute the XOR of elements from index `L_i` to `R_i` (both inclusive) and return the result as an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size:** What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and `queries`?
   - Typical constraints could range from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **Element values:** What are the constraints on the values of elements in `arr`?
   - Usually, they are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **XOR Properties:**
   - XOR is a bitwise operator where \(x \oplus x = 0\) and \(x \oplus 0 = x\).
   - XOR is also associative and commutative.

2. **Optimization using Prefix XOR:**
   - Instead of recalculating the XOR for every query, we can use a prefix XOR array to speed up our computation.
   - Define `prefix_xor[i]` as the XOR of all elements from the start of the array to index \(i\).
   - The XOR of elements from \(L\) to \(R\) can be computed as:
     \[
     \text{xor}(L, R) = \text{prefix\_xor}[R+1] \oplus \text{prefix\_xor}[L]
     \]
   - This allows each query to be answered in constant time after an initial \(O(n)\) preprocessing step.

### Code

Here's the implementation using the described strategy:

```python
def xorQueries(arr, queries):
    n = len(arr)
    # Step 1: Calculate prefix xor
    prefix_xor = [0] * (n+1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_xor[i+1] = prefix_xor[i] ^ arr[i]
    
    # Step 2: Process each query
    result = []
    for L, R in queries:
        result.append(prefix_xor[R+1] ^ prefix_xor[L])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 3, 4, 8]
queries = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 3], [3, 3]]
print(xorQueries(arr, queries))  # Output: [2, 7, 14, 8]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Preprocessing (prefix_xor array):** \(O(n)\)
2. **Answering each query:** \(O(1)\) per query, with `k` queries this becomes \(O(k)\).

Overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n + k) \]

This is efficient and should work well within typical problem constraints.
