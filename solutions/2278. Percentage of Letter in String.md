title:  Percentage of Letter in String-out
permalink: /s2278
---

You are given a string `s` and a character `letter`. You need to return the percentage of characters in `s` that are equal to `letter` rounded down to the nearest whole percent.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Can `s` contain non-alphabetic characters?
   - Is the comparison case-sensitive?

2. **Output Details:**
   - Should the result be an integer?

### Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences:**
   - Traverse the string `s` and count how many times the character `letter` appears.

2. **Calculate the Percentage:**
   - Compute the percentage by dividing the count of `letter` by the length of the string `s`, multiplying by 100, and then using integer division to round down to the nearest whole number.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string `s` is empty, the function should handle it appropriately, although typically this edge case may not be needed if input constraints guarantee a non-empty string.

### Code

```python
def percentageLetter(s: str, letter: str) -> int:
    # Count occurrences of the specified letter in the string
    count = s.count(letter)
    
    # Calculate the percentage and round down to the nearest integer
    percentage = (count * 100) // len(s)
    
    return percentage
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because the `count` method in Python traverses the entire string to count occurrences of `letter`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input string.

This strategy effectively counts the number of occurrences and calculates the percentage in a straightforward manner, ensuring both efficiency and simplicity.
