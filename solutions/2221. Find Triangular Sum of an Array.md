title:  Find Triangular Sum of an Array-out
permalink: /s2221
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The triangular sum of `nums` is the value of the only element present in `nums` after the following process terminates:

1. Let `nums` consist of `n` elements. If `n == 1`, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array of length `n-1` where the `i`-th element (0 <= i < n - 1) is equal to `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`.
2. Replace `nums` with the new array and repeat the entire process.

Return the triangular sum of `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of the input array `nums`?
2. Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums` beyond being digits (0-9)?

Assuming standard constraints and no edge cases beyond what's specified:

## Strategy

1. Initialize the array `nums` as given.
2. Iteratively transform the array by creating new arrays of size one less than the current array by summing adjacent elements modulo 10.
3. Continue this process until the array size is reduced to 1.
4. Return the single remaining element of the array.

## Code

```python
def triangularSum(nums):
    while len(nums) > 1:
        nums = [(nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10 for i in range(len(nums) - 1)]
    return nums[0]

# Example usage:
print(triangularSum([1,2,3,4,5]))  # Output should be 8
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for each iteration reduces the size of the array by one. The outer loop runs `n-1` times (where `n` is the initial size of `nums`). Each iteration itself involves an array traversal of decreasing size:

    (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 1

This forms an arithmetic series, the sum of which is given by:

    (n-1)n / 2

Hence, the time complexity is **O(nÂ²)**.

## Space Complexity

The auxiliary space used is negligible (constant space) since the operations are done in place with a new list being created iteratively of reducing size. Hence, the space complexity is **O(1)**.
