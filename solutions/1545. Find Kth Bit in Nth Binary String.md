title:  Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String-out
permalink: /s1545
---
Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, the task is to find the `k`-th bit in the `n`-th binary string in a special sequence. The sequence is generated as follows:
- `S1 = "0"`
- `Sn` is defined recursively as `Sn = Sn-1 + "1" + reverse(invert(Sn-1))`

Here, `reverse(x)` means reversing the string `x`, and `invert(x)` means inverting all the bits in the string `x` (changing `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on `n` and `k`?**
    - Typically, constraints on the values of `n` and `k` are mentioned, like \(1 \leq n \leq 20\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 2^n - 1\).
    
2. **What is the expected output?**
   - The function should return the character ('0' or '1') at the `k`-th position in the `n`-th binary string.

### Strategy
- Trying to directly compute `Sn` can be extremely inefficient due to its exponential growth.
- Instead, an efficient approach involves understanding the recursive construction of `Sn`, allowing us to determine the `k`-th bit without generating the entire string.
- The recursive generation of `Sn` suggests a recursive solution where we can break down the problem:
  - If `k` is in the first half of `Sn-1`, it remains unchanged.
  - If `k` is exactly at the middle point, it is `1`.
  - If `k` is in the reversed and inverted second half, we should map `k` to its position in `Sn-1`, invert, and reverse the result.

### Code

```python
def findKthBit(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    def invert(c: str) -> str:
        return '1' if c == '0' else '0'
    
    def findKth(n: int, k: int) -> str:
        if n == 1:
            return '0'
        length_of_sn_minus_1 = (1 << (n - 1)) - 1
        middle_index = length_of_sn_minus_1 + 1
        if k == middle_index:
            return '1'
        elif k < middle_index:
            return findKth(n - 1, k)
        else:
            return invert(findKth(n - 1, 2 * middle_index - k))
    
    return findKth(n, k)

# Example usage
n = 3
k = 5
print(findKthBit(n, k))  # Output should be '1'
```

### Time Complexity
- Each recursive call decreases `n` by 1, leading to a logarithmic stack depth with respect to `n`, i.e., O(n).
- Each level of recursion involves at most constant work to determine which part of the string `k` resides in.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

This approach ensures efficient computation of the `k`-th bit without generating the enormous binary strings explicitly.
