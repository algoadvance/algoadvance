title:  Remove Invalid Parentheses-out
permalink: /s301
---
Given a string `s` that contains parentheses and lowercase letters, you need to remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid. Return all possible results. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `s = "()())()"`
- **Output:** `["()()()", "(())()"]`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `s = "(a)())()"`
- **Output:** `["(a)()()", "(a())()"]`

### Example 3:
- **Input:** `s = ")("`
- **Output:** `[""]`

You need to find all possible ways to remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses. 

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the string `s` be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, the input string `s` can be empty, and the output should be an array containing an empty string.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of `s`?
   - **A:** No specific constraints are given, but the length can be assumed to be moderately large for practical purposes.

3. **Q:** Should the order of the solutions matter in the output list?
   - **A:** No, the order of solutions in the output list does not matter.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The key idea is to generate all possible strings by removing one parenthesis at each level and to check if the string is valid.

1. Use a queue to store the current level of strings to process.
2. Use a set to store visited strings to avoid processing the same string multiple times.
3. For each string, if it is valid, add it to the result list.
4. If none of the strings at the current level are valid, add their children (strings formed by removing a single parenthesis) to the queue.
5. Stop the process once any valid strings are found at a level.

## Code
```python
from collections import deque

def removeInvalidParentheses(s: str):
    def is_valid(string):
        # Helper function to check if a string is a valid parentheses string
        count = 0
        for char in string:
            if char == '(':
                count += 1
            elif char == ')':
                count -= 1
                if count < 0:
                    return False
        return count == 0

    # Initialize BFS
    queue = deque([s])
    visited = set([s])
    result = []
    found = False

    while queue:
        current_level = len(queue)
        for _ in range(current_level):
            expr = queue.popleft()
            
            if is_valid(expr):
                result.append(expr)
                found = True
            
            if found:
                continue
            
            # Remove one parenthesis at a time and add new string to queue
            for i in range(len(expr)):
                if expr[i].isalpha():
                    continue
                next_expr = expr[:i] + expr[i+1:]
                if next_expr not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_expr)
                    queue.append(next_expr)
                    
        if found:
            break
            
    return result
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the length of the input string `s`. This accounts for generating all possible subsequences.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * 2^N) to hold all possible generated strings and the visited set.

This solution effectively finds all valid strings by minimizing the number of removed parentheses using a level-wise exploration approach.
