title:  Valid Word-out
permalink: /s3136

The problem *3136. Valid Word-out* (assuming the name might need clarification) is likely about determining whether words in a puzzle or a list adhere to certain rules. Unfortunately, the provided problem number does not directly correspond to a specific well-known problem description, so I'll assume a standard format of verifying the validity of words based on certain constraints. 

Let's define a problem statement:

> Given a list of words and a set of characters, write a function `is_valid_word` that checks if each word can be formed using the characters from the given set. Each character in the set can only be used once per word.
> 
> Input:
> - `words` (list of strings): A list containing multiple words.
> - `chars` (string): A string which contains the allowed characters.
>
> Output:
> - A list of boolean values where each boolean value corresponds to whether the word at the respective index in the input list can be formed using the given characters.
>
> Example:
> ```
> words = ["hello", "world", "leetcode"]
> chars = "welldonehatch"
> ```
> Output:
> ```
> [True, True, False]
> ```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
   - Assume that the comparison is case-sensitive.

2. **Special Characters**: Can words and characters include special characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation)?
   - Yes, both words and chars can include special characters.

3. **Multiple Uses**: Can characters in the set `chars` be used more than once?
   - No, each character in the set `chars` can only be used once per word.

### Strategy
1. **Character Frequency Count**:
   - Calculate the frequency count of each character in `chars`.
   
2. **Word Validation**:
   - For each word, calculate the frequency count of characters and compare it with the frequency count of `chars`.
   - Check if each character in the word can be satisfied by the character count in `chars`.

3. **Output**:
   - Return a list of boolean values indicating whether each word can be formed.

### Code
Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def is_valid_word(words, chars):
    chars_count = Counter(chars)
    result = []
    
    for word in words:
        word_count = Counter(word)
        is_valid = True
        for char in word_count:
            if word_count[char] > chars_count.get(char, 0):
                is_valid = False
                break
        result.append(is_valid)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
words = ["hello", "world", "leetcode"]
chars = "welldonehatch"
print(is_valid_word(words, chars))  # Output: [True, True, False]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building Counter for `chars`**: O(n) where n is the length of `chars`.
- **Validation for each word**: O(m * k) where m is the number of words and k is the average length of the words.
   
Overall Time Complexity: **O(n + m * k)** which is efficient for typical input sizes.
