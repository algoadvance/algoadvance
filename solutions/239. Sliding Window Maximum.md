title:  Sliding Window Maximum-out
permalink: /s239
---

You are given an array of integers `nums`, and there is a sliding window of size `k` that moves from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position, you should return the maximum value in the window.

Implement the function `maxSlidingWindow(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `nums` be an empty list?
   **A:** Yes, if `nums` is empty, the output should also be an empty list.

2. **Q:** What is the minimum value of `k`?
   **A:** The minimum value of `k` is 1.

3. **Q:** Can `k` be larger than the length of `nums`?
   **A:** No, `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

4. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?
   **A:** There are no specific constraints mentioned, but we can assume `nums` contains integers.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a **deque** (double-ended queue) to store indices of the array elements. Hereâ€™s the detailed strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an empty deque to store indices.
   - Create an empty list to store the result.
  
2. **Sliding through the array:**
   - For each element in the array:
     - Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are outside the bounds of the current window (`i - k + 1`).
     - Remove indices from the back of the deque if the corresponding values are less than the current element (this ensures elements in deque are in decreasing order).
     - Add the current index to the deque.
     - If the current index is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, append the front value of the deque to the result (because it is the maximum for the current window).

3. **Return the result.**

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** because each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

def maxSlidingWindow(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    if not nums or k == 0:
        return []
    
    deq = deque()
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Remove elements outside the bounds of the current window
        if deq and deq[0] < i - k + 1:
            deq.popleft()
        
        # Remove all elements in the deque that are less than the current element
        while deq and nums[deq[-1]] < nums[i]:
            deq.pop()
        
        # Add the current element index to the deque
        deq.append(i)
        
        # Append the maximum element of the current window to the result
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(nums[ deq[0] ])
    
    return result
```

### Example Usage

```python
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]
k = 3
print(maxSlidingWindow(nums, k)) # Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
```
