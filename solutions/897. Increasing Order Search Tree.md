title:  Increasing Order Search Tree-out
permalink: /s897
---

Given the root of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in an "in-order" manner such that the left child of all nodes becomes `None` and the right child points to the next node in the in-order sequence. Essentially, flatten the BST so that it becomes an increasingly ordered singly linked list.

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any duplicates in the BST?
   **A:** Since it is a BST, there will be no duplicate values.

2. **Q:** Should the values in the new tree be sorted in increasing order?
   **A:** Yes, the values should appear in increasing order, following an in-order traversal.

3. **Q:** Is it allowed to modify the existing tree, or should we create a new tree structure?
   **A:** We can rearrange the nodes of the existing tree or create a new tree structure as required by the problem.

## Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal:** Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. During the traversal, capture the nodes in the order processed by in-order, which naturally gives us the nodes in increasing order.
2. **Re-build Tree:** Use the captured nodes to re-link the tree such that each node's left child is `None` and right child points to the next node in the sequence.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:
- **Step 1:** Traverse the tree in in-order and collect nodes.
- **Step 2:** Iterate through the collected nodes and reconnect them to form the desired output structure.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def increasingBST(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    def in_order_traversal(node):
        if node:
            yield from in_order_traversal(node.left)
            yield node
            yield from in_order_traversal(node.right)
    
    # We create a dummy node to serve as the previous node initially
    dummy = TreeNode(-1)
    prev = dummy
    
    # Traverse the tree in order and link nodes appropriately
    for node in in_order_traversal(root):
        node.left = None  # Nullify the left child
        prev.right = node
        prev = node  # Move prev to the current node
    
    # The right child of dummy points to the newly created tree head
    return dummy.right

# This test setup assumes a TreeNode class and the input structure similar to provided problem example
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the in-order traversal which visits each node exactly once. The space complexity, considering the function call stack, is **O(h)** where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (a highly unbalanced tree), this can become **O(n)**.
