title:  Number of Squareful Arrays-out
permalink: /s996
---

Given an array `A` of `N` integers, return the number of permutations of the array that are squareful. An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of values for the elements in the array `A`?
   - **A:** The elements of the array can be any integer, both positive and negative.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the array?
   - **A:** The length of the array (N) is at most 12.

3. **Q:** Can array `A` contain repeated elements?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

4. **Q:** What should be returned if no permutations are squareful?
   - **A:** Return 0 in such case.

5. **Q:** Does the permutations need to be unique?
   - **A:** Yes, we only count unique permutations.

### Strategy

1. **Generate Permutations**: We need to generate all possible permutations of array `A`.
2. **Check Each Permutation**: For each permutation, check if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.
3. **Perfect Square Check**: A utility function will determine if a number is a perfect square.
4. **Optimization**: Use backtracking efficiently to generate permutations and avoid repeating the same elements multiple times by using a count dictionary for elements.

### Code

```python
import math
from collections import Counter

def is_perfect_square(x):
    """Utility function to check if a number is a perfect square."""
    return x == math.isqrt(x) ** 2

# Backtracking function to count squareful arrays
def backtrack(path, counter, remaining):
    if remaining == 0:
        # All elements are used up, increment the count
        result[0] += 1
        return
    
    last_num = path[-1] if path else None
    
    for num in counter:
        if counter[num] > 0:
            if last_num is None or is_perfect_square(last_num + num):
                counter[num] -= 1
                path.append(num)
                backtrack(path, counter, remaining - 1)
                path.pop()
                counter[num] += 1

def numSquarefulPerms(A):
    # Edge case
    if not A:
        return 0
    
    # Counter to handle duplicates
    counter = Counter(A)
    global result
    result = [0]
    
    # Start backtracking
    backtrack([], counter, len(A))
    
    return result[0]

# Example use-case
A = [1, 17, 8, 26]
print(numSquarefulPerms(A))  # Output should be 2 if [1, 8, 17, 26] forms valid permutations with [1, 17, 8, ...]
```

### Time Complexity

The complexity involves generating permutations of the array.

- Generating all permutations takes \(O(N!)\).
- Checking each permutation takes \(O(N \log M)\) where \(M\) is the max possible value of the sum of any two elements.

However, we optimize by reducing redundant checks using a counter and backtracking, avoiding permutations with the same elements more than once.

Thus, the overall time complexity for this optimized solution can be approximated as \(O(N! \cdot N \cdot \log M)\), although this would vary based on the characteristics of the input array and the efficiency of the backtracking approach with memoization aspects.
