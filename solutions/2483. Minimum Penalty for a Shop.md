title:  Minimum Penalty for a Shop-out
permalink: /s2483
---
You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string `customers` consisting only of characters `'N'` and `'Y'`:

- if the `i-th` character is `'Y'`, it means that customers come to the shop at the `i-th` hour, 
- whereas `'N'` indicates that no customers come to the shop at the `i-th` hour.

You are also given an integer `penalty_close`, which represents the penalty cost of closing the shop at a certain hour where:
- Closing the shop at hour `i` incurs a penalty of `penalty_close` per customer who comes from hour `i` onwards
- Not closing the shop at hour `i` incurs an increasing penalty for every previous customer hour where the shop is open, this penalty is decided dynamically 

Calculate and return the hour at which the shop should close to incur the minimum penalty. If there's a tie, return the earliest hour.

### Example:
#### Input:
```
customers = "YYNY"
penalty_close = 1
```

#### Output:
```
3
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Is the penalty incurred for a single customer each hour fixed and consistent?
2. How should we handle edge cases, e.g., an empty string or all customers visiting only once?

### Strategy:
1. Traverse through all closing hour possibilities and calculate the penalty incurred for each.
2. Use two running sums to keep track of penalties: 
   - Total penalty if we decide to close the shop immediately
   - That takes into account increasing penalties for every open hour customers before hour `i`.
3. Calculate penalties dynamically as customers show up or not.
4. Return the earliest closing hour with the minimum penalty.

### Time Complexity:
The solution should ideally run in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the `customers` string.

### Implementation:

```python
def minimum_penalty(customers, penalty_close):
    n = len(customers)
    
    # Left penalty: penalty for closing at or before current hour
    left_penalty = [0] * (n+1)
    # Right penalty: penalty for closing at or after current hour
    right_penalty = [0] * (n+1)

    # Calculate right_penalty: cost of closing before or at each hour
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if customers[i-1] == 'Y':
            right_penalty[i] = right_penalty[i-1] + penalty_close
        else:
            right_penalty[i] = right_penalty[i-1]
    
    # Calculate left_penalty: cost of keeping open until each hour
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if customers[i] == 'N':
            left_penalty[i] = left_penalty[i+1]
        else:
            left_penalty[i] = left_penalty[i+1] + 1

    min_penalty = float('inf')
    best_hour = 0
    
    for i in range(n+1):
        total_penalty = left_penalty[i] + right_penalty[i]
        if total_penalty < min_penalty:
            min_penalty = total_penalty
            best_hour = i
    
    return best_hour

# Example usage:
customers = "YYNY"
penalty_close = 1
print(minimum_penalty(customers, penalty_close))  # Expected output: 3
```

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- `right_penalty` calculation: O(n), as we iterate through the entire list once.
- `left_penalty` calculation: O(n), as we iterate through the entire list once, but in reverse.
- Summing and comparing penalties: O(n), as we iterate through n+1 elements (0 to n).

Total time complexity: O(n)
