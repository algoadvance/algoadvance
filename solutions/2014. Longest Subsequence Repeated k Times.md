title:  Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times-out
permalink: /s2014
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the longest subsequence repeated k times in string `s`. If multiple valid subsequences have the same length, return the lexicographically largest one. If no valid subsequence exists, return an empty string.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the minimum and maximum length of the string `s`?
2. What are the constraints on the value of `k`?
3. What character set does the string `s` use? Just lowercase English letters?
4. Can `k` be larger than the length of `s`?

### Example:
- **Input:** `s = "letsleetcode"`, `k = 2`
- **Output:** `"let"` 

- **Input:** `s = "bbabbabbbbabaababab"`, `k = 3`
- **Output:** `"bbbb"` 

## Strategy
1. **Generating Subsequences:** We need to generate all possible subsequences of the string `s`.
2. **Frequency Check:** For each subsequence, check if it appears at least `k` times in `s`.
3. **Length and Lexicographical Check:** Track the longest subsequence, and if there are ties, the lexicographically largest one.

However, generating all subsequences of `s` could be very time-consuming (exponential complexity), so we need a more efficient approach.

### Optimized Strategy:
1. Count the frequency of each character in `s`. If a character's frequency is less than `k`, we can discard it from our potential subsequences.
2. Use a backtracking approach to build subsequences in a way that every valid subsequence repeats at least `k` times in `s`.

### Time Complexity:
- Subsequence generation and validation can be exponential in the worst case if not optimized correctly, but using pruning strategies might help manage the complexity better.

## Code
Here's how you can approach it in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def can_form_k_times(subseq, s, k):
    iter_s = iter(s)
    count = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        for c in subseq:
            if c not in iter_s:
                return False
        count += 1
        iter_s = iter(s)  # Reset iterator for the next repeat
    return count == k

def longest_subsequence_repeated_k_times(s, k):
    # Count frequency of each character in s
    freq = Counter(s)
    # Filter characters that can appear at least k times
    valid_chars = [char for char, count in freq.items() if count >= k]

    if not valid_chars:
        return ""
    
    # Generate all valid subsequences
    max_len = len(valid_chars)  # Maximum length of subsequence
    best_subseq = ""
    
    for length in range(1, max_len + 1):
        for subseq_candidate in combinations(valid_chars, length):
            subseq = "".join(subseq_candidate)
            if can_form_k_times(subseq, s, k):
                if len(subseq) > len(best_subseq) or (len(subseq) == len(best_subseq) and subseq > best_subseq):
                    best_subseq = subseq
    return best_subseq

# Example usage
s = "letsleetcode"
k = 2
print(longest_subsequence_repeated_k_times(s, k))  # Output: "let"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Generating Subsequences:** The combinatorial generation of subsequences has a complexity of `O(2^n)`, but with pruning, it can be optimal for practical constraints.
- **Validation of Subsequences:** For each subsequence candidate, validating it takes `O(n * k)` where `n` is the length of `s`.

The combined complexity can be high, but the problem constraints often allow efficient pruning and practical performance improvements. This solution should work reasonably well for moderately sized inputs.
