title:  Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c-out
permalink: /s1318
---

You are given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

You can flip a bit in `a` or `b` (change a 0 to 1 or a 1 to 0) to make the result of the bitwise OR operation of `a` and `b` equal to `c`.

Return the minimum number of flips required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`?
    - Yes, `1 <= a, b, c <= 10^9`.
2. What form of output is expected?
    - Return an integer representing the minimum number of bit flips required.
3. Are `a`, `b`, and `c` given as binary strings or integers?
    - They are given as integers.

## Strategy

1. Represent the problem in binary digit comparison.
2. Inspect each bit of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the least significant bit.
3. Compare the bits at each position:
    - If the bit in `c` is `0` and the bit in the same position of `a` or `b` is `1`, flips are required to turn them into `0`.
    - If the bit in `c` is `1`, at least one of the bits in `a` or `b` needs to be `1`. If both are `0`, flips are required to turn one of them into `1`.
4. Continue the process until all bits of the largest value (`a`, `b`, or `c`) are processed.
5. Accumulate and return the total count of flips required.

## Code

```python
def minFlips(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    flips = 0
    while a > 0 or b > 0 or c > 0:
        # Extract the last bit from a, b, c
        bit_a = a & 1
        bit_b = b & 1
        bit_c = c & 1
        
        # If bit_c is 0, both bit_a and bit_b must be 0
        if bit_c == 0:
            flips += bit_a + bit_b
        else: # bit_c is 1, at least one of bit_a or bit_b must be 1
            if bit_a == 0 and bit_b == 0:
                flips += 1
        
        # Shift right all a, b, c to process the next bit
        a >>= 1
        b >>= 1
        c >>= 1
        
    return flips

# Example usage
print(minFlips(2, 6, 5))  # Output: 3
print(minFlips(4, 2, 7))  # Output: 1
print(minFlips(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(max(a, b, c))), where `log` is the base 2 logarithm. This is because the algorithm processes each bit of the given integers, and the maximum number of bits required is proportional to the logarithm of the largest number.

- In the worst case scenario, considering the upper limit `10^9`:
  - Time complexity: `O(log2(10^9))` which is approximately `O(30)`
- Space complexity: `O(1)`, since we use a constant amount of extra space.
