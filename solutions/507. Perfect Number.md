A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. Given an integer `num`, write a function that returns `True` if `num` is a perfect number, otherwise, return `False`.

**Example:**

- Input: `num = 28`
- Output: `True`
- Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

- Input: `num = 6`
- Output: `True`
- Explanation: 6 = 1 + 2 + 3

- Input: `num = 496`
- Output: `True`
- Explanation: 496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248

- Input: `num = 12`
- Output: `False`
- Explanation: 12 â‰  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `num`?**
   - The problem does not specify a range, so we assume any positive integer within the limits of typical integer operations in Python.
   
2. **Is `num` guaranteed to be positive?**
   - The problem specifies the number is a positive integer.

3. **What should we return for the smallest input like `num = 1`?**
   - For `num = 1`, it should return `False` since by definition it doesn't meet the sum condition.


### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: If `num` is 1 or less, immediately return `False` since 1 has no positive divisors other than itself.
    
2. **Divisor Calculation**:
   - Find all divisors of `num` excluding `num` itself.
   - Only iterate up to the square root of `num` to improve efficiency (`d` and `num/d` will both be divisors).

3. **Sum and Compare**:
   - Sum up all unique divisors found in step 2.
   - Check if the sum equals `num`.

### Code

```python
def checkPerfectNumber(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False

    divisors_sum = 1
    sqrt_num = int(num**0.5)

    for i in range(2, sqrt_num + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            divisors_sum += i
            if i != num // i:
                divisors_sum += num // i
    
    return divisors_sum == num
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(sqrt(n))`
  - The loop runs up to the square root of `num`, making it efficient for large values.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - Only a few extra variables are used, so the space usage is minimal.

This approach ensures the problem is solved efficiently within the constraints provided.
