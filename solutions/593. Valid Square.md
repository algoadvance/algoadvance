You are given the coordinates of four points in a 2D space, and you need to determine if these four points can form a square. The coordinates of the points are given as:

- p1: List[int]
- p2: List[int]
- p3: List[int]
- p4: List[int]

Your task is to write a function `validSquare(p1, p2, p3, p4)` which returns `True` if the points form a square, otherwise returns `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the points be given in any order?**
   - Yes, the points can be given in any order.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the coordinates?**
   - The coordinate values can be any integers.

### Strategy

To determine if the four points form a square, we need to check the following properties:

1. **All four sides of the square should be of equal length.**
2. **All diagonals should be of equal length and longer than the sides.**

We can compute the squared distance between each pair of points to avoid dealing with floating-point precision issues.

Steps:

1. Compute the squared distances between each pair of points.
2. Verify that there are exactly two distinct squared distances: one for the sides and one for the diagonals.
3. Confirm there are exactly four occurrences of the side length and two occurrences of the diagonal length.

### Code

```python
from itertools import combinations

def distance_sq(point1, point2):
    return (point1[0] - point2[0]) ** 2 + (point1[1] - point2[1]) ** 2

def validSquare(p1, p2, p3, p4):
    points = [p1, p2, p3, p4]
    
    # Calculate squared distances between each pair
    dists = [distance_sq(pt1, pt2) for pt1, pt2 in combinations(points, 2)]
    
    # Use a set to get the unique distances
    unique_dists = set(dists)
    
    # To form a valid square, there should be only 2 unique distances
    if len(unique_dists) != 2:
        return False
    
    # Find the count of each unique distance
    dist_count = {dist: dists.count(dist) for dist in unique_dists}
    
    # Valid square should have 4 sides of equal length and 2 equal diagonals
    side_length = min(dist_count.keys())
    diagonal_length = max(dist_count.keys())
    
    return dist_count[side_length] == 4 and dist_count[diagonal_length] == 2

# Example Usage
p1 = [0, 0]
p2 = [1, 1]
p3 = [1, 0]
p4 = [0, 1]

print(validSquare(p1, p2, p3, p4))  # Output should be True
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since the number of points is fixed (always 4 points). The space complexity is also O(1) for the same reason. We are just performing a constant amount of work (calculating distances and checking conditions).
