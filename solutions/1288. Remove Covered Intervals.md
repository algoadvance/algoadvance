**1288. Remove Covered Intervals**

Given a list of intervals, remove all intervals that are covered by another interval in the list.

An interval [a,b) is covered by an interval [c,d) if and only if c <= a and b <= d.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], therefore it is removed.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 1000`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are all intervals guaranteed to be valid, i.e., `intervals[i][0] < intervals[i][1]`?
   **A:** Yes, the problem statement guarantees this.
   
2. **Q:** Can intervals have the same start or end point?
   **A:** Yes, but they will be different in terms of coverage as stated by the problem's constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Sort** the intervals by their start point. If two intervals have the same start point, sort by their end point in descending order.
2. **Iterate** through the sorted intervals and keep track of the maximum end point observed so far.
3. If the current interval is completely covered by the interval represented by the maximum endpoint, ignore it, otherwise update the maximum end point and count it in the result.

This strategy ensures that we properly identify and count the uncovered intervals efficiently.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

def removeCoveredIntervals(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Sort intervals: first by start point, if they are the same then by end point in descending order
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))

    max_end = 0
    count = 0

    for interval in intervals:
        start, end = interval
        # If the current interval is not covered by the previous
        if end > max_end:
            count += 1
            max_end = end

    return count

# Test cases
print(removeCoveredIntervals([[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]])) # Expected output: 2
print(removeCoveredIntervals([[1,4],[2,3]])) # Expected output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the intervals takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of intervals.
- The iteration through the list takes \(O(n)\) time.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
