title:  Minimum Number of Chairs in a Waiting Room-out
permalink: /s3168
---

You are given an array of time intervals where some people arrive and leave a waiting room. Each interval is represented by a pair of integers `[start, end]`, where `start` indicates the time of arrival and `end` the time of departure. 

You need to determine the minimum number of chairs required in the waiting room so that no one has to wait standing.

**Example:**
Input: `intervals = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 7]]`
Output: `3`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the intervals inclusive of both start and end times?**
   - For the sake of the problem, we assume intervals are inclusive.
   
2. **Are the intervals guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, the intervals will have positive integer values.

3. **Can intervals have overlapping times?**
   - Yes, intervals can overlap, which is why calculating the number of chairs is necessary.

4. **Is the input given in any specific order?**
   - Not necessarily. The input can be unsorted.

## Strategy

1. **Separate Events**: Create two lists, one for arrival times and one for departure times.
2. **Sort Events**: Sort both lists.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a two-pointer technique to iterate over the arrival and departure times:
   - Increment the chair count when a person arrives.
   - Decrement the chair count when a person leaves.
4. **Track Maximum Chairs**: Maintain a running count of chairs in use and update the maximum requirement as needed.

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the intervals will take `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of intervals.
- The two-pointer traversal will take `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

## Code

```python
def min_chairs_required(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    arrivals = sorted([interval[0] for interval in intervals])
    departures = sorted([interval[1] for interval in intervals])

    min_chairs = 0
    current_chairs = 0
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < len(arrivals) and j < len(departures):
        if arrivals[i] <= departures[j]:
            current_chairs += 1
            min_chairs = max(min_chairs, current_chairs)
            i += 1
        else:
            current_chairs -= 1
            j += 1

    return min_chairs

# Example usage:
intervals = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 7]]
print(min_chairs_required(intervals))  # Output: 3
```

This function computes the minimum number of chairs required in the waiting room based on the given time intervals.
