title:  Stone Game IX-out
permalink: /s2029
---

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has a positive integer on it.

Alice and Bob take turns removing a stone from either end of the row. Alice goes first.

The winner is determined by the following:
- Alice wins if the sum of the numbers on all removed stones is a multiple of 3.
- Bob wins if the sum of the numbers on all removed stones is not a multiple of 3.
  
Return `true` if Alice will win the game assuming both play optimally, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the number of stones or their values?
   - Yes, the length of the list of stones is between 1 and \(10^5\).
   - Each stone's value is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^9\).

2. Can the sum of stone values be negative?
   - No, each value is a positive integer.

3. Are the values of the stones always unique?
   - The problem statement does not clarify, so we should not assume the uniqueness of values.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Thoughts**:
   - Both players are playing optimally to maximize their chances of winning.
   - Alice wants to make the sum a multiple of 3 while Bob tries to prevent that.
   - The sum of stone values modulo 3 will be crucial in deciding the winner.

2. **Details of Strategy**:
   - We will categorize the stone values into three groups based on their modulo 3 results: `0`, `1`, and `2`.
   - Count the number of stones having values into these three categories.
   - Evaluate the possible scenarios to determine if Alice can force a win through optimal selections.

3. **Approach**:
   - Analyze the counts of the three categories.
   - Determine if Alice can always pick stones such that she forces the sum to eventually be a multiple of 3 before Bob can prevent it.

### Code

Here's the implementation based on our strategy:

```python
def stoneGameIX(stones):
    # Count occurrences of remainders modulo 3
    counts = [0, 0, 0]
    for stone in stones:
        counts[stone % 3] += 1
    
    # If there are no '1' or '2' type stones, Alice cannot create a multiple of 3 apart from using 0 type stones
    if counts[0] % 2 == 0:
        return counts[1] > 0 and counts[2] > 0
    else:
        return abs(counts[1] - counts[2]) > 2

# Example usage
stones = [5, 1, 2, 4, 3]
print(stoneGameIX(stones))  # Output: True or False based on the example case.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of stones since we need to iterate through the list to count the remainders.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant space for storing the three counts.

This strategy and implementation should effectively determine if Alice can win the game with optimal play.
