### Problem Statement

We need to tackle Leetcode Problem 2615, titled "Sum of Distances."

**Description:**
Given an array of integers `arr`, you are required to return a new array where each element at index `i` is the sum of absolute differences between `arr[i]` and each other element in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few things:
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values in the array? (e.g., can they be negative?)
    - What is the maximum length of the array?

2. **Output Format**:
    - Should the result array maintain the same order as the input?
    
3. **Performance Concerns**:
    - Is there an upper limit on time complexity we should aim for? (e.g., O(n), O(n log n), or O(n^2))

### Code

Let's first define a brute force solution to understand the problem better, and then see if we can optimize it.

### Strategy

#### Brute Force Approach:
1. **Calculate Absolute Differences**: 
    - For each element in the array, calculate the sum of absolute differences with every other element.
2. **Nested Loops**:
    - Use nested loops where the outer loop fixes one element and the inner loop calculates the differences with all other elements.

This brute force solution will have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which can be slow for large inputs. We'll implement it first and then look for optimizations.

#### Optimized Approach:
1. **Prefix Sums and Suffix Sums**: 
    - We can use prefix and suffix sums to improve efficiency. Calculate the sum of all elements before and after the current element, which can be done in linear time.

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force**: \(O(n^2)\)
- **Optimized**: \(O(n)\)

### Implementation

Let me write up both the brute force and optimized solutions.

#### Brute Force Solution
```python
def sum_of_distances(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    result = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        total_sum = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                total_sum += abs(arr[i] - arr[j])
        result[i] = total_sum

    return result

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(sum_of_distances(arr))  # Output: [27, 18, 14, 16, 25]
```

#### Optimized Solution
```python
def sum_of_distances(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    result = [0] * n
    
    # Step 1: Calculate prefix sum of array
    prefix_sum = [0] * n
    prefix_sum[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + arr[i]
    
    # Step 2: Calculate suffix sum of array
    suffix_sum = [0] * n
    suffix_sum[n - 1] = arr[n - 1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        suffix_sum[i] = suffix_sum[i + 1] + arr[i]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate result
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            result[i] = suffix_sum[i + 1] - (n - 1) * arr[i]
        elif i == n - 1:
            result[i] = (n - 1) * arr[i] - prefix_sum[i - 1]
        else:
            result[i] = (i * arr[i] - prefix_sum[i - 1]) + (suffix_sum[i + 1] - (n - i - 1) * arr[i])

    return result

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(sum_of_distances(arr))  # Output: [27, 18, 14, 16, 25]
```

### Summary
- The brute force solution involves nested loops, resulting in \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
- The optimized solution uses prefix and suffix sums to achieve \(O(n)\) time complexity.
