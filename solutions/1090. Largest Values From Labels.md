title:  Largest Values From Labels-out
permalink: /s1090
---

You are given two arrays `values` and `labels` with the same length. Each element in the `values` array represents the value of an item and the corresponding element in the `labels` array represents the label of that item. Further, an integer `numWanted` and an integer `useLimit` are given. 

You need to choose a subset of items that:
1. Contains at most `numWanted` different items.
2. Contains at most `useLimit` items with the same label.

The goal is to select the above subset such that the sum of the values of the chosen items is maximized.

### Example:

**Input:**
- `values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- `labels = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
- `numWanted = 3`
- `useLimit = 1`

**Output:** 
- `9`

**Explanation:** 
- Choose the items labeled 1, 2, and 3 with values 5, 3, and 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values and labels arrays always of the same length?**
   - Yes, each value has a corresponding label.
2. **Can `numWanted` and `useLimit` be zero?**
   - Theoretically, yes, but it would mean we're selecting no items at all.

## Strategy

1. **Pairing and Sorting:**
   - First, pair each value with its corresponding label.
   - Sort these pairs in descending order based on the value.

2. **Selecting Items:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of how many times each label has been used.
   - Iterate through the sorted pairs and greedily pick the items until you reach `numWanted` or run out of items.
   - Ensure that each label does not exceed `useLimit`.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def largestValsFromLabels(values, labels, numWanted, useLimit):
    # Pair values with labels and sort by value in descending order
    items = list(zip(values, labels))
    items.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    label_count = defaultdict(int)
    total_value = 0
    selected_items = 0

    for value, label in items:
        if label_count[label] < useLimit:
            total_value += value
            label_count[label] += 1
            selected_items += 1
            
            if selected_items == numWanted:
                break
                
    return total_value

# Example usage
values = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
labels = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
numWanted = 3
useLimit = 1
print(largestValsFromLabels(values, labels, numWanted, useLimit))  # Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step:** Sorting the list of pairs (values, labels) takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the input arrays.
- **Selection Step:** Iterating through the sorted list takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of input arrays.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. The space complexity is `O(n)` mainly for storing the list of pairs.
