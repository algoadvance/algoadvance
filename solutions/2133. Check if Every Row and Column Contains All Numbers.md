title:  Check if Every Row and Column Contains All Numbers-out
permalink: /s2133
---
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `matrix`. The matrix contains all the integers from `1` to `n`. Your task is to check if every row and every column contains all the integers from `1` to `n`.

Return `true` if every row and every column of the matrix contains all the integers from `1` to `n`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the values of `n`?**
   - `n` can vary, but let's assume it fits within reasonable memory constraints, so `1 <= n <= 100`.
  
2. **Can we assume the given matrix is always square?**
   - Yes, the matrix is always `n x n`.

3. **Is there any specific data type we need to ensure in our return type?**
   - The function should return a boolean.

### Strategy
1. **Validation of Individual Rows and Columns:**
   To ensure each row and column contains all numbers from `1` to `n`, we can use sets for comparison since set operations (like union and difference) are efficient.

2. **Steps:**
   - Create a reference set containing all numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - For each row and each column in the matrix, create a set for the numbers in that row/column.
   - Compare the set of each row and column with the reference set.
   - If any row or column does not match the reference set, return `false`.
   - If all rows and columns match the reference set, return `true`.

### Code
```python
def checkValid(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    reference_set = set(range(1, n + 1))

    # Check all rows
    for row in matrix:
        if set(row) != reference_set:
            return False
    
    # Check all columns
    for col in range(n):
        column_set = set(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n))
        if column_set != reference_set:
            return False

    return True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
  - We traverse every element in the `n x n` matrix twice (once for rows and once for columns).
  - Set operations (creation and comparison) are `O(n)` for each row and column, summing to `O(n^2)`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We are using additional space for the reference set and the sets used for individual rows and columns, which takes up linear space relative to `n`.

### Explanation
1. **Reference Set Creation:** We create a set called `reference_set` consisting of numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Row Validation:** For each row in the matrix, we convert it to a set and compare it to `reference_set`. If any row does not match, we return `false`.
3. **Column Validation:** Similarly, we construct sets for each column by iterating through each row and accumulating values for the column indices. Compare these column sets with `reference_set`. If any column does not match, return `false`.
4. **If All Valid:** If both row and column checks pass, return `true`.

This ensures that every row and column contains all the integers from `1` to `n`.
