title:  Find the Number of Subarrays Where Boundary Elements Are Maximum-out
permalink: /s3113
---

You need to find the number of subarrays where the maximum element in the entire subarray is either the first element or the last element of the subarray. Specifically, you are given an integer array `nums`. You need to return the number of such subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input array?**
   - Length of the array (let's assume \(n\)) can vary between 1 and \(10^5\).
   - Each element in the array can be between \(-10^9\) and \(10^9\).

2. **Should the subarrays include single-element subarrays?**
   - Yes, a single element subarray is valid.

3. **Are there any limitations on the output?**
   - The output should be a single integer representing the number of valid subarrays.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to count all subarrays where either the first or the last element is the maximum element of the subarray. To achieve this, we should:

1. Iterate over each element in the array.
2. For each element, count subarrays where this element is the boundary (either start or end) and also the maximum element in that subarray.

A detailed breakdown can be as follows:
- **Identify boundaries**: For each element \( nums[i] \), determine how far to the left and right you can go before encountering an element greater than \( nums[i] \).
- **Compute the number of valid subarrays**: The total number of subarrays where \( nums[i] \) is the maximum boundary element is determined by how many valid subarrays can have \( nums[i] \) as either the start or end element.

### Code

```python
def findNumberOfValidSubarrays(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Step 1: Find the closest element greater than the current element to the left
    left = [-1] * n
    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            left[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    # Step 2: Find the closest element greater than the current element to the right
    right = [n] * n
    stack = []
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] <= nums[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            right[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate valid subarrays
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        left_boundary = left[i]
        right_boundary = right[i]
        count += (i - left_boundary) * (right_boundary - i)
    
    return count

# Sample usage
nums = [2, 1, 4, 3]
print(findNumberOfValidSubarrays(nums)) # Outputs 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Left boundary calculation**: \(O(n)\)
- **Right boundary calculation**: \(O(n)\)
- **Counting subarrays**: \(O(n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), which is efficient for handling up to \(10^5\) elements as specified in the constraints.

### Explanation

1. **Left Boundary Calculation**: 
   - We iterate over each element and maintain a stack to find the closest element to the left that is greater than the current element.
2. **Right Boundary Calculation**:
   - Similarly, we iterate from the end of the array to find the closest element to the right that is greater than the current element using a stack.
3. **Valid Subarrays Counting**:
   - For each element, using the calculations from the previous steps, we determine the number of valid subarrays with this element as the maximum based on its left and right boundaries. Then, we sum these counts to get the final result.
