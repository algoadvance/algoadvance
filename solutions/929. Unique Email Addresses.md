title:  Unique Email Addresses-out
permalink: /s929
---
Given a list of email addresses, we need to determine the number of unique email addresses.

Rules for processing each email address:
1. **Local name**:
   - The part before the '@' character is called the local name.
   - In the local name, a period `.` has no effect (i.e., "alice.z@example.com" is the same as "alicez@example.com").
   - Plus `+` sign and its following characters in the local name should be ignored (i.e., "alice+foo@example.com" is the same as "alice@example.com").
2. **Domain name**:
   - The part after the '@' character is called the domain name and it remains as is.

**Example:**
- Input: `["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]`
- Output: `2`

The "test.email+alex@leetcode.com" and "test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com" reduce to "testemail@leetcode.com", while "testemail+david@lee.tcode.com" reduces to "testemail@lee.tcode.com".

**Function Signature:**
```python
def numUniqueEmails(emails: List[str]) -> int:
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we consider the list of email addresses to be always valid and non-empty?
2. Is there an upper limit on the number of email addresses we might receive in the list?

## Strategy
1. Iterate through each email in the input list.
2. Split each email into the local name and the domain name using the '@' character.
3. Process the local name:
   - Remove substring starting from `+` (if exists) to the end.
   - Remove all `.` characters.
4. Combine processed local name with the domain name.
5. Use a set to store unique processed email addresses.
6. Return the size of the set.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for the solution is O(n * m) where:
- `n` is the number of email addresses.
- `m` is the average length of an email address.

This is due to processing each email address and the operations applied to split and modify the strings.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

def numUniqueEmails(emails: List[str]) -> int:
    unique_emails = set()
    
    for email in emails:
        local, domain = email.split('@')
        local = local.split('+')[0]  # Ignore the characters after '+'
        local = local.replace('.', '')  # Remove all periods
        unique_email = local + '@' + domain
        unique_emails.add(unique_email)
    
    return len(unique_emails)

# Example usage:
print(numUniqueEmails(["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]))
```

Feel free to test the function with different input cases to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly.
