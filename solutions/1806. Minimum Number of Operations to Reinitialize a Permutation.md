title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation-out
permalink: /s1806
---

We start with an array `perm` of size `n` where `n` is an even integer. The goal is to reinitialize the permutation array to its original order in the minimum number of steps. Each step consists of creating a new array `arr` based on the current array `perm` using the rules:
- `arr[i] = perm[i // 2]` if `i` is even, and
- `arr[i] = perm[n // 2 + (i - 1) // 2]` if `i` is odd.

We need to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the array back to its initial sorted state `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume `n` is always even and greater than 2?
2. Should the solution handle large values of `n` efficiently?
3. Should intermediate arrays that represent the permutation be generated, or is there a more mathematical solution that minimizes space complexity?

### Strategy

To determine the number of operations required to return `perm` to its original state, we'll simulate the permutation transformation process until `perm` equals `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` again. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:

1. Start with `perm = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
2. Apply the transformation rules to generate the next permutation array.
3. Keep track of the number of operations.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the permutation is back to the original state.

### Code

Here's the Python code implementing this strategy:

```python
def reinitializePermutation(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize perm array to [0, 1, 2, ... , n-1]
    perm = list(range(n))
    original = perm[:]
    steps = 0
    
    while True:
        # Apply transformation
        new_perm = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                new_perm[i] = perm[i // 2]
            else:
                new_perm[i] = perm[n // 2 + (i - 1) // 2]
        
        perm = new_perm
        steps += 1
        
        # Check if it's back to original
        if perm == original:
            break
    
    return steps

# Example usage:
# n = 4
# Output should be 2
print(reinitializePermutation(4))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * T)`, where `n` is the size of the array and `T` is the number of operations required to return to the original permutation. Given that `n` is even and `T` depends on the structure of transformation cycles, we can consider the worst-case scenario where the number of operations is `O(n)`, making the overall complexity approximately `O(n^2)`. This is efficient enough for competitive programming constraints where `n` is typically reasonable in size.
