title:  Find Maximum Non-decreasing Array Length-out
permalink: /s2945
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. We define the length of a subarray as the number of elements it contains. Your task is to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray.

### Example:

- Input: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7]`
- Output: `3`

Here, the longest non-decreasing subarray is `[1, 3, 5]`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one element.
   
2. **Are there constraints on the size of the array or the values of its elements?**
   - Typically, there would be constraints such as \(1 \leq \text{len(nums)} \leq 10^4\) and \(-10^9 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 10^9\), but we will proceed as if these constraints hold unless specified otherwise.

3. **What if all elements are the same?**
   - The subarray itself is non-decreasing.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, consider a single pass through the array while keeping track of the length of the current non-decreasing subarray and updating the maximum length encountered.

### Steps:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length of any non-decreasing subarray found so far, and `current_length` to track the length of the current non-decreasing subarray.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
3. For each element, compare it with the previous element:
   - If it is greater than or equal to the previous element, increment `current_length`.
   - Otherwise, update `max_length` with `current_length` if `current_length` is greater, and reset `current_length` to 1.
4. After the loop, ensure that `max_length` is updated with the length of the last subarray.

### Code:

Here's the implementation of this strategy:

```python
def findLengthOfLCIS(nums):
    if not nums:  # Edge case, but technically not needed as specified above.
        return 0

    max_length = 1
    current_length = 1

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            current_length = 1

    # Final max check in case the longest subarray ends at the last element
    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    return max_length
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we only use a fixed amount of additional space regardless of input size.
