title:  Count Integers in Intervals-out
permalink: /s2276
---
You are given a data structure that supports adding intervals and querying how many integers are present in the union of the intervals.

Specifically, implement the `CountIntervals` class:
- `CountIntervals()` Initializes the object with an empty set of intervals.
- `void add(int left, int right)` Adds the interval `[left, right]` to the set of intervals.
- `int count()` Returns the number of integers present in the union of the intervals.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Integers**: What is the range of integers for inputs `left` and `right`?
    - Assuming that the input intervals are bounded by practical ranges for the problem (e.g., `left` and `right` can be large but within typical integer bounds in competitive programming).

2. **Operations Frequency**: How frequently are `add` and `count` operations called?
    - Assuming both operations can be called multiple times in a mixed sequence.

3. **Overlapping Intervals**: Should overlapping intervals be merged?
    - Yes, overlapping intervals should be merged for accurate counts.

### Code

```python
class CountIntervals:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intervals = []
        self.total_count = 0
    
    def add(self, left: int, right: int) -> None:
        new_intervals = []
        current_interval = [left, right]
        added_length = right - left + 1
        
        for interval in self.intervals:
            if interval[1] < current_interval[0]:
                new_intervals.append(interval)
            elif interval[0] > current_interval[1]:
                new_intervals.append(current_interval)
                current_interval = interval
            else:
                # merge intervals
                added_length -= max(0, min(interval[1], current_interval[1]) - max(interval[0], current_interval[0]) + 1)
                current_interval = [min(interval[0], current_interval[0]), max(interval[1], current_interval[1])]
        
        new_intervals.append(current_interval)
        self.intervals = new_intervals
        self.total_count += added_length
    
    def count(self) -> int:
        return self.total_count

# Example Usage:
# obj = CountIntervals()
# obj.add(2, 3)
# obj.add(7, 10)
# obj.add(5, 8)
# print(obj.count())  # Outputs the total number of unique integers in the union of added intervals.
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an empty list `self.intervals` to store the set of disjoint intervals.
   - Initialize `self.total_count` to keep track of the total unique count of integers.

2. **Add Interval (`add`)**:
   - Create a `current_interval` for the input range `[left, right]` and calculate its initial length.
   - Iterate over existing intervals to merge overlapping intervals and adjust the `added_length` accordingly.
   - Append non-overlapping and merged intervals to a new list `new_intervals`.
   - Update `self.intervals` to `new_intervals` and adjust `self.total_count` by `added_length`.

3. **Count Integers (`count`)**:
   - Simply return `self.total_count`.

### Time Complexity
- **add**: The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of existing intervals due to iterating and merging/splitting intervals.
- **count**: The time complexity is `O(1)` as it simply returns the total count.
