title:  Robot Bounded In Circle-out
permalink: /s1041
---
The problem "1041. Robot Bounded In Circle" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. The robot can receive one of three possible instructions:

- 'G': go straight 1 unit.
- 'L': turn 90 degrees to the left.
- 'R': turn 90 degrees to the right.

The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever. Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the instruction string contain only 'G', 'L', and 'R'?**
   - Yes.
2. **What is the length of the instruction string?**
   - The length can be up to 100 characters.

### Strategy
The robot will be bounded in a circle if, after executing the sequence of instructions once, it either:
1. Returns to the starting point `(0, 0)`.
2. Does not face north.

If either of these conditions is met after one complete execution of the instructions, then the robot will be bounded in a circle when the instructions are repeated.

### Code
```python
def isRobotBounded(instructions: str) -> bool:
    # Initial position and orientation of the robot
    x, y = 0, 0
    # Directions: North, East, South, West (in clockwise order)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    # Start facing North
    current_direction = 0
    
    for instruction in instructions:
        if instruction == 'G':
            x += directions[current_direction][0]
            y += directions[current_direction][1]
        elif instruction == 'L':
            current_direction = (current_direction - 1) % 4
        elif instruction == 'R':
            current_direction = (current_direction + 1) % 4
    
    # After one cycle, check if it's back to the origin or not facing north
    return (x == 0 and y == 0) or (current_direction != 0)

# Example usage:
instructions = "GGLLGG"
print(isRobotBounded(instructions))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the instructions string. This is because each instruction takes constant time to process, and we iterate through the instructions exactly once.
