title:  Collecting Chocolates-out

You are given an array `chocolates` where `chocolates[i]` is the number of chocolates at index `i`. You can perform the following operation as many times as needed (including zero):

- Pick an index `i` (0 â‰¤ i < n - 1) and move one chocolate from `i` to `i+1`.

Your goal is to make all elements of the array equal. Find the minimum number of operations needed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the input `chocolates` list is always non-empty?
2. Are negative numbers allowed in the `chocolates` array?
3. Can the number of chocolates at each index be very large, and if yes, will it fit within Python's integer limits?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, the following steps could be employed:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Chocolates**: Sum the number of chocolates in the `chocolates` array.
2. **Check for Possibility**: For it to be possible to make all elements equal, the total number of chocolates should be divisible by the length of the array.
3. **Find Target Value**: If the total number of chocolates is divisible by the length of the array, then the target number of chocolates at each position is `total // n`, where `n` is the length of the array.
4. **Calculate Operations**:
    - Traverse the array from the end to the beginning.
    - Track the current deficit or surplus of chocolates while ensuring the minimum number of moves by shifting chocolates from higher indices to lower indices to balance the array progressively.

### Time Complexity
The expected time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `chocolates` array since a single pass through the array is sufficient to calculate the number of operations.

### Code

```python
def min_operations_to_equal_chocolates(chocolates):
    n = len(chocolates)
    total_chocolates = sum(chocolates)
    
    # Check if it's possible to make all elements equal
    if total_chocolates % n != 0:
        return -1  # It's not possible to balance the chocolates

    target = total_chocolates // n
    operations = 0
    deficit = 0
    
    # Start from the end of the array
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        deficit += chocolates[i] - target
        operations += abs(deficit)
    
    return operations

# Example usage
chocolates = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(min_operations_to_equal_chocolates(chocolates))  # Output: Number of minimum operations needed
```
This solution ensures that we both account for imbalance incrementally and determine the required number of operations efficiently.
