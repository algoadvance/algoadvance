title:  Count Subarrays With Median K-out
permalink: /s2488
---
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays of `nums` that have a median equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Sorting allowed**: Is it permissible to sort subarrays or perform operations that could potentially increase the complexity?
2. **Constraints**: What are the potential lengths of the array `nums` and the range of integer values in `nums`?
3. **Edge cases**:
   - Should we consider cases where the target median `k` does not exist in the array?
   - What happens if `nums` is empty?

For this solution, let's assume the following constraints based on typical problem setups:
- `nums` will contain `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
- The numbers in `nums` can be both positive and negative and fall within a considerable range typically around `-10^9` to `10^9`.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding Median**: For an odd length, the median is the middle element of the sorted subarray. For an even length, itâ€™s typically the average of the two middle elements. Here, we need to count subarrays wherein the exact value `k` is the median, implying the subarray length is odd.

2. **Using Prefix Sum for Efficient Calculation**: 
   - We'll convert `nums` into a list of boolean values based on comparison with `k`: `1` if `nums[i] >= k`, and `0` otherwise.
   - We will maintain a prefix sum to count subarrays efficiently.

3. **Balancing Prefix Sums**:
   - Use a hashmap to store frequencies of prefix sums. 
   - Iterate through the array while maintaining a running balance.
   - Increment the count when the balance indicates equal or one count more of elements greater than equal and less than `k` up to the current index.

### Code Implementation
Here's the detailed Python code to achieve the desired result.

```python
def countSubarrays(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k_idx = nums.index(k)
    
    prefix_counts = {0: 1}  
    balance = 0
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(k_idx, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] < k:
            balance -= 1
        else:
            balance += 1
        
        prefix_counts[balance] = prefix_counts.get(balance, 0) + 1

    balance = 0
    
    for i in range(k_idx, n):
        if nums[i] < k:
            balance -= 1
        else:
            balance += 1
        
        count += prefix_counts.get(-balance, 0)
        count += prefix_counts.get(1-balance, 0)
    
    return count

# Example Usage
nums = [2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
k = 2
print(countSubarrays(nums, k))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the prefix counts and iterating through the array twice: O(n)
- Using dictionary operations which are average O(1) time

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), making this approach efficient for input sizes up to \(10^5\).
