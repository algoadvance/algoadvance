title:  Tree of Coprimes-out
permalink: /s1766
---
Given an integer array `nums`, a tree where `nums[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` node in the tree, and the `i-th` node has zero or more children, you need to answer queries of the following type:

Given a `query` [`u`, `v`], you need to find the closest ancestor of node `u` that is coprime (i.e., greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1) with the value `nums[v]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size and Constraints:**
   - What are the minimum and maximum lengths of `nums`?
   - What is the range of the values in `nums`?
   - How many queries can there be?
   
2. **Tree Representation:**
   - Are the nodes of the tree given in a specific structure (like an adjacency list or parent array)?
   
3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - What should be returned if no ancestor is coprime with the value of `v`?

### Code
Let's first implement the solution adhering to the typical input patterns of Tree problems and ensure we construct the tree properly.

```python
from math import gcd
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from functools import lru_cache

def build_tree(edges):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    return tree

@lru_cache(None)
def find_coprimes(val, max_val=50):
    coprimes = []
    for i in range(1, max_val+1):
        if gcd(val, i) == 1:
            coprimes.append(i)
    return coprimes

def deepest_coprime_ancestor(node, value, node_values, ancestors):
    candidates = find_coprimes(value)  # Find coprimes of given value
    
    for depth in range(len(ancestors)-1, -1, -1):
        ancestor = ancestors[depth]
        if node_values[ancestor] in candidates:
            return ancestor
    return -1

def tree_of_coprimes(nums, edges, queries):
    n = len(nums)
    tree = build_tree(edges)
    
    node_values = {i: nums[i] for i in range(n)}
    result = []
    
    def dfs(node, parent, ancestors):
        current_result.append((node, list(ancestors)))  # Track ancestors for the node
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child == parent:
                continue
            ancestors.append(node)
            dfs(child, node, ancestors)
            ancestors.pop()

    current_result = []
    # DFS the tree and collect ancestors for each node.
    dfs(0, -1, [])
    
    # Dictionary to fetch ancestors list for any node in O(1)
    ancestors_map = {node: ancestors for node, ancestors in current_result}
    
    for u, v in queries:
        ancestors_u = ancestors_map[u]
        coprime_ancestor = deepest_coprime_ancestor(u, nums[v], node_values, ancestors_u)
        result.append(coprime_ancestor)
    
    return result

# Example Usage:
# nums = [2,3,6,2,3]
# edges = [(0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (3,4)]
# queries = [(0, 4), (2, 3), (4, 0)]
# print(tree_of_coprimes(nums, edges, queries))
```

### Strategy
1. **Tree Building**: Convert the edge list into an adjacency list representation of the tree.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverse the tree to keep track of the ancestors for each node.
3. **Coprimes Calculation**: Precompute possible coprime values using the `find_coprimes` function, but utilize caching to avoid recomputation.
4. **Query Processing**: For each query, retrieve valid coprime ancestors and determine the closest one based on depth comparison.

### Time Complexity
- **Tree Construction**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **DFS Traversal**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes (since we visit each node and edge exactly once).
- **Coprime Calculation**: Though computing coprimes is `O(MN)`, it is optimized with caching to effectively `O(N)`.
- **Query Processing**: `O(Q * D)`, where `Q` is the number of queries and `D` is the depth of the deepest node's ancestors.

Hence, the overall complexity is approximately `O(N + E + Q * D)` given typical constraints.
