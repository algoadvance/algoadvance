Leetcode Problem #1781: **Sum of Beauty of All Substrings**

You are given a string `s`. The *beauty* of a substring is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

- For instance, if the substring is "abcbba", then three characters have frequencies: `a` -> 1, `b` -> 3, `c` -> 1. Here, the most frequent character is `b` (frequency 3) and the least frequent characters are `a` and `c` (frequency 1). So the beauty of this substring is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Return the sum of *beauty* of all substrings of the given string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string contain non-alphabetic characters? 
   - Based on typical problem assumptions, it's likely only lowercase alphabetic characters.
2. Is there any constraint on the length of the string?
   - Typically, there's a constraint but let's assume a reasonable length suitable for computational processing like `1 <= len(s) <= 500`.
3. Should we return the sum for all possible substrings?
   - Yes, that's the goal.

### Strategy

1. **Generate all substrings:** We need to compute the beauty for each substring of the given string.
2. **Track frequencies:** For each substring, keep track of character frequencies.
3. **Compute beauty:** Calculate the beauty (difference between max and min frequency with a non-zero value) for each substring.
4. **Sum up beauties:** Sum up the beauties of all substrings and return the result.

### Code

```python
def beautySum(s: str) -> int:
    def calculate_beauty(freq):
        values = [count for count in freq.values() if count > 0]
        if not values:
            return 0
        return max(values) - min(values)
    
    n = s.length
    total_beauty = 0
    
    for start in range(n):
        freq = {chr(i + ord('a')): 0 for i in range(26)}
        for end in range(start, n):
            freq[s[end]] += 1
            total_beauty += calculate_beauty(freq)
    
    return total_beauty

# Example usage:
s = "aabcb"
print(beautySum(s))  # Output should be 17
```

### Explanation
1. **Helper Function:** `calculate_beauty` computes the beauty of the substring based on the current frequency dictionary.
2. **Nested Loops:** Iterate over all possible start and end positions in the string to generate substrings.
   - **Outer Loop:** Varies the starting point of the substring.
   - **Inner Loop:** Varies the ending point of the substring.
3. **Frequency Tracking:** For each substring `s[start:end+1]`, update the frequency and compute the beauty.
4. **Sum Beauties:** Accumulate the beauty values to get the total beauty sum of all substrings.

### Time Complexity
- **Nested Loops and Frequency Calculation:** `O(n^2)` for iterating through all substrings, and within each iteration, updating the frequency map leads to `O(26)` (constant time).
- **Final Complexity:** `O(n^3)`. This should be feasible for reasonable string lengths as mentioned (e.g., `n <= 500`).

This approach through careful loop nesting and on-the-fly frequency counting provides an efficient solution to sum the beauty of all substrings.
