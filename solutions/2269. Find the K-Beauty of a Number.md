title:  Find the K-Beauty of a Number-out
permalink: /s2269
---
Given an integer `num` and an integer `k`, the k-beauty of `num` is defined as the count of distinct integers of length `k` that are a contiguous substring of `num` and are divisible by `k`. 

Given an integer `num` and an integer `k`, return the k-beauty of `num`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Data Types?**
   - `num`: A positive integer.
   - `k`: A positive integer.

2. **Output Data Type?**
   - The function should return an integer, which is the k-beauty of `num`.

3. **Examples for Better Understanding?**
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Input: num = 240, k = 2
     Output: 2
     Explanation: The substrings of length 2 are "24" and "40". Both "24" and "40" are divisible by 2.
     ```

4. **Edge Cases?**
   - If `num` has length less than `k`, return 0.
   - Handle cases where `num` contains zeros or leading zeros.

### Strategy
1. Convert the number to a string to facilitate slicing.
2. Iterate over the number with a sliding window of size `k`.
3. Extract each substring, convert it to an integer, check divisibility by `k`.
4. Collect the divisible substrings in a set to ensure uniqueness.
5. Return the size of the set.

### Code
Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def find_k_beauty(num: int, k: int) -> int:
    num_str = str(num)
    n = len(num_str)
    
    if k > n:
        return 0
    
    k_beauty_set = set()
    
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        substring = num_str[i:i + k]
        sub_num = int(substring)
        
        if sub_num % k == 0:
            k_beauty_set.add(sub_num)
            
    return len(k_beauty_set)

# Example usage:
num = 240
k = 2
print(find_k_beauty(num, k))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- Converting the number to a string takes `O(d)` time, where `d` is the number of digits in `num`.
- The loop runs `n - k + 1` times, where `n` is the number of digits in `num`. Each iteration involves slicing the string and converting to an integer, both of which are `O(k)` operations. Thus, the overall complexity of the loop is `O((n - k + 1) * k)`.
- In the worst case, the overall time complexity is `O(d * k)`.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(d)` for storing the string representation of the number and additional space for the set to hold unique k-beauties which, in the worst case, also holds `O(d)` elements.
- Thus, the space complexity is `O(d)`.
