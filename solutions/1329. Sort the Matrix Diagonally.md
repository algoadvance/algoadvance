title:  Sort the Matrix Diagonally-out
permalink: /s1329
---

Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` where each cell contains an integer, return a new matrix `mat` where each diagonal in the returned matrix is sorted in ascending order.

A diagonal is defined as a line of cells starting from some entry in column 0 or row 0 and running downwards diagonally to the right until the end of the matrix.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
mat = [
  [3, 3, 1, 1],
  [2, 2, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 1, 2]
]
```

**Output:**
```
[
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 2, 2, 2],
  [1, 2, 3, 3]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions?**
   - The matrix dimensions are both reasonably small, typically `1 <= m, n <= 100`.

2. **Are all matrix elements non-negative integers?**
   - Typically, matrix elements can be any integers.

3. **Should we assume the input matrix is not empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the matrix has at least one element.

## Strategy:

1. **Identify Diagonals**:
   - Diagonals can be identified by their starting points. Any element `mat[i][j]` on the same diagonal will satisfy the condition `i - j` is constant.
   - We need to collect all elements of each diagonal.

2. **Sort Each Diagonal**:
   - For each diagonal, sort the collected elements.
   
3. **Repopulate the Matrix**:
   - Place the sorted elements back into their original diagonal positions.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Iterate over each diagonal (both those starting from the first row and those starting from the first column).
   - Extract the diagonal elements, sort them, and place them back into the matrix.

## Code:

```python
def diagonalSort(mat):
    import collections

    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    diagonals = collections.defaultdict(list)

    # Collect all the elements of each diagonal
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            diagonals[i - j].append(mat[i][j])

    # Sort each diagonal
    for key in diagonals:
        diagonals[key].sort()

    # Place back the sorted elements into the matrix
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            mat[i][j] = diagonals[i - j].pop(0)

    return mat

# Example usage:
mat = [
  [3, 3, 1, 1],
  [2, 2, 1, 2],
  [1, 1, 1, 2]
]

print(diagonalSort(mat))  # Output should be [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2, 2], [1, 2, 3, 3]]
```

## Time Complexity:

- Collecting elements for each diagonal: \( O(m \times n) \)
- Sorting each diagonal: Each diagonal has at most \(\min(m, n)\) elements. So sorting each takes \( O(\min(m, n) \log \min(m, n)) \). Since we can have at most \( m + n - 1 \) diagonals, the total sorting time is \( O((m + n) \times \min(m, n) \log \min(m, n)) \).
- Repopulating the matrix: \( O(m \times n) \)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(m \times n + (m + n) \times \min(m, n) \log \min(m, n)) \). For simplicity, this can be considered as \( O(m \times n \log \min(m, n)). \)

The space complexity is \( O(m \times n) \) due to the storage needed for the diagonals.
