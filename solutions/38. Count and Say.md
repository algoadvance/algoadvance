The "Count and Say" sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(n)` is the previous term (i.e., `countAndSay(n-1)`) read off. This means that you count the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

For example, the first few terms of the sequence are:
- `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
- `countAndSay(2) = "11"` (one 1)
- `countAndSay(3) = "21"` (two 1s)
- `countAndSay(4) = "1211"` (one 2 followed by one 1)
- `countAndSay(5) = "111221"` (one 1, one 2, then two 1s)

Given an integer `n`, generate the `n`-th term of the count-and-say sequence.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the integer `n` we need to handle?
   - Typically, interview problems will restrict `n` to a reasonably small number (e.g., `1 <= n <= 30`).

2. What should we return?
   - You should return a string that represents the `n`-th term of the count-and-say sequence.

3. Is there a maximum length we need to consider for the sequence terms?
   - Generally, this problem won't expect very large terms; keeping space and time efficiencies reasonable for `n <= 30` should suffice.

### Strategy

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is `1`, then we simply return `"1"`.

2. **Recursive Build**: We need to build the sequence iteratively from `countAndSay(1)` up to `countAndSay(n)`.
    - For each term, take the previous term and read it, counting consecutive digits and forming the new term in the format "count" + "digit".

3. **Iterate to Get Target Term**:
   - Start with the base term `"1"`.
   - For each next term, read through the current term and build the next term by counting groups of identical digits and appending "count" + "digit" to form the new term.

### Code

```python
def countAndSay(n: int) -> str:
    # Base term
    result = "1"
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        result = next_term(result)
        
    return result

def next_term(current_term: str) -> str:
    next_term = []
    i = 0
    length = len(current_term)
    
    while i < length:
        count = 1
        while i + 1 < length and current_term[i] == current_term[i + 1]:
            count += 1
            i += 1
        next_term.append(f"{count}{current_term[i]}")
        i += 1
    
    return "".join(next_term)

# Example usage:
print(countAndSay(5))  # Expected output: "111221"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N), where M is the length of each term which grows with `n`, and N is the number of terms to be generated (which is `n`). Specifically, since the length of terms in the sequence can grow exponentially, precise complexity analysis is intricate, but an upper-bound estimate is O(2^N) for large N, due to the exponential growth of sequence lengths.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the length of the current term being generated, since that's the major space usage besides the function call stack.
