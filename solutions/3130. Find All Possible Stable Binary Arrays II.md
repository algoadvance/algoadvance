3130. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays II-out

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible stable binary arrays of length `n` with exactly `k` ones. A binary array is called stable if no two adjacent elements are the same.

A valid binary array should start with 1.

### Example
```python
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [[1, 0, 1]]
Explanation: The only stable binary array of length 3 with 2 ones is [1, 0, 1].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:** 
   * 1 <= n <= 20
   * 0 <= k <= n
   * Input parameters `n` and `k` will always be valid.

2. **Output Format:**
   * Return a list of lists where each sublist represents a valid stable binary array.

3. **Stability Definition:**
   * Stability implies no two adjacent elements are the same.

### Strategy
1. **Base Case:**
   * If `n == 0`, the only valid array is `[]`.
   * If `k == 0`, the only valid array is `[0] * n` which isnâ€™t stable (since it won't start with 1).

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   * We can recursively generate the sequences:
     - Whenever we add `1`, the next element must be `0`.
     - Whenever we add `0`, the next element must be `1`.
   * Start with `1` since arrays need to start with `1`.

3. **Recursive Solution:**
   * Generate the sequences by toggling between `1` and `0`, and ensuring that the count of `1`s matches `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   * An array of length `n` and `k = 0`: There's no valid array starting with `1` and having no `1`s.
   * `k > (n + 1) // 2`: Impossible to have that many `1`s in a stable sequence.

### Code

```python
def generate_stable_arrays(n, k, current_array, result):
    if len(current_array) == n:
        if current_array.count(1) == k:
            result.append(current_array.copy())
        return
    
    last_element = current_array[-1]
    if last_element == 1:
        current_array.append(0)
        generate_stable_arrays(n, k, current_array, result)
        current_array.pop()
    else:
        if current_array.count(1) < k:
            current_array.append(1)
            generate_stable_arrays(n, k, current_array, result)
            current_array.pop()
        current_array.append(0)
        generate_stable_arrays(n, k, current_array, result)
        current_array.pop()

def find_all_stable_binary_arrays(n, k):
    if k == 0 or k > (n + 1) // 2:
        return []
    
    result = []
    generate_stable_arrays(n, k, [1], result)
    return result

# Example Usage
n = 3
k = 2
print(find_all_stable_binary_arrays(n, k))
```

### Time Complexity
* **Worst-case scenario:** 
  * The recursive function potentially explores sequences of length `n` leading to a complexity of O(2^n).
  * However, pruning is done based on counts of `1`s and stability conditions.
* **Space Complexity:**
  * Includes the space for the recursion stack, which is `O(n)` deep.
  * Holding the result arrays which in the worst case can be significant.

By following this strategy, we ensure all valid, stable arrays of length `n` with exactly `k` ones are generated effectively.
