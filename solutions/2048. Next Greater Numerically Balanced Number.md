title:  Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number-out
permalink: /s2048
---
Given an integer `n`, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than `n`.

A numerically balanced number is a number where the number of occurrences of each digit matches its value.

For example:
- `122` is a numerically balanced number because it contains one `1` and two `2`s.
- `333` is not a numerically balanced number because it contains three `3`s but no other digits.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What are the constraints on the input integer `n`?
   - Constraints: `0 <= n <= 10^6`.

2. **Output**: Should the output also be within a specific range?
   - It should be strictly greater than `n` and numerically balanced.

3. **Format**: What should the output format be?
   - The output should be a single integer that is the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than `n`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Generate the next numerically balanced number greater than `n`.
2. Check if a number is numerically balanced:
   - Convert the number to a string, count each digit's occurrences, and ensure that each digitâ€™s count matches the digit itself.
3. Start checking from `n + 1` and continue until we find a valid numerically balanced number.

## Code:
```python
def is_numerically_balanced(num: int) -> bool:
    """Function to check if a number is numerically balanced."""
    from collections import Counter
    
    num_str = str(num)
    digit_count = Counter(num_str)
    
    for digit, count in digit_count.items():
        if int(digit) != count:
            return False
            
    return True

def next_beautiful_number(n: int) -> int:
    """Find the smallest numerically balanced number greater than n."""
    num = n + 1
    while True:
        if is_numerically_balanced(num):
            return num
        num += 1

# Sample usage
n = 1
print(next_beautiful_number(n))  # Output: 22, because 11 is not numerically balanced
```

## Explanation
- **is_numerically_balanced(num: int) -> bool**:
  - This function takes an integer `num` and checks if it is numerically balanced.
  - It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each digit.
  - It verifies if each digit matches its respective count.

- **next_beautiful_number(n: int) -> int**:
  - This function starts with `n + 1` and keeps checking the next integer until it finds a numerically balanced number.
  - It returns that number.

## Time Complexity
- **is_numerically_balanced(num)**:
  - Time Complexity: \(O(k)\) where \(k\) is the number of digits in the number (for counting and verification).
  
- **next_beautiful_number(n)**:
  - Time Complexity: The worst-case time complexity is not easily defined since it depends on how sparse the numerically balanced numbers are in the range of possible values. However, checking each number has an \(O(k)\) complexity, where \(k\) is the number of digits. Checking from `n + 1` onward until finding the next valid number can take up to \(O(m \times k)\) where `m` is the number of checks needed and `k` is the average number of digits per check. In practical scenarios, for numbers up to \(10^6\), the solver will find the next balanced number reasonably quickly.

This approach ensures we accurately and efficiently find the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than the given integer `n`.
