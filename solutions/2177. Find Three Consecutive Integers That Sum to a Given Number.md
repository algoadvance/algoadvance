title:  Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number-out
permalink: /s2177
---
You are given an integer `num`. You need to return an array of three integers `[a, b, c]` such that `a`, `b`, and `c` are consecutive integers (i.e., `a + 1 = b` and `b + 1 = c`) and their sum is equal to `num`. If no such integers exist, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `num` be negative?
   - Yes, any integer (positive, negative, or zero) is valid as input.
  
2. Should the three integers always be unique?
   - Yes, since they are consecutive integers, they will naturally be unique.

3. Are there constraints on the size of `num`?
   - The problem does not specify constraints, so we will assume it can be any valid integer within the typical range of Python integers.

4. What should we return if no such three integers exist?
   - Return an empty array if no valid integers can be found.

### Strategy
1. Letâ€™s derive a mathematical relationship from the problem:
   - Let the three consecutive integers be `a`, `a+1`, and `a+2`.
   - The sum of these integers is \( a + (a+1) + (a+2) = 3a + 3 \).

2. Given the sum `num`, we can set up the equation:
   - \( 3a + 3 = num \)
   - Solving for `a`:
     - \( a = \frac{num - 3}{3} \)

3. To ensure `a` is an integer, `(num - 3) % 3` must be 0.

4. If this condition holds, then:
   - \( a \), \( a + 1 \), and \( a + 2 \) are the three integers.
   - If not, return an empty array.

### Code
Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def sumOfThree(num):
    if (num - 3) % 3 == 0:
        a = (num - 3) // 3
        return [a, a + 1, a + 2]
    else:
        return []

# Example usage:
num = 33
print(sumOfThree(num))  # Output should be [10, 11, 12]

num = 10
print(sumOfThree(num))  # Output should be []
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \( O(1) \) as we are performing a constant amount of mathematical operations regardless of the input size.

### Explanation
1. Check if (`num - 3`) is divisible by 3:
   - If yes, compute `a = (num - 3) / 3` and generate `[a, a + 1, a + 2]`.
   - If no, return an empty array as it's impossible to find such consecutive integers.

This approach ensures optimal performance while correctly addressing the problem requirements.
