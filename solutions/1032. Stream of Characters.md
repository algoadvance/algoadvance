title:  Stream of Characters-out
permalink: /s1032
---

Design an algorithm that accepts a stream of characters and checks if a suffix of these characters is a string of a given list of words. Implement the `StreamChecker` class:

- `StreamChecker(words: List[str])` Initializes the object with the given `words`.
- `query(letter: str) -> bool` Returns `true` if any suffix of the characters queried so far is a word in the given list.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Stream:**
   - Will the stream of characters be finite or can it be extremely long (affecting space complexity)?
   
2. **Words given:**
   - Can the words contain uppercase and lowercase? 
   - Should the comparison be case-insensitive?

3. **Query Frequency:**
   - How frequently will the `query` function be called? This can help assess the need for optimization.

4. **Character Set:**
   - Are the characters restricted to ASCII or could there be Unicode characters as well?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- Characters are lowercase English letters.
- Words are provided in lowercase.
- The stream can be long, implying we need to focus on an efficient solution in terms of both speed and space.

## Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, a Trie (prefix tree) can be used, but to check suffixes efficiently, we can insert reversed words in the Trie. By doing this, when querying, we build a string from the most recent character backwards and check if it exists in the Trie.

1. **Trie Data Structure:** 
   - Build a Trie of all reversed words.
   
2. **Process Queries:**
   - Use a dynamic list or deque to store the history of queried characters.
   - For each query, check if any reverse suffix (from the end to the recent characters) matches any word in the Trie.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class StreamChecker:

    def __init__(self, words: list):
        self.root = TrieNode()
        self.stream = deque()
        self.max_length = 0
        
        # Insert reversed words into the Trie
        for word in words:
            self.max_length = max(self.max_length, len(word))
            node = self.root
            for char in reversed(word):
                if char not in node.children:
                    node.children[char] = TrieNode()
                node = node.children[char]
            node.is_end_of_word = True

    def query(self, letter: str) -> bool:
        self.stream.appendleft(letter)
        if len(self.stream) > self.max_length:
            self.stream.pop()
        
        node = self.root
        for char in self.stream:
            if char in node.children:
                node = node.children[char]
                if node.is_end_of_word:
                    return True
            else:
                break
        return False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`__init__`):** 
  - Building the Trie has a time complexity of \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the total length of all words.

- **Query (`query`):**
  - Each `query` operation has a time complexity of \(O(M)\), where \(M\) is the length of the longest word (since we store only up to M characters in the stream).

This algorithm efficiently handles the stream of characters and checks for matching suffixes using a Trie data structure with a slight twist of storing reversed words.
