title:  Merge Two Sorted Lists-out
permalink: /s21
---

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a chance of either of the lists being empty?**
   - Yes, either or both lists can be empty.

2. **What should be the format of the final merged list?**
   - The final merged linked list should be in sorted order.

3. **Can the lists have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the lists can have duplicate values.

4. **What is the return type of the function?**
   - The function should return the head of the merged linked list.

5. **Is there any constraint on the size of the input lists?**
   - No, there is no constraint on the size of the input lists.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - We will use a dummy node to form the merged linked list. This helps to simplify edge cases by providing a non-null starting point.
   - We will maintain a current pointer that will track the end of the merged list.

2. **Merge Process:**
   - Traverse both lists `list1` and `list2` simultaneously:
     - Compare the values at the current nodes of both lists.
     - Attach the smaller value node to the merged list.
     - Move the pointer of the list from which the node was taken.
   - If one of the lists is exhausted, attach the remainder of the other list to the merged list.

3. **Return the merged list:**
   - The dummy node's next pointer will point to the head of the merged linked list.

### Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(list1: ListNode, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # Initialize dummy node and current pointer
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    
    # Traverse both lists
    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val < list2.val:
            current.next = list1
            list1 = list1.next
        else:
            current.next = list2
            list2 = list2.next
        current = current.next
    
    # Attach the remaining nodes, if any
    if list1:
        current.next = list1
    if list2:
        current.next = list2
    
    # Return the merged list starting from the node next to dummy
    return dummy.next
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n + m)\)
  - Where \(n\) is the length of `list1` and \(m\) is the length of `list2`.
  - Each node in both lists is processed exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - Only a few extra pointers are used; the space usage does not grow with the input size.

This solution is optimal for merging two sorted linked lists and ensures that the merged linked list remains sorted.
