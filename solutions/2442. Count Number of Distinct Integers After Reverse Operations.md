**LeetCode 2442 - Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations**

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. You can perform two types of operations on this array:
1. Reverse any number in the array and place the reversed number back into the array.
2. Count the number of distinct integers present in the array after performing the above operation any number of times.

Write a function that returns the number of distinct integers after performing any number of reverse operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?**
   - The constraints can vary, but typically problems might mention constraints like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`.

2. **What should be done if reversing a number generates a leading zero?**
   - Normally, leading zeroes should be ignored as they are not meaningful in integer representations.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty set to keep track of the distinct integers.
2. **Insert original numbers**: Insert all numbers in the input array `nums` into the set.
3. **Insert reversed numbers**: For each number in the array, reverse its digits and insert the reversed number into the set.
4. **Result**: The size of the set at the end will give the number of distinct integers.

### Code

```python
def countDistinctIntegers(nums):
    # Initialize a set to store distinct integers
    distinct_numbers = set(nums)
    
    # Helper function to reverse digits of a number
    def reverse_number(n):
        return int(str(n)[::-1])
    
    # Iterate through nums to calculate and add the reversed numbers
    for num in nums:
        reversed_num = reverse_number(num)
        distinct_numbers.add(reversed_num)
    
    # The answer is the number of distinct elements in the set
    return len(distinct_numbers)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 13, 10, 31, 44]
print(countDistinctIntegers(nums))  # Output should be the count of distinct integers after the operations
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of the set**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Reversing a number**: O(log d), where `d` is the number of digits in the number (Since converting to string and reversing is proportional to the number of digits).
- **Adding elements to the set**: O(1) on average per insertion due to hash set insertions being average O(1), so for all elements O(n).

**Overall time complexity**:  
O(n * log d) where `d` is the average number of digits in the numbers in the input list `nums`.

### Space Complexity

- The space used by the set will be O(n) in the worst case (if all numbers and their reversals are unique).
- Additional space for the string conversion and reversal operations is O(log d).

**Overall space complexity**: O(n).

This solution efficiently counts the number of distinct integers in the array after all possible reverse operations.
