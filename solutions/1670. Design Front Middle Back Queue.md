title:  Design Front Middle Back Queue-out
permalink: /s1670
---

You need to design a data structure that supports the following operations:
1. **pushFront(val)**: Add a `val` to the front of the queue.
2. **pushMiddle(val)**: Add a `val` to the middle of the queue.
3. **pushBack(val)**: Add a `val` to the back of the queue.
4. **popFront()**: Remove the front element from the queue and return it. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.
5. **popMiddle()**: Remove the middle element from the queue and return it. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.
6. **popBack()**: Remove the back element from the queue and return it. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.

The "middle" element is the median of the elements when sorted. If the number of elements is even, the middle element is the first element of the second half. (i.e., arr[(len(arr)-1)//2])

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints on the values of `val`?
   - No specific constraints beyond typical integer value ranges.
2. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if operations like `popFront`, `popMiddle`, or `popBack` are called on an empty queue?
   - Return `-1`.

### Strategy

To achieve efficient operations for all the specified methods, we can use two dequeues (double-ended queues), one to represent the first half and the other to represent the second half of the queue. This will help in efficiently managing the middle operations as well.

1. **pushFront(val)**: Insert `val` to the front of the first half. Balance the two halves if necessary.
2. **pushMiddle(val)**: Insert `val` to the end of the first half. Balance the two halves if necessary.
3. **pushBack(val)**: Insert `val` to the back of the second half. Balance the two halves if necessary.
4. **popFront()**: Remove the front element from the first half (or second half if the first half is empty). Balance the two halves if necessary.
5. **popMiddle()**: Remove the last element from the first half (or first element from the second half if the first half is empty). Balance the two halves if necessary.
6. **popBack()**: Remove the back element from the second half (or first half if the second half is empty). Balance the two halves if necessary.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

class FrontMiddleBackQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.first_half = deque()
        self.second_half = deque()

    def balance(self):
        # Ensure first_half and second_half are balanced
        if len(self.first_half) > len(self.second_half) + 1:
            self.second_half.appendleft(self.first_half.pop())
        elif len(self.first_half) < len(self.second_half):
            self.first_half.append(self.second_half.popleft())

    def pushFront(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.first_half.appendleft(val)
        self.balance()

    def pushMiddle(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.first_half.append(val)
        self.balance()

    def pushBack(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.second_half.append(val)
        self.balance()

    def popFront(self) -> int:
        if not self.first_half and not self.second_half:
            return -1
        if self.first_half:
            val = self.first_half.popleft()
        else:
            val = self.second_half.popleft()
        self.balance()
        return val

    def popMiddle(self) -> int:
        if not self.first_half and not self.second_half:
            return -1
        if len(self.first_half) >= len(self.second_half):
            val = self.first_half.pop()
        else:
            val = self.second_half.popleft()
        self.balance()
        return val

    def popBack(self) -> int:
        if not self.first_half and not self.second_half:
            return -1
        if self.second_half:
            val = self.second_half.pop()
        else:
            val = self.first_half.pop()
        self.balance()
        return val
```

### Time Complexity

- **pushFront, pushMiddle, pushBack**: Each operation involves appending to the deque (O(1)) and balancing the two halves (amortized O(1)).
- **popFront, popMiddle, popBack**: Each operation involves popping from the deque (O(1)) and balancing the two halves (amortized O(1)).

Thus, all operations run in O(1) amortized time.
