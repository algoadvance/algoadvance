title:  Sum of Values at Indices With K Set Bits-out
permalink: /s2859
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Return the sum of the elements of `nums` at indices where the number of 1s in the binary representation of the index is `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
2. What is the range of values for `k`?
   - `k` is a non-negative integer and will be less than or equal to the number of bits used to represent the indices of `nums`.
3. What are the constraints on the length of `nums`?
   - The length of `nums` can be up to \(2^{20}\).

### Strategy

1. **Bit Counting**: For each index, we need to count the number of 1 bits set in its binary representation.
2. **Sum Calculation**: If the count of set bits equals `k`, add the element at that index to the sum.
3. We can use Python’s built-in bit manipulation functions to make counting the 1s more efficient.

### Code

```python
def sum_indices_with_k_set_bits(nums, k):
    def count_set_bits(n):
        return bin(n).count('1')
    
    total_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if count_set_bits(i) == k:
            total_sum += nums[i]
            
    return total_sum
```

### Explanation

1. **Helper Function**: 
    - `count_set_bits(n)`: Returns the number of 1s in the binary representation of `n` by using `bin(n).count('1')`.
2. **Sum Calculation**:
    - Initialize `total_sum` to 0.
    - Loop through each index `i` in the array `nums`.
    - For each index, use `count_set_bits(i)` to get the number of set bits.
    - If this count equals `k`, add `nums[i]` to `total_sum`.
3. **Return Result**:
    - After loop finishes, return the computed `total_sum`.

### Time Complexity

- **Count Set Bits**: `bin(i).count('1')` runs in \(O(\log i)\), but practically it is very fast.
- **For Loop Over Indices**: We iterate over each element of the array once, making the loop \(O(n)\) if the length of `nums` is `n`.
- Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of `nums`, but the logarithmic factor is small in practice given Python’s efficient handling of integers.

This solution ensures that we are efficiently calculating the sum by leveraging Python's optimized bit manipulation tools.
