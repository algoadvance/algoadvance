title:  Maximum Fruits Harvested After at Most K Steps-out
permalink: /s2106

You are given a 2D integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti]` depicts the amount of fruits located at position `positioni` on a number line. Fruits are placed in ascending order of their positions.

Your starting position is at `startPos`. From `startPos`, you can move left or right by at most `k` steps.

Given `startPos` and `k`, return the maximum number of fruits you can harvest.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can `positioni` in the `fruits` array be negative?
   **A:** No, positions will be non-negative integers.
   
2. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that the positions in `fruits` are unique and sorted?
   **A:** Yes, positions are unique and given in ascending order.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the sizes of `fruits` and the values within `fruits`?
   **A:** Here are the constraints:
   - `1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= positioni, amounti <= 2 * 10^4`
   - `0 <= startPos, k <= 2 * 10^4`

### Strategy:
Given these constraints, we will use the following approach:
1. **Left and Right Limits Calculation:** Calculate the farthest left and right positions that can be reached given the start position and the number of steps `k`.
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use the sliding window technique to sum the fruit amounts in a range that maximizes the number of fruits collected. The window will adjust based on two pointers that represent the left and right limits of the current range.
3. **Traversing the Position Ranges:** The main idea is to consider various ranges around `startPos` and compute the total fruits that can be collected within `k` steps when the range shifts.

### Code:
```python
def maxFruits(fruits, startPos, k):
    # Initialize pointers and variables to keep track of maximum fruits collected
    n = len(fruits)
    max_fruits = 0
    current_sum = 0
    left = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        # Calculate distance to the current start position
        while left <= right and (fruits[right][0] - startPos + startPos - fruits[left][0] + min(fruits[right][0] - startPos, startPos - fruits[left][0])) > k:
            current_sum -= fruits[left][1]
            left += 1
        
        # Update current window sum
        current_sum += fruits[right][1]
        
        # Update maximum sum of fruits collected within the allowed steps
        max_fruits = max(max_fruits, current_sum)
    
    return max_fruits

# Example test case
fruits = [[2,4],[4,1],[6,5],[8,3]]
startPos = 4
k = 6
print(maxFruits(fruits, startPos, k))  # Expected output: 9
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of positions in the `fruits` array since each element is processed and adjusted once with the sliding window mechanism.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we're only using a few extra variables for tracking maximum fruits and the current sum within the fixed window.
