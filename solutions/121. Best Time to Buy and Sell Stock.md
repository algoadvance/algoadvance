title:  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock-out
permalink: /s121
---
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### Example:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can we have prices with zero or negative values?
   **A**: Prices can be zero, but they will not be negative.
2. **Q**: Is it guaranteed to have distinct prices every day?
   **A**: No, prices can repeat across different days.
3. **Q**: Can I assume input array is always valid (not empty)?
   **A**: Yes, as per the constraints, the length of the prices array is at least 1.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `min_price`: a variable to store the minimum price encountered so far, initialized to a high value (infinity).
   - `max_profit`: a variable to store the maximum profit observed so far, initialized to 0.

2. **Iterate Through Prices**:
   - For each price, update the `min_price` if the current price is lower than `min_price`.
   - Calculate the `current_profit` as the difference between the current price and `min_price`.
   - Update `max_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After iterating through all the prices, `max_profit` will hold the highest profit possible.

## Code
Here is the implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        current_profit = price - min_price
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
            
    return max_profit
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `prices` array. This is because we iterate through the list exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently finds the maximum profit in linear time while maintaining constant space usage.
