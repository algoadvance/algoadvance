title:  Sum of Subsequence Widths-out
permalink: /s891
---
The problem is to find the sum of all subsequences' widths of a given integer array `A`. The width of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. Given an array `A`, its width subsequence is:

```
( (elements) | max(elements) - min(elements) )
```

Return the sum of the widths of all possible subsequences of the array `A`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is the array sorted or unsorted?
    - Are all elements in the array distinct or can they contain duplicates?
    - What is the size range of the array `A`?

The general constraint of such problems on LeetCode:
- The array `A` will contain between 1 and 2000 elements.
- Each element of `A` will be between 1 and 10^9.

2. **Output Specification**:
    - Should the result be modulo `10^9 + 7`?

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**:
    - First, sort the array. This helps in easily finding the min and max within subsequences.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
    - For each element in the array, determine how many times it can be the minimum and the maximum in the subsequences.
    - If `A` is the sorted array, for an element `A[i]`:
        - It can be the maximum in `2^i` subsequences.
        - It can be the minimum in `2^(n-1-i)` subsequences.
    - The contribution of `A[i]` to the result can thus be found using this logic:
        \[
        \text{contribution} = A[i] \times (2^i - 2^{(n-1-i)})
        \]

3. **Final Calculation**:
    - Sum up all contributions and return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```python
def sumSubseqWidths(A):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(A)
    A.sort()
    
    # Precompute powers of 2 up to 2^1999 % MOD since input size is at max 2000
    pow2 = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        pow2[i] = pow2[i - 1] * 2 % MOD
    
    result = 0
    # Calculate the contribution of each element
    for i in range(n):
        # A[i] as the maximum
        result += A[i] * pow2[i]
        # A[i] as the minimum
        result -= A[i] * pow2[n - 1 - i]
        # Take modulo at each step to avoid overflow
        result %= MOD
    
    return result

# Example:
A = [2,1,3]
print(sumSubseqWidths(A))  # Output should be 6
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Precomputing the powers of 2 takes \(O(n)\).
- Calculating the result by iterating through the array takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), dominated by the sorting step.

### Conclusion

This solution effectively leverages sorting and mathematical properties of subsequences to derive the answer efficiently within the given constraints.
