title:  Find Indices With Index and Value Difference II-out
permalink: /s2905
---

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `t`, return the indices of all pairs `(i, j)` of `nums` that satisfy the following conditions:
- `i != j`
- `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= t`
- `|i - j| <= k`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the format of the output?**
    - The output should be a list of tuples where each tuple represents the indices `(i, j)`.

2. **Can the values of `k` and `t` be negative?**
    - Typically, `k` and `t` are non-negative, as they represent non-negative constraints on indices and differences in values, respectively.

3. **Is there a specific range for the elements in the `nums` array?**
    - There is no specific range mentioned, so we assume any integer values.

4. **What should be done if no pairs satisfy the conditions?**
    - If no pairs satisfy the conditions, return an empty list.

## Strategy

1. Use a sliding window of size `k` to keep track of the current possible indices.
2. For each element in the array, `nums[i]`, compare it with the elements that fall within the sliding window to check if their indices and values satisfy the required conditions.
3. Use a balanced binary search tree or sorted list to efficiently manage and query these indices.
4. Append each valid pair `(i, j)` to the result list.

## Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def find_indices_with_difference(nums, k, t):
    if k <= 0 or t < 0:
        return []
    
    result = []
    window = SortedList()
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Find if there is already a value within the required range
        if window:
            pos1 = SortedList.bisect_left(window, nums[i] - t)
            pos2 = SortedList.bisect_right(window, nums[i] + t)
            
            for j in range(pos1, pos2):
                # j represents the position in the sorted list
                # we need to find the original index that corresponds to this value
                index_in_window = window[j][1]
                if abs(i - index_in_window) <= k:
                    result.append((index_in_window, i))
                
        # Adding the current element into the window
        window.add((nums[i], i))
        
        # Remove the element that gets out of the sliding window range
        if i >= k:
            window.remove((nums[i - k], i - k))
            
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
k = 3
t = 0
print(find_indices_with_difference(nums, k, t)) # Expected [(0, 3)]
```

## Time Complexity

- The addition and removal of elements to/from the `SortedList` each take `O(log k)` time.
- For each element in the `nums` array, we perform a query operation in the `SortedList` which also takes `O(log k)`.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log k)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.

This solution efficiently finds all pairs `(i, j)` that meet the given constraints using the properties of a sorted list to manage and query the sliding window.
