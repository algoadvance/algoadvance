title:  Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions-out
permalink: /s2300
---

You are given two positive integer arrays `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m` respectively, where `spells[i]` represents the strength of the `i-th` spell, and `potions[j]` represents the strength of the `j-th` potion. You are also given an integer `success`.

A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least `success`.

Return an integer array `pairs` of length `n` where `pairs[i]` is the number of potions that form a successful pair with the `i-th` spell.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the input array contain any constraints like sorted order?**
   - No specific constraints about ordering are mentioned.

2. **Is there any constraint on the range of values for the elements in `spells` and `potions`, and the value of `success`?**
   - The problem generally assumes standard integer range constraints.

3. **Can we use extra space for auxiliary data structures?**
   - Yes, using extra space is permitted to optimize the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Potions array**:
   - Sorting the potions array will help us use binary search to quickly determine the number of successful pairs for each spell.

2. **Binary Search to Find the Minimum Potion**:
   - For each spell, using binary search on the sorted potions array, we can find the smallest potion that can form a successful pair with the spell.
   - Calculate the required minimum potion strength as `min_potion = ceil(success / spell)`. We can use math.ceil or handle it manually since we are using integers.

3. **Count Successful Pairs**:
   - The count of successful pairs for a spell will be the number of elements from the found position to the end of the potions array.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
import bisect

def successfulPairs(spells, potions, success):
    potions.sort()  # sort the potions array
    pairs = []  # to store the number of successful pairs for each spell
    
    for spell in spells:
        # Calculate the minimum potion needed to achieve the success condition
        if spell == 0:  
            pairs.append(0)
            continue
            
        required_potion = (success + spell - 1) // spell  # equivalent to math.ceil(success / spell)
        
        # Find the first potion that is >= required_potion using binary search
        index = bisect.bisect_left(potions, required_potion)
        
        # Count of successful potions is the portion from index to end
        num_successful_potions = len(potions) - index
        
        pairs.append(num_successful_potions)
        
    return pairs

# Example usage:
spells = [10, 20, 30]
potions = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
success = 100

print(successfulPairs(spells, potions, success))  # Output: [0, 0, 1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Potions**:
  - Sorting the `potions` array will take \(O(m \log m)\), where `m` is the length of the potions array.

- **Processing Each Spell**:
  - For each spell, we use binary search on the potions array, which takes \(O(\log m)\).

- **Total Complexity**:
  - Let `n` be the length of the `spells` array.
  - The total time complexity is \(O(m \log m + n \log m)\).

This approach ensures that we handle the problem efficiently even for larger input sizes.
