Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that `beginWord` is not a transformed word.

Return the length of the shortest transformation sequence, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

### Example:
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", return its length 5.

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in the word list, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is `beginWord` guaranteed to be different from `endWord`?
    - Are all words in the input of the same length?
    - Is the word list guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output**:
    - Should 0 be returned if no valid transformation is found?
    - Are there any limits on the size of the word list?

## Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

def ladderLength(beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
    if endWord not in wordList:
        return 0
    
    wordSet = set(wordList)
    queue = deque([(beginWord, 1)])
    
    while queue:
        current_word, level = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_word == endWord:
            return level
        
        for i in range(len(current_word)):
            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                next_word = current_word[:i] + c + current_word[i+1:]
                if next_word in wordSet:
                    wordSet.remove(next_word)
                    queue.append((next_word, level + 1))
                    
    return 0
```

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
    - This approach is suitable because we're looking for the shortest path and BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
    
2. **Queue Initialization**:
    - Initialize a queue with a tuple containing the `beginWord` and the initial transformation length (1).

3. **Level Traversal**:
    - For each word, change each character to all possible letters from 'a' to 'z'.
    - If the new word is in the word list (set for O(1) lookups), add it to the queue for further exploration.
    - Remove words from the set once they're added to prevent cycles and redundant operations.
  
4. **Termination**:
    - If the `endWord` is reached, return the level.
    - If the queue gets exhausted without finding `endWord`, return 0.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(M \times N \times 26)\)
    - \(M\) is the length of the words.
    - \(N\) is the total number of words in the word list.
    - For each word, we check each position (M positions) and iterate over 26 possible letters (constant factor).

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(M \times N)\)
    - The queue can hold up to \(N\) words with \(M\)-length and the set operations.

This provides an efficient solution to find the shortest transformation sequence.
