title:  Maximum Score of a Node Sequence-out
permalink: /s2242
---
You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and an array `scores` of length `n`, where `scores[i]` denotes the score of node `i`. Additionally, you are given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

A node sequence is a sequence of nodes `[a, b, c, d]` such that:
- There is an edge between `a` and `b`.
- There is an edge between `b` and `c`.
- There is an edge between `c` and `d`.

Your goal is to find the maximum possible score of any valid node sequence `[a, b, c, d]`. The score of a given node sequence is defined as `scores[a] + scores[b] + scores[c] + scores[d]`.

If there are no valid node sequences, return `-1`.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the undirected graph using an adjacency list to easily access the neighbors of each node.
2. **Valid Sequence Search**:
   - Iterate through each edge `[ui, vi]` considering `ui` and `vi` as potential `b` and `c` in the sequence `[a, b, c, d]`.
   - For each edge `[ui, vi]`, find the top `4` neighbors with the highest scores of `ui` (excluding `vi`) and `vi` (excluding `ui`).
   - Combine these top neighbors to form potential valid sequences `[a, ui, vi, d]`.
3. **Scoring**:
   - Calculate the scores for all valid sequences found and keep track of the maximum score.

### Code
Below is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def maximumScore(scores, edges):
    n = len(scores)
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)
    
    best_score = -1
    
    for u, v in edges:
        top_u = heapq.nlargest(3, [scores[nei] for nei in adj[u] if nei != v])
        top_v = heapq.nlargest(3, [scores[nei] for nei in adj[v] if nei != u])
        
        for score_u in top_u:
            for score_v in top_v:
                node_u = next(nei for nei in adj[u] if scores[nei] == score_u and nei != v)
                node_v = next(nei for nei in adj[v] if scores[nei] == score_v and nei != u and nei != node_u)
                
                seq_score = scores[u] + scores[v] + score_u + score_v
                best_score = max(best_score, seq_score)
                
    return best_score

# Example usage:
scores = [5, 2, 9, 8, 4]
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4]]
print(maximumScore(scores, edges))  # Output would be 24
```

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure the correct implementation of the solution, consider the following clarifying questions:
1. Can a node in the adjacency list contain duplicate entries, meaning can there be multiple edges between two nodes?
2. Is the graph guaranteed to be connected, or are there potentially disconnected components?

### Time Complexity
The time complexity to solve this problem is derived from:
- **Graph Construction**: O(E)
- **Finding the Top Neighbors**: For each edge, get the top `3` highest scores from neighbors, which involves at most `O(n log n)` operations.
- **Combinations and Scoring**: The nested loops run constant times (since we are dealing with at most 3 nodes always).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(E*n log n)`, where `E` is the number of edges and `n` is the number of nodes. This is efficient for moderate values of `n` and `E`.

**Note**: The provided example is to illustrate the method; the final code should handle edge cases and invalid graphs according to problem constraints more precisely.
