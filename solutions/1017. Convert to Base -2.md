title:  Convert to Base -2-out
permalink: /s1017
---
Convert a given integer `n` to a binary number in base `-2`. The function should return the result as a string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the integer `n`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but typical constraints for such problems are within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (i.e., `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`).

2. **What should the function return if `n` is zero or negative?**
   - Return `"0"` for `n = 0`. For negative values, conversion should follow the rules of base -2 representations.

3. **Any constraints on the performance or format of the output?**
   - The output should be a string representing the integer in base -2.
   - Performance should handle the typical constraints of LeetCode problems efficiently.

## Strategy
1. **Understand Base -2**:
   - In base -2, digits can be either `0` or `1`, but the base is negative.
   - For example, `1010` in base -2 represents `1*(-2)^3 + 0*(-2)^2 + 1*(-2)^1 + 0*(-2)^0 = -8 + 2 = -6`.

2. **Conversion Algorithm**:
   - The conversion process involves repeated division by -2, recording the remainders. A remainder of -1 or less would be adjusted to fit the digit range of `0` and `1`.

3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty result list.
   - Continue the division process until `n` becomes zero.
   - In each step, calculate the remainder and update `n` accordingly.
   - Append the corresponding digit to the result list.
   - Join and reverse to form the final string result.

Here is the code implementation using the above strategy:

```python
def base_neg2(n: int) -> str:
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    
    result = []
    while n != 0:
        n, remainder = divmod(n, -2)
        if remainder < 0:
            remainder += 2
            n += 1
        result.append(str(remainder))
    
    return ''.join(result[::-1])

# Example usage:
# print(base_neg2(2))  => "110"
# print(base_neg2(3))  => "111"
# print(base_neg2(4))  => "100"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(n)). This is because the loop reduces the magnitude of `n` exponentially, and each step of the loop takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(log(n)). This is for storing the result list which grows in proportion to the number of digits in the base -2 representation.
