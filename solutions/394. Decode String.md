title:  Decode String-out
permalink: /s394
---
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. You may assume that the input string is always valid; no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

**Example 1:**

Input: `s = "3[a]2[bc]"`
Output: `"aaabcbc"`

**Example 2:**

Input: `s = "3[a2[c]]"`
Output: `"accaccacc"`

**Example 3:**

Input: `s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"`
Output: `"abcabccdcdcdef"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are nested encodings possible?
   - **A:** Yes, nested encodings are possible as illustrated in the examples.
2. **Q:** Can we assume the input string is always correctly formatted?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume the input string is always valid and well-formed.

### Strategy
The problem contains nested structures and repeated patterns, which makes it apt for a **stack** based solution. Here is the strategy to decode the string:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of characters and numbers.
   - Iterate through the input string, processing one character at a time.

2. **Processing Characters:**
   - If you encounter a digit, calculate the full digit (since it can be more than one character like `10`).
   - If you encounter `[`, start a new segment.
   - If you encounter `]`, pop from stack until you get the matching `[`, decode the current segment, and repeat it according to the number on the top of the stack before the `[`.

3. **Reconstructing String:**
   - For characters and completed segments inside the stack, concatenate to form the final decoded string.

### Code
```python
def decodeString(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    current_num = 0
    current_string = ''
    
    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
        elif char == '[':
            # Push the current num and string to the stack
            stack.append(current_string)
            stack.append(current_num)
            # Reset current variables
            current_string = ''
            current_num = 0
        elif char == ']':
            # Pop the number first and then the string
            num = stack.pop()
            prev_string = stack.pop()
            # Build the new string
            current_string = prev_string + num * current_string
        else:
            current_string += char
            
    return current_string
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character in the string is processed once, and operations on the stack (push and pop) are O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), because in the worst case, the stack can store all characters of the string.

This solution efficiently handles the decoding of strings with nested and repeated encoded patterns using a stack-based approach.
