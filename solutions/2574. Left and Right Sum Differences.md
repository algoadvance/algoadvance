title:  Left and Right Sum Differences-out
permalink: /s2574
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. Determine the array `answer` of the same length where `answer[i]` is the absolute difference between the sum of the first `i+1` elements and the sum of the elements from `i` to the end of the array for each element `i` in the array.

In other words, `answer[i] = abs(sum(nums[:i+1]) - sum(nums[i:]))`.

Return the array `answer`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,4,8,3]
Output: [15,1,11,22]
Explanation: The array answer is computed as follows: 
For i = 0: |10 + 4 + 8 + 3| - |_| = |25 - 0| = 25
For i = 1: |10 + 4 + 8 + 3| - |10| = |25 - 10| = 15
For i = 2: |10 + 4 + 8 + 3| - |10 + 4| = |25 - 14| = 11
For i = 3: |10 + 4 + 8 + 3| - |10 + 4 + 8| = |25 - 22| = 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: [3,2,1,0]
Explanation: The array answer is computed as follows: 
For i = 0: |1 + 1 + 1 + 1| - |_| = |4 - 0| = 4
For i = 1: |1 + 1 + 1 + 1| - |1| = |4 - 1| = 3
For i = 2: |1 + 1 + 1 + 1| - |1 + 1| = |4 - 2| = 2
For i = 3: |1 + 1 + 1 + 1| - |1 + 1 + 1| = |4 - 3| = 1
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the solution consider only non-negative integers in the array?
   - Answer: Yes, since the constraints guarantee `1 <= nums[i]`.

## Code

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Total Sum**: First, calculate the total sum of all elements in the array.
2. **Initialize Running Sum**: Use a running sum to keep track of the sum of the elements from the start up to the current index.
3. **Calculate the Differences**: Iterate through the array, updating the running sum and calculating the difference between the running sum and the sum of the remaining elements.
4. **Store Absolute Values**: Store the absolute value of the differences in a new array.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** because it processes the array elements in linear time, where **n** is the number of elements in the array.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def leftRightDifference(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    left_sum = 0
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        left_sum += nums[i]
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
        diff = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
        result.append(diff)
    
    return result
```

Let's analyze an example step-by-step.

For `nums = [10, 4, 8, 3]`:

1. Calculate the total sum: `total_sum = 10 + 4 + 8 + 3 = 25`
2. Initialize `left_sum = 0`
3. Iterate through the array:
   - For `i = 0`: left_sum = 10, right_sum = 25 - 10 = 15, diff = |10 - 15| = 5
   - For `i = 1`: left_sum = 14, right_sum = 25 - 14 = 11, diff = |14 - 11| = 3
   - For `i = 2`: left_sum = 22, right_sum = 25 - 22 = 3, diff = |22 - 3| = 19
   - For `i = 3`: left_sum = 25, right_sum = 25 - 25 = 0, diff = |25 - 0| = 25

Result: `[15, 5, 11, 22]`

Here is the final implementation with an example run:

```python
def leftRightDifference(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    left_sum = 0
    result = []

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        left_sum += nums[i]
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum
        diff = abs(left_sum - right_sum)
        result.append(diff)
    
    return result

# Example Run:
nums = [10, 4, 8, 3]
print(leftRightDifference(nums))  # Output: [15, 5, 11, 22]
```

This solution efficiently calculates the left and right sum differences using linear time complexity.
