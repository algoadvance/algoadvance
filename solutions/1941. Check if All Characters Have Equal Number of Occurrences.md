title:  Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences-out
permalink: /s1941
---
Given a string `s`, determine if all characters in the string have the same number of occurrences.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length range of the string `s`?  
      - The string can have a length ranging from 1 to \(10^5\).
    - What kind of characters does the string contain?  
      - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
    - Return `True` if all characters in the string have the same number of occurrences; otherwise, return `False`.
    
### Strategy
1. **Data Structure**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Steps**:
    1. Traverse the string `s` and count the occurrences of each character using a dictionary.
    2. Extract the set of values (frequencies) from the dictionary.
    3. If the length of the set of frequencies is 1, return `True` (indicating all characters have the same frequency). Otherwise, return `False`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string once to count the characters and then perform operations on a fixed size set of frequencies.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) or \(O(26)\) considering the fixed number of lowercase English letters, which can be considered as constant space \(O(1)\).

### Code
```python
def areOccurrencesEqual(s: str) -> bool:
    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each character
    freq_dict = {}
    
    # Count the frequencies of each character
    for char in s:
        if char in freq_dict:
            freq_dict[char] += 1
        else:
            freq_dict[char] = 1
    
    # Set to store unique frequencies
    freq_set = set(freq_dict.values())
    
    # If there's only one unique frequency, return True
    return len(freq_set) == 1
```

### Example
1. **Input**: `s = "abacbc"`
    - Frequencies: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
    - Unique Frequencies: {2}
    - Output: `True`

2. **Input**: `s = "aaabb"`
    - Frequencies: {'a': 3, 'b': 2}
    - Unique Frequencies: {2, 3}
    - Output: `False`

This approach ensures we efficiently check whether all characters in the string `s` occur the same number of times.
