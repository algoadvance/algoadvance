Given `n` pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed (valid) parentheses.

### Example

``` 
Input: n = 3
Output: 
[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` can be from 0 to any reasonable integer. For interview purposes, constraints would be practical (e.g., 0 ≤ n ≤ 8).
   
2. **Is there a specific order in which the results should be provided?**
   - No, the order of the generated combinations does not matter as long as they are all provided.

3. **Should we handle invalid inputs, such as negative integers or non-integer values for `n`?**
   - Let's assume `n` is always a valid, non-negative integer for the sake of this problem.

### Strategy
The goal is to generate all possible valid combinations of `n` pairs of parentheses. This can be efficiently achieved using a recursive backtracking approach:

1. **Recursive Backtracking:** 
   - Use a recursive function that constructs the parentheses one character at a time.
   - Maintain a balance count to ensure the parentheses remain well-formed.
   - Keep two counters for the number of opening and closing parentheses used so far:
     - Only add an opening parenthesis `(` if it would not exceed `n`.
     - Only add a closing parenthesis `)` if it would not create an imbalance in parentheses.
2. **Base Case:**
   - If the combination has used all `n` pairs, add it to the result list.

### Code

```python
def generateParenthesis(n):
    def backtrack(current, open_count, close_count):
        if len(current) == 2 * n:
            result.append("".join(current))
            return
        if open_count < n:
            current.append('(')
            backtrack(current, open_count + 1, close_count)
            current.pop()
        if close_count < open_count:
            current.append(')')
            backtrack(current, open_count, close_count + 1)
            current.pop()

    result = []
    backtrack([], 0, 0)
    return result

# Example usage
print(generateParenthesis(3))
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this problem is `O(4^n / sqrt(n))`. This comes from the fact that we're generating all combinations of balanced parentheses, which is a well-known problem with this complexity. 

### Explanation of Time Complexity
The number of valid parentheses sequences is the `n-th Catalan number`, which is approximately `O(4^n / sqrt(n))`. This complexity arises from the possible sequences we generate and prune during our recursive backtracking solution.

### Summary
- The problem involves generating well-formed parentheses combinations using backtracking.
- We maintain counters for open and close parentheses to ensure validity.
- The time complexity reflects the nature of generating balanced parentheses sequences, closely related to Catalan numbers.
