title:  Surrounded Regions-out
permalink: /s130
---
Given an `m x n` matrix board containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions that are surrounded by `'X'`. A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

### Example
Input:
```
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

Output:
```
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

### Explanation:
Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any `'O'` connected to an border `'O'` cannot be flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border or not connected to a border `'O'` will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the input matrix always contain at least one cell?**
    - Yes, the input matrix `board` will contain at least one cell.
2. **Will the board always be rectangular in shape?**
    - Yes, the input matrix `board` will always be rectangular.
3. **Can the board contain invalid characters other than 'X' or 'O'?**
    - No, the board will only contain the characters 'X' and 'O'.

## Strategy
1. Traverse the board and start a Depth-First Search (DFS) from all `'O'`s located on the border.
2. Mark these `'O'`s and all connected `'O'`s (i.e., that are not surrounded by `'X'`) with a temporary marker, for example, `'T'`.
3. After marking, traverse the entire board again:
    - Convert all `'T'` (temporary marker) back to `'O'`.
    - Convert all other `'O'` (which are surrounded by `'X'`) to `'X'`.

## Code
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def solve(board):
    if not board or not board[0]:
        return

    rows = len(board)
    cols = len(board[0])

    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or board[r][c] != 'O':
            return
        board[r][c] = 'T'  # Temporary marker
        dfs(r-1, c)
        dfs(r+1, c)
        dfs(r, c-1)
        dfs(r, c+1)

    # Step 1: Perform DFS for 'O's on the border
    for i in range(rows):
        if board[i][0] == 'O':
            dfs(i, 0)
        if board[i][cols-1] == 'O':
            dfs(i, cols-1)

    for j in range(cols):
        if board[0][j] == 'O':
            dfs(0, j)
        if board[rows-1][j] == 'O':
            dfs(rows-1, j)

    # Step 2: Flip all the 'O's to 'X' and all 'T's back to 'O'
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if board[r][c] == 'O':
                board[r][c] = 'X'
            elif board[r][c] == 'T':
                board[r][c] = 'O'

# Example Usage:
board = [
    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'X', 'O', 'X'],
    ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X']
]
solve(board)
print(board)
# Output:
# [['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
#  ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
#  ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],
#  ['X', 'O', 'X', 'X']]
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the board because each cell is visited a constant number of times.
- The space complexity is dominated by the recursion stack of DFS, which in the worst case can go up to **O(m * n)**.

This approach efficiently marks non-surrounded 'O's and flips only those that are truly surrounded by 'X's, providing an optimal solution to the problem.
