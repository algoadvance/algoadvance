title:  Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph-out
permalink: /s1857
---

You are given a directed graph of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n-1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the color of the `i-th` node in this graph (0-indexed). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[j] = [a_j, b_j]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `a_j` to node `b_j`.

A valid path in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x1 -> x2 -> x3 -> ... -> xk` such that there is a directed edge from `xi` to `xi+1` for every `1 <= i < k`. The color value of a path is the number of nodes that have the most frequent color along that path.

Return the largest color value of any valid path in the given graph, or `-1` if the graph contains a cycle.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using adjacency lists. Use in-degree counting for detecting cycles.

2. **Topological Sorting**: Use Kahn's Algorithm for topological sorting to detect any cycles and also process the nodes in topological order if no cycle exists.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP table `dp[u][c]` where `dp[u][c]` represents the maximum number of times color `c` appears in any path ending at node `u`.

4. **Tracking Maximum Color Value**: Track the maximum value of colors encountered during the processing of nodes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the color values guaranteed to only contain lowercase English letters?
2. Can the graph contain self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
3. What should the function return if there are no edges?

### Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def largestPathValue(colors: str, edges: [[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(colors)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegree = [0] * n
    
    # Build the graph and indegree array
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        indegree[v] += 1

    # Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sort
    topo_sort = []
    queue = deque()
    
    for i in range(n):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        topo_sort.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            indegree[neighbor] -= 1
            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)

    # If topological sort does not include all nodes, there is a cycle
    if len(topo_sort) != n:
        return -1

    # DP Array to store the max frequency of colors in paths up to each node
    dp = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n)]
    max_color_value = 0

    # Process nodes in topological order
    for node in topo_sort:
        color_idx = ord(colors[node]) - ord('a')
        dp[node][color_idx] += 1
        max_color_value = max(max_color_value, dp[node][color_idx])
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            for c in range(26):
                dp[neighbor][c] = max(dp[neighbor][c], dp[node][c])

    return max_color_value

# Example:
# colors = "abaca"
# edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
# print(largestPathValue(colors, edges)) # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Graph and In-degree Construction**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of edges.
2. **Topological Sort**: \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes and \(m\) is the number of edges.
3. **DP Array Update**: \(O(26 \times (n + m))\), as we process each node and edge updating the DP table for each of 26 letters.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O((n + m) \times 26)\), which simplifies to \(O(n + m)\). The additional factor of 26 is constant, so it is often omitted in Big-O notation. The solution is efficient for large graphs as typically expected in coding interviews.
