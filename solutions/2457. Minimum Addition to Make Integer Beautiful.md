title:  Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful-out
permalink: /s2457
---
Given a positive integer `n` and an integer `target`, you can do the following operation any number of times:
- Increment the integer `n` by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum of the digits of `n` equal to or less than `target`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `target`?**
   - Both `n` and `target` are positive integers with `1 <= n, target <= 10^12`.

2. **What is the expected output if it is impossible to make the sum of digits equal to or less than the target?**
   - By incrementing `n`, it should always be possible to make its digits' sum smaller, so it's never impossible.

3. **Is performance a big concern?**
   - Given the constraint of `10^12`, we should aim for an efficient solution.

### Strategy:
Given the problem constraints, an efficient solution involves:
1. Calculating the sum of digits of `n`.
2. Incrementing `n` until this sum is less than or equal to `target`.

Since iterating from `n` and incrementing one-by-one would be too slow for large values of `n`, we need a more mathematically efficient approach. One way is to:
- Check sums digit-wise.
- Use arithmetic properties to efficiently skip ranges of increments.

**Plan:**
1. Define a helper to calculate the sum of digits.
2. If the initial sum is already less than or equal to `target`, return 0.
3. Otherwise, determine the required number to add to `n` by considering the magnitude determined by each digit in `n`.

### Code:
```python
def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

def make_integer_beautiful(n, target):
    # starting position and sum
    current_sum = sum_of_digits(n)
    operations = 0
    
    # Create a new number iteratively, appending zeros in higher magnitudes
    base = 1
    while current_sum > target:
        # Determine the increment at the current base
        increment = base * (10 - int(str(n)[-1])) if str(n)[-1] != '0' else base
        n += increment
        operations += increment
        
        # Update the sum of digits after increment
        current_sum = sum_of_digits(n)
        
        # Move to the next base (shifting left)
        base *= 10
    
    return operations
    
# Example use-case
print(make_integer_beautiful(37, 10))  # example output
```

### Explanation:
1. **sum_of_digits**: Utility to sum the digits of a number.
2. **make_integer_beautiful**:
   - **Loop Until Target Achieved**: We keep checking if the current sum of digits is greater than the target.
   - **Increment Calculation**: We identify the required increment to make the last non-zero digit zero or increment by the smallest base, effectively rounding up.
   - **Update `n` and Operations**: Increase `n` and track the number of operations.
   - **Base Management**: Shift the base to consider higher digit increments next.

### Time Complexity:
- Calculating sum of digits: \(O(\log n)\)
- Loop through each digit position of \(n\), ensuring give major increments.
Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(\log^2 n)\), which is efficient for values up to \(10^{12}\).
