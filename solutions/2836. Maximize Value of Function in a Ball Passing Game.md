title:  Maximize Value of Function in a Ball Passing Game-out
permalink: /s2836
---

You are given a weighted undirected graph represented by a positive integer `n` denoting the number of nodes and a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, w_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` with weight `w_i`.

Initially, a ball is at node `0`. Every second, it can either remain at its current node or move to an adjacent node. The ball follows a sequence of nodes `path = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_t]` such that each adjacent pair of nodes `a_i` and `a_{i+1}` (for all `0 <= i < t`) are directly connected in the graph by an edge.

The value of the function at a particular node `k` in the graph is the total weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) after adding the ball to node `k`. You need to find the maximum value of this function across all nodes in the graph.

Returns the maximum value of the function `MST + weight(k)` for all nodes `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that the graph is connected?
2. Can the ball traverse any node multiple times?
3. Are there any constraints on the weights of the edges (e.g., non-negative)?
4. Is there any constraint on the dimensions of `edges`?
5. How should ties (same value function for multiple nodes) be resolved?

## Strategy

To maximize the value function, we need to:

1. Compute the MST of the graph using Kruskal’s or Prim's algorithm.
2. Compute the total weight of the MST.
3. For each node in the graph, find the maximum value by using the ball's position.

### Steps:

1. **Parse Input:** Extract the number of nodes `n` and the edges list.
2. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):** Use Prim’s or Kruskal's algorithm to calculate the MST of the graph, and compute its weight.
3. **Maximizing Value Function:** For each node, simulate placing the ball at that node and compute the value function (MST + weight of the edges connected to that node).

### Time Complexity

- **Prim’s/Kruskal's Algorithm**: O(E log V) where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
- **Overall Complexity**: The main complexity will be derived from the MST calculation, thus O(E log V).

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

# Helper function to calculate MST using Prim's algorithm
def calculate_mst(n, edges):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, weight in edges:
        adj_list[u].append((weight, v))
        adj_list[v].append((weight, u))
    
    # Prim's algorithm with Min-Heap
    min_heap = [(0, 0)]  # (weight, node)
    mst_weight = 0
    visited = set()
    
    while min_heap and len(visited) < n:
        weight, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if u in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(u)
        mst_weight += weight
        
        for next_weight, v in adj_list[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (next_weight, v))
    
    return mst_weight if len(visited) == n else float('inf')

def maximize_value_function(n, edges):
    mst_weight = calculate_mst(n, edges)
    
    node_weights = [0] * n
    for u, v, weight in edges:
        node_weights[u] += weight
        node_weights[v] += weight
    
    max_value = 0
    for k in range(n):
        max_value = max(max_value, mst_weight + node_weights[k])
    
    return max_value

# Example usage:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 10], [0, 2, 6], [0, 3, 5], [1, 3, 15], [2, 3, 4]]

print(maximize_value_function(n, edges))  # Example output based on the input
```

This approach ensures we calculate the MST weight and then evaluate the value of the function for each node in an optimal manner.
