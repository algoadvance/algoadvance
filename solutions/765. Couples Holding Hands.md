title:  Couples Holding Hands-out

You are given an integer array `row` of length `2n` where `n` is the number of couples. The elements in `row` are numbered from `0` to `2n-1` and are arranged in some random order. 

Initially, each integer in `row` represents a person, and couples are represented as two consecutive integers (e.g., couple "0" is represented by integers "0" and "1", couple "1" is represented by integers "2" and "3", and so on).

The goal is to determine the minimum number of swaps required such that each couple ends up sitting next to each other.

### Example:
```
Input: row = [0, 2, 1, 3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap row[1] and row[2] to have row[0]={0, 1} and row[2]={2, 3}.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output if the initial array is already sorted?**
   - If the array is already sorted such that each couple is next to each other, the output should be 0.

2. **Can the input array contain duplicate integers?**
   - No, each person (integer) will appear exactly once in the array.

3. **What are the constraints on performance?**
   - Ideally, the solution should aim for a time complexity around O(n), where n is the number of couples.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Couples**:
   - Construct couples such that for any person `p`, their partner in the couple is `(p ^ 1)`. This operation flips the last bit, mapping `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0`, `2 -> 3`, `3 -> 2`, etc.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - Iterate through the list `row` in steps of 2 (since couples are formed by pairs of seats).
   - Check if the current seat and the next seat form a couple.
   - If they donâ€™t, find the partner of the current seat and swap it with the current incorrect neighbor to correct the mistake.
   - Count each swap and continue until the array is completely paired.

3. **Mapping and Positions**:
   - Use a dictionary to maintain the current positions of each person for efficient lookups during swaps.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def minSwapsCouples(row):
    n = len(row) // 2
    
    # Create a position map
    position = {person: i for i, person in enumerate(row)}
    
    swaps = 0
    
    for i in range(0, len(row), 2):
        first_person = row[i]
        second_person = row[i + 1]
        
        # Get the expected pair of the first person
        expected_pair = first_person ^ 1
        
        if second_person != expected_pair:
            # Find the expected pair's current position
            second_person_index = position[expected_pair]
            
            # Swap the second person with the expected pair
            row[i + 1], row[second_person_index] = row[second_person_index], row[i + 1]
            
            # Update positions in position map
            position[second_person] = second_person_index
            position[expected_pair] = i + 1
            
            # Count a swap
            swaps += 1
    
    return swaps

# Example usage:
row = [0, 2, 1, 3]
print(minSwapsCouples(row))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution is O(n), where n is the number of couples, because we iterate through the array once, and each lookup and swap operation is O(1) due to the position map.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) because we store the positions of all `2n` elements in the position map.

This approach minimizes unnecessary swaps and ensures that the solution is efficient even for larger inputs.
