title:  Maximum Elegance of a K-Length Subsequence-out
permalink: /s2813
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find a subsequence of `nums` of length `k` that maximizes the sum of the elements in the subsequence while maintaining the element order from the original array.

Your solution should return the sum of this k-length subsequence.

**Constraints:**
- The length of `nums` will be between 1 and 10^5.
- The elements of `nums` can be any integer.
- 1 ≤ k ≤ length of `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements of `nums` be negative?**
   - Yes, elements can be any integer.
2. **Is the subsequence required to maintain the order of `nums`?**
   - Yes, it must maintain the order from the original array.
3. **Are there any specific constraints on time or space complexity we should consider?**
   - The length of `nums` can be large (up to 10^5), so an efficient solution is required.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Use a max heap**: We will use a max heap (priority queue) to keep track of the `k` largest sums as we iterate through `nums`.
2. **Iterate through `nums`**: As we iterate through `nums`, we will always add the current element to the heap.
3. **Maintain heap size**: If the heap size exceeds `k`, we will remove the smallest element from the heap. This ensures that the heap always contains the `k` largest elements seen so far while maintaining their order.
4. **Sum the elements in the heap**: After processing all elements, sum the elements in the heap to get our desired maximum sum of the k-length subsequence.

## Code

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import heapq

def max_elegance_subsequence(nums, k):
    # Initialize a min-heap
    min_heap = []
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)
    
    # Iterate through each number in nums
    for num in nums:
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
        # Ensure the heap doesn't grow bigger than k
        if len(min_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
    
    # Sum up the elements in the heap to get the required maximum sum of k-length subsequence
    return sum(min_heap)

# Example usage:
nums = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
k = 3
print(max_elegance_subsequence(nums, k))  # Output should be 12 (subsequence [4, 3, 5] or [5, 3, 4] etc.)
```

## Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity of the solution:
- Iterating through `nums` takes O(n) time.
- Each operation of pushing to and popping from the heap takes O(log k) time.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log k).

This is efficient given the constraints, as it handles up to 10^5 elements in the array, keeping operations within acceptable limits.

## Conclusion

By using a min-heap, we efficiently maintain the largest `k` elements from the array `nums` and ensure that we achieve the maximum possible sum for a subsequence of length `k`, all while maintaining an O(n log k) time complexity.
