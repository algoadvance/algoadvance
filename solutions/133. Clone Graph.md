**Leetcode Problem 133: Clone Graph**

Given a reference of a node in a **connected** undirected graph, return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a value (`int`) and a list of its neighbors.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is it possible to have nodes with the same value in the graph?
   **A:** Yes, node values are not guaranteed to be unique.

2. **Q:** Is the graph always connected?
   **A:** Yes, as stated in the problem.

3. **Q:** Can the input node be `None`?
   **A:** Yes, the input can be `None` and in that case, the output should also be `None`.

4. **Q:** What is the range of node values and the maximum number of nodes?
   **A:** Node values are typically positive integers. The graph can have up to 100 nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Use DFS/BFS Traversal:** To clone the graph, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. 

2. **HashMap to Track Clones:** Utilize a hashmap (dictionary) to store the mapping from original nodes to their clone nodes to avoid duplication.

3. **Recursive/Iterative Approach:** Both recursive (DFS) and iterative (BFS) approaches can be used. We'll demonstrate the BFS approach using a queue for simplicity.

### Code

The following code uses BFS to clone the graph:

```python
from collections import deque

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

def cloneGraph(node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    if not node:
        return None

    # Dictionary to store the mapping from original node to its clone
    clone_map = {node: Node(node.val)}

    # Initialize BFS queue
    queue = deque([node])

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.popleft()

        # Iterate over all the neighbors of the current node
        for neighbor in current_node.neighbors:
            if neighbor not in clone_map:
                # Clone the neighbor and add it to the dictionary
                clone_map[neighbor] = Node(neighbor.val)
                # Enqueue the original neighbor node
                queue.append(neighbor)
            # Add the clone of the neighbor to the cloned node's neighbors list
            clone_map[current_node].neighbors.append(clone_map[neighbor])

    # Return the clone of the start node
    return clone_map[node]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges. Each node is processed once, and each edge is considered once during the BFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes. The space is used for storing the hashmap and the BFS queue.
