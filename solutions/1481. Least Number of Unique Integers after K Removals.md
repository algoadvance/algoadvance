title:  Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals-out
permalink: /s1481
---

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, you need to remove exactly `k` elements from the array. Your goal is to return the least number of unique integers in the array after removing exactly `k` elements.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [5,5,4], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Remove the single 4 to get [5,5], only 1 unique number remains.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [4,3,1,1,3,3,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Remove three 1's or three 3's to get [4,3,3,2] or [4,1,1,2], both of which have 3 unique numbers.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `k` be larger than the length of the array?**
   - No, `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of the array.
   
2. **What happens if `k` is zero?**
   - If `k` is zero, the array remains unchanged, and the result will simply be the number of unique integers in the array.

3. **Can the array contain negative numbers or all identical numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers, and it is also possible for all the elements to be identical.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**: Use a frequency dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the array.
2. **Sort by Frequency**: Sort the unique elements by their frequency in ascending order. This way, you can remove the least frequent elements first to minimize the number of unique integers.
3. **Remove Elements**: Iteratively remove elements according to their frequency until `k` elements are removed.
4. **Count Unique Elements**: After the removals, count the remaining unique elements.

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Count**: \(O(n)\)
- **Sorting**: \(O(m \log m)\) where \(m\) is the number of unique elements.
- **Removal Process**: \(O(m)\)

The dominating term is the sorting step, so the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\).

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(arr, k):
    # Step 1: Frequency count
    frequency = Counter(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Sort unique elements by their frequency
    freq_pairs = list(frequency.items())
    freq_pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Step 3: Remove k elements
    for num, count in freq_pairs:
        if k >= count:
            k -= count
            del frequency[num]
        else:
            break
    
    # Step 4: Count the remaining unique elements
    return len(frequency)

# Example Usage
print(findLeastNumOfUniqueInts([5, 5, 4], 1))  # Output: 1
print(findLeastNumOfUniqueInts([4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2], 3))  # Output: 2
```

This approach ensures that we minimize the number of unique integers left after exactly removing `k` elements from the given array.
