title:  Four Divisors-out
permalink: /s1390
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. For each integer in `nums`, find all its divisors. If the integer has exactly four divisors, sum these divisors and add the result to the total sum. Return the total sum of all such results.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [21, 4, 7]
Output: 32
Explanation:
21 has exactly 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has exactly 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has exactly 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is 32 because 21 has exactly four divisors and the sum is 1 + 3 + 7 + 21 = 32
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input list be empty?**
   - Yes, and the expected output should be 0.
2. **What is the range of the integers in `nums`?**
   - The integers will be positive.
3. **Are there any constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   - The constraints usually follow typical LeetCode guidelines for arrays but should be explicitly checked in the problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Divisor Calculation:** To find all divisors of a number `n`, iterate from `1` to `sqrt(n)`. For every integer `i` that divides `n` without a remainder, both `i` and `n/i` are divisors.
2. **Counting Divisors:** If the number of divisors is exactly four, sum those divisors and add it to the total sum.
3. **Edge Cases:** Handle the cases where the number has fewer or more than four divisors efficiently.

### Code

```python
import math

def sumFourDivisors(nums):
    total_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        divisors = set()
        
        # Calculate all divisors of num
        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                divisors.add(i)
                divisors.add(num // i)
        
        # Check if the number has exactly four divisors
        if len(divisors) == 4:
            total_sum += sum(divisors)
    
    return total_sum

# Example usage
nums = [21, 4, 7]
print(sumFourDivisors(nums))  # Output: 32
```

### Time Complexity

- **Divisor Calculation for Each Number:** The loop runs up to `sqrt(n)`, resulting in `O(sqrt(n))` time complexity per number.
- **Total:** If `N` is the total number of integers in the list:
  - Worst-case scenario, each divisor check runs in `O(sqrt(m))` where `m` is the maximum element in `nums`.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(N * sqrt(m))`.

This approach efficiently calculates the sum of divisors for numbers with exactly four divisors using straightforward math operations.
