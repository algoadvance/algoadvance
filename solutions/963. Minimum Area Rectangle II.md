title:  Minimum Area Rectangle II-out
permalink: /s963
---

Given a set of points in the plane, find the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the x and y axes. If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints?**
   - The number of points is between 1 and 50.
   - Each point's coordinate is between -40000 and 40000.

2. **Can the rectangle have sides not aligned with the axes?**
   - Yes, the sides do not have to be parallel to the axes.

3. **Is there any specific requirement for the return type?**
   - Return the minimum area as a float. If no rectangle can be formed, return 0.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a nested loop approach to iterate through all pairs of points to determine potential rectangles. 

1. Iterate over every pair of points `(i, j)` to determine possible diagonals of the rectangle.
2. For each possible diagonal, calculate the center and possible side lengths.
3. Check if all points forming the rectangle are in the given set of points.
4. Calculate the area for each valid rectangle and keep track of the minimum area encountered.
5. Return the smallest area found, or 0 if no rectangle can be formed.

### Detailed Steps

1. Use two nested loops to iterate through each pair of points.
2. Treat each pair of points as a potential diagonal of a rectangle.
3. For each pair (diagonal), calculate:
   - Center of the rectangle.
   - Two other possible vertices using the properties of rectangles:
     1. Point A: `center + vector perpendicular to the diagonal`.
     2. Point B: `center - vector perpendicular to the diagonal`.
4. Check if both vertices exist in the set of given points.
5. If a valid rectangle is found, compute its area using:
   \[
   \text{area} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \times \sqrt{(x3 - x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2}
   \]

### Code

```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

def minAreaFreeRect(points):
    def distance(p1, p2):
        return (p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2 + (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2
    
    point_set = {(x, y) for x, y in points}
    min_area = float('inf')
    found = False
    
    for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(points, 3):
        d1 = distance(p1, p2)
        d2 = distance(p2, p3)
        d3 = distance(p1, p3)
        
        if d1 + d2 == d3:
            p4 = (p1[0] + p3[0] - p2[0], p1[1] + p3[1] - p2[1])
        elif d1 + d3 == d2:
            p4 = (p2[0] + p3[0] - p1[0], p2[1] + p3[1] - p1[1])
        elif d2 + d3 == d1:
            p4 = (p1[0] + p2[0] - p3[0], p1[1] + p2[1] - p3[1])
        else:
            continue
        
        if (p4[0], p4[1]) in point_set:
            found = True
            side1 = math.sqrt(distance(p1, p2))
            side2 = math.sqrt(distance(p1, p3))
            area = side1 * side2
            min_area = min(min_area, area)
    
    return min_area if found else 0

# Example usage
points = [[1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1]]
print(minAreaFreeRect(points))  # Output: 2.0
```

### Time Complexity

The solution involves checking each combination of three points to form diagonal pairs.

- **Combinatorial Calculations:** \(O(n^3)\) due to combinations of three points.
- **Distance Calculations and Set Lookups:** \(O(1)\) each.

Overall, the complexity is \(O(n^3)\), which is manageable given the problem constraints \(n \leq 50\).
