title:  Trapping Rain Water-out
permalink: /s42
---

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

#### Example:
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (where width of each bar is 1) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding with the solution, here are some questions that could help better understand the problem:
1. Are all elements in the input array non-negative?
   - Yes, there are no negative elevations.
2. What should be returned if the input array is empty or has less than 3 elements?
   - In such cases, no water can be trapped, so the result should be 0.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a two-pointer technique which is efficient both in terms of time and space complexity.

#### Steps:

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the start (position 0) and `right` at the end (position n-1) of the elevation map.
2. Also, initialize two variables `left_max` and `right_max` to store the maximum heights encountered so far from the left and right respectively. Set `left_max` to the height of the first position and `right_max` to the height of the last position.
3. Loop through the list using these two pointers until they meet.
4. On each iteration, compare `height[left]` with `height[right]`:
   - If `height[left]` is smaller, check if `height[left]` is greater than `left_max`. If it is, update `left_max`. If it's smaller, calculate the trapped water for position `left` as `left_max - height[left]` and add to the total.
   - Similarly, if `height[right]` is smaller, check if `height[right]` is greater than `right_max`. If it is, update `right_max`. If it's smaller, calculate the trapped water for position `right` as `right_max - height[right]` and add to the total.
5. Move the pointer `left` to the right if `height[left]` was processed, otherwise move the pointer `right` to the left.
6. Continue this process until `left` and `right` pointers converge.

This approach ensures that we traverse the list only once, leading to an efficient solution.

### Code

```python
def trap(height):
    if not height:
        return 0

    left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
    left_max, right_max = height[left], height[right]
    water_trapped = 0

    while left < right:
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            if height[left] >= left_max:
                left_max = height[left]
            else:
                water_trapped += left_max - height[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            if height[right] >= right_max:
                right_max = height[right]
            else:
                water_trapped += right_max - height[right]
            right -= 1

    return water_trapped
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we process each element exactly once.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This two-pointer approach is optimal for solving the Trapping Rain Water problem.
