title:  Number of Days Between Two Dates-out
permalink: /s1360
---

### Problem Statement
Given two dates `date1` and `date2` in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, return the number of days between the two dates. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the dates always valid (e.g., checking for leap years, correct month and day ranges)?
2. Shall we consider the date order? For example, if date1 is after date2, should we return a positive number of days?
3. Is it guaranteed that the input format is always `YYYY-MM-DD`?

We'll assume the input format is always valid and as specified.

### Strategy
We can leverage Python’s `datetime` module to handle date manipulations and calculations easily. Here's the plan:
1. Parse the input dates using `datetime.strptime`.
2. Calculate the difference between the two dates.
3. Return the absolute value of the difference in days.

### Code
Here’s a Python function to achieve this:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def days_between_dates(date1: str, date2: str) -> int:
    # Define the date format
    date_format = "%Y-%m-%d"
    
    # Parse the input dates
    d1 = datetime.strptime(date1, date_format)
    d2 = datetime.strptime(date2, date_format)
    
    # Calculate the difference in days
    delta = abs((d2 - d1).days)
    
    return delta

# Example usage:
date1 = "2020-01-15"
date2 = "2019-12-31"
print(days_between_dates(date1, date2))  # Output: 15
```
### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) since parsing the dates and computing the difference is done in constant time with respect to the input size.

### Explanation
1. The `datetime.strptime` method parses the input string into a `datetime` object, making it easier to handle date arithmetic.
2. The difference between two `datetime` objects returns a `timedelta` object, from which we can extract the number of days.
3. Using `abs` ensures that we always return a positive number of days regardless of the order of the input dates.

This solution should cover typical use cases efficiently and correctly. If additional constraints or edge cases need to be considered, further clarifications can be added.
