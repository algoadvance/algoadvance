title:  Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero-out
permalink: /s1342

1. **Input:** What is the range and type of input values?
2. **Output:** What is expected as output?
3. **Constraints:** Any specific constraints, edge cases to consider, e.g., negative numbers?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to reduce a given number to zero following these rules:
- If the number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the number is odd, subtract 1 from it.
We count the number of steps required to achieve zero.

Given the problem, a clear strategy involves a simple iterative approach:
1. Initialize a step counter.
2. Loop until the number becomes zero.
3. Depending on whether the current number is even or odd, either divide by 2 or subtract 1.
4. Increment the step counter accordingly.
5. Return the step counter once the number is zero.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(log n) since for each even number, we are performing a division by 2, which reduces the number's bit length logarithmically.
- The auxiliary space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Python Code
Here is the implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def numberOfSteps(num: int) -> int:
    steps = 0
    
    while num > 0:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            num //= 2
        else:
            num -= 1
        steps += 1
    
    return steps

# Example Test
print(numberOfSteps(14))  # Output: 6
print(numberOfSteps(8))  # Output: 4
print(numberOfSteps(123))  # Output: 12
```

In this code:
- We start with the given number `num`.
- We use a loop that continues until `num` is reduced to zero.
- Inside the loop, we check if `num` is even or odd and perform the necessary operation.
- We count each operation by incrementing `steps`.

This simple iterative approach ensures we handle different cases and reduce the number to zero efficiently.
