1929. Concatenation of Array

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans` of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n` (0-indexed).

Specifically, `ans` is the concatenation of two `nums` arrays.

Return the array `ans`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. `Q:` Are the elements in `nums` guaranteed to be integers?
   `A:` Yes, the problem statement specifies an integer array.
   
2. `Q:` Can `nums` be empty?
   `A:` According to the problem description, no constraints are specified regarding the emptiness of the `nums` array. It's assumed to be a non-empty array as per usual array input conventions in such problems.

3. `Q:` Is there a constraint on the size of `nums`?
   `A:` The typical constraint for such problems is usually around `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`, but these specifics would normally be found in the problem details.

## Strategy
The problem can be solved directly using list concatenation operations in Python:
1. Take the input `nums` array.
2. Concatenate it with itself to form the required result.

The naive and efficient way to achieve this is by using the `+` operator to concatenate the list with itself.

## Code
```python
def getConcatenation(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return nums + nums
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the list concatenation involves copying each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, because we are creating a new list of size `2n`.

This approach should efficiently solve the given problem within the typical constraints expected in such coding interviews.
