title:  Shortest Path in Binary Matrix-out
permalink: /s1091
---

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. The matrix contains only `0`s (representing an open cell) and `1`s (representing an obstacle).

You can move 8 directions: up, down, left, right, and the 4 diagonal directions.

Return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return `-1`.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., `grid[0][0]`) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., `grid[n-1][n-1]`) such that:
- All the visited cells of the path are `0`s.
- All the adjacent cells of the path are connected in the 8 directions.

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the size of the grid (value of `n`) and values within the grid?
    - **Answer**: The grid size will be between `1` and `100`, and each element of the grid will either be `0` or `1`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if the grid size is `1x1` and the only cell is `0`?
    - **Answer**: In that case, the shortest clear path would be the cell itself, so the length would be `1`.

    - What should be returned if either the start or end cell is blocked?
    - **Answer**: If either `grid[0][0]` or `grid[n-1][n-1]` is `1`, return `-1` as there is no possible path.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the shortest path is found.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Check if the start or end is blocked.
   - Initialize a queue with the starting position `(0, 0)`, with a path length of `1`.

2. **BFS Execution**:
   - Create directions for the 8 possible moves.
   - Process each cell in the queue:
     - For each of the 8 possible moves, check if the new position is within bounds and not blocked (i.e., `0`).
     - If the new position is the end, return the current path length incremented by `1`.
     - If valid, mark it as visited and add it to the queue with the incremented path length.
   
3. **Termination**:
   - If the queue is exhausted without finding the end, return `-1`.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    
    # Check if start or end is blocked
    if grid[0][0] == 1 or grid[n-1][n-1] == 1:
        return -1
    
    # Directions for 8 possible moves (left, right, up, down, and 4 diagonals)
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    
    # Queue for BFS: (row, column, path_length)
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 1)])
    visited = set((0, 0))
    
    while queue:
        row, col, length = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we have reached the bottom-right cell
        if row == n-1 and col == n-1:
            return length
        
        # Explore all 8 directions
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            
            # Check if the new position is inside the grid and not blocked (i.e. a `0`)
            if 0 <= new_row < n and 0 <= new_col < n and grid[new_row][new_col] == 0 and (new_row, new_col) not in visited:
                visited.add((new_row, new_col))
                queue.append((new_row, new_col, length + 1))
    
    # If we exhaust the queue without finding the path
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the size of the grid. In the worst case, we'll have to visit almost all cells.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the queue and visited set.

This approach ensures that the shortest path is found due to the level-wise exploration characteristic of BFS.
