title:  Meeting Rooms III-out
permalink: /s2402
---

You are given an array of meetings `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` denotes the start and end times of the i-th meeting, respectively. All meetings need a conference room to be held, and only one meeting can be held in one room at a particular time. 

Return the minimum number of conference rooms required to hold all the meetings.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the start and end times in the `meetings` array inclusive?**
   - The `start_i` time includes the exact time the meeting starts, and `end_i` is the exact time the meeting ends.

2. **Can meetings have overlapping times?**
   - Yes, meetings can have overlapping times, and that's the key point of determining the minimum number of conference rooms.

3. **How should we handle the edge case where the input array is empty?**
   - If there are no meetings, the number of conference rooms required is 0.

### Strategy

To determine the minimum number of conference rooms needed, we can use a min-heap to keep track of the end times of meetings currently using a room. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the Meetings:** First, sort the meetings by their start time.
2. **Initialize a Min-Heap:** Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the end times of meetings.
3. **Process Each Meeting:**
    - For each meeting, check if the room that frees up the earliest (i.e., the root of the min-heap) is available (i.e., its end time is less than or equal to the start time of the current meeting).
    - If a room is available, replace its end time with the end time of the current meeting.
    - If no rooms are available, add a new room (push the end time of this meeting onto the heap).
4. **Determine the Number of Rooms:** The size of the heap at the end represents the minimum number of rooms required.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def minMeetingRooms(meetings):
    if not meetings:
        return 0

    # Sort meetings by start time
    meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Initialize a heap
    min_heap = []

    # Add the end time of the first meeting
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, meetings[0][1])

    for i in range(1, len(meetings)):
        # If the room due to free up the earliest is free, reuse it
        if meetings[i][0] >= min_heap[0]:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # Push the current meeting's end time into the heap
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, meetings[i][1])
    
    # The size of the heap is the number of rooms we need
    return len(min_heap)

# Example usage:
meetings = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]
print(minMeetingRooms(meetings))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** Sorting the meetings by their start time takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of meetings.
2. **Heap Operations:** We perform `heapq.heappush()` and `heapq.heappop()` operations, each of which takes \(O(\log k)\) where \(k\) is the size of the heap. In the worst case, the heap could have all \(n\) meetings, so it can be considered \(O(\log n)\). Since these operations are performed for each meeting, this part also takes \(O(n \log n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
