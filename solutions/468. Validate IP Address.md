title:  Validate IP Address-out
permalink: /s468
---

The problem is to write a function that determines whether a given string is a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address or neither.

- An **IPv4** address is formatted as four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots (`"."`). Each part contains one to three digits. Leading zeros are not allowed (e.g., "192.168.01.1" is invalid, but "192.168.1.1" is valid).
  
- An **IPv6** address is formatted as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group separated by a colon (`":"`). Each hexadecimal digit is a digit or a letter from 'a' to 'f' or 'A' to 'F'. Leading zeros are allowed in each group, but a group shouldn't be empty (e.g., "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334" is valid, but "2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334" is invalid).

The output should be:
- "IPv4" if the input string is a valid IPv4 address.
- "IPv6" if the input string is a valid IPv6 address.
- "Neither" if the input string is neither.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - Can the input string be empty or contain only white spaces?
    - Should we consider the input to be case-sensitive for IPv6 addresses?

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - Should we consider non-standard cases, such as a string with a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 formats?

## Code

```python
def validIPAddress(IP: str) -> str:
    def is_valid_ipv4(ip):
        parts = ip.split(".")
        if len(parts) != 4:
            return False
        for part in parts:
            if not part.isdigit():
                return False
            if len(part) > 1 and part[0] == '0':
                return False
            if not 0 <= int(part) <= 255:
                return False
        return True

    def is_valid_ipv6(ip):
        parts = ip.split(":")
        if len(parts) != 8:
            return False
        hexdigits = '0123456789abcdefABCDEF'
        for part in parts:
            if len(part) == 0 or len(part) > 4:
                return False
            for char in part:
                if char not in hexdigits:
                    return False
        return True

    if IP.count('.') == 3 and is_valid_ipv4(IP):
        return "IPv4"
    elif IP.count(':') == 7 and is_valid_ipv6(IP):
        return "IPv6"
    else:
        return "Neither"
```

## Strategy

1. **IPv4 Validation**:
    - Split the IP address by periods (`"."`).
    - Ensure there are exactly four parts.
    - Check each part to ensure it:
        - Contains only digits.
        - Does not have leading zeros (except for the number '0').
        - Falls within the range 0 to 255.

2. **IPv6 Validation**:
    - Split the IP address by colons (`":"`).
    - Ensure there are exactly eight parts.
    - Check each part to ensure it:
        - Is not empty and does not exceed four characters in length.
        - Contains only valid hexadecimal characters (0-9, a-f, A-F).

## Time Complexity

- **IPv4 Validation**: O(1) - The function checks exactly four parts.
- **IPv6 Validation**: O(1) - The function checks exactly eight parts.

Both validation methods are constant time operations since the given constraints ensure a fixed number of checks regardless of input size.
