title:  Shuffle String-out

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `i`-th position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can we assume the length of `s` and `indices` are always the same?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees this.
2. Are the integers in `indices` always unique and within the range [0, len(s)-1]?
   - Yes.
3. Should we handle any special characters or specific types of inputs?
   - No, the string will consist of printable ASCII characters.

### Strategy:
1. Initialize an empty list `shuffled` of the same length as `s`.
2. Iterate over the `indices` array:
   - For each index `i`, place the character `s[i]` at the position `indices[i]` in the `shuffled` list.
3. Join the `shuffled` list into a string and return it.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the list once and performing constant-time operations for each character.

### Code:
```python
def restoreString(s, indices):
    # Initialize a list of the same length as s with empty strings
    shuffled = [''] * len(s)
    
    # Place each character at its new index
    for i in range(len(s)):
        shuffled[indices[i]] = s[i]
    
    # Join the list into a string and return
    return ''.join(shuffled)

# Example usage
s = "codeleet"
indices = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 2, 1, 3]
print(restoreString(s, indices))  # Output: "leetcode"
```

This code creates a new list `shuffled` which stores the characters of `s` rearranged according to the `indices` list, and then returns the joined string.
