You are given a string `answers` which contains only the characters "Y", "N", and "M". "Y" means a student is happy, "N" means a student is not happy, and "M" means the student's happiness depends on their neighbors.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of happy students after the influence of all 'M' students is considered. A student with 'M' can become happy if their neighbors (either left or right) are happy.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length constraint on the `answers` string?
   - The string length can be arbitrarily long but will fit within typical problem constraints for algorithms-related challenges (up to 10^4 or so).

2. Are there always guaranteed to be at least one student with 'Y' in the input?
   - No, the input may not have any 'Y', and the 'M' students will not influence the 'N' students.

3. Should we consider students only on their immediate left or right as neighbors?
   - Yes, only immediate neighbors should be considered. 

### Strategy 

1. Iterate through the string `answers` to find the position of 'M'.
2. For each 'M', check its immediate neighbors:
   - If any immediate neighbor ('Y' or 'N') becomes 'Y', the 'M' should also be happy.
3. Maintain a list to keep track of which students are happy after considering 'M' students.

### Code

```python
def maxHappyStudents(answers):
    n = len(answers)
    
    # Convert the string to a list for mutability
    answers_list = list(answers)
    
    # Traverse the list to apply the influence of 'M'
    for i in range(n):
        if answers_list[i] == 'M':
            if (i > 0 and answers_list[i - 1] == 'Y') or (i < n - 1 and answers_list[i + 1] == 'Y'):
                answers_list[i] = 'Y'
    
    # Count the number of 'Y' (happy students)
    happy_count = answers_list.count('Y')
    
    return happy_count

# Example usage
example_input = "NYMYNY"
print(maxHappyStudents(example_input))  # Output should be 4 based on the example
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution involves a single pass through the input list, giving a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because we convert the string to a list for mutability. This can be optimized to \(O(1)\) space if we modify the input string in-place if allowed by programming language constraints. 

Feel free to test this implementation with different inputs to ensure it handles edge cases, such as strings with no 'Y' or all 'N' and 'M'.
