title:  Decode Ways II-out
permalink: /s639
---
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping way:
```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```
To decode an encoded message, all the digits should be grouped by replacing the stars "*" by any digit from '1' to '9' inclusive. Besides, the encoded message may contain the character '*', which can represent any digit from 1 to 9.

Given a string `s` containing digits and the character '*', return the number of ways to decode it. Because the answer could be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
- Input: `s = "*"`. Output: `9`
- Input: `s = "1*"` Output: `18`
- Input: `s = "2*"` Output: `15`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` contains digits and the character `'*'`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input string contain any invalid characters like letters that are not '*', digits, or spaces?
    - No, the input string will only contain digits and the character '*'.
  
2. Are there any limitations on memory usage?
    - We can proceed with standard memory usage guidelines for competitive programming, assuming the constraints. We'll try to operate within `O(n)` space complexity.

## Strategy:
Given the constraints, we can approach this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP):
1. **Define DP Array:** We'll use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[:i+1]`.
2. **Initialization:** 
   - If the first character is '0', there's no valid way to decode.
   - If it's '*', it can represent '1' to '9', so we initialize `dp[1] = 9`.
   - Otherwise, it's a single valid digit, so we initialize `dp[1] = 1`.
3. **DP Relation:**
   - Single character decoding -> similar to initializing.
   - Two characters ('*', digit combinations) -> consider their possible combinations (use helper functions if needed).
4. **Modulo Operation:** Always return results modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   
## Code:
```python
def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(s)
    
    if n == 0: 
        return 0
    
    # dp[i] will represent the number of ways to decode up to the ith character (1-indexed)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case
    dp[1] = 9 if s[0] == '*' else 1 if s[0] != '0' else 0
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        current_char = s[i-1]
        previous_char = s[i-2]
        
        # Single character decode
        if current_char == '*':
            dp[i] += 9 * dp[i-1]
        elif current_char != '0':
            dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        
        # Two characters decode
        if previous_char == '*':
            if current_char == '*':
                dp[i] += 15 * dp[i-2]  # "**" -> '11'-'19' and '21'-'26'
            elif '0' <= current_char <= '6':
                dp[i] += 2 * dp[i-2]  # "*0"-"*6" -> 10-16, 20-26
            else:
                dp[i] += dp[i-2]  # "*7"-"*9" -> 17-19
        elif previous_char == '1':
            if current_char == '*':
                dp[i] += 9 * dp[i-2]  # "1*" -> 11-19
            else:
                dp[i] += dp[i-2]  # "1x" -> 11-19
        elif previous_char == '2':
            if current_char == '*':
                dp[i] += 6 * dp[i-2]  # "2*" -> 21-26
            elif '0' <= current_char <= '6':
                dp[i] += dp[i-2]  # "2x" -> 20-26
        
        dp[i] %= MOD
    
    return dp[n]
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` because we iterate through the string once, performing constant-time operations on each character.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` due to the DP array used for memoization. This can be optimized to `O(1)` by only storing relevant state transitions.
