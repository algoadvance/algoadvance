title:  Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I-out
permalink: /s3042
---
Given two lists of strings, `A` and `B`, count how many pairs `(a, b)` can be formed such that `a` is a prefix of `b` and `a` is in list `A`, and `b` is in list `B`.

- `A` and `B` are lists of non-empty strings consisting of only lowercase English letters.
- We need to count pairs where strings from `A` are prefixes of strings from `B`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected length of lists `A` and `B`?**
   - This helps determine if the brute-force solution will be efficient enough.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of individual strings within the lists?**
   - Understanding the length constraints helps in determining an efficient approach.
   
3. **Are there any repetitive strings within the lists `A` and `B`?**
   - Clarifying this can help optimize the solution if necessary.

4. **Do we need to consider case sensitivity?**
   - Ensuring that all comparisons are done in a consistent manner.

## Strategy
1. **Brute-Force Approach:**
    - Iterate over each string `a` in list `A` and each string `b` in list `B`.
    - Check if `a` is a prefix of `b`.
    - Increment the count if `a` is a prefix of `b`.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
    - Since this problem primarily involves prefix checking, we can pre-sort lists to potentially reduce unnecessary comparisons.
    - However, in this problem, each string needs to be checked individually, making sorting and dictionary approaches relatively complex for minor gains in efficiency.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the brute-force method to solve the problem:

```python
def count_prefix_suffix_pairs(A, B):
    count = 0
    for a in A:
        for b in B:
            if b.startswith(a):
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
A = ["a", "b", "ab"]
B = ["ab", "bc", "abc"]
print(count_prefix_suffix_pairs(A, B))  # Output should be 4
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times m \times l)\)
  - \(n\) is the length of list `A`
  - \(m\) is the length of list `B`
  - \(l\) is the average length of strings in `B` (for prefix checking)
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space.

This brute-force solution should be efficient enough for moderate-sized lists. If the input lists are extremely large, further optimizations would be warranted.
