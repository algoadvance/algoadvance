title:  Frequency of the Most Frequent Element-out
permalink: /s1838
---
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you are allowed to increment any element of the array by 1 at most `k` times. Find the maximum possible frequency of the most frequent element after performing at most `k` increment operations.

### Example

1. Input: `nums = [1,2,4]`, `k = 5`
   Output: `3`
   Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make `nums = [4,4,4]. All elements are equal, thus the frequency of the most frequent element is 3.

2. Input: `nums = [1,4,8,13]`, `k = 5`
   Output: `2`
   Explanation: Increment the second element once to make `nums = [1,5,8,13]` and the fourth element 4 times to make `nums = [1,5,8,13]`. Therefore, the maximum frequency of the most frequent element is 2.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are all elements of `nums` positive integers?
   **A:** The problem statement does not restrict `nums` to only positive integers, so they can be non-negative or negative integers as well.
   
2. **Q:** Can `nums` contain duplicates?
   **A:** Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate elements.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting:** First, we will sort the array to enable a sliding window approach.
   
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use two pointers to form a window of numbers in the sorted array. The idea is to keep track of the total increments needed to make all the elements within the window equal to the current maximum element within the window.
   
3. **Calculate Increments:** For a given window from `left` to `right` (inclusive), the total increments needed to equalize `nums[left:right+1]` to `nums[right]` is:
    \[
    \text{increments} = \text{nums}[right] \times (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - \sum (\text{nums}[left:right+1])
    \]

   If the total increments are less than or equal to `k`, then we update the maximum frequency. If not, we increment the left pointer to reduce the number of elements in the window.
   
4. **Update and Maximize:** Continue this process until the right pointer reaches the end of the array, and keep track of the maximum frequency achieved.

## Code

```python
def maxFrequency(nums, k):
    nums.sort()
    left = 0
    total = 0
    max_freq = 1
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        total += nums[right]
        
        while nums[right] * (right - left + 1) > total + k:
            total -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        
        max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_freq

# Example usage
print(maxFrequency([1, 2, 4], 5))            # Output: 3
print(maxFrequency([1, 4, 8, 13], 5))        # Output: 2
print(maxFrequency([3, 9, 6], 2))            # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Sliding Window:** Each element is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer), hence \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step. 

This algorithm is efficient and works well within typical problem constraints.
