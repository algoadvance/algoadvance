title:  Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference-out
permalink: /s1218
---

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence is equal to `difference`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the arithmetic difference?**
   - The arithmetic difference is a fixed integer `difference` which each pair of consecutive elements in the subsequence should have.

2. **Can the subsequence be non-contiguous?**
   - Yes, the subsequence can be non-contiguous, i.e., we can skip elements in the original `arr` to form the subsequence.

3. **What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and the values within `arr`?**
   - The length of `arr` can be between `1` and `10^5`, and each element in `arr` can be between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

## Strategy

To find the longest arithmetic subsequence with a given difference, we'll use a hash map to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each element.

### Steps:

1. Create a dictionary `lengths` that will map each element `x` to the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending with `x`.

2. Traverse each element `num` in the array. For each `num`:
   - Calculate the previous element in the subsequence as `prev = num - difference`.
   - If `prev` is in `lengths`, then the length of the longest subsequence ending at `num` will be `lengths[prev] + 1`. Otherwise, it starts a new subsequence, so is set to `1`.

3. Track the maximum length found during the traversal.

### Time Complexity:
Since each element in the array is processed once, this algorithm runs in `O(n)` time where `n` is the size of the `arr`.

## Code

```python
def longestSubsequence(arr, difference):
    lengths = {}  # Dictionary to store the lengths of longest subsequences ending at each value
    max_length = 0  # To keep track of the maximum length found

    for num in arr:
        # Let prev be the previous element in the arithmetic subsequence
        prev = num - difference
        # Update lengths[num] to lengths[prev] + 1 if prev is in lengths otherwise set to 1
        lengths[num] = lengths.get(prev, 0) + 1
        # Update max_length if needed
        max_length = max(max_length, lengths[num])
    
    return max_length
```

This solution ensures we efficiently find the longest arithmetic subsequence with the given difference by leveraging the properties of hash maps for quick lookups.
