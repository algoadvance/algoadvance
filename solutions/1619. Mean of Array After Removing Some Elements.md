title:  Mean of Array After Removing Some Elements-out
permalink: /s1619
---

You are given an integer array `arr` consisting of `n` elements, where `n` is divisible by 20. Remove the smallest 5% and the largest 5% of the elements in the array. After removing those elements, find the mean of the remaining elements.

### Example

```python
Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900]
Output: 200.78947
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Size of `arr`:** We know that `n` is divisible by 20. This means the array size will always be a multiple of 20.
2. **Return value format:** Should the mean be rounded to a specific number of decimal places?

### Strategy

1. **Sort the array:** Sorting helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest 5% elements.
2. **Remove the smallest 5% and the largest 5%:** Calculate the number of elements that correspond to 5% of the array size, which is `n/20`. Remove these elements from both ends of the sorted array.
3. **Calculate mean:** Compute the mean of the remaining elements.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the array:** This takes \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Removing elements and calculating the mean:** This takes \(O(n)\) since we are iterating through the array once after sorting.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code

```python
def trimMean(arr):
    arr.sort()
    n = len(arr)
    remove_count = n // 20  # 5% of the array length
    trimmed_arr = arr[remove_count:-remove_count]  # Removing 5% smallest and largest
    
    # Calculate mean
    mean_value = sum(trimmed_arr) / len(trimmed_arr)
    return mean_value
```

### Example Usage

```python
arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900]
result = trimMean(arr)
print(result)  # Output: 200.78947
```

This code takes an array, removes the smallest and largest 5% of its elements after sorting, and then calculates and returns the mean of the remaining elements.
