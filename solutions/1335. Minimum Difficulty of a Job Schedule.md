title:  Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule-out
permalink: /s1335
---

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the `d` days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum job difficulty during that day. No job can go unfinished, and each job must be scheduled one after the other in the order they appear in the array. 

Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs, return -1.

### Example 1:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day is {6, 5, 4}, Second day is {3, 2, 1}. The difficulty on the first day is 6 and the difficulty on the 2nd day is 3. Therefore, minimum difficulty of the job schedule = 6 + 3 = 9.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If there are 4 days but only 3 jobs, it is impossible to schedule the jobs.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Each day's difficulty = 1, so total difficulty = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
- `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= d <= 10`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is there a constraint on the sum of job difficulties?
2. What should be returned if it's impossible to schedule jobs across `d` days?
3. Are the difficulties of the jobs always non-negative integers?

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). We can model this by defining `dp[i][j]` as the minimum difficulty of scheduling the first `j` jobs over `i` days.

1. **Initialization**:
   - If we have more days `d` than the number of jobs, return `-1` since it is impossible to schedule the jobs.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 0` which represents the base case of having no jobs and no days. 

2. **DP Transition**:
   - To fill `dp[i][j]`, we need to consider splitting the first `j` jobs into `i-1` days and then appending the remaining jobs to the last day.
   - For `i`-th day and `j`-th job ending at `k` where `i-1 <= k < j`, calculate:
     ```python
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + max(jobDifficulty[k:j+1]))
     ```
   - The main challenge is efficiently calculating `max(jobDifficulty[k:j+1])`.

3. **Result**:
   - The answer will be in `dp[d][n]` (scheduling `n` jobs over `d` days).

## Code
```python
def minDifficulty(jobDifficulty, d):
    n = len(jobDifficulty)
    if n < d:
        return -1
    
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(d)]
    
    # Base case for the first day
    dp[0][0] = jobDifficulty[0]
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = max(dp[0][j-1], jobDifficulty[j])
    
    for day in range(1, d):
        for j in range(day, n):
            max_job_difficulty = 0
            for k in range(j, day-1, -1): # Traverse backwards to get max job difficulty
                max_job_difficulty = max(max_job_difficulty, jobDifficulty[k])
                dp[day][j] = min(dp[day][j], dp[day-1][k-1] + max_job_difficulty)
    
    return dp[d-1][n-1]

# Example usage:
jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1]
d = 2
print(minDifficulty(jobDifficulty, d))  # Output: 7
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(d * n^2)\) where \(d\) is the number of days and \(n\) is the number of jobs. Although this might seem impractical at a glance, given the constraint (\(d \leq 10\)), it works well within acceptable limits.
