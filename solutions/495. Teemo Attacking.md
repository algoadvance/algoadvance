title:  Teemo Attacking-out
permalink: /s495
---

In the game, Hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly `duration` seconds. More attacks may follow, and the poison's timer resets with each subsequent attack. However, if Teemo attacks again before the poison effect fades, the timer will reset, and the poison effect will extend.

You are given a non-decreasing integer array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at time `timeSeries[i]`, and an integer `duration`.

Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `timeSeries` contain duplicate times?
    - No, all values in `timeSeries` are distinct and non-decreasing.
    
2. Is `timeSeries` guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order?
    - Yes, `timeSeries` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. What are the constraints on the values of the elements in `timeSeries` and `duration`?
    - `1 <= timeSeries.length <= 10000`
    - `0 <= timeSeries[i] <= 10^7`
    - `1 <= duration <= 10^7`

## Strategy

We need to compute the total duration for which Ashe is poisoned. Here's the approach:
1. Initialize `total_poisoned_duration` to 0.
2. Iterate through `timeSeries` array to calculate how long Ashe remains poisoned.
   - For each attack at time `timeSeries[i]`, calculate the overlap time with the previous attack if any.
   - Add the minimum of `duration` and the time difference between the current attack and the previous attack to the total poisoned duration.
3. The last attack will always contribute a full `duration` to the total duration.
4. Return the computed total poisoned duration.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `timeSeries`. This is because we only need to traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code

```python
def findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries, duration):
    if not timeSeries:
        return 0
    
    total_poisoned_duration = 0
    
    for i in range(1, len(timeSeries)):
        # Calculate the minimum poison duration between attacks
        total_poisoned_duration += min(duration, timeSeries[i] - timeSeries[i-1])
    
    # Always add the duration for the last attack
    total_poisoned_duration += duration
    
    return total_poisoned_duration

# Example usage
timeSeries = [1, 4]
duration = 2
print(findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries, duration))  # Output: 4

timeSeries = [1, 2]
duration = 2
print(findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries, duration))  # Output: 3
```

This solution efficiently calculates the total poisoned duration using a single pass through the `timeSeries` array, ensuring a linear runtime complexity.
