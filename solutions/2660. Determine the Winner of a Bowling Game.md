title:  Determine the Winner of a Bowling Game-out
permalink: /s2660
---
You are given an integer array `player1` and an integer array `player2`, each of length `n`. The arrays represent the scores of two players in a bowling game across `n` rounds. Each score is an integer between `1` and `10`, inclusive.

The game follows these rules:
- Each score {score} automatically gets added to the player's total score.
- If a player scores a strike (10 points) or a spare (any score of 10 points achieved via two rolls) in a round, their scores from the next round are doubled.
- The game consists of exactly 10 rounds.

Implement a function `determine_winner(player1: List[int], player2: List[int]) -> int` that:
- Takes in two lists of integers `player1` and `player2`.
- Returns `1` if player1 wins, `2` if player2 wins, and `0` if there is a tie.

### Clarifying Questions
1. How is a spare represented in the input arrays?
2. If we don't have information on spares explicitly, should we assume only strikes contribute to future score doubling?
3. Are the additional rules (like doubling scores in subsequent rounds) applied cumulatively, i.e., can multiple rounds of doubling be stacked?

Let's assume the input lists contain only the round score and not individual rolls, which means we only consider strikes for future round score doubling.

### Strategy
1. **Tracking Scores & Doubling**:
   Each player has their own list of scores for each round.
2. **Score Calculation**:
   - Iterate through each round and sum up the scores.
   - Track if the previous round was a strike to decide if the next round's score should be doubled.
3. **Determine Winner**:
   - Compare the total scores after all the rounds are summed up considering the doubling criteria.

### Time Complexity
The solution will iterate through each list of scores once, making the time complexity O(n) where n is the number of rounds.

### Code
```python
from typing import List

def determine_winner(player1: List[int], player2: List[int]) -> int:
    def calculate_score(scores: List[int]) -> int:
        total_score = 0
        previous_was_strike = False
        
        for i in range(len(scores)):
            round_score = scores[i]
            
            if previous_was_strike:
                total_score += 2 * round_score
            else:
                total_score += round_score
            
            if round_score == 10:
                previous_was_strike = True
            else:
                previous_was_strike = False
        
        return total_score
    
    player1_total = calculate_score(player1)
    player2_total = calculate_score(player2)
    
    if player1_total > player2_total:
        return 1
    elif player2_total > player1_total:
        return 2
    else:
        return 0

# Example usage:
# player1 = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
# player2 = [10, 9, 8, 8, 9, 4, 6, 5, 10, 10]
# print(determine_winner(player1, player2))  # Output will depend on the total scores
```

All edge cases are considered, and we assume the simplest doubling rules. The function does not account for spares as individual roll data is not provided in problem statement. If spares should also affect the scores, then individual rolls must be known.
