The problem "60. Permutation Sequence" on LeetCode asks you to find the k-th permutation sequence of the first n natural numbers. The sequence of permutations is in lexicographical order.

Here is the full problem description:

Given `n` and `k`, return the k-th permutation sequence of numbers from 1 to n.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 9
- 1 <= k <= n!

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output format?**
   - The output should be a string representing the k-th permutation sequence.
   
2. **Are there any edge cases or special scenarios to consider?**
   - Given the constraints, calculations will be manageable in terms of time and space within typical limits.

3. **Do we need to handle invalid inputs?**
   - For this problem, as per the constraints, inputs will always be valid.

## Strategy

To find the k-th permutation directly without generating all permutations step-by-step, we can use the properties of factorial numbers. Here's the plan:

1. **Factorials:** Precompute the factorial values for numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Initialize Items:** Create a list `numbers` that contains elements from `1` to `n`.
3. **Adjust Indexing:** Adjust `k` because our list is zero-indexed.
4. **Construct Permutation:** For each position in the permutation, determine the blocks of permutations of length `(n-1)!`, `(n-2)!`, etc. Use integer division to find the correct position.

This will allow us to place the correct digit at each position without generating all permutations.

## Code

```python
def getPermutation(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    import math
    
    # Precompute factorials up to n
    factorials = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorials[i] = factorials[i - 1] * i
    
    # Initialize numbers array and adjust k to be zero-indexed
    numbers = [str(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    k -= 1
    
    # Build the k-th permutation
    permutation = []
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        # Determine the index of the next number to add
        idx = k // factorials[i - 1]
        permutation.append(numbers[idx])
        
        # Remove used number and update k
        numbers.pop(idx)
        k %= factorials[i - 1]
    
    return ''.join(permutation)

# Example usage
print(getPermutation(3, 3)) # Output: "213"
print(getPermutation(4, 9)) # Output: "2314"
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\). Let's break it down:

- Precomputation of factorial values: \(O(n)\)
- Constructing the permutation sequence involves removing elements from a list, which in the worst case is \(O(n)\) for each of the \(n\) removals, giving us \(O(n^2)\) overall.

This approach ensures that we directly find the k-th permutation efficiently without generating unnecessary permutations.
