title:  Numbers At Most N Given Digit Set-out
permalink: /s902
---

You are given an array of `digits` which is a sorted array of digits (strings) and an integer `n`. You need to determine how many positive integers less than or equal to `n` can be formed using `digits`. The numbers can have repeated digits and the digits need not be in sorted order within the number.

Example:
- Input: `digits = ["1","3","5","7"]`, `n = 100`
- Output: `20`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can digits in the `digits` array repeat within the same number?**
   Yes, digits can repeat within the same number.

2. **Is there any constraint on the number of elements in the digits array or the maximum value of n?**
   Elements in the `digits` array are between 1 and 9. The number `n` is a positive integer, usually provided within the limits that can be managed within computational constraints.
   
3. **Since `digits` is a sorted array, would non-increasing order inputs be allowed?**
   Typically inputs like `digits` are given in non-decreasing order as per the problem statement.

4. **What should be returned if all given digits are larger than `n`?**
   In such cases, the return value should be 0 since no valid numbers can be formed.

### Strategy:

1. **Base Case Analysis**:
   - If `n` is very small or digits array does not offer digits <= n, simple checks will help in identifying early returns.
   
2. **Convert n to String**:
   - We'll convert `n` to a string, making it easier to compare digit by digit.
   
3. **Using Digit Permutations**:
   - Determine the number of valid integers with fewer digits than `n`.
   - For integers with the same number of digits as `n`, compute recursively by fixing the leftmost digit and solving for the remainder.
   
4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Utilize a helper to track the counts based on the number of valid choices at each digit place.
   
5. **Summation**:
   - Sum all combinatorially valid counts, considering both cases: shorter lengths and exact length equivalence checks.

### Code:

```python
def at_most_n_given_digit_set(digits, n):
    def count_valid_numbers(prefix, num):
        if not num:
            return 1
        count = 0
        for digit in digits:
            if digit < num[0]:
                count += len(digits) ** (len(num) - 1)
            elif digit == num[0]:
                count += count_valid_numbers(prefix + digit, num[1:])
        return count
    
    n_str = str(n)
    total_count = 0
    
    # Count numbers with lengths less than the length of n_str
    for length in range(1, len(n_str)):
        total_count += len(digits) ** length
    
    # Count numbers with the same length as n_str
    total_count += count_valid_numbers("", n_str)
    
    return total_count

# Example
digits = ["1", "3", "5", "7"]
n = 100
print(at_most_n_given_digit_set(digits, n))  # Output: 20
```

### Time Complexity:

- The function `count_valid_numbers` runs in a recursive manner, checking each digit in `digits` against each character in the string representation of `n`.
- With m as the total number of digits available and k being the length of `n`, the time complexity approximates to O(k * m^k), in the worst case.
- This implements a powerful albeit costly recursive approach, which covers combinations and permutations required effectively.

This solution is suitable given the constraints on size and complexity ensuring valid answers.
