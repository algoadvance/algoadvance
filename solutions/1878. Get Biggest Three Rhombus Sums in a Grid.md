title:  Get Biggest Three Rhombus Sums in a Grid-out
permalink: /s1878
---

You are given a 2D grid of integers ```grid``` of size ```m x n```. A rhombus sum is defined as the sum of the integers in the rhombus defined by cells that lie along the edges of a rhombus (diamond shape) with its center at `(i, j)`. The size of the rhombus is specified with an integer `k`. The bigger the value of `k`, the bigger the rhombus.

The goal is to find the three largest distinct rhombus sums in the grid. If there are fewer than three distinct sums, return all of them.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Rhombus Definition:** Is the rhombus symmetrical around its center?
    - Yes, the rhombus is defined symmetrically around its center `(i, j)`.

2. **Rhombus Size:** How is the rhombus size `k` defined?
    - The size `k` is defined as the distance from the center to any of its four vertices.

3. **Edge Cases:** What if `m` or `n` is very small (such as 1 or 2)?
    - In such cases, rhombuses cannot be formed if `k` is greater than 0, so we can only consider single-cell rhombuses.

### Strategy

1. **Single Cell Rhombuses:** Every cell itself represents a rhombus of size `0`.
2. **Larger Rhombuses:** For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the sum for each possible rhombus size `k`.
3. **Valid Rhombus Check:** Ensure the rhombus fits within the grid.
4. **Sum Calculation:** Calculate the sum of the unique edge cells to avoid double-counting.
5. **Distinct Sums:** Maintain a set to ensure sums are distinct.
6. **Top Three Sums:** Sort the sums and return the top three.

### Time Complexity

- **Worst Case:** O((m * n) * min(m, n)^2), where calculating the sum involves iterating over all potential rhombus sizes and centers.
- **Average Case:** Assuming constraints, we'll keep computations manageable.

### Code

```python
def getBiggestThree(grid):
    def get_rhombus_sum(i, j, k):
        if k == 0:
            return grid[i][j]
        total_sum = 0
        # Sum the diagonals (4 edges)
        for d in range(k):
            total_sum += grid[i - k + d][j + d]  # Top-Left to Bottom-Right
            total_sum += grid[i - k + d][j - d]  # Top-Right to Bottom-Left
            total_sum += grid[i + k - d][j + d]  # Bottom-Left to Top-Right
            total_sum += grid[i + k - d][j - d]  # Bottom-Right to Top-Left
        
        # Remove corners which have been counted twice
        total_sum -= grid[i - k][j]
        total_sum -= grid[i + k][j]
        total_sum -= grid[i][j - k]
        total_sum -= grid[i][j + k]
        
        # Add center cell (always included once when k=1 or more)
        total_sum += grid[i][j]
        
        return total_sum

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    sums_set = set()

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Max value of k such that the rhombus still fits in the grid
            max_k = min(i, m - i - 1, j, n - j - 1)
            for k in range(max_k + 1):
                sums_set.add(get_rhombus_sum(i, j, k))
    
    # Get top three unique sums
    sums_list = sorted(sums_set, reverse=True)
    return sums_list[:3]

# Example usage:
grid = [
  [3,4,5,1,3],
  [3,3,4,2,3],
  [20,30,200,40,10],
  [1,5,5,4,1],
  [4,3,2,2,5]
]
print(getBiggestThree(grid))  # Output: top three distinct rhombus sums
```

In this solution, we compute the sum for every possible rhombus centered at each cell `(i, j)` with all valid `k` values. Unique sums are maintained in a set and the top three unique sums are extracted and returned.
