title:  Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero-out
permalink: /s1611
---

A binary string is a string that consists of only '0's and '1's. Given a binary string `s` with '1's and '0's, you can perform the following operations to turn the binary string to zero:

1. If the first character of `s` is '1', flip the first character from '1' to '0'.
2. If the first character of `s` is '0', flip any '1' in `s` to '0'.

You need to find the minimum number of operations to turn the binary string `s` into a string of all '0's.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the given integer `x` become zero.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What is the range of `x`? 
   - The integer `x` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

2. **Binary String Length:** What is the maximum length of the binary representation of `x`?
   - Although not strictly given, considering typical integer size limits, the length can be large (up to 32 bits or more).

3. **Example:** If `x` is 3, we need to convert the binary representation of `3` (`'11'`) to `'00'`. 

## Strategy

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the transformation of binary operations. The binary representation of `x` can be manipulated to reach zero using the rules provided.

We can use a recursive approach to determine the minimum operations needed:

1. **Base Case:** If `x == 0`, return 0 as no operations are needed.
2. **Recursive Case:** For any integer `x`, we need to:
   - Find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Use this information to recursively solve the problem for the remaining part caused by flipping the first '1'.

Each change of the first '1' to '0' will affect the subsequent bits. Thus, the number of operations needed can be derived recursively.

The function `minimumOneBitOperations` uses this principle:

## Code

```python
def minimumOneBitOperations(n: int) -> int:
    def helper(x):
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        b = 1
        while b <= x:
            b = b << 1
        b = b >> 1
        return (b - 1) ^ helper((b - 1) ^ x)
    
    return helper(n)

# Example usage:
x = 3
print(minimumOneBitOperations(x))  # Output: 3
```

## Strategy

- **Recursive Function `helper(x)`**:
  - If `x == 0`, return 0.
  - Determine the highest power of 2 (`b`) less than or equal to `x`.
  - Use XOR operations to reduce the complexity of transformations.
  - Recursively solve the reduced problem until `x` becomes 0.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the recursive function is largely dependent on how quickly we can reduce `x`. The dominant operation within each recursion is the bitwise shift and XOR, both of which operate in constant time.

- On average, the depth of the recursion would be `O(log n)`, where `n` is the length of the binary representation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`, making the function efficient for reasonably sized integers.
