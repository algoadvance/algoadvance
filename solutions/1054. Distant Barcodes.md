Given an array of integers `barcodes` where `barcodes[i]` is the barcode of the i-th prisoner, rearrange the barcodes such that no two adjacent prisoners have the same barcode. You may return any answer that satisfies this condition.

### Example
```
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: [1,3,1,2,1,2]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the barcodes?** 
   - Barcodes are integers, and there isn't a specific range mentioned, but they could be large or small integers.

2. **What is the size of the input array (length of barcodes)?**
   - The length of the barcodes array can be between 1 and 10000 as typically found in LeetCode problems unless stated otherwise.

3. **Is it guaranteed that a valid arrangement is always possible?**
   - Yes, it's guaranteed that it's possible to rearrange the barcodes such that no two adjacent barcodes are the same.

### Strategy

The main challenge here is to rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent elements are the same. 

1. **Count the Frequency:** First, we'll count the frequency of each barcode.
2. **Max Heap:** Use a max heap to store the barcodes by their frequency so that we can always pop the most frequent barcode not recently used.
3. **Re-arrangement:**
   - Continuously pop the most frequent element and place it in the result array.
   - Use a temporary variable to store the previously used element to ensure it is not used again immediately.
4. **Reinsert:** After using a barcode, if it still has a remaining count, push it back to the heap but only after using another element.
5. **Result Construction:** This ensures elements are spaced out adequately.

### Time Complexity

- Building the frequency map takes O(n).
- Constructing the max heap takes O(k), where k is the number of unique barcodes.
- Extracting from the heap will take O(log k), and we do this for all n elements.
  
Overall, the time complexity is O(n log k).

### Code

```python
import heapq
from collections import Counter

def rearrangeBarcodes(barcodes):
    # Count the frequency of each barcode
    count = Counter(barcodes)
    
    # Max heap based on the counts. Use negative counts because Python's heapq is a min-heap by default
    max_heap = [(-freq, barcode) for barcode, freq in count.items()]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    
    prev_freq, prev_barcode = 0, 0
    result = []
    
    while max_heap or prev_freq < 0:
        if max_heap:
            freq, barcode = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result.append(barcode)
            freq += 1 # Increase the count towards 0
            
            if prev_freq < 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (prev_freq, prev_barcode))
                
            prev_freq, prev_barcode = freq, barcode
        else:
            # If heap is empty but previous frequency is not reset, push it back
            if prev_freq < 0:
                result.append(prev_barcode)
                prev_freq += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
barcodes = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
print(rearrangeBarcodes(barcodes))
```

This code will ensure that no two adjacent elements in the resulting array are the same by following the strategy outlined. The use of a max heap helps in always picking the most frequent barcode that's not recently used efficiently.
