title:  Strictly Palindromic Number-out
permalink: /s2396
---
Given an integer `n`, your task is to determine if `n` is a "strictly palindromic number." A strictly palindromic number is defined as a number `n` such that, for every base `b` from `2` to `n-2`, the representation of `n` in base `b` is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

Write a function `isStrictlyPalindromic(n: int) -> bool` that returns `True` if `n` is a strictly palindromic number, and `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?
   - Typically we would check for standard constraints such as `1 <= n <= 10^9` or similar.

2. Is it sufficient to assume standard integer conversion functions for base conversions?
   - Yes, this can simplify our implementation.

3. Should we precompute for multiple values, or is this a per-instance check?
   - Each call to `isStrictlyPalindromic` should independently check if the given n is strictly palindromic.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding Palindromic in Bases**: To check if a number is palindromic in a specific base:
   - Convert the number to the specified base.
   - Check if the representation is a palindrome.
   
2. **Loop Through Bases**: We need to check for every base from `2` to `n-2`.

3. **Base Conversion**:
   - Convert the number `n` into a string representation of a given base.
   - A helper function to perform this conversion.

4. **Palindrome Check**:
   - Write a helper function to check if a string is a palindrome.

5. **Optimization Insight**:
   - For all `n >= 4`, it is inherently impossible for `n` to be strictly palindromic. For any number `n` in base `n-1` is represented as `11`, which is trivially a palindrome. Therefore, for the strictly palindromic definition to hold "strictly" for all bases from `2` to `n-2` is mathematically impossible for `n >= 4`.

### Code
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def number_to_base(n: int, b: int) -> str:
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    digits = []
    while n:
        digits.append(int(n % b))
        n //= b
    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])

def isStrictlyPalindromic(n: int) -> bool:
    # Mathematically pre-analysis:
    # It is shown strictly no number `n` >= 4 can be strictly palindromic.
    return False

# No further checks needed given the mathematical proof for n >= 4.
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(1)\) due to the mathematical insight that no number `n >= 4` can satisfy the condition of being strictly palindromic. Therefore, the solution is constant time since we directly return `False` for these cases.
