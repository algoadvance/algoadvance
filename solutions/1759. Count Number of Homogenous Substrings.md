title:  Count Number of Homogenous Substrings-out
permalink: /s1759
---

We are given a string `s`. A substring of a string is called homogenous if all the characters of the substring are the same. We need to return the number of homogenous substrings of the given string.

Due to the potentially large size of the output, the result must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a" -> 3 times
"aa" -> 1 time
"b" -> 2 times
"bb" -> 1 time
"c" -> 3 times
"cc" -> 2 times
"ccc" -> 1 time
Total count = 13
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Can the string be empty?
   - A: No, the string is guaranteed to have at least one character.
   
2. Q: Are there any constraints on the length of the string?
   - A: The length of the string can go up to 10^5.

3. Q: Should we only consider lowercase English letters?
   - A: Yes, the string `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the String**: We'll iterate through the string using a loop.
2. **Count Consecutive Homogenous Substrings**: As we traverse, we'll maintain a count of consecutive identical characters.
3. **Calculate Substring Counts**: For each segment of consecutive identical characters of length `n`, the number of homogenous substrings is given by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we will take the modulo operation (`10^9 + 7`) at each step to avoid overflow.

### Code

```python
def countHomogenous(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    count = 0
    length = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            length += 1
        else:
            count += (length * (length + 1)) // 2
            count %= MOD
            length = 1
    
    # Add the homogenous substrings of the last segment
    count += (length * (length + 1)) // 2
    count %= MOD
    
    return count

# Example Usage
s = "abbcccaa"
print(countHomogenous(s))  # Output: 13
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We are traversing the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently count the homogenous substrings and handle large inputs within the constraints.
