title:  Design a Text Editor-out

Design a text editor with the following functionalities:
- `addText(text: str) -> None`: Appends `text` to the current contents of the text editor.
- `deleteText(k: int) -> int`: Deletes the last `k` characters from the current contents of the text editor and returns the number of characters actually deleted.
- `cursorLeft(k: int) -> str`: Moves the cursor to the left by `k` characters and then returns the last 10 characters before the cursor or fewer if the total number of characters left is less than 10.
- `cursorRight(k: int) -> str`: Moves the cursor to the right by `k` characters and then returns the last 10 characters before the cursor or fewer if the total number of characters left is less than 10.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the cursor movements beyond the text boundaries be properly handled?
2. Can the text processed by the editor contain special characters?
3. Are there upper limits on the size of the `text` or the values for `k`?

## Strategy

We'll maintain a string to represent the content and a cursor position as an integer.

1. **Initialization**: We'll have a string `content` to hold the text and an integer `cursor` to point to the current position.
2. **Add Text**: Insert the given `text` at the current cursor position and update the cursor accordingly.
3. **Delete Text**: Remove up to `k` characters from the position to the left of the cursor, update the content, and move the cursor.
4. **Cursor Left**: Move the cursor to the left by `k` characters (without going past the start) and return the last 10 characters before the cursor.
5. **Cursor Right**: Move the cursor to the right by `k` characters (without going past the end) and return the last 10 characters before the cursor.

Pseudocode:
- For `addText`, use slicing to insert text.
- For `deleteText`, update the slice of content to remove characters before the cursor.
- For `cursorLeft` and `cursorRight`, shift the cursor position adequately and return the required substring.

## Code

```python
class TextEditor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content = ""
        self.cursor = 0

    def addText(self, text: str) -> None:
        self.content = self.content[:self.cursor] + text + self.content[self.cursor:]
        self.cursor += len(text)

    def deleteText(self, k: int) -> int:
        delete_count = min(k, self.cursor)
        self.content = self.content[:self.cursor - delete_count] + self.content[self.cursor:]
        self.cursor -= delete_count
        return delete_count

    def cursorLeft(self, k: int) -> str:
        self.cursor = max(0, self.cursor - k)
        return self.content[max(0, self.cursor - 10):self.cursor]

    def cursorRight(self, k: int) -> str:
        self.cursor = min(len(self.content), self.cursor + k)
        return self.content[max(0, self.cursor - 10):self.cursor]
```

## Time Complexity

1. **addText**: `O(n + m)` where `n` is the current content length and `m` is the length of the text being added.
2. **deleteText**: `O(n)` due to the slicing operation.
3. **cursorLeft**: `O(1)` for updating the cursor and `O(1)` for slicing a maximum of 10 characters.
4. **cursorRight**: `O(1)` for updating the cursor and `O(1)` for slicing a maximum of 10 characters.

In conclusion, `addText` and `deleteText` have linear time complexity in the worst case, while `cursorLeft` and `cursorRight` have constant time complexity.
