title:  Maximum XOR for Each Query-out
permalink: /s1829
---

You are given a **sorted** (in ascending order) integer array `nums` of `n` elements and an integer `maximumBit`. You need to perform the following queries `n` times:

1. Find the maximum possible XOR (`∧`) of `nums` with any integer `x` such that `0 <= x < 2^maximumBit`.
2. Remove the last element from the `nums`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the i-th query (0-indexed).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum range for `nums` and `maximumBit`?**
   - `nums` can have lengths up to 10^5 and `maximumBit` can be as large as 20.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?**
   - `nums` values are sorted in ascending order and lie within the range `[0, 2^maximumBit - 1]`.

3. **Can `nums` contain duplicates?**
   - This wasn't specified, but usually array problems may contain duplicates unless stated otherwise. We will assume duplicates are possible.

### Strategy

To devise an efficient solution, we need to understand how to maximize the XOR value. 

#### Observations:

1. **Properties of XOR**: The XOR operation (`∧`) between two numbers is maximized when the two numbers' differing bits are aligned as much as possible. 

2. **Binary Inversion**: For a given integer, the best way to maximize its XOR with another number is to XOR it with its binary complement within the bit-length specified by `maximumBit`.

#### Steps:

1. **Compute Prefix XOR**: Start by computing the prefix XOR for the given array `nums`. This will aid in fast XOR computation:
   - `prefix_xor[i]` = `nums[0] ∧ nums[1] ∧ ... ∧ nums[i]`
   
2. **Find Complement**: For each query:
   - Compute the complement integer for the prefix XOR value at the current position to maximize the XOR value.
   - Remove the last element in the current prefix XOR array.

3. **Generate Result**: Store results for each query in reverse order (since we start removing from the end of the list).

#### Plan:

1. Compute the prefix XOR.
2. Iterate to generate the maximum XOR for each prefix.
3. Return the results in required order.

### Code

```python
def getMaximumXor(nums, maximumBit):
    n = len(nums)
    max_val = (1 << maximumBit) - 1  # max integer with `maximumBit` bits, i.e., 2^maximumBit - 1
    
    prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ nums[i - 1]
    
    result = []
    
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        current_xor = prefix_xor[i] ^ max_val
        result.append(current_xor)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [0, 1, 2, 2, 5, 7]
maximumBit = 3
print(getMaximumXor(nums, maximumBit))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix XOR Computation**: O(n)
- **Answer Array Computation**: O(n)

Overall, the algorithm runs in `O(n)` time complexity where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity

- The primary space usage is for the `prefix_xor` array and `result` array, making the space complexity O(n).
