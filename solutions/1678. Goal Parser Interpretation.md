Leetcode Problem 1678: Goal Parser Interpretation

You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()", and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret the command as follows:
* "G" -> "G"
* "()" -> "o"
* "(al)" -> "al"

Given the string `command`, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of the command.

Example:
```
Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
```

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the code, let's clarify a few points:
1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What is the length range of the input string? (This will help determine if efficiency is a concern)
   - Is the input guaranteed to be valid according to the rules specified?
2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should we handle case sensitivity?
   
For now, we'll assume:
- Input string `command` length is between 1 and 100.
- The input is always a valid command according to the problem's specifications.
- Case sensitivity is handled as specified (i.e., "G" is different from "g").

### Strategy
- We will iterate through the string `command`.
- When we encounter a "G", it directly interprets as "G".
- When we encounter "()", it interprets as "o".
- When we encounter "(al)", it interprets as "al".
- We can use string manipulation to achieve this.

### Code

```python
def interpret(command: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    i = 0
    while i < len(command):
        if command[i] == 'G':
            result += 'G'
            i += 1
        elif command[i:i+2] == '()':
            result += 'o'
            i += 2
        elif command[i:i+4] == '(al)':
            result += 'al'
            i += 4
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(interpret("G()(al)"))
print(interpret("G()()()()(al)"))
print(interpret("(al)G(al)()()G"))
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `command`. This is because we are scanning through the string once and processing sections of it in constant time.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(n) since we create a new result string whose size could be up to the length of the input string `command`.
