title:  Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges-out
permalink: /s1553
---

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of oranges you have. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of days to eat all `n` oranges. 

You can only eat the oranges as follows:
1. Eat one orange.
2. Eat `n // 2` oranges if `n` is divisible by 2.
3. Eat `2 * (n // 3)` oranges if `n` is divisible by 3.

Return the minimum number of days required to eat all the oranges.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `n` be zero?
   **A:** No, `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
   
2. **Q:** Is the number of oranges always less than a certain value, for example, less than 10,000,000?
   **A:** There is no explicit upper bound mentioned, so we should assume it could be a large number.

3. **Q:** How do the operations combine? For example, can you first eat one orange, and then proceed with the other actions?
   **A:** Yes, you can choose any of the specified actions on each day.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Solution with Memoization:**
   - Use a recursive function that explores all possible actions (eat one orange, eat `n // 2` oranges if divisible by 2, eat `2 * (n // 3)` oranges if divisible by 3).
   - Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Create a dynamic programming table where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of days to eat `i` oranges.
   - Populate the table from `1` to `n` using the defined operations.

Given that `n` can be very large, the recursive solution with memoization is more suitable as it can handle large inputs more effectively.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minDays(self, n: int) -> int:
        from functools import lru_cache
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(orange_count):
            if orange_count == 0:
                return 0
            if orange_count == 1:
                return 1
            
            # Option 1: Eat one orange
            days_one_orange = 1 + dfs(orange_count - 1)
            
            # Option 2: Eat n // 2 oranges if divisible by 2
            if orange_count % 2 == 0:
                days_half_oranges = 1 + dfs(orange_count // 2)
            else:
                days_half_oranges = float('inf')
                
            # Option 3: Eat 2 * (n // 3) oranges if divisible by 3
            if orange_count % 3 == 0:
                days_two_third_oranges = 1 + dfs(orange_count // 3)
            else:
                days_two_third_oranges = float('inf')
                
            # Return the minimum days among all options
            return min(days_one_orange, days_half_oranges, days_two_third_oranges)
        
        return dfs(n)

# Example of usage
solution = Solution()
print(solution.minDays(10))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is hard to pinpoint exactly due to the memoization, but the worst-case scenario should be sub-linear O(log n) because with each division by 2 or 3, the size of `n` is reduced significantly.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) due to the depth of the recursive calls and the memoization storage.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum days required to eat all the oranges by leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
