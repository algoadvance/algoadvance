title:  Linked List Cycle-out
permalink: /s141
---

Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked-list.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be the return type?**
   - The function should return a boolean value: `True` if a cycle is detected, `False` otherwise.

2. **Should we handle empty linked list cases?**
   - Yes, if the linked list is empty (`head` is `None`), the function should return `False`.

3. **What is the structure of a linked list node?**
   - Each node in the list contains a value (`val`) and a pointer (`next`) to the next node.

### Strategy:

We will use Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm):

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Initialize two pointers, both starting from the head of the linked list. The fast pointer (hare) will move two steps at a time, while the slow pointer (tortoise) will move one step at a time.

2. **Move the Pointers**: In each iteration, advance the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps.

3. **Check for Cycle**: If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (`None`), then there is no cycle.

4. **Return Result**: If the fast pointer meets the slow pointer, return `True` indicating a cycle exists. Otherwise, if the fast pointer reaches the end, return `False`.

### Code:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def hasCycle(head: ListNode) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return False

    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if slow == fast:
            return True

    return False
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, we will traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use two pointers and no additional data structures that scale with the input size.

This solution effectively detects cycles using constant space and linear time.
