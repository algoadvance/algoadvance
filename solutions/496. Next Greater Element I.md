title:  Next Greater Element I-out
permalink: /s496
---

You are given two arrays (with unique elements) `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`. Find the next greater element for each element of `nums1` in the corresponding positions of `nums2`.

The Next Greater Element of a number x in `nums1` is the first greater number to its right in `nums2`. If it does not exist, output -1 for that number.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
```
Explanation:
For `nums1`, 4 -> -1 for `nums1` because there is no next greater number in `nums2` after 4.
1 -> 3 because 3 is the first number greater than 1 to its right in `nums2`.
2 -> -1 because there is no next greater number in `nums2` after 2.

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
```
Explanation:
For `nums1`, 2 -> 3 because 3 is the first number greater than 2 to its right in nums2.
4 -> -1 because there is no next greater number in `nums2` after 4.

**Constraints:**
- All the elements of `nums1` and `nums2` are unique.
- 1 <= `nums1.length` <= 1000
- 1 <= `nums2.length` <= 1000
- 0 <= `nums1[i]`, `nums2[i]` <= 10^4
- `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Use a Stack:** This will help keep track of the potential candidates for "next greater element".
2. **Use a HashMap:** This will store each number from `nums2` and its corresponding next greater element.
3. **Iterate through `nums2` in reverse order:** This allows us to efficiently determine the next greater elements using a stack.

### Approach

1. Initialize an empty stack and an empty hashmap.
2. Traverse `nums2` from right to left:
   - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current element, pop from the stack.
   - If the stack is not empty, the next greater element for the current element is the element on the top of the stack.
   - Otherwise, the next greater element does not exist, so we store `-1`.
   - Push the current element onto the stack.
3. For each element in `nums1`, retrieve the next greater element from the hashmap.

### Time Complexity

- Building the hashmap and stack traversal takes O(n), where n is the length of `nums2`.
- Retrieving the results for `nums1` elements takes O(m), where m is the length of `nums1`.
- Overall complexity is O(n + m).

### Code

```python
def nextGreaterElement(nums1, nums2):
    # HashMap to store the next greater elements
    next_greater = {}
    
    # Stack to keep track of the current element and find the next greater element
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate through nums2 in reverse order
    for num in nums2[::-1]:
        # Maintain elements in stack such that they are always greater than the current element
        while stack and stack[-1] <= num:
            stack.pop()
        
        # If stack is not empty, then top of stack is the next greater element
        if stack:
            next_greater[num] = stack[-1]
        else:
            next_greater[num] = -1
        
        # Push the current element into the stack
        stack.append(num)
    
    # Build the result for nums1 based on the next_greater map
    result = [next_greater[num] for num in nums1]
    
    return result

# Example Usage
nums1 = [4, 1, 2]
nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2]
print(nextGreaterElement(nums1, nums2))  # Output: [-1, 3, -1]
```

This implementation uses a stack-based approach to achieve an efficient solution with a linear time complexity, making it suitable for the given constraints.
