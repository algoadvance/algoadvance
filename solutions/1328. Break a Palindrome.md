### Problem Statement
Given a palindromic string `palindrome` of lowercase English letters, replace exactly one character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is not a palindrome and is the lexicographically smallest one possible.

If it is not possible to do so, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the length range of the input string?
   - The length will be between 1 and 1000.

2. What should we return if the input string length is 1?
   - Since we need to change exactly one character and it cannot be a palindrome, if the input string length is 1, it's impossible to achieve the task. We should return an empty string in this case.

### Strategy
1. If the length of the string is 1, return an empty string since we can't achieve our goal.
2. Iterate over the first half of the string:
   - If we find any character that is not 'a', change it to 'a' to make the string lexicographically smaller and return it.
3. If all characters in the first half are 'a', change the last character of the string to 'b'.
4. Return the modified string.

### Code

Here's the Python function to solve this problem:

```python
def breakPalindrome(palindrome: str) -> str:
    if len(palindrome) == 1:
        return ""
    
    for i in range(len(palindrome) // 2):
        if palindrome[i] != 'a':
            # Found a character that is not 'a', replace it with 'a'
            return palindrome[:i] + 'a' + palindrome[i+1:]
    
    # If we reach here, all characters in the first half are 'a'
    # so change the last character to 'b'
    return palindrome[:-1] + 'b'

# Example usage:
print(breakPalindrome("abccba"))  # Expected output: "aaccba"
print(breakPalindrome("a"))       # Expected output: ""
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We are essentially making a single pass through the first half of the string and performing constant-time operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the new string generated in the worst case, but we are not using any extra space other than variables and a new string.

This approach ensures the lexicographically smallest non-palindromic string possible with exactly one character change.
