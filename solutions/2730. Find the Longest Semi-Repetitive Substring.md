title:  Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring-out
permalink: /s2730
---

You are given a string `s`. A substring of `s` is called semi-repetitive if it does not contain two consecutive identical characters. Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the string length?**
   - Typical constraints on LeetCode must be checked, but let's assume it can go up to `10^5`.
2. **What should be returned if the string is empty?**
   - Should return 0 because there are no substrings in an empty string.
3. **Can the string contain special characters or only lowercase/uppercase alphabets?**
   - Usually, strings are composed of lowercase and uppercase alphabets, but any explicit constraints should be verified.

### Strategy

To find the longest semi-repetitive substring, follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two pointers, `start` and `end`, to iterate through the string and find valid substrings.
   - Maintain a variable `max_length` to keep track of the maximum length of semi-repetitive substrings found.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Use the `end` pointer to expand the window and check each character.
   - If a consecutive identical character is found, update the `start` pointer to the position after the previous repeated character.
   - Continually update the `max_length` as the difference between `end` and `start` pointers whenever a non-repetitive substring is extended.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle the case of an empty string.
   - Consider scenarios where the entire string has no consecutive identical characters.

### Code

```python
def longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    max_length = 0
    start = 0
    n = len(s)

    for end in range(1, n):
        if s[end] == s[end - 1]:
            start = end
    
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
s = "abcab"
print(longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(s))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The sliding window ensures that each character is processed once, making the solution linear relative to the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** since no additional data structures are used that grow with input size.

### Summary

- We employ a sliding window technique to efficiently find the longest semi-repetitive substring by adjusting the start point based on consecutive character repetition.
- This approach guarantees a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the order of \(10^5\).
