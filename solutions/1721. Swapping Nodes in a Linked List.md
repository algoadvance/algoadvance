title:  Swapping Nodes in a Linked List-out
permalink: /s1721
---

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return the head of the linked list after **swapping the values** of the `kth` node from the beginning and the `kth` node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What if `k` is out of the bounds of the linked list?** 
    - You can assume that `k` is valid for the given linked list.
    
2. **Can the linked list be empty?**
    - No, the linked list will have at least one node.

3. **Will `k` always be a positive integer?**
    - Yes, `k` will always be a positive integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. **Find the kth Node from the Beginning:**
   - Traverse the list from the head to locate the `kth` node.

2. **Find the kth Node from the End:**
   - Use two pointers: Initialize both pointers at the head. 
   - Move the first pointer `k` steps ahead.
   - Move both pointers simultaneously until the first pointer reaches the end of the list. The second pointer will then be pointing to the `kth` node from the end.

3. **Swap Values:**
   - Swap the values of the `kth` node from the beginning and the `kth` node from the end.

### Code

Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def swapNodes(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    # Step 1: Find the kth node from the beginning
    first_k_node = head
    for i in range(k - 1):
        first_k_node = first_k_node.next
    
    # Step 2: Find the kth node from the end using two-pointer technique
    fast = head
    for i in range(k):
        fast = fast.next
    
    second_k_node = head
    while fast:
        fast = fast.next
        second_k_node = second_k_node.next
    
    # Step 3: Swap the values of the two kth nodes
    first_k_node.val, second_k_node.val = second_k_node.val, first_k_node.val
    
    return head
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. Here's the breakdown:
- Finding the `kth` node from the beginning involves traversing `k` steps: `O(k)`.
- Finding the `kth` node from the end requires traversing the entire list with the two-pointer technique: `O(n)`.
- Swapping the values involves a constant time operation: `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Additional Notes

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are using only a constant amount of extra space for pointers.
- **Edge Cases**: Minimal edge cases such as very small linked lists (e.g., 1-node list) are inherently handled by the given constraints that `k` is valid.
