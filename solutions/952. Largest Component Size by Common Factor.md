title:  Largest Component Size by Common Factor-out
permalink: /s952
---

Given an integer array `A`, find the size of the largest subset of `A` such that every pair (i, j) of elements in this subset satisfies:

- 1 <= i, j <= A.length 
- A[i] and A[j] have a common factor greater than 1 (i.e., `gcd(A[i], A[j]) > 1`).

The function signature is:
```python
def largestComponentSize(A: List[int]) -> int:
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the array contain negative numbers or zero?
   - **A**: No, the problem constraints ensure that all elements in the array are positive integers.
   
2. **Q**: What is the size constraint of the array `A`?
   - **A**: The array length can be up to 100,000.
   
3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values within `A`?
   - **A**: Yes, each integer in `A` is between 1 and 100,000.

### Strategy

The goal is to find the largest connected component in the graph where each node represents an element in `A` and an edge between two nodes exists if the elements have a common factor greater than 1.

**Approach**:

1. **Factorization**:
    - For each number, find all of its prime factors.
   
2. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**:
    - Use the Union-Find data structure to manage and merge components.
    - For each pair of numbers that share a common prime factor, union them into the same component.

3. **Component Size Calculation**:
    - After processing the entire array, count the sizes of connected components and find the maximum size.

**Steps**:

1. Define the `find` and `union` operations for managing the Union-Find structure.
2. For each number in `A`, decompose it into its prime factors.
3. Union components based on shared prime factors.
4. Compute the size of each component.

### Code

Here is the implementation of this approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import math

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        
        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

def largestComponentSize(A: List[int]) -> int:
    max_val = max(A)
    uf = UnionFind(max_val + 1)
    
    def prime_factors(n):
        i = 2
        factors = set()
        while i * i <= n:
            while (n % i) == 0:
                factors.add(i)
                n //= i
            i += 1
        if n > 1:
            factors.add(n)
        return factors
    
    num_to_prime_factors = defaultdict(list)
    
    for num in A:
        primes = prime_factors(num)
        num_to_prime_factors[num] = primes
        for prime in primes:
            uf.union(num, prime)
    
    component_size = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in A:
        root = uf.find(num)
        component_size[root] += 1
    
    return max(component_size.values())

```

### Time Complexity

- **Prime Factorization**: O(n log log n) for all elements in A using sieve method (for factorization alone).
- **Union-Find Operations**: O(α(n)) for each union or find operation, where α is the inverse Ackermann function, very close to constant.
- Overall computational complexity combines these, safely within reasonable bounds for the given constraints.
