title:  Count Good Numbers-out

You are given a positive integer `n`. Each integer from `0` to `9` can be either a "good" digit or not. A "good" digit is defined as an even digit for positions indexed at even numbers and an odd digit for positions indexed at odd numbers.

For example, if `n` is even:
- At even indexes `[0, 2, 4, ...]`, you can place an even digit `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]`.
- At odd indexes `[1, 3, 5, ...]`, you can place an odd digit `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

If `n` is odd, the last digit at the highest index would follow the pattern as per its position.

Return the total number of "good" numbers possible for the given `n`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are we considering only non-negative integers?**
   Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.

2. **Does the order of digits matter?**
   Yes, the pattern must follow the even-odd positioning.

3. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   `n` can be very large, up to `10^15`.

### Strategy
The pattern strictly follows:
- `n/2` positions for even indexed digits (0, 2, 4, ...) and `5` choices each.
- `n/2` or `(n/2 + 1)` positions for odd indexed digits (1, 3, 5, ...) for odd `n`, with 5 choices each.

Essentially, we'll have:
- `5^(n//2)` ways to arrange even indexed digits.
- `5^ceil(n/2)` ways to arrange odd indexed digits.

This is a straightforward application of modular exponentiation, as the numbers can become exceptionally large. Therefore, Python's built-in `pow` function, which allows for modular exponentiation efficiently, will be useful.

### Code
```python
def countGoodNumbers(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    even_count = (n + 1) // 2
    odd_count = n // 2
    
    result = pow(5, even_count, MOD) * pow(4, odd_count, MOD) % MOD
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is very efficient:
- `pow(a, b, c)` function in Python uses exponentiation by squaring, which operates in \(O(\log b)\).
- The overall complexity for this operation would be \(O(\log n)\), which is manageable given the large constraints.

This approach ensures that we can handle very large values of `n` effectively and perform computations within acceptable time limits.

Would you like to run through an example, or is there any clarification needed on a particular part?
