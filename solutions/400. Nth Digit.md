**LeetCode 400: Nth Digit**

Find the nth digit of the infinite integer sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...

**Example:**
```python
Input: n = 11
Output: 0
```
Explanation: The 11th digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is `0`, which is part of the number 10.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`?
     - `1 <= n <= 2*10^9`
2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a single digit from the sequence.

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Range:**
   - Identify the range in which the `n`th digit falls. The sequence of digits can be broken down into segments based on number length:
     - 1 to 9 (1-digit numbers)
     - 10 to 99 (2-digit numbers)
     - 100 to 999 (3-digit numbers)
     - and so on.

2. **Calculate Number Range Contribution:**
   - Calculate the number of digits contributed by numbers with a specific number of digits.
   - 1-9: 9 * 1 = 9 digits
   - 10-99: 90 * 2 = 180 digits
   - 100-999: 900 * 3 = 2700 digits
   - Continue until you find the range that includes the `n`th digit.

3. **Locate the Exact Digit:**
   - After finding the correct range, calculate the exact number and the exact digit within that number where the `n`th digit is located.

### Code

```python
def findNthDigit(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the length of digits we are looking at and the count of numbers
    length = 1
    count = 9
    start = 1
    
    # While n is greater than the digits in the current range, narrow down the range
    while n > length * count:
        n -= length * count
        length += 1
        count *= 10
        start *= 10
    
    # Now n is within the current range denoted by length
    # Find the exact number where the nth digit is located
    start += (n - 1) // length
    
    # Find the exact digit within the number
    s = str(start)
    digit_index = (n - 1) % length
    return int(s[digit_index])

# Example Usage:
n = 11
print(findNthDigit(n))  # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\)
  - The `while` loop runs logarithmically by increasing the `length` and adjusting `count` by powers of 10.
  - Converting a number to a string and accessing a specific character is \(O(\log n)\).

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

This code efficiently narrows down the exact range and finds the specific digit in the continuous sequence of integers.
