title:  Balance a Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s1382
---

Given a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: What is the structure of the tree nodes? 
    - Typically, each node will have a value and will have links to left and right children.
2. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the number of nodes in the tree?
    - According to the problem, there may be up to \(10^4\) nodes in the tree.
3. **Output Format**: What should be the structure of the returned tree?
    - We need to return the root of the balanced binary search tree.

## Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal of the input BST to get the elements in a sorted array.
2. **Build Balanced BST**: Use the sorted array to recursively build a balanced BST. The middle element of the current segment becomes the root, with the middle element of the left segment becoming the left child, and the middle element of the right segment becoming the right child, recursively.

Here is the detailed approach:

1. **Perform In-order Traversal**:
   - This will give us a sorted list of the values in the BST.
  
2. **Build Balanced BST**:
   - Select the middle element of the list as the root.
   - Recursively apply this step for the left half as the left subtree and the right half as the right subtree.

## Time Complexity

- **In-order Traversal**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST.
- **Building Balanced BST**: O(N), as each element is visited once during recursive partitioning.

Overall time complexity is O(N).

## Code

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def balanceBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        # In-order traversal to get a sorted list of the node values
        def inorder_traversal(node):
            if not node:
                return []
            return inorder_traversal(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder_traversal(node.right)
        
        # Helper function to build a balanced BST from sorted list of values
        def build_balanced_bst(values):
            if not values:
                return None
            mid = len(values) // 2
            root = TreeNode(values[mid])
            root.left = build_balanced_bst(values[:mid])
            root.right = build_balanced_bst(values[mid+1:])
            return root
        
        sorted_values = inorder_traversal(root)
        return build_balanced_bst(sorted_values)
```

In summary, this solution efficiently balances a binary search tree by first collecting its elements in sorted order and then constructing a new balanced tree from those elements. This ensures that the resulting tree maintains the properties of a balanced binary search tree.
