title:  Contain Virus-out
permalink: /s749
---
A virus is spreading rapidly, and our task is to contain it by building walls. The virus spreads to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are in the same region. Each day, it spreads to all adjacent cells that are not yet infected or previously contained by a wall.

You are given a 2D array `isInfected` of size `m x n` where `isInfected[i][j]` is:

- `0` : If the cell is uninfected.
- `1` : If the cell is infected.
- `-1`: If the cell is protected by a wall.

Each day, we can choose one region (i.e., a connected component of infected cells) and install walls around all cells in that region to prevent the virus from spreading. 

Write a function that returns the number of walls used to contain the virus completely.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input and Output Formats:** What is the expected input and output format?
   - **Input:** A 2D list `isInfected` representing the grid.
   - **Output:** An integer representing the number of walls used.

2. **Infected regions:** How do we define an "infected region"?
   - An infected region is defined as a connected component of adjacent cells with value `1`.

3. **Containment Strategy:** Can we contain multiple regions in a single day or do we only choose one?
   - We can only choose one region each day to contain.

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Infected Regions:** Identify all distinct infected regions in the grid. For each region, calculate the number of walls required to fully isolate the region and how many uninfected cells are adjacent to this region.

2. **Select the Most Dangerous Region:** Choose the region that would spread the most on the next day (i.e., the one adjacent to the most uninfected cells) to contain.

3. **Build Walls:** Build the necessary walls around the chosen region and stop the virus in that region from spreading.

4. **Spread Virus:** Allow the virus in the other regions to spread to adjacent uninfected cells.

5. **Repeat Steps:** Repeat the above steps until no more cells can be infected.

6. **Count Walls:** Accumulate the number of walls used in each step until the virus is fully contained.

### Code:
```python
def containVirus(isInfected):
    def neighbors(r, c):
        for dr, dc in ((0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)):
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < len(isInfected) and 0 <= nc < len(isInfected[0]):
                yield nr, nc

    def dfs(r, c, seen):
        if (r, c) in seen:
            return []
        seen.add((r, c))
        region = [(r, c)]
        for nr, nc in neighbors(r, c):
            if isInfected[nr][nc] == 1:
                region.extend(dfs(nr, nc, seen))
        return region
    
    def walls_needed(region):
        walls = set()
        uninfected = set()
        for r, c in region:
            for nr, nc in neighbors(r, c):
                if isInfected[nr][nc] == 0:
                    uninfected.add((nr, nc))
                    walls.add((min((r, nr), (c, nc)), max((r, nr), (c, nc))))
        return len(walls), len(uninfected)
    
    total_walls = 0
    while True:
        regions = []
        seen = set()
        
        for r in range(len(isInfected)):
            for c in range(len(isInfected[0])):
                if isInfected[r][c] == 1 and (r, c) not in seen:
                    region = dfs(r, c, seen)
                    regions.append(region)

        if not regions:
            break
        
        walls_uninfected = [walls_needed(region) for region in regions]
        
        if not walls_uninfected:
            break
        
        _, _, index = max((u, -w, i) for i, (w, u) in enumerate(walls_uninfected))
        
        total_walls += walls_uninfected[index][0]
        for r, c in regions[index]:
            isInfected[r][c] = -1
            
        for i, region in enumerate(regions):
            if i != index:
                for r, c in region:
                    for nr, nc in neighbors(r, c):
                        if isInfected[nr][nc] == 0:
                            isInfected[nr][nc] = 1
    return total_walls

# Example of usage
isInfected = [
    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]
print(containVirus(isInfected))  # Output: number of walls used.
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for the algorithm can be approximated as follows:
- Identifying regions: `O(m * n)` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid.
- Building walls for each region: `O(m * n)`.
- Repeating the process until all viruses are contained: In the worst case, this might repeat for every cell, leading to a total complexity close to `O((m * n) * (m * n))`.

This complexity is quite high, but due to the nature of the problem, this can be acceptable since each day the number of infected cells increases, reducing the time needed in subsequent steps.
