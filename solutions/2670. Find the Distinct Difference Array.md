title:  Find the Distinct Difference Array-out
permalink: /s2670
---

We are given an integer array `nums`. We need to construct a difference array `diff` such that for each `i` (0 <= i < n):

- `diff[i]` is equal to the difference between the number of distinct elements in the subarray `nums[0:i+1]` and the number of distinct elements in the subarray `nums[i+1:n]`.

We need to return the `diff` array.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there any constraint on the size of the input array `nums`?
2. **Elements Range**: What kinds of integers can the array `nums` contain (positive, negative, zero)?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if the input array is empty?

Assume for our purposes:
1. The input size `n` can be up to \(10^5\).
2. The integers in `nums` can be positive, negative, and zero.
3. For an empty input, since there are no elements to compare, it should return an empty array.

Given this, let's proceed with the solution.

# Strategy

1. **Preprocessing**: Use a prefix approach. Compute:
    - The number of distinct elements in the prefix subarray `nums[0:i+1]`.
    - The number of distinct elements in the suffix subarray `nums[i+1:n]`.
2. **Prefix Array**: Construct an array `prefix_distinct` such that `prefix_distinct[i]` stores the count of distinct elements from the start to index `i`.
3. **Suffix Array**: Construct an array `suffix_distinct` such that `suffix_distinct[i]` stores the count of distinct elements from index `i` to the end.

4. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the `diff` array by subtracting the `suffix_distinct` values from `prefix_distinct` values.

5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the array might be empty or very short.

# Code

```python
def find_distinct_difference_array(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the prefix and suffix distinct count arrays
    prefix_distinct = [0] * n
    suffix_distinct = [0] * n
    
    seen_prefix = set()
    seen_suffix = set()
    
    # Constructing prefix_distinct array
    for i in range(n):
        seen_prefix.add(nums[i])
        prefix_distinct[i] = len(seen_prefix)
    
    # Constructing suffix_distinct array
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        seen_suffix.add(nums[i])
        suffix_distinct[i] = len(seen_suffix)
    
    # Calculating the difference array
    diff = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i + 1 < n:
            diff[i] = prefix_distinct[i] - suffix_distinct[i+1]
        else:
            diff[i] = prefix_distinct[i]
    
    return diff

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(find_distinct_difference_array(nums))  # Output should be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

# Time Complexity

- **Prefix Processing**: Constructing the `prefix_distinct` array involves iterating over the array and maintaining a set. This is \(O(n)\).
- **Suffix Processing**: Constructing the `suffix_distinct` array also involves a single pass with a set, making it \(O(n)\).
- **Difference Calculation**: Computing the final `diff` array comprises a simple iteration which is \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\).

# Space Complexity

- **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We store two arrays of size `n`.
- **Sets**: We use two sets that in the worst case can grow up to size `n`.

Thus, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).
