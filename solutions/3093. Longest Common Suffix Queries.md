title:  Longest Common Suffix Queries-out
permalink: /s3093
---

You are given an array of strings and two arrays of indices. Your task is to determine the longest common suffix for each query specified by the indices. 

For each query `(i, j)`:

1. Consider all the strings from index `i` to index `j` (inclusive) in the array.
2. Find the suffix common to all these strings.
3. Return the length of that suffix.

### Example

Let's say you have the following list of strings and queries:

Strings: `["apple", "ample", "pebble", "bubble"]`
Queries: `[(0, 2), (1, 3)]`

- For query `(0, 2)`:
  The strings are: `["apple", "ample", "pebble"]`
  Longest common suffix is: `"le"` (length: 2)

- For query `(1, 3)`:
  The strings are: `["ample", "pebble", "bubble"]`
  Longest common suffix is: `"ble"` (length: 3)

### Constraints

- You can assume all strings contain only lowercase letters.
- 1 <= number of strings <= 1000
- 0 <= index in queries < number of strings

## Strategy
1. Start by implementing a function that can determine the longest common suffix given two strings.
2. Write a function that can find the longest common suffix among a list of strings.
3. Iterate over the query pairs, and for each query pair, determine the longest common suffix for the subarray specified by the query.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the string comparisons case-sensitive?
2. Can the input list of strings and/or the queries contain duplicates?
3. Is it guaranteed that all indices in the queries are valid and within range?

Let's start by assuming the simplest case unless specified otherwise: 
- The comparisons are case-sensitive.
- The input list can contain duplicates.
- Indices in the queries are valid.

## Code

Letâ€™s write the code to solve the problem.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_longest_common_suffix(strings: List[str]) -> int:
    if not strings:
        return 0

    def common_suffix(str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        min_len = min(len(str1), len(str2))
        suffix = []
        for i in range(1, min_len + 1):
            if str1[-i] == str2[-i]:
                suffix.append(str1[-i])
            else:
                break
        return ''.join(reversed(suffix))

    lcs = strings[0]
    for s in strings[1:]:
        lcs = common_suffix(lcs, s)
        if not lcs:
            return 0
    
    return len(lcs)

def longest_common_suffix_queries(strings: List[str], queries: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    results = []
    for i, j in queries:
        substring_list = strings[i:j+1]
        lcs_length = find_longest_common_suffix(substring_list)
        results.append(lcs_length)
    return results

# Example test case
strings = ["apple", "ample", "pebble", "bubble"]
queries = [(0, 2), (1, 3)]
print(longest_common_suffix_queries(strings, queries))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

- The function `common_suffix` has a time complexity of O(min(len(str1), len(str2))) since it compares characters from the end.
  
- The function `find_longest_common_suffix`:
  - Iterates over the list of strings.
  - Each comparison via `common_suffix` can be O(min(len(lcs), len(current_string))).
  - In the worst case, comparing every pair of strings can be O(m*n) where m is the maximum string length and n is the number of strings in the sublist.

- The `longest_common_suffix_queries` function processes each query, treating them one by one:
  - Suppose there are `q` queries, and each involves a sublist of size `k`, the worst case is `O(n*k*m)` per query.

Hence, the overall time complexity is:
- O(q * n * m) where `q` is the number of queries, `n` is the length of the longest sublist among all queries, and `m` is the maximum string length in those sublists.
