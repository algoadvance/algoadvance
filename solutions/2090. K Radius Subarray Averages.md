title:  K Radius Subarray Averages-out
permalink: /s2090
---

Given a 0-indexed array `nums` of integers of length `n` and an integer `k`, the `k-radius` subarray average for a subarray of `nums` centered at some index `i` with radius `k` is the average of all elements in `nums` between the indices `i - k` and `i + k` (inclusive). If there are less than `k` elements before or after the index `i`, then the `k-radius` subarray average is `-1`.

Build and return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the `k-radius` subarray average of the subarray centered at index `i`. The average is computed by `floor(sum / (2*k + 1))`, where `sum` is the sum of all elements in the `k-radius` subarray. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input range**: What are the limits for the length of `nums` and the values of `k`?
2. **Element values**: Can the elements of `nums` be negative, and are they within a specific range?
3. **Output rounding**: Should the average be rounded down as specified using `floor`?
   
Assuming usual constraints of LeetCode problems, we'll assume:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll start by initializing an array `answer` of the same length as `nums` with all elements set to `-1`.

2. **Initial sum calculation**:
   - Calculate the initial sum of the first possible `k-radius` subarray (from index 0 to `2*k`).

3. **Sliding window**:
   - Use a sliding window approach to update the sum as we move the center of the subarray from index `k` to `n-k-1`.

4. **Maintaining sum**:
   - After calculating the initial sum, slide the window to the right by adding the next element at `i + k + 1` and subtracting the element at `i - k`.

5. **Calculate average**:
   - For each valid center index, compute the average and store it in the `answer` array.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def getAverages(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(nums)
    if k == 0:
        return nums
    if n < 2 * k + 1:
        return [-1] * n
    
    answer = [-1] * n
    window_sum = sum(nums[:2 * k + 1])
    
    for i in range(k, n - k):
        answer[i] = window_sum // (2 * k + 1)
        if i + k + 1 < n:
            window_sum += nums[i + k + 1]
        window_sum -= nums[i - k]
    
    return answer

# Example usage:
nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6]
k = 3
print(getAverages(nums, k))  # Expected output: [-1, -1, -1, 5, 4, 4, -1, -1, -1]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of `answer`**: O(n)
- **Initial sum calculation**: O(k)
- **Sliding window updates**: O(n - 2k)

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This ensures the solution is efficient.

The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the storage of the result in the `answer` array.
