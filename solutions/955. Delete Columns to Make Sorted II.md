title:  Delete Columns to Make Sorted II-out
permalink: /s955
---

You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete the same indices from each string in `strs`. The goal is to have the remain strings in lexicographic order (i.e.: `strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2] <= ... <= strs[n-1]`).

Return the minimum number of columns that you need to delete to ensure that each `strs[i]` is in lexicographic order after deletion.

#### Example:
```
Input: strs = ["ca","bb","ac"]
Output: 1
Explanation:
After deleting column 1, strs = ["c","b","a"].
Now strs is in lexicographic order. 
```

#### Constraints:
- `n == strs.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input strings contain uppercase and lowercase letters?**
   - No, per the problem statement, characters are lowercase English letters.

2. **What happens if the strings are already in order?**
   - If the strings are already in lexicographical order, 0 columns need to be deleted.

3. **Do we need to handle any edge cases specifically, such as very small or large input sizes?**
   - Yes, the solution should be designed to handle the constraints effectively without performance issues.

### Strategy

1. **Identify non-decreasing sequences:** We need to identify the order of each column in the strings.
2. **Track deletion indices:** Maintain a set of indices that, if deleted, would cause the remaining columns to be in order.
3. **Iterate through columns:** For each column, compare characters in pairwise strings and decide whether it helps in maintaining the lexicographic order.
4. **Confirm the rows after deletions**: Keep track of previously confirmed rows that are already non-decreasing, so we don't re-check them.

### Code

```python
def minDeletionSize(strs):
    # Number of rows and columns
    n, m = len(strs), len(strs[0])
    
    # Keep track of columns to delete
    delete_count = 0
    confirmed_rows = set()
    
    for col in range(m):
        # Check if current column in sorted order
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Check only if the row pair haven't been confirmed
            if i not in confirmed_rows and strs[i][col] < strs[i-1][col]:
                delete_count += 1
                break
        else:
            # If current column is sorted, mark the confirmed rows
            for i in range(1, n):
                if strs[i][col] > strs[i-1][col]:
                    confirmed_rows.add(i)
    
    return delete_count
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n * m):** Here, `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of each string. We potentially check each of the `m` columns for ordered relations among `n` rows resulting in `O(n * m)` complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) worst case, where we may maintain confirmation for each row.

This solution efficiently solves the problem within the given constraints by maintaining a balance of deletion checks and by optimizing unnecessary re-evaluations of confirmed rows.
