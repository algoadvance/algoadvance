title:  Longest Consecutive Sequence-out
permalink: /s128
---

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
  
2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Yes, the array can be empty, and in that case, the longest consecutive sequence would be `0`.

3. **What is the range of the elements within the array?**
   - The range of the elements is typical of integer values within Python's capabilities.

4. **Can elements be repeated in the array?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements, but duplicates should only count once in any sequence.

### Strategy

The key to solving this problem efficiently (in `O(n)` time complexity) is to use a set for `O(1)` average time complexity for checking the existence of elements.

Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Convert the List to a Set:** Converting the list to a set helps in `O(1)` average time complexity for checking the presence of elements.
  
2. **Iterate through the Set:** For each element, check if it is the start of a sequence by verifying that the element minus one (`num - 1`) is not in the set.
  
3. **Count the Length of the Sequence:** If an element is the start of a sequence, count the length of the sequence by checking how many consecutive numbers follow it.
  
4. **Track the Maximum Length:** Keep track of the maximum length of all found sequences.

### Code

```python
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    num_set = set(nums)
    max_length = 0

    for num in num_set:
        # Only start counting if num is the start of a sequence
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_length = 1

            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_length += 1

            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)

    return max_length
```

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Set:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Iteration Through the Set:** O(n), since in the worst case, each element is checked and each sequence is counted once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to storing the elements in a set.

### Summary

- Convert the list to a set for quick look-ups.
- Check each element to see if it could be the start of a sequence.
- Count the length of the sequence starting from such an element.
- Track and return the maximum sequence length found.
