title:  Process Tasks Using Servers-out
permalink: /s1882
---

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. `servers[i]` is the weight of the i-th server, and `tasks[j]` is the time needed to process the j-th task in seconds.

Tasks are assigned to servers using the following rules:
1. Each task can only be assigned to one server that is available at the time processing starts.
2. Each server can only process one task at a time.
3. Multiple tasks can start processing at the same time if there are enough available servers.
4. If there are multiple servers available, assign the task to the server with the smallest weight.
5. If there are multiple servers with the smallest weight, use the server with the smallest index.
6. Assign task `j` starting at `time t = j` assuming zero-based indexing.

Return an array `result` of length `m` where `result[j]` is the index of the server assigned to the j-th task.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can tasks be processed simultaneously if there are enough servers?
   - Yes, tasks can be processed simultaneously if there are enough servers.
2. Are all provided servers unique in terms of weight?
   - No, multiple servers can have the same weight; in such cases, use the smallest index.

### Strategy

1. Use two heaps:
   - One for available servers sorted by weight, then index.
   - One for busy servers sorted by the time when they become free.

2. Iterate over each task and perform the following steps:
   - Release servers from the busy heap whose processing time is less than or equal to the current time.
   - If no servers are available, pop the earliest free server from the busy heap.
   - If servers are available, assign the task to the server with the smallest weight and index.
   - Push the newly busy server into the busy heap with the time it will be free.
3. Store each task's server assignment in the result list.

### Time Complexity

- Assigning each task involves pushing and popping from heaps, each operation takes \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of servers.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \log n)\), where \(m\) is the number of tasks.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def assignTasks(servers, tasks):
    available_heap = [(servers[i], i) for i in range(len(servers))]
    heapq.heapify(available_heap)
    
    busy_heap = []
    result = []

    current_time = 0
    
    for task_index, task_duration in enumerate(tasks):
        current_time = max(current_time, task_index)
        
        while busy_heap and busy_heap[0][0] <= current_time:
            _, weight, index = heapq.heappop(busy_heap)
            heapq.heappush(available_heap, (weight, index))
        
        if available_heap:
            weight, index = heapq.heappop(available_heap)
        else:
            current_time = busy_heap[0][0]
            while busy_heap and busy_heap[0][0] <= current_time:
                _, weight, index = heapq.heappop(busy_heap)
                heapq.heappush(available_heap, (weight, index))
            weight, index = heapq.heappop(available_heap)
        
        result.append(index)
        heapq.heappush(busy_heap, (current_time + task_duration, weight, index))
        
        current_time += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
servers = [3, 3, 2]
tasks = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2]
print(assignTasks(servers, tasks))  # Output: [2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2]
```

### Explanation
1. **Creating Heaps:** An `available_heap` is initialized with server weights and indices. The `busy_heap` keeps track of when servers will be free.
2. **Assigning Tasks:**
   - For each task, check if there are servers in the `busy_heap` that have become available.
   - Assign the task to the minimum weight (and index) server.
   - Move the server to the `busy_heap` with the time it will be free.
3. **Return the Results:** The `result` list is populated with indices of servers assigned to each task.
