title:  Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums-out
permalink: /s1508
---

Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers, you will have to return the sum of all subarray sums between indexes left and right (inclusive). Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: All subarray sums are listed in the following table:
```

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| **Subarray** | **Sum** |
| [1] | 1 |
| [2] | 2 |
| [3] | 3 |
| [4] | 4 |
| [1,2] | 3 |
| [2,3] | 5 |
| [3,4] | 7 |
| [1,2,3] | 6 |
| [2,3,4] | 9 |
| [1,2,3,4] | 10 |

After sorting the sums we get [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of 1st to 5th sums is 1+2+3+3+4=13.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are we guaranteed that `nums` contains only positive integers?
   - Yes.
2. Can `n` be inferred from the length of `nums`?
   - Yes.
3. Should we handle edge cases where `left` and `right` are outside the valid range?
   - We assume `left` and `right` are always within the valid range.
4. What value should be used for the modulo operation?
   - It should be 10^9 + 7.

## Strategy

1. Compute all possible subarray sums.
2. Store these sums in a list.
3. Sort the list of sums.
4. Retrieve sums from the `left` to `right` indices.
5. Calculate the sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```python
def rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    subarray_sums = []

    # Compute all possible subarray sums
    for start in range(n):
        current_sum = 0
        for end in range(start, n):
            current_sum += nums[end]
            subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    # Sort the list of sums
    subarray_sums.sort()
    
    # Sum the values from `left` to `right` (1-indexed to 0-indexed)
    result = sum(subarray_sums[left-1:right]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Test example
print(rangeSum([1,2,3,4], 4, 1, 5))  # Output: 13
```

## Time Complexity

- **Computing Subarray Sums:** This takes \(O(n^2)\) because for each starting point, we iterate through the remainder of the array.
- **Sorting Subarray Sums:** Given there are \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) subarray sums, sorting takes \(O((n^2) \log(n^2)) = O(n^2 \log n)\).
- **Sum for Range:** This summing operation takes \(O(right - left + 1)\), which is essentially linear.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: **O(n^2 log n)**.
