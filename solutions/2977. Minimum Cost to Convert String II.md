title:  Minimum Cost to Convert String II-out
permalink: /s2977
---

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length consisting of lowercase English letters. You want to convert string `s1` into string `s2` with the minimum cost. You are allowed to perform the following operations:

1. **Insert a character** for a cost of 1.
2. **Delete a character** for a cost of 1.
3. **Replace a character** for a cost of 1.

Determine the minimum cost required to convert `s1` into `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Lengths of Strings**: Are both strings guaranteed to have the same length?
2. **Allowed Operations**: Are we allowed to perform multiple operations on the same character?
3. **Output**: Should the output be just the minimum cost as an integer?

Assuming the strings are the same length and the operations are allowed as described above, the problem can be approached as a form of transformation where each step has a fixed cost.

### Strategy

The problem is essentially asking for the minimum edit distance between two strings, where each operation (insert, delete, replace) has a unit cost of 1. This can be solved efficiently using Dynamic Programming (DP).

We'll create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to convert the first `i` characters of `s1` to the first `j` characters of `s2`. Here is the strategy:

1. **Initialize DP Table**: Create a (len(s1) + 1) x (len(s2) + 1) table.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - Converting an empty string to `s2` will require `len(s2)` insertions.
   - Converting `s1` to an empty string will require `len(s1)` deletions.
3. **DP Transition**:
   - If the characters match (`s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`), then no cost is incurred, and `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - Otherwise, consider the minimum cost of inserting, deleting, or replacing:
     - Insertion: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1`
     - Deletion: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1`
     - Replacement: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`

We'll iterate through the table filling it up according to the above rules, and the value at `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]` will give us the required minimum cost.

### Code

```python
def min_cost_to_convert(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Base cases
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = i  # Deleting all characters from s1
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = j  # Inserting all characters to s1

    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]  # Characters match, no cost
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(
                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1,  # Insert
                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1,  # Delete
                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1  # Replace
                )
    
    return dp[m][n]

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s1 = "abc"
    s2 = "yabd"
    print(min_cost_to_convert(s1, s2))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`. This is because we need to fill an `m x n` DP table.

The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the storage requirement for the DP table.
