title:  Minimum Sideway Jumps-out
permalink: /s1824
---

The classic video game "Frogger" involves a frog jumping from lane to lane to avoid traffic and obstacles. This problem is inspired by it. Given a frog starting at the middle lane of a three-lane road, the frog can move forward or sideways:

- Forward by 1, without changing the lane.
- Sideways to an adjacent lane, incurring a "sideway jump" cost.

Given an array `obstacles` where `obstacles[i]` is the lane (1-indexed) where there is an obstacle at position `i`, return the minimum number of sideways jumps the frog needs to reach the end of the road (from position 0 to `len(obstacles) - 1`).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the obstacles array?
     - *Typically, constraints will be provided, such as `1 <= len(obstacles) <= 10^5`.*

2. **Obstacle Representation:**
   - Is there always at least one lane that is free of obstacles at every position?
     - *This is typically assumed to ensure the problem has a valid solution.*

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The frog starts from lane 2 (1-indexed), at position 0.

### Code

Below is the implementation of the solution:

```python
def minSideJumps(obstacles):
    n = len(obstacles)
    # Initialize positions in lanes: infinite jumps needed initially
    dp = [float('inf')] * 3
    dp[1] = 0  # Starting at lane 2, which is index 1 in the 0-indexed dp array
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Step 1: Move forward in the same lane if no obstacle
        for lane in range(3):
            if obstacles[i] != lane + 1:
                dp[lane] = dp[lane]
            else:
                dp[lane] = float('inf')
        
        # Step 2: Check for sideway jumps
        min_jumps = min(dp)
        for lane in range(3):
            if obstacles[i] != lane + 1:
                dp[lane] = min(dp[lane], min_jumps + 1)

    return min(dp)

# Example Usage:
# obstacles = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]
# print(minSideJumps(obstacles)) # Output: 2
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of jumps needed to reach lane `i` at the current position.
   - Initialize the DP array with infinity (`float('inf')`) indicating high cost except for the starting lane (index `1` or lane `2`), which is set to `0`.

2. **Traversal:**
   - Traverse through each position of the `obstacles` array.
   - **Forward Movement:** For each lane, if there is no obstacle in the current position, retain the current minimum jumps.
   - **Sideway Movement:** If an obstacle exists in the current lane, set the jumps for this lane to infinity to indicate it's blocked.
   - **Cost Calculation:** For each lane that is not blocked, update the minimum jumps considering potential sideway jumps from other lanes.

3. **Final Result:**
   - After processing all positions in `obstacles`, return the minimum value among the DP array's three lanes, which represents the minimal sideway jumps needed to reach the end.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The implementation processes each position in the `obstacles` array in constant time operations, leading to a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `obstacles` array.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` because we use a fixed-size array of length 3 to maintain the minimum jumps for each lane at any position.
