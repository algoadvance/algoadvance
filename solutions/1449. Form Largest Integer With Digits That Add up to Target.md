title:  Form Largest Integer With Digits That Add up to Target-out
permalink: /s1449

Given an array of integers `cost` and an integer `target`, return the largest integer you can form with digits having a sum of `target`. The integer `cost[i]` represents the cost of the digit (i+1) (i.e., `cost[0]` is the cost for digit 1, `cost[1]` is the cost for digit 2, etc.). You can use digits as many times as you want. If you cannot form any integer that has a sum of `target`, return "0".

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - `cost` array length (number of digits' costs) can be between 1 and 9 (inclusive).
   - Each `cost[i]` is a positive integer less than or equal to 5000.
   - `target` is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).

2. **Output Expectations**:
   - Return the *string representation* of the largest number possible.
   - If no combination adds up to the `target`, return "0".

3. **Example**:
   - Input: `cost = [4,3,2,5,6,7,2,5,5]`, `target = 9`
   - Output: "7772"

Let's write the solution to this problem systematically.

### Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[t]` represents the largest integer we can form with a sum `t`.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to an empty string because no digits are needed to form the sum 0.
   - For each target from 1 to `target`, and for each digit from 1 to 9, update the `dp` array to reflect the largest possible number at each step.
   - Iterate over all possible sub-targets and update them with the largest possible number.
   - At the end, `dp[target]` will contain the largest number possible or remain an empty string if no number can be formed.

2. **Digit Evaluation**:
   - Check each digit from largest to smallest to prioritize larger digits in the final number combination.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If it's impossible to form the `target`, `dp[target]` will be an empty string and we should return "0".

### Code Implementation:
```python
def largestNumber(cost, target):
    dp = [''] * (target + 1)

    for t in range(1, target + 1):
        for i in range(9):
            if t >= cost[i] and dp[t - cost[i]] is not None:
                candidate = dp[t - cost[i]] + str(i + 1)
                if (len(candidate) > len(dp[t])) or (len(candidate) == len(dp[t]) and candidate > dp[t]):
                    dp[t] = candidate

    return dp[target] if dp[target] else "0"

# Example usage:
cost = [4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 5, 5]
target = 9
print(largestNumber(cost, target))  # Output: "7772"
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(9 \times \text{target})\) where 9 is the fixed length of the digit costs.
  - We iterate over each sub-target up to `target` and for each, we check up to 9 digits.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\text{target})\) for the `dp` array which stores the largest number for each sub-target sum.

This solution ensures we build the largest number in an efficient manner while satisfying the constraints.
