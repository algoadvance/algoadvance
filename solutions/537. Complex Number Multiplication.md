Given two strings representing two complex numbers, you need to return a string representing their product. The complex numbers are in the form "a+bi" where `a` and `b` are integers, and `i` is the imaginary unit.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Are the inputs guaranteed to be valid complex numbers in the specified format without spaces?
    - Yes, inputs are guaranteed to be in the format "a+bi".
  
2. **Output Format**: Should the output also be formatted as "a+bi"?
    - Yes, the output should be in the same "a+bi" format.

3. **Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints on the values of `a` and `b`? 
    - No specific constraints as long as `a` and `b` are integers.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. **Parsing the Input**: Extract the real and imaginary parts from the input strings.
2. **Complex Number Multiplication**: Recall that if \( z1 = a + bi \) and \( z2 = c + di \), their product is computed as:
    \[
    z1 \times z2 = (a + bi) \times (c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
    \]
3. **Format the Output**: Convert the result back to the string format "a+bi".

### Code
Here's an implementation in Python:

```python
def complexNumberMultiply(num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
    # Helper function to parse the complex number
    def parse_complex(num):
        real, imaginary = num.split('+')
        return int(real), int(imaginary[:-1])  # remove 'i' at the end

    # Parse the complex numbers
    a, b = parse_complex(num1)
    c, d = parse_complex(num2)
    
    # Perform complex number multiplication
    real_part = a * c - b * d
    imag_part = a * d + b * c
    
    # Format the result back to the "a+bi" form
    return f"{real_part}+{imag_part}i"

# Example usage:
num1 = "1+1i"
num2 = "1+1i"
print(complexNumberMultiply(num1, num2))  # Output: "0+2i"
```

### Explanation
- **Parsing**:
    - `parse_complex` splits the input string by '+', converts the real part directly to an integer, and the imaginary part after removing the trailing 'i'.
- **Multiplication**:
    - Uses the formula \( (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i \) to calculate the real and imaginary parts.
- **Formatting**:
    - Formats the result as required by joining the real and imaginary parts with a '+' and an 'i'.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \( O(1) \) because it involves a constant amount of work irrespective of the input size. Parsing, multiplication, and formatting steps are all constant-time operations given the fixed format of the input.
