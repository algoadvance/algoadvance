title:  Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K-out
permalink: /s2294
---

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, partition the array into the minimum number of subarrays such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subarray is at most `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be the result of the function?**
   The function should return an integer representing the minimum number of subarrays required.

2. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
   - `0 <= k <= 10^9`

3. **Are there any constraints on the space complexity?**
   No explicit constraints are given, but we should aim for an efficient solution, ideally linear or near-linear in time complexity.

4. **Are duplicates allowed in the array?**
   Yes, duplicates are allowed.

### Strategy:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the array such that in each subarray, the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most `k`.
   
2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Start by sorting the array. This allows easier partitioning since all elements in each subarray need to be consecutive in the sorted order to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum.

3. **Partitioning:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array and create subarrays based on the condition that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a subarray should be less than or equal to `k`.
   - Maintain a running minimum and maximum for the current subarray. If adding a new element to the current subarray violates the `k` condition, start a new subarray.

### Implementation:

```python
def partitionArray(nums, k):
    # Sort the numbers first
    nums.sort()
    
    count = 1  # At least one partition is needed
    min_val = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums:
        # If the current num - min_val is greater than k, we need a new partition
        if num - min_val > k:
            count += 1
            min_val = num  # Reset the min_val for the new partition
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting the Array:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Iterating through the sorted array:** \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **\(O(n \log n)\)**.

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting the array:** We sort the array to make sure that elements with small differences are together.
2. **Partitioning:** We iterate through the sorted array and keep track of the minimum value in the current partition. If we encounter an element such that the difference between it and the minimum value in the current partition exceeds `k`, we start a new partition and update the minimum value for the new partition.

This approach efficiently partitions the array with minimal subarrays while meeting the given condition.
