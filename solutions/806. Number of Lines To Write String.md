title:  Number of Lines To Write String-out
permalink: /s806
---

You are given a list `widths`, where `widths[0]` is the width of `'a'`, `widths[1]` is the width of `'b'`, and so on up to `widths[25]` which is the width of `'z'`. You are also given a string `S`.

Write a function `numberOfLines(widths, S)` that returns two integers: the number of lines needed to write the string `S` and the width of the last line. The width of each line must not exceed 100 units. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the widths always guaranteed to be positive integers and less than 100?**
   - Yes, each character's width is a positive integer and is reasonably small compared to the line width capacity of 100 units.

2. **Can the input string `S` be empty?**
   - For simplicity, consider that the input string `S` is non-empty.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the total width of the input string can be distributed over multiple lines?**
   - Yes, however, each individual character will always fit within the 100 units constraint.

### Strategy

1. Initialize counters for the number of lines used (`lines`) and the current width of the last line (`current_width`).
2. Iterate through each character in the string `S`.
3. For each character, determine its width using the `widths` list.
4. Check if adding the current character's width to `current_width` will exceed the limit of 100 units.
   - If yes, increment `lines` by 1 and reset `current_width` to the current character’s width.
   - If no, add the character’s width to `current_width`.
5. After processing all characters, return the number of lines used and the width of the last line.

### Code

```python
def numberOfLines(widths, S):
    lines, current_width = 1, 0
    
    for char in S:
        char_width = widths[ord(char) - ord('a')]
        if current_width + char_width > 100:
            lines += 1
            current_width = char_width
        else:
            current_width += char_width
    
    return [lines, current_width]

# Example usage
widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
print(numberOfLines(widths, S))  # Output: [3, 60]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the string `S`. Each character in the string is visited exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The `widths` list is always of constant size 26, and we only use a few additional variables for counting.
