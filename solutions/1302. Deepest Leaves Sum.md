title:  Deepest Leaves Sum-out
permalink: /s1302
---
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of a leaf node?**
    - A leaf node is a node with no children.
   
2. **What should we return if the tree is empty?**
    - If the tree is empty, the sum should be `0`.

3. **Can the values in the tree be negative?**
    - Yes, the node values can be negative.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can perform a level order traversal (BFS) to determine the sum of the values at the deepest level:
1. Use a queue to facilitate level order traversal.
2. Track the sum of node values at the current level.
3. Proceed until the queue is empty, updating the sum only for the deepest level.
4. At the end of traversal, the accumulated sum will be the sum of the deepest leaves.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def deepestLeavesSum(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque([root])
    current_level_sum = 0
    
    while queue:
        current_level_sum = 0
        level_size = len(queue)
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level_sum += node.val
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
                
    return current_level_sum
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)` where `m` is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the binary tree (i.e., the maximum width of the tree), due to the space needed for the queue used in BFS.

This BFS approach ensures that we correctly accumulate the sum of the deepest level nodes by processing every level of the tree in sequence, so the last processed level's sum will be the sum of the deepest leaves.
