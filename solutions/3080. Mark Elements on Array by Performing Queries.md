title:  Mark Elements on Array by Performing Queries-out
permalink: /s3080
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an array of queries `queries` where `queries[i] = [value, index]`.

For each query, `value` is added to `nums[index]`. After performing each query, you need to find the number of distinct integers in the updated `nums`.

Implement a function `distinctElements(nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]` that returns a list indicating the number of distinct integers after each query.


### Clarifying Questions

Before solving the problem, it's essential to have a clear understanding. Listed here are some potential clarifying questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum limits for `nums` and `queries`?
   - Can `value` be negative?

2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the resulting list of counts be the same length as the queries list?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the result if `nums` is empty and there are multiple queries?
   - What happens if there are no queries (i.e., an empty `queries` array)?

Given the typical complexity and constraints, we'll assume that:
- `nums` and `queries` will have a reasonable size for computation.
- Values can be negative, affecting the total sum but not the distinct count logic.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Initialize a set to keep track of the distinct elements in `nums`.

2. **Processing each Query:**
   - For each query `[value, index]`:
     - Update the element at `nums[index]` by adding `value`.
     - Update the distinct elements set with this new value.
     - Add the count of distinct elements to the result list.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Using a set ensures that each insert and check operation is O(1) on average.
   - Iterating through the queries is O(q), where q is the number of queries.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
from typing import List

def distinctElements(nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    # Initialize a set for keeping track of distinct elements
    distinct_set = set(nums)
    results = []
    
    # Process each query
    for value, index in queries:
        # Before changing the element, remove the old one if it is not duplicated
        old_value = nums[index]
        if old_value in distinct_set:
            nums[index] += value
            new_value = nums[index]
            
            # Check the old value appear count
            if nums.count(old_value) == 1 and old_value != new_value:
                distinct_set.remove(old_value)
        
        # Add the new value into the set
        distinct_set.add(new_value)
        
        # Get the distinct count
        results.append(len(distinct_set))
    
    return results

# Example Usage:
# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# queries = [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2]]
# Output: [3, 3, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Setup:** O(n) to populate the initial set of distinct elements from `nums`.
- **Processing each Query:**
  - **Update Element:** O(1) to update the element at `nums[index]`.
  - **Set Operations:** O(1) average time to remove and add elements from/to the set.

Thus, the overall time complexity for processing `q` queries is **O(n + q)**.

### Edge Cases

- If `nums` is empty initially, the results list should be filled with zeros.
- If `queries` is empty, the result should directly be an empty list.
- If adding `value` to `nums[index]` results in the same distinct counts, the count in results will not change.

This approach ensures efficient handling with clear logic and optimized performance within the constraints of the problem description.
