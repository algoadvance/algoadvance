title:  How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number-out
permalink: /s1365
---

Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. This behavior needs to be applied for every element in the array. Return the answer in an array.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there are four numbers smaller than it: [1,2,2,3]. 
For nums[1]=1 there are zero numbers smaller than it.
For nums[2]=2 there is one number smaller than it: [1]. 
For nums[3]=2 there is one number smaller than it: [1].
For nums[4]=3 there are three numbers smaller than it: [1,2,2].
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
```

**Example 3:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the array or the values in the array?**
    - Yes, typically the constraints are:
      - `2 <= nums.length <= 500`
      - `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

2. **Do we need to handle any edge cases like empty arrays or non-integer inputs?**
    - According to the constraints, we donâ€™t need to handle empty arrays, and all inputs will be integers.

3. **What is the desired time complexity for an optimal solution?**
    - A brute-force approach would be O(n^2), but we should aim for a more efficient solution, ideally O(n log n) or O(n).

### Strategy
1. **Brute-force Solution:**
   - For each element in the array, count how many elements are smaller than it.
   - Time Complexity: O(n^2)
   
2. **Optimized Approach with Sorting:**
   - Sort the array and use a dictionary to keep track of the number of elements smaller than the current element as we iterate through the sorted array.
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)

### Python Code
Here's an optimized approach using sorting and a dictionary to achieve a better time complexity.

```python
def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    
    # Step 2: Create a dictionary to record the count of smaller numbers
    count_dict = {}
    
    # Step 3: Populate the count_dict
    for i, num in enumerate(sorted_nums):
        if num not in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] = i
            
    # Step 4: Build the result array using the count_dict
    result = [count_dict[num] for num in nums]
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(smallerNumbersThanCurrent([8,1,2,2,3]))  # Output: [4, 0, 1, 1, 3]
print(smallerNumbersThanCurrent([6,5,4,8]))  # Output: [2, 1, 0, 3]
print(smallerNumbersThanCurrent([7,7,7,7]))  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`
- **Populating Dictionary:** `O(n)` where n is the length of the array.
- **Building Result Array:** `O(n)`

Overall time complexity: **O(n log n)**

### Space Complexity
- **Auxiliary Space for Dictionary:** `O(n)`
- **Auxiliary Space for Sorted Array:** `O(n)`

Overall space complexity: **O(n)**
