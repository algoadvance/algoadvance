title:  Substring with Concatenation of All Words-out
permalink: /s30
---

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings in `words` are of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at indices 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarfooman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
Output: [6,9,12]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all words in `words` guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement.

2. **Can the input `words` list be empty?**
   - No, it is assumed that `words` contains at least one word.

3. **What should be returned if no valid substring is found?**
   - An empty list should be returned in this case.

4. **Is the order of indices in the output important?**
   - No, the order of indices in the output does not matter.

## Strategy

The key observations are:
1. Each word has the same length.
2. We are looking for concatenations of all words exactly once.

So, the length of each valid substring is `word_length * len(words)`, which we'll call `substr_length`.

We can use a sliding window of size `substr_length` moving from the beginning of the string `s` to `len(s) - substr_length + 1`. For each window's starting position, we'll check if the substring can be reconstructed by concatenating each word in `words`.

## Code

Here is the suggested implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def findSubstring(s, words):
    if not s or not words:
        return []

    word_length = len(words[0])
    num_words = len(words)
    substr_length = word_length * num_words
    word_count = Counter(words)
    result_indices = []

    for i in range(len(s) - substr_length + 1):
        seen_words = Counter()
        for j in range(num_words):
            word_start = i + j * word_length
            word = s[word_start:word_start + word_length]
            if word in word_count:
                seen_words[word] += 1
                if seen_words[word] > word_count[word]:
                    break
            else:
                break
        else:
            # All words matched correctly.
            result_indices.append(i)
            
    return result_indices

# Example usage:
print(findSubstring("barfoothefoobarman", ["foo", "bar"]))  # Output: [0, 9]
print(findSubstring("wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", ["word", "good", "best", "word"]))  # Output: []
print(findSubstring("barfoofoobarthefoobarfooman", ["bar", "foo", "the"]))  # Output: [6, 9, 12]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Compute Word Counts:** O(m) where `m` is the length of `words`.
- **Sliding Window Traverse:** O((n - m*k) * k) where `n` is the length of `s` and `k` is the length of each word.

Combining these:
- Overall Time Complexity: O(n * k) where `n` is the length of `s` and `k` is the word length, since `m*k` is effectively limited by `n`.

This approach ensures we efficiently identify all starting indices of valid substrings.
