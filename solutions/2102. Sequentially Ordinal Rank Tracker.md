Leetcode Problem 2102: **Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker**

Design a system that manages the sequentially ordinal rank of the players in a game.

A player's rank is based on their highest score. To participate in the game, each player gets a unique `nickname`. A player's rank is defined as:
- `1`st rank: player with the highest score,
- `2`nd rank: player with the second highest score, and so on.

Tie scores should be ranked by the player's dictionary order of their `nickname`.

Implement the `SORTracker` class:
- `SORTracker()`: Initializes the tracker object.
- `add(name: str, score: int)`: Adds a new player with `nickname` `name` and `score` `score` to the tracker.
- `get() -> str`: Returns the nickname of the player at the `k`-th highest rank, where `k` is the number of times the `get` function has been called (starting at 1).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Ties**: If two players have the same score, we rank them by their nickname in dictionary order (lexicographically).
2. **Initialization**: The object will be initialized without any parameters.
3. **Number of Players**: No explicit constraint on the number of players or `add` and `get` operations, but they should be efficient.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
    - Use a max-heap to store the players by their scores and nicknames (since heapq in Python is a min-heap, we'll store negative scores to simulate a max-heap).
    - Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of times `get` has been called.

2. **Operations**:
    - `add(name, score)`: Push the player onto the heap.
    - `get()`: Pop the top element from the heap `k` times to get the `k`-th highest rank player. (We need to store popped elements to maintain state for future calls).

## Code

```python
import heapq

class SORTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.min_heap = []
        self.max_index = 0

    def add(self, name: str, score: int):
        # Use negative to use min-heap as max-heap
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, (-score, name))
        
    def get(self) -> str:
        self.max_index += 1
        # Create a temporary list to store max_index pops
        temp_list = []
        
        # Pop elements max_index times
        for _ in range(self.max_index):
            temp_list.append(heapq.heappop(self.min_heap))
            
        # Store the k-th highest element
        kth_highest = temp_list[-1]
        
        # Push all elements back to min-heap
        for elem in temp_list:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, elem)
        
        return kth_highest[1]
```

## Time Complexity

- **add(name, score)**: The time complexity is `O(log n)`, as we are using a heap to insert the new player.
- **get()**: The time complexity is `O(k * log n)` for retrieving the `k`-th highest rank player, where `k` is the number of times `get()` has been called.

Note: This approach can be optimized to avoid the `k * log n` complexity in the `get` method using more sophisticated data structures, like maintaining both a min-heap and a max-heap to keep order efficiently.
