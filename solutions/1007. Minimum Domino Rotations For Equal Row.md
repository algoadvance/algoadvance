title:  Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row-out
permalink: /s1007
---
You are given two lists of integers `tops` and `bottoms` representing the top and bottom halves of dominoes. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half, i.e., it looks like | top | bottom |). You can choose one of the numbers (top or bottom) at every index and rotate the domino so that the desired number is on top. Write a function that returns the minimum number of rotations needed so that all numbers in the `tops` list are the same, or all numbers in the `bottoms` list are the same.

If it's not possible to make all the numbers in one of the lists the same, return -1.

### Example 1:
```
Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first 2 rotations swap the 1st and 2nd dominoes to get tops = [2,2,2,2,2,2], or bottoms = [2,2,2,2,2,2].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: tops = [3,5,1,2,3], bottoms = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
It's not possible to have all the numbers in tops or bottoms the same.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the values in `tops` and `bottoms` always between 1 and 6?
   **A:** Yes, they are always valid domino values between 1 and 6.
   
2. **Q:** Can the lists have different lengths?
   **A:** No, `tops` and `bottoms` always have the same length.

3. **Q:** What will be the constraint on the length of the lists?
   **A:** The length of the lists will be between 1 and 2 * $10^4$.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, a strategy is:
1. We need to check if we can make all elements in `tops` equal to either `tops[0]` or `bottoms[0]`, or make all elements in `bottoms` equal to either `tops[0]` or `bottoms[0]`.
2. For each of these four checks, calculate the minimum rotations required. If it's not possible for a particular check, count the rotations as infinity or discard it.
3. Return the minimum number of rotations among these checks. If none of them are valid, return -1.

### Code
```python
def minDominoRotations(tops, bottoms):
    def check(x):
        rotations_top = rotations_bottom = 0
        for i in range(len(tops)):
            if tops[i] != x and bottoms[i] != x:
                return float('inf')
            elif tops[i] != x:
                rotations_top += 1
            elif bottoms[i] != x:
                rotations_bottom += 1
        return min(rotations_top, rotations_bottom)
    
    rotations = min(check(tops[0]), check(bottoms[0]))
    
    return rotations if rotations != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage:
tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2]
bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
print(minDominoRotations(tops, bottoms))  # Output: 2

tops = [3,5,1,2,3]
bottoms = [3,6,3,3,4]
print(minDominoRotations(tops, bottoms))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the inputs `tops` and `bottoms`. We are making a single pass through the lists for each of the four possible targets.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because the additional space used by the algorithm does not depend on the size of the input lists.
