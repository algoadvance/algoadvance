title:  Replace Words-out
permalink: /s648
---

You are given a list of strings `dictionary` where each string is a word, and a string `sentence` containing words separated by spaces. You want to replace all the words in the sentence with the root form of the words found in the dictionary. 

If a word has multiple roots in the dictionary, replace it with the shortest one. 

Return the sentence with the words replaced.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: dictionary = ["cat", "bat", "rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: dictionary = ["a", "b", "c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"], sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"
Output: "a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"
```

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100`
- `dictionary[i]` and `sentence` consist of only lowercase letters and spaces.
- The sentence has no leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in the sentence are separated by a single space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can a word appear more than once in the sentence?
   - Yes, and it should be replaced every time it appears.
2. Should we handle punctuation or special characters?
   - No, assume the input is always clean and consists only of lowercase letters and spaces.
3. Is the dictionary case-sensitive?
   - Yes, everything is in lowercase.

### Strategy
1. **Trie Data Structure**: Build a Trie from the dictionary to facilitate quick prefix search.
2. **Tokenize Sentence**: Split the sentence into words.
3. **Replace Words**: For each word in the sentence, find the shortest root in the Trie.
4. **Rebuild Sentence**: After replacement, join the words to form the final sentence.

### Code

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_word = True
    
    def search_root(self, word):
        node = self.root
        root = ""
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return word
            node = node.children[char]
            root += char
            if node.is_word:
                return root
        return word

def replaceWords(dictionary, sentence):
    trie = Trie()
    for word in dictionary:
        trie.insert(word)
    
    words = sentence.split()
    replaced_sentence = []
    for word in words:
        replaced_sentence.append(trie.search_root(word))
    
    return " ".join(replaced_sentence)

# Example usage:
dictionary = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
print(replaceWords(dictionary, sentence))  # Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Trie Construction**: Inserting each dictionary word into the Trie. For `n` words each of maximum length `l`, this is `O(n * l)`.
2. **Replacement Search**: For each word in the sentence, finding the root using Trie traversal. If `m` words in the sentence, each of max length `l`, this is `O(m * l)`.
3. **Total Time Complexity**: `O(n * l + m * l)`, where `n` is the size of the dictionary, `m` is the number of words in the sentence, and `l` is the average length of the words.
