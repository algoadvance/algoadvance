title:  Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s1287
---

Given an integer array `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that appears more than 25% of the time. Return that integer.

### Example:
- Input: `arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]`
- Output: `6`

### Constraints:
- 1 <= `arr.length` <= 10^4
- 0 <= `arr[i]` <= 10^5

---

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if the array is empty?**
   - According to the constraints, the array will always contain at least one element.
   
2. **Are there any other constraints or edge cases to consider?**
   - Only one element will appear more than 25% of the time in the array.
   - The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Strategy

Given that the array is sorted:
1. **Determine the Threshold Count:** The threshold count for an element to appear more than 25% of the time is calculated by `len(arr) // 4`.
2. **Frequency Counting:** Iterate through the array to count the frequency of each element. If an element's frequency exceeds the threshold, return that element immediately.

An effective approach in a sorted array is to leverage the fact that elements will cluster together. Thus:
- Traverse the array, comparing each element to the previous one.
- Keep a count of the current element's occurrences.
- If the count reaches the `threshold + 1`, return that element immediately.

This approach ensures a single pass through the array, making it efficient.

## Code

```python
def findSpecialInteger(arr):
    threshold = len(arr) // 4
    current_element = arr[0]
    count = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == current_element:
            count += 1
        else:
            current_element = arr[i]
            count = 1
        
        if count > threshold:
            return current_element
    
    return current_element  # Should never be reached given problem constraints

# Example Test
arr = [1, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 10]
print(findSpecialInteger(arr))  # Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array `arr`. This is because it involves a single pass through the array to count the frequency of each element.

- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. The variables `threshold`, `current_element`, and `count` are used to maintain state as we iterate through the array.
