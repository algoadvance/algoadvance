title:  Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array-out
permalink: /s2176
---

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`, such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `(i * j)` is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `n`?
     - Typically, n could be any size within [1, 1000] based on similar problems, but the exact constraints should be checked.
   - What is the range of integers in the `nums` array?
     - Usually, it could be any integers within [1, 10^6], but again, verify from problem constraints.
   - Could there be negative integers in the `nums` array?
     - This typically shouldn't happen based on standard constraints, unless specified.

2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a single integer, which is the count of valid pairs `(i, j)`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Small arrays, where n = 1 or 2.
   - Values of `k` that are larger than the length of the array.
   - Arrays with distinct elements where no pair is equal.

### Strategy:

1. **Brute Force:**
   - Iterate through every possible pair `(i, j)` with `0 <= i < j < n`.
   - Check if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.
   - Check if `(i * j) % k == 0`.
   - Increment the count if both conditions are met.

2. **Optimization Insight:**
   - A brute force approach might be acceptable given the constraints, especially if `n` is relatively small (under a few thousand).
   - However, as an extra step, we might consider pre-checking for pairs based on `nums` values reducing unnecessary multiplicative checks.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Iterate through all pairs and apply the stated conditions.
   - Maintain a count of valid pairs.

### Code:

```python
def countPairs(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0

    # Iterate through every pair (i, j) with 0 <= i < j < n
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[i] == nums[j] and (i * j) % k == 0:
                count += 1

    return count

# Example usage
nums = [3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3]
k = 2
print(countPairs(nums, k))  # Output should be based on problem description
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Brute Force Approach:** 
  - The time complexity of the above solution is \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops iterating through all pairs.
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\), as we are only using a few additional variables.
  
Given the constraints typically provided in such problems, \(O(n^2)\) should be efficient enough for \(n \leq 1000\). However, if \(n\) is significantly larger, alternative strategies might be required.
