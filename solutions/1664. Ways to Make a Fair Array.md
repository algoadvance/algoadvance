title:  Ways to Make a Fair Array-out
permalink: /s1664
---
Given an integer array `nums`, you want to make the array fair. To make the array fair, you can remove exactly one element from `nums`. An array is fair if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.

Return the number of indices you could remove from the array to make it fair.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if the `nums` array is empty? (Not applicable as per problem constraints)
   - What if the `nums` array has only one element? (After removing that element the array will be empty; the fair condition will be inherently satisfied)

2. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `nums` length? Typically constraints are given in problems to guide the approach. (Usually between 1 to \(10^5\))
   - What are the possible values in `nums`? (Usually integers; sometimes constraints are given for range)

Let's proceed with the problem assuming reasonable constraints typical for LeetCode problems.

### Strategy
To find the number of indices that when removed will make the array fair, we can follow these steps:

1. **Pre-computation:**
   - Compute prefix sums for both even and odd indexed values in the array. 
   - Compute suffix sums for both even and odd indexed values in the array. 

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each index \(i\):
     - Compute the sum of even indexed numbers excluding the index \(i\).
     - Compute the sum of odd indexed numbers excluding the index \(i\).
     - Check if these sums are equal.

3. **Count valid indices:**
   - Count how many such indices meet the fair array condition when that element is removed.

### Code
Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def waysToMakeFair(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Total sums for even and odd indexed elements
    total_even_sum = 0
    total_odd_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total_even_sum += nums[i]
        else:
            total_odd_sum += nums[i]
    
    fair_count = 0
    even_sum = 0
    odd_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total_even_sum -= nums[i]
        else:
            total_odd_sum -= nums[i]
        
        # If removing nums[i], check if the remaining array is fair
        if even_sum + total_odd_sum == odd_sum + total_even_sum:
            fair_count += 1
        
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += nums[i]
        else:
            odd_sum += nums[i]
    
    return fair_count

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 1, 6, 4]
print(waysToMakeFair(nums))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Pre-computation:** The prefix sums computation is \(O(n)\) as we traverse the list once.
- **Iteration and checking:** We again traverse the list once, making the complexity for this part \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(n)\). The space complexity is also \(O(1)\), since we are using a fixed number of extra variables irrespective of the input size.
