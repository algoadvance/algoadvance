title:  Add Edges to Make Degrees of All Nodes Even-out
permalink: /s2508
---

You are given an undirected graph represented by a list `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. You are to add at most two additional edges to the graph such that all the nodes in the resultant graph have even degrees.

Return `True` if it is possible to achieve this, otherwise `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of nodes in the graph?**
   - The nodes are labeled from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the number of nodes.

2. **Are the given edges guaranteed to contain no duplicates and no self-loops?**
   - Yes, each edge is unique and does not connect a node to itself.

3. **Can the graph be disconnected initially?**
   - Yes, the graph can be disconnected initially.

4. **What is the maximum number of nodes in the graph?**
   - The problem statement may specify a limit, but usually, constraints ensure `n` is reasonably large but manageable within typical computational limits for this problem.

### Strategy

1. **Determine Initial Degrees:**
   - Calculate the degree (number of connections) of each node.

2. **Identify Odd-Degree Nodes:**
   - Gather all nodes with an odd degree.

3. **Determine Feasibility:**
   - If there are no nodes with odd degrees, return `True`.
   - If there are exactly 2 nodes with odd degrees, check if we can add an edge between them or if they can connect to even-degree nodes to make their degrees even.
   - If there are exactly 4 nodes with odd degrees, check for specific pairs or possible connections ensuring each can be evened out.
   - Any other number of odd-degree nodes greater than 4 makes it impossible to resolve by adding at most two edges.

### Code

```python
def canMakeAllDegreesEven(n, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Calculate node degrees
    degree = defaultdict(int)
    for u, v in edges:
        degree[u] += 1
        degree[v] += 1
    
    # Step 2: Identify nodes with odd degrees
    odd_degree_nodes = [node for node, deg in degree.items() if deg % 2 != 0]
    
    # Base checks
    if len(odd_degree_nodes) == 0:
        return True
    if len(odd_degree_nodes) > 4 or len(odd_degree_nodes) % 2 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Helper set to speed up existence checks
    edge_set = set((min(u, v), max(u, v)) for u, v in edges)
    
    def can_add(a, b):
        return (min(a, b), max(a, b)) not in edge_set

    # If there are two odd degree nodes, they must be made even by connecting each other
    if len(odd_degree_nodes) == 2:
        u, v = odd_degree_nodes
        return can_add(u, v) or any(can_add(u, x) and can_add(v, x) for x in range(1, n+1) if x != u and x != v)
    
    # If there are four odd degree nodes, we must match pairs
    if len(odd_degree_nodes) == 4:
        u, v, w, x = odd_degree_nodes
        return (can_add(u, v) and can_add(w, x)) or \
               (can_add(u, w) and can_add(v, x)) or \
               (can_add(u, x) and can_add(v, w))
    
    return False
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Degree Calculation:**
   - O(E), where E is the number of edges.

2. **Identify Odd Nodes:**
   - O(N), where N is the number of nodes.

3. **Edge Existence Check:**
   - Implemented using a set for quick lookup, which is essentially O(1) per check.

Overall, the time complexity is approximately O(E + N). Given typical graph problems, this is efficient and manageable within standard limits.
