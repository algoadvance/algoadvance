A magical string `S` consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

The string is initially "122". After the first 3 characters, the next character can be constructed by reading the previous characters in the string and appending the corresponding number of '1's or '2's. The rule to expand `S` is: 

- '1' means append `1` '2' to the string.
- '2' means append `2` '1's to the string.

Given an integer `n`, you need to find the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of the magical string `S`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned if `n` is 0?
    - Return 0 since there are 0 characters to consider.
2. Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?
    - Yes, `1 <= n <= 100000`.

Once these are clear, we can proceed to the solution.

### Strategy

The magical string is constructed following the specified rules. To solve this problem:

1. Start with the initial string "122".
2. Use two pointers: 
   - One (let's call it `pos`) to keep track of where we are reading '1' or '2'.
   - Another to mark the end of the current string, so we know where to append new characters.
3. According to the character at `pos`, append 1 or 2 instances of the next alternating character to the string.
4. Continue this process until the length of the string is at least `n`.
5. Count the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of the string.

### Code

```python
def magicalString(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n <= 3:
        return 1 if n == 1 else 1
    
    s = ['1', '2', '2']
    pos = 2  # The position in the string we're reading to generate new parts.
    
    while len(s) < n:
        next_char = '1' if s[-1] == '2' else '2'
        count = int(s[pos])
        s.extend([next_char] * count)
        pos += 1
    
    return s[:n].count('1')

# Example usage:
n = 6
print(magicalString(n))  # should output 3, corresponding to the first 6 characters "122112"
```

### Time Complexity

- The while loop runs until the length of `s` reaches `n`, thus it has a complexity of `O(n)`.
- Extending the list and counting characters are linear operations themselves.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently construct the magical string and count the required characters within acceptable time limits even for large values of `n`.
