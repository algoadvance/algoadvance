title:  Using a Robot to Print the Lexicographically Smallest String-out
permalink: /s2434
---

You are given a string `s` and a robot that can perform the following operations:

1. Append the first character of the string `s` to the end of the string `result` and remove this first character from `s`. 
2. Append the last character of the string `s` to the end of the string `result` and remove this last character from `s`.

You need to determine the lexicographically smallest string `result` that can be obtained by performing the above operations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the string `s` composed of only lowercase English letters?**
    - Yes, `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
2. **What is the maximum length of `s`?**
    - This problem typically assumes the length is manageable within the constraints of competitive programming, so let's assume it can range into thousands.
3. **Should the function return the result string directly?**
    - Yes, the function should return the resulting smallest lexicographical string.

## Strategy

To get the lexicographically smallest string, our goal is to always make the smallest lexicographical choice as early as possible. 

- We will maintain a result list where we append characters based on the lexicographically smallest decision we can make at each step.
- We can use a two-pointer technique to simulate the choices where one pointer points to the start and the other pointer points to the end of the string `s`.

### Steps:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the string and `right` at the end.
2. Compare the characters at these two pointers. Append the smaller character to the result and adjust the corresponding pointer.
3. Continue this until `left` crosses `right`.

## Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement the strategy in Python:

```python
def lexicographically_smallest_string(s: str) -> str:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    result = []
    
    while left <= right:
        if s[left] < s[right]:
            result.append(s[left])
            left += 1
        elif s[left] > s[right]:
            result.append(s[right])
            right -= 1
        else:
            # When s[left] == s[right], we need to look at subproblems
            sub_left, sub_right = left, right
            while sub_left < sub_right and s[sub_left] == s[sub_right]:
                sub_left += 1
                sub_right -= 1
            
            # Decide on the next character based on deeper comparison
            if sub_left > sub_right or s[sub_left] < s[sub_right]:
                result.append(s[left])
                left += 1
            else:
                result.append(s[right])
                right -= 1
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

## Time Complexity

- Initializing pointers takes O(1).
- The while loop runs until `left` crosses `right`, and in every step, either `left` is incremented or `right` is decremented.
- The character comparison inside the loop is O(1) while navigating subproblems for tie-breaking, the subroutine may take O(n) in the worst case, but it moves the pointers substantially reducing further comparisons.

Overall, the time complexity is amortized O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, because each comparison step reduces the effective problem size significantly.

This approach ensures that we obtain the lexicographically smallest string by always making the optimal choice at each step and efficiently handling tie situations.
