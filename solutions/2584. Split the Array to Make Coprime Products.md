title:  Split the Array to Make Coprime Products-out
permalink: /s2584
---
Given an array of integers `nums`, you need to split the array into two non-empty contiguous subarrays, say `left` and `right`, such that the product of the elements in the subarray `left` and the product of the elements in the subarray `right` are coprime (GCD = 1). Return the number of ways to split the array into such subarrays.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the integers in the array?
   - The integers in the array are positive.
2. What is the size range of the input array?
   - Thereâ€™s no specific range given in the prompt, but typical constraints can be considered for efficient algorithm design (1 <= len(array) <= 10^5).
3. Should the split positions be continuous subarrays?
   - Yes, the problem requires contiguous subarrays.
4. Can there be multiple ways to split? 
   - Yes, the goal is to count all such possible splits.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Precompute the product of elements for subarrays `left` and `right`.
2. Iterate through the array, computing the GCD of products dynamically and check if GCD is 1.
3. For efficiency, maintain running products and use a method to compute GCD efficiently.

## Code Implementation
```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def splitArray(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Compute prefix products
    prefix_product = [1] * n
    suffix_product = [1] * n
    
    prefix_product[0] = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_product[i] = prefix_product[i-1] * nums[i]
        
    suffix_product[-1] = nums[-1]
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        suffix_product[i] = suffix_product[i+1] * nums[i]
    
    # Calculate number of valid splits
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_prod = prefix_product[i-1]
        right_prod = suffix_product[i]
        
        if gcd(left_prod, right_prod) == 1:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage
nums = [4, 7, 8, 15, 3, 5]
print(splitArray(nums))  # Expected output: 1
```

## Explanation
1. **Prefix and Suffix Products:** 
   - We calculate the `prefix_product` array, where `prefix_product[i]` represents the product of all elements from the start of the array up to `i`.
   - Similarly, `suffix_product[i]` represents the product of all elements from `i` to the end of the array.

2. **Iterative Split Check:**
   - We iterate through the array index `i` and split the array into `left` and `right` at each valid position.
   - For each split, we check the GCD of `prefix_product[i-1]` and `suffix_product[i]`.
   - If they are coprime (GCD = 1), it is a valid split.

3. **Count Valid Splits:**
   - We increment our count for each valid split condition satisfied.

## Time Complexity
- **Prefix and Suffix Product Calculation:** O(n)
- **Iteration and GCD Calculation:** O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, making this solution efficient for typical constraints of the problem.

Remember, the provided code ensures we handle the continuous subarray requirement and checks coprimality efficiently using the GCD function from the Python standard library.
