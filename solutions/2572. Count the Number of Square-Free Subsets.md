title:  Count the Number of Square-Free Subsets-out
permalink: /s2572
---

You are given a list of distinct positive integers `nums`. A subset of `nums` is called square-free if the product of its elements is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. In other words, none of the elements of the subset should have a common factor with its product other than 1.

Given `nums`, return the number of square-free subsets.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of `nums`?**
   - This is important to understand potential performance implications.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?**
   - For example, are they guaranteed to fit within a certain range?

3. **Can elements in `nums` be repeated or are they distinct?**
   - This affects whether we need to handle duplicates.

4. **Should the empty subset be counted as a square-free subset?**
   - Clarifies if we need to count the empty subset in the final answer.

Let’s proceed with the assumption that the input list `nums` contains distinct positive integers and its length and value are reasonable enough to handle typical computational limits (e.g., Python's default recursion depth).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use recursion combined with memoization to explore all possible subsets efficiently. For each element, we have two choices: include it in the current subset or exclude it. 

While doing this:
- We check whether including an element violates the square-free condition by keeping track of the product of elements in the subset so far.
- To optimize, prime factorization can help us ensure the product remains square-free.

Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Recursion Base Case:** If we reach the end of the list, check if the current subset is square-free.
2. **Recursive Case:** For each element, include it in the subset and proceed only if the resulting subset remains square-free.

By keeping a memoization table, we can avoid redundant calculations about subsets we have already analyzed.

## Code

Here's a Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from functools import lru_cache
from math import isqrt
from typing import List

def countSquareFreeSubsets(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    def get_primes_up_to(n):
        """ Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding all primes up to n. """
        is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)
        is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
        for i in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):
            if is_prime[i]:
                for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):
                    is_prime[j] = False
        return [x for x in range(n + 1) if is_prime[x]]
    
    def is_square_free(product):
        """ Check if product is square-free. """
        if product == 0:
            return True
        for p in primes:
            if p * p > product:
                break
            if product % (p * p) == 0:
                return False
        return True

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(index, product):
        if index == len(nums):
            return 1 if is_square_free(product) else 0
        
        count = dfs(index + 1, product)  # Exclude nums[index]
        if is_square_free(product * nums[index]):
            count += dfs(index + 1, product * nums[index])  # Include nums[index]
        
        return count

    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    max_num = max(nums)
    primes = get_primes_up_to(max_num)
    
    # Subtract 1 to exclude the empty subset
    return dfs(0, 1) - 1

# Example Usage:
nums = [2, 3, 6, 7]
print(countSquareFreeSubsets(nums))  # Example output
```

## Time Complexity

- The recursive approach potentially explores all subsets, giving it a complexity of `O(2^n)`.
- The memoization can reduce redundant calculations, though each memoized call takes `O(n log n)` due to prime factorization.
- The overall complexity will thus be largely dependent on `2^n`, where `n` is the size of the input list `nums`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of square-free subsets using recursion and memoization, significantly improving calculation time for larger inputs.
