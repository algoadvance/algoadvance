2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers-out

Given two positive integers `n` and `x`.

Find the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of the `i`-th powers of unique positive integers, where 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `x`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10**9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `x`?**
   - Typically both `n` and `x` are positive integers with constraints being large, but we should assume they could have practical computational limits given in common algorithm problems.

2. **Are the integers in the sum required to be unique?**
   - Yes, the integers used must be unique.

3. **Can there be multiple different sets of integers resulting in the same sum?**
   - Yes, and each distinct set should be counted as a different way.

4. **What is the largest power we need to consider?**
   - It depends on the value of `x`. Specifically, if `x = 3`, we must consider up to cubes.

5. **Is dynamic programming applicable here to store intermediate results for efficiency?**
   - Yes, dynamic programming seems to be a suitable approach for this problem.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Definition:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to express the integer `j` as the sum of the `k`-th powers of unique integers from the set `{1, 2, ..., i}` where `1 ≤ k ≤ x`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`, since the number of ways to make 0 is by choosing nothing.
   - For all other `dp[0][j]` where `j > 0`, initialize to `0` as you can't form a positive number with no integers.

3. **Transition:**
   - For each integer `i`, and for each power `k` up to `x`, calculate `i^k`.
   - Update the DP table considering whether to include `i^k` in making up the number `j`.

4. **Final State:**
   - Sum up the ways to form `n` using powers of all numbers up to `n` considering the constraint of uniqueness.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be very large, take modulo `10**9 + 7`.

### Code

Here’s the Python implementation following the strategy described:

```python
def numberOfWays(n: int, x: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Maximum value to consider for base
    max_base = int(n**(1/x))
    
    # DP array
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    # Iterate over all possible bases
    for i in range(1, max_base + 1):
        power_val = i**x
        for j in range(n, power_val - 1, -1):
            dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - power_val]) % MOD
    
    return dp[n]

# Example Usage
print(numberOfWays(10, 2))  # Example case to test the function
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * max_base), where `max_base` is `int(n**(1/x))`. This complexity arises as the inner loop runs approximately `n` times for each base up to `max_base`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the `dp` array used to store intermediate results.

The code and approach ensure efficient calculation by utilizing dynamic programming to handle overlapping subproblems and consider unique combinations of elements.
