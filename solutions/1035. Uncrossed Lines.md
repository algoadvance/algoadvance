The problem is as follows:

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We write the two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` on a 2D plane, such that `nums1` is written horizontally and `nums2` is written vertically. An uncrossed line connects `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and the line does not intersect any other connecting line.

Return the maximum number of uncrossed lines you can draw between `nums1` and `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What is the length range of `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - A: The length of `nums1` and `nums2` is within the range `[1, 500]`.

2. **Q: What are the possible values for the elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - A: The values in `nums1` and `nums2` are integers in the range `[1, 2000]`.

3. **Q: Are there any special edge cases to consider?**
   - A: Edge cases might include the smallest input sizes (i.e., arrays of length 1) or completely unmatched arrays.

### Strategy
The problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP), which is reminiscent of finding the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two sequences. The idea is to build a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of uncrossed lines between the first `i` elements of `nums1` and the first `j` elements of `nums2`.

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a 2D DP table with dimensions `(len(nums1)+1) x (len(nums2)+1)` initialized with zeros.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
    - Iterate through each `i` from `1` to `len(nums1)` and each `j` from `1` to `len(nums2)`.
    - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` (this means we can extend the sequence of uncrossed lines by one).
    - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Result**:
    - The final answer will be in `dp[len(nums1)][len(nums2)]`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)` where `m = len(nums1)` and `n = len(nums2)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` for the DP table.

### Code
```python
def maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2):
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage
nums1 = [1, 4, 2]
nums2 = [1, 2, 4]
print(maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2
```

This approach builds the solution bottom-up using a DP table and provides the maximum number of uncrossed lines that can be drawn between the two arrays.
