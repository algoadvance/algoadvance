title:  Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II-out
permalink: /s3192
---
Given an array `nums` consisting of binary elements (0s and 1s), return the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of `nums` equal to 1.

In one operation, you can change any `0` into a `1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of `nums`?
   - Is `nums` guaranteed to contain at least one `1`?
   
2. **Output Constraints**:
   - Are we required to return the exact count of operations, or can we return special values for scenarios where it is impossible (e.g., returning `-1` if it's impossible)?

Assuming the problem's constraints resemble typical LeetCode constraints (with the array length being reasonable and containing at least one `1`), we can proceed with solving it.

## Strategy
To make all elements equal to `1`, each `0` in the array needs to be changed to a `1`. Thus, the problem boils down to counting the number of `0`s.

### Steps:
1. Traverse the array and count the number of `0`s.
2. The count of `0`s will be the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired array.

## Code
```python
def min_operations_to_make_all_one(nums):
    # Count the number of zeros in the array
    zero_count = nums.count(0)
    
    return zero_count

# Example usage:
nums = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
print(min_operations_to_make_all_one(nums))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are traversing the array once to count the number of zeros.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for the `zero_count` variable.
