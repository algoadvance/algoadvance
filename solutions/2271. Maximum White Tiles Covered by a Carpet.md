title:  Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet-out
permalink: /s2271
---

You are given a 2D integer array `tiles` where `tiles[i] = [li, ri]` represents that every tile between `li` and `ri` (inclusive) is colored white. You are also given an integer `carpetLen`, the length of a single carpet that can be placed anywhere.

Return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the values of `li`, `ri`, and `carpetLen`?
   - Answer: `tiles[i].length == 2`, `1 <= tiles.length <= 5 * 10^4`, `1 <= li <= ri <= 10^9`, `1 <= carpetLen <= 10^9`.

2. Can the tiles overlap and be unordered?
   - Answer: Yes, tiles can be unordered and overlapping.

3. Does the carpet need to lie within the range `(li, ri)` of tiles or can it start or end outside the tiles' ranges?
   - Answer: The carpet can start or end outside the tiles' ranges; the goal is to cover the maximum number of tiles possible.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Tiles**: First, sort the tiles based on the starting position `li`.
2. **Use Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window to keep track of the number of white tiles covered by a carpet of length `carpetLen`.
    - Maintain a starting and ending pointer (`start`, `end`) for the sliding window.
    - Calculate the total white tiles covered in the current window.
    - If the carpet exceeds `carpetLen`, adjust the window by moving the `start` pointer.
    - Keep track of the maximum number of white tiles covered during the adjustments.

## Code

```python
def maximumWhiteTiles(tiles, carpetLen):
    # Step 1: Sort the tiles based on the starting position
    tiles.sort()
    
    max_cover = 0
    current_cover = 0
    start = 0
    
    # Step 2: Sliding window to calculate the max white tiles covered
    for end in range(len(tiles)):
        start_pos, end_pos = tiles[end]
        
        # Increase the current covered tiles
        current_cover += end_pos - start_pos + 1
        
        # Check while the carpet goes beyond the carpetLen
        while tiles[start][0] + carpetLen <= tiles[end][1]:
            overlap = max(0, tiles[start][0] + carpetLen - tiles[end][0])
            max_cover = max(max_cover, current_cover - overlap)
            
            # Move the start pointer to the right
            current_cover -= tiles[start][1] - tiles[start][0] + 1
            start += 1
        
        # Update the max cover value after adjusting the start position
        max_cover = max(max_cover, min(current_cover, carpetLen))
    
    return max_cover

# Example usage
tiles = [[1, 5], [10, 11], [12, 18], [20, 25], [30, 32]]
carpetLen = 10
print(maximumWhiteTiles(tiles, carpetLen))  # Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting of tiles takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of tiles.
- **Sliding Window**: The sliding window traversal over the tiles array takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
