title:  Product of Array Except Self-out
permalink: /s238
---
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The problem should be solved without using division and in O(n) time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, the input array can contain negative numbers.
2. **Q:** Is the input array guaranteed to have at least one element?
   - **A:** Yes, the input array will have at least one element.
3. **Q:** Can the input array contain zeros?
   - **A:** Yes, the input array can contain zeros.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can leverage two auxiliary arrays: `left_products` and `right_products`.

1. **Left Products**:
   - `left_products[i]` will store the product of all elements to the left of index `i`.
   - Initialize `left_products[0]` to 1 because there are no elements to the left of the first element.

2. **Right Products**:
   - `right_products[i]` will store the product of all elements to the right of index `i`.
   - Initialize `right_products[length-1]` to 1 because there are no elements to the right of the last element.

3. **Combine**:
   - Finally, compute the result for each index `i` by multiplying `left_products[i]` and `right_products[i]`.

This approach ensures that each element at index `i` is a product of all elements except `nums[i]` and also ensures the solution is done in O(n) time.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the described strategy in Python:

```python
def product_except_self(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    # Initialize the arrays with default values of 1
    left_products = [1] * n
    right_products = [1] * n
    answer = [0] * n

    # Calculate the left products
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_products[i] = left_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]

    # Calculate the right products
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        right_products[i] = right_products[i + 1] * nums[i + 1]

    # Calculate the answer array by multiplying left and right products
    for i in range(n):
        answer[i] = left_products[i] * right_products[i]

    return answer
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - This results from two traversals to fill `left_products` and `right_products`, and one more traversal to fill the `answer` array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - Additional space is used for the `left_products`, `right_products`, and `answer` arrays. If we consider the result array as part of the output (which is usually considered as not extra space), the space complexity can be O(n) too due to the use of the auxiliary arrays.
