title:  Find Products of Elements of Big Array-out
permalink: /s3145
---

You have been given a huge list `nums` containing up to \(10^6\) integers. You are required to return a list `products` such that, for each index `i`, `products[i]` contains the product of all elements in `nums` except `nums[i]`. This should be done without using division and in O(n) time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the array?**
   - They can be any integers, positive or negative.
   
2. **Can the input list contain zeros?**
   - Yes, the list can contain zeros.
   
3. **Is the use of additional space allowed, given the output list also counts as space?**
   - Yes, additional space is allowed but should be minimized. The goal is to achieve the solution in linear time complexity.

### Strategy

To solve this problem in O(n) time complexity, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Prefix Product Array**: Calculate the product of all elements before each index.
2. **Suffix Product Array**: Calculate the product of all elements after each index.
3. **Combine Results**: Multiply the prefix product and suffix product to get the desired result for each index.

**Steps**:
1. Create an array `left_products` where `left_products[i]` contains the product of all elements to the left of `i`.
2. Create an array `right_products` where `right_products[i]` contains the product of all elements to the right of `i`.
3. Multiply corresponding elements of `left_products` and `right_products` to get the desired result.

### Code

```python
def find_product_of_elements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    if n == 0:
        return []
    
    # Step 1: Create the `left_products` array
    left_products = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_products[i] = left_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Create the `right_products` array
    right_products = [1] * n
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        right_products[i] = right_products[i + 1] * nums[i + 1]
    
    # Step 3: Construct the result by multiplying the left and right products
    products = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        products[i] = left_products[i] * right_products[i]
    
    return products

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(find_product_of_elements(nums))  # Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Constructing `left_products` takes O(n) time.
  - Constructing `right_products` takes O(n) time.
  - Calculating the final `products` array takes O(n) time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Storing `left_products`, `right_products`, and the output `products` array each requires O(n) space.

This approach ensures that we achieve the desired results efficiently without using division, while maintaining the linear time and space constraints.
