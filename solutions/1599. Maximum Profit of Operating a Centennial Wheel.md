title:  Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel-out
permalink: /s1599
---

You are given two lists: `customers` and `grumpy`. The `customers[i]` is the number of customers that enter the store on the ith day, and `grumpy[i]` is 0 or 1, indicating whether the store owner is grumpy on that day. When the store owner is not grumpy (`grumpy[i] == 0`), the customers are satisfied. Otherwise, they are not satisfied. However, there is a "secret" technique that the owner can use to keep customers happy for X consecutive days, regardless of whether the owner is grumpy on those days or not.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied by using this technique optimally. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of the `customers` and `grumpy` lists?
   - Typically, constraints would be such that 1 <= `len(customers)` == `len(grumpy)` <= 20000.

2. **Value Constraints**: What are the constraints on the values within the `customers` and `grumpy` lists?
   - It would help to know if 0 <= `customers[i]` <= 1000 and `grumpy[i]` being binary {0,1}.

3. **X Constraints**: What is the value of X and its constraints?
   - Assuming 1 <= X <= `len(customers)`.

### Strategy

1. **Base Satisfaction Calculation**: First, calculate the base number of satisfied customers assuming no special technique is applied. This would only account for days where the owner is not grumpy (`grumpy[i] == 0`).

2. **Sliding Window to Maximize Extra Satisfied Customers**: Use a sliding window of size X to determine where applying the secret technique would maximize additional satisfied customers. This technique involves checking days where the owner is grumpy (`grumpy[i] == 1`) within the window.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Profit**:
   - Initialize the base number of satisfied customers.
   - Use a sliding window to go through each possible window of days where the technique could be applied, calculating the additional satisfaction gained within the window.
   - Track the maximum additional satisfaction to find the optimal window for applying the technique.

The solution will involve iterating through the lists multiple times, focusing on performing calculations in a time-efficient manner (O(n) complexity).

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity will be O(n), where n is the length of the `customers` list. This stems from:
1. Calculating the base satisfaction (O(n)).
2. Using the sliding window (O(n)).

### Code

```python
def maxSatisfied(customers, grumpy, X):
    n = len(customers)
    
    # Calculate base satisfaction
    base_satisfaction = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if grumpy[i] == 0:
            base_satisfaction += customers[i]
    
    # Calculate additional satisfaction for the first window of size X
    extra_satisfaction = 0
    for i in range(X):
        if grumpy[i] == 1:
            extra_satisfaction += customers[i]
    
    max_extra_satisfaction = extra_satisfaction
    
    # Use sliding window to find max gain for applying the secret technique
    for i in range(X, n):
        # If we include customers[i] (end of window)
        if grumpy[i] == 1:
            extra_satisfaction += customers[i]
        # If we exclude customers[i-X] (start of window)
        if grumpy[i - X] == 1:
            extra_satisfaction -= customers[i - X]
        
        max_extra_satisfaction = max(max_extra_satisfaction, extra_satisfaction)
    
    return base_satisfaction + max_extra_satisfaction

# Example usage
customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5]
grumpy =    [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
X = 3
print(maxSatisfied(customers, grumpy, X))  # Output should be 16
```

This method ensures that we are efficiently scanning through the `customers` and `grumpy` lists to find the maximum number of satisfied customers with optimal usage of the secret technique.
