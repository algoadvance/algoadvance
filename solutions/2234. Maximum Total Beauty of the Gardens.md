title:  Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens-out
permalink: /s2234
---

You are given two arrays, `flowers` and `beauty`, both of length `n`. The `i-th` type of flower has `flowers[i]` flowers and their beauty value is `beauty[i]`. Additionally, you can perform at most `k` operations to add new flowers or remove existing flowers such that the total number of flowers of any type remains a non-negative value.

You are tasked with finding the maximum total beauty of all the gardens you can achieve with at most `k` operations.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** 
  - flowers = [1, 3, 2, 1]
  - beauty = [1, 2, 4, 3]
  - k = 2
- **Output:** 10
- **Explanation:** 
  - We can perform up to `2` operations. By adding `1` flower to garden `2` (index 1) and `1` to garden `3` (index 2), we can have all the gardens to have the same number of flowers which gives us the total beauty as `1*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 + 4*1 = 10`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= flowers[i], beauty[i] <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the number of flowers in any garden become zero after operations?**
   - Yes, zero flowers in a garden is allowed as long as it doesn’t go negative.

2. **Are the beauty values distinct for each flower type?**
   - This isn’t specified, so we can assume that beauty values can be the same for different flower types.

3. **What kind of operations can we perform?**
   - We can add or remove flowers to the gardens, and the total number of operations used must be less than or equal to `k`.

4. **How should we approach if `k` is very large?**
   - We should ensure the approach is optimized as `k` can be very large (`<= 10^9`).

## Strategy

The primary goal is to maximize the total beauty, and the secondary goal is to do so within the constraint of at most `k` operations. The strategy can involve:

1. **Sorting**: Evaluate which gardens contribute more beauty and prioritize those.
2. **Prefix Sum/Greedy**: Use a sliding window or greedy approach to evaluate the changes.
3. **Binary Search**: Efficiently adjust gardens within the allowed number of operations.

### Steps:

1. **Sort by Beauty**: Begin by sorting gardens based on their beauty, as we aim to increase the contribution of gardens with higher beauty values.
2. **Sliding Window / Two-pointer Approach**: Apply a sliding window or two-pointer technique to keep track of `k` adjustments.
3. **Operations Handling**: Calculate required operations to balance the number of flowers and ensure the total doesn’t exceed `k`.

## Code

Here’s a Python implementation of the strategy described:

```python
def maximumBeauty(flowers, beauty, k):
    n = len(flowers)
    flower_beauty = sorted(zip(flowers, beauty), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    max_beauty = 0
    current_beauty = 0
    sums = []  # prefix sum to handle operations efficiently
    for i in range(n):
        f, b = flower_beauty[i]
        if i > 0:
            f_prev, b_prev = flower_beauty[i-1]
            current_beauty += f_prev * b_prev
            sums.append(f_prev)
        if i == n-1:
            current_beauty += f * b
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, current_beauty)
        flowers_needed = sum(sums) - (i * f)
        if flowers_needed <= k:
            remaining_operations = k - flowers_needed
            total_b = current_beauty + (remaining_operations // (i+1)) * b
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, total_b)
    
    return max_beauty

# Example test
flowers = [1, 3, 2, 1]
beauty = [1, 2, 4, 3]
k = 2
print(maximumBeauty(flowers, beauty, k))  # Output: 10
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting the flowers and beauty array.
- **Calculations**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of flower types, as we iterate through the sorted list.
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n log n)` which should be efficient enough for the constraints.

By using this optimized approach, we ensure that the solution is scalable and efficient for large inputs.
