title:  Count Square Submatrices with All Ones-out
permalink: /s1277

You are given an \(m \times n\) binary matrix `matrix`. You need to count the number of square submatrices that have all ones.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints for the size of the matrix `matrix`?
   - Is the matrix always non-empty?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return the total count of square submatrices containing all ones or should it print the count?

### Code
Here's how we can solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach:

```python
def countSquares(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0

    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    count = 0

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1  # Edge cases: first row or first column
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                count += dp[i][j]

    return count
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of size \(m \times n\) with all elements initialized to 0. This will store the size of the largest square submatrix ending at each position.
   - Initialize a variable `count` to track the total number of square submatrices.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition:**
   - **Base Case:** If `matrix[i][j]` is on the first row or the first column and is equal to 1, then `dp[i][j] = 1`.
   - **General Case:** For other elements, if `matrix[i][j]` is 1, compute `dp[i][j]` as:

\[ \text{dp}[i][j] = \min(\text{dp}[i-1][j], \text{dp}[i][j-1], \text{dp}[i-1][j-1]) + 1 \]

This formula ensures we use the minimum size of the squares ending at the adjacent top, left, and top-left cells to form a new square. 

3. **Counting Squares:**
   - Increment the `count` by `dp[i][j]` for all \(i\) and \(j\).
   - Return `count` as the final result.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) because we traverse each cell in the `matrix` once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) for the `dp` matrix, although this can be optimized to \(O(n)\) by using a single row.

### Example

Let's consider a matrix:

\[ 
[
  [1, 0, 1],
  [1, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0]
]
\]

1. **Initialization:**

    \[
    \text{matrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]

2. **DP Table Calculation:**

    - For `dp[0][0]`, it is 1 since it's on the first row.
    - For `dp[0][2]`, it is 1 since there's a single '1'.
    - For `dp[1][0]`, it is 1 since it's in the first column.
    - For `dp[1][1]`, it is 1 + min(1, 1, 1) = 2.
    - For remaining cells, process accordingly.

3. **Final DP table:**

    \[
    \text{dp} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 2 & 0 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    Thus, the total count of square submatrices is \(1+0+1+1+2+0 = 5\).
