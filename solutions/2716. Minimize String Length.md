title:  Minimize String Length-out

Given a string `s`, the task is to remove duplicate characters from `s` such that each character appears only once. The output should be the minimized length of the string after removing the duplicates.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the characters case-sensitive?** - Yes, lowercase and uppercase characters should be treated differently.
2. **Do the characters need to remain in any specific order in the final string?** - The order of the unique characters in the final string doesn't matter, only the count of unique characters does.
3. **What should be the output if the input string is empty?** - The output should be 0, as there are no characters in the string.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a set data structure which inherently maintains unique elements. The basic approach can be broken down into these steps:

1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of the unique characters.
2. Iterate over each character in the string `s` and add it to the set.
3. The size of the set (`len(set)`) will represent the number of unique characters, which is the answer.

The use of a set ensures that each character only appears once, automatically handling the removal of duplicates.

## Code

```python
def minimize_string_length(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a set to track unique characters
    unique_chars = set()
    
    # Add each character in the input string to the set
    for char in s:
        unique_chars.add(char)
    
    # The size of the set is the number of unique characters
    return len(unique_chars)

# Example usage:
print(minimize_string_length("abca"))  # Output: 3
print(minimize_string_length("abcabc"))  # Output: 3
print(minimize_string_length(""))  # Output: 0
print(minimize_string_length("aAaA"))  # Output: 2 (since 'a' and 'A' are different)
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through each character in the string once, and each set insertion operation is average **O(1)** time complexity.

The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case, where all characters in the string are unique, and hence, the set will store `n` characters.
