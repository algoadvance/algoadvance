Convert a non-negative integer `num` into its corresponding English words representation.

**Examples:**
```
Input: num = 123
Output: "One Hundred Twenty Three"

Input: num = 12345
Output: "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"

Input: num = 1234567
Output: "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
```

**Constraints:**
- The number is in the range [0, 2^31 - 1].

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider localization (e.g., British vs. American English)?
   - No, we'll stick to standard American English.
2. Are leading zeros in the number an issue?
   - No, the number is non-negative and should not have leading zeros.

## Strategy
1. Divide the problem into manageable parts by creating a mapping of words for small numbers.
2. Process the number in chunks of thousands (1000, 1 million, etc.).
3. Use a helper function to convert numbers less than 1000 into words.
4. Combine the results for the chunks with appropriate scales ("Thousand", "Million", etc.).

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def numberToWords(self, num: int) -> str:
        if num == 0:
            return "Zero"
        
        # Words for single-digit and two-digit numbers, and groups of ten, hundred etc.
        below_20 = ["", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine",
                    "Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen", "Fourteen", "Fifteen", "Sixteen",
                    "Seventeen", "Eighteen", "Nineteen"]
        tens = ["", "", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"]
        thousands = ["", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"]
        
        def helper(n: int) -> str:
            if n == 0:
                return ""
            elif n < 20:
                return below_20[n] + " "
            elif n < 100:
                return tens[n // 10] + " " + helper(n % 10)
            else:
                return below_20[n // 100] + " Hundred " + helper(n % 100)
        
        result = ""
        for i, chunk in enumerate(thousands):
            if num % 1000 != 0:
                result = helper(num % 1000) + chunk + " " + result
            num //= 1000
        
        return result.strip()

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.numberToWords(123))       # "One Hundred Twenty Three"
print(sol.numberToWords(12345))     # "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
print(sol.numberToWords(1234567))   # "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of digits in the input number. Each digit (or small group of digits in the case of chunk processing) is processed in a constant amount of time. 

- Division and modulus operations, as well as string concatenations, are handled in constant time for each digit/group.
- The number of iterations in the `for` loop depends on the length of the number (at most 10 iterations for up to 10-digit numbers, which fits within the constraint range of [0, 2^31 - 1]).

The space complexity is also \(O(N)\) for storing the result string which scales with the size of the input number.

With this strategy and code, you can convert any non-negative integer within the specified range to its English words representation effectively.
