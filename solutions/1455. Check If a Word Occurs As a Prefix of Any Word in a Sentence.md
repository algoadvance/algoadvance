title:  Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence-out
permalink: /s1455
---
Given a sentence consisting of a string of words separated by spaces, and a search word, determine if the search word appears as a prefix of any word in the sentence. If it does, return the index (1-indexed) of the first word in the sentence that has the search word as a prefix. If the search word is not a prefix of any word in the sentence, return -1.

**Example:**
1. `Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"`
   - `Output: 4`
2. `Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"`
   - `Output: 2`
3. `Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"`
   - `Output: -1`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the sentence contain punctuation marks?
   - No, the sentence consists of words separated by spaces only.
2. Are we guaranteed that the input sentence is not empty?
   - Yes.
3. Is the search word guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes.

### Strategy
1. Split the sentence into words.
2. Iterate through the list of words with their indices.
3. Check if the search word is a prefix of the current word.
4. If it is, return the current index (1-indexed).
5. If no words in the sentence have the search word as a prefix, return -1.

### Code

```python
def isPrefixOfWord(sentence: str, searchWord: str) -> int:
    words = sentence.split()
    for index, word in enumerate(words):
        if word.startswith(searchWord):
            return index + 1  # returning 1-indexed position
    return -1

# Example Test Cases
print(isPrefixOfWord("i love eating burger", "burg"))  # Output: 4
print(isPrefixOfWord("this problem is an easy problem", "pro"))  # Output: 2
print(isPrefixOfWord("i am tired", "you"))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity
- Splitting the sentence into words will take O(n) time, where n is the length of the sentence.
- Iterating through the list of words also takes O(m) time, where m is the number of words.
- Checking if a word starts with the search word takes O(p) time in the worst case for each word, where p is the length of the search word.

Overall time complexity is O(n + k*p), where:
- n is the length of the sentence,
- k is the number of words in the sentence,
- p is the length of the search word.

This solution should be efficient for most practical inputs.
