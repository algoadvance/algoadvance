title:  Latest Time by Replacing Hidden Digits-out
permalink: /s1736
---

You are given a time in the format of `HH:MM`, where some of the digits are hidden (represented by `?`). The task is to replace the hidden digits in such a way that the resulting time is the latest possible valid time. The given string will always satisfy the format `HH:MM`.

### Example
#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `"?4:5?"`
- **Output:** `"14:59"`
  
#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `"23:5?"`
- **Output:** `"23:59"`

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `"2?:22"`
- **Output:** `"23:22"`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Will the input always be in the format `HH:MM` with exactly two characters for hours and two for minutes?**
   - Yes, the format is guaranteed.

2. **Can we assume the input string will only contain valid placeholder characters for unknown digits?**
   - Yes, only `?` characters will be used as placeholders.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we need to consider how to replace each `?` to create the maximum possible time:

1. **Hours place (`HH`):**
   - First digit: If the first digit is `?`, it can be either 2 if the second digit is 0-3, or 1 if the second digit is 4-9.
   - Second digit: If the second digit is `?`, it can be 9 if the first digit is 0 or 1, or 3 if the first digit is 2.

2. **Minutes place (`MM`):**
   - Always replace `?` with the highest possible valid digit (9).

### Code Implementations:

```python
def maximumTime(time: str) -> str:
    hours, minutes = time.split(":")
    
    # Handle hours
    if hours[0] == "?":
        if hours[1] == "?" or int(hours[1]) <= 3:
            hours = "2" + hours[1]
        else:
            hours = "1" + hours[1]
    if hours[1] == "?":
        if hours[0] == "2":
            hours = hours[0] + "3"
        else:
            hours = hours[0] + "9"
    
    # Handle minutes
    if minutes[0] == "?":
        minutes = "5" + minutes[1]
    if minutes[1] == "?":
        minutes = minutes[0] + "9"
    
    return f"{hours}:{minutes}"

# Example usage
print(maximumTime("?4:5?"))  # Should return "14:59"
print(maximumTime("23:5?"))  # Should return "23:59"
print(maximumTime("2?:22"))  # Should return "23:22"
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(1):** The solution involves a fixed number of operations regardless of the input content or size.

This code efficiently finds and replaces the `?` characters, ensuring the resulting time is the latest possible valid time.
