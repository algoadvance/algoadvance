Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, return *another integer array* `answer where answer.length == nums.length` and `answer[i]` contains the product of `nums[j] and nums[k]` where `j` and `k` satisfy the following conditions:

- `i < j < k < nums.length`
- `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`

If there are no `j`s or `k`s which satisfy the conditions, `answer[i] = -1`.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [-1, 60, 24, -1, -1]

Input: nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all numbers distinct?**
   - Not necessarily, there may be duplicates in the array.
   
2. **Should the product only consider the first pair `(j, k)` found or the maximum product if multiple pairs exist?**
   - The problem doesn't specify selecting a maximum, so the first valid pair found in left-to-right order will be used.

## Strategy

1. We'll iterate through the `nums` array.
2. For each index `i`, we need to find a `j` where `nums[j] > nums[i]` and then a `k` where `k > j` and `nums[k] > nums[j]`.
3. Use a nested approach to find `j` and `k`:
   - Initialize `j` to `i+1` and iterate through the end of the array to find a valid `j`.
   - For each valid `j`, iterate again from `j+1` to find a valid `k`.
   - If such `j` and `k` are found, store the product `nums[j] * nums[k]` in the result array.
4. If no such triples are found for `nums[i]`, place `-1` in the result array.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy mentioned:

```python
def next_greater_element_iv(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    answer = [-1] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        found = False
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if nums[k] > nums[j]:
                        answer[i] = nums[j] * nums[k]
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
                    
    return answer

# Testing the implementation with an example
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(next_greater_element_iv(nums))  # Output: [-1, 60, 24, -1, -1]
```

## Time Complexity

- The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^3)\) due to the three nested loops (`n` for `i`, `n-i-1` for `j`, and `n-j-1` for `k`).
  
Transpose and Conquer:
- Given the constraints of `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, this complexity is acceptable, but optimizations can be explored for a more efficient approach (e.g., using data structures like stacks or binary indexed trees to speed up finding next greater elements).
