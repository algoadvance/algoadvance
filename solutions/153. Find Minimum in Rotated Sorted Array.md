title:  Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s153
---

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times. 

Given the rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array. You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?** 
   - No, the elements are unique as per the problem statement.

2. **Is the array always rotated?**
   - The rotation can be between `1` and `n` times, meaning it can also be `0` times (the array is not rotated).

3. **What should be returned if the array is not rotated?**
   - The minimum element of an unrotated sorted array is the first element.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently in `O(log n)` time, we can use a modified binary search algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set `left` to `0` and `right` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - While `left` is less than `right`:
     - Compute the middle index `mid`.
     - Use the property of the rotated sorted array to determine which half to search next:
       - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, the smallest element is in the right half, so set `left` to `mid + 1`.
       - Otherwise, the smallest element is in the left half, so set `right` to `mid`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - After the loop ends, `left` will point to the smallest element. Return `nums[left]`.

### Code

```python
def findMin(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    
    return nums[left]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time because we are using a binary search approach, which halves the search space in each step.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are using only a constant amount of additional space.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array using properties of the rotation and binary search technique.
