title:  Parsing A Boolean Expression-out
permalink: /s1106

### Problem Statement

Given a string `expression` that represents a boolean expression, you need to parse it and return the boolean value of the expression. The valid boolean expressions can contain:

- 't' for true
- 'f' for false
- '!' for NOT, which takes one boolean expression
- '&' for AND, which takes two or more boolean expressions
- '|' for OR, which takes two or more boolean expressions

### Example

```plaintext
Input: expression = "!(f)"
Output: true

Input: expression = "|(f,t)"
Output: true

Input: expression = "&(t,f)"
Output: false

Input: expression = "|(&(t,f,t),!(t))"
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any parentheses mismatches or invalid inputs?**
   - For this problem, you can assume that the input is always valid.

2. **How large can the input expression be?**
   - The length of the expression will be <= 20000.

### Strategy

We can parse the expression using a stack-based method:
- **Stack** helps in managing the nested structure of the expression.
- **Iterate** through each character in the expression:
  - If a boolean value (`t` or `f`) is encountered, push it onto the stack.
  - If an operator (`!`, `&`, `|`) is encountered, push it onto the stack.
  - If a closing parenthesis `)` is encountered, it means the end of a sub-expression. Pop the stack until the corresponding opening parenthesis `(` is found, then process the sub-expression using the operator at the top of the stack.
- **Evaluate** each sub-expression and push the result back onto the stack.
- **Result** of the whole expression will be the only element left in the stack.

### Code

```python
def parseBoolExpr(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    
    for char in expression:
        if char in 'tf':
            stack.append(char)
        elif char == ')':
            seen = []
            while stack[-1] != '(':
                seen.append(stack.pop())
            stack.pop()  # Remove the '('
            operator = stack.pop()
            if operator == '!':
                stack.append('t' if seen[0] == 'f' else 'f')
            elif operator == '&':
                stack.append('t' if all(x == 't' for x in seen) else 'f')
            elif operator == '|':
                stack.append('t' if any(x == 't' for x in seen) else 'f')
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    
    return stack[-1] == 't'

# Example Usage
print(parseBoolExpr("!(f)")) # Output: True
print(parseBoolExpr("|(f,t)")) # Output: True
print(parseBoolExpr("&(t,f)")) # Output: False
print(parseBoolExpr("|(&(t,f,t),!(t))")) # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the expression.
  - Each character is processed once. Parentheses are handled in constant time for each pairing.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the use of the stack to hold the characters of the expression.
  
This approach efficiently handles parsing and evaluation of the boolean expression using stack operations.
