title:  Number of Pairs of Interchangeable Rectangles-out
permalink: /s2001
---

### Problem Statement
You are given `rectangles`, where `rectangles[i] = [width_i, height_i]` represents the dimensions of the `i-th` rectangle. Two rectangles are considered interchangeable if their widths to heights ratios are the same. Compute the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles.

### Example
Input:
```
rectangles = [[4, 8], [3, 6], [10, 20], [15, 30]]
```
Output:
```
6
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the dimensions `[width_i, height_i]` be zero or negative?
   **A**: No, the dimensions of the rectangles are always positive integers.
   
2. **Q**: What is the maximum possible value for width and height?
   **A**: The problem doesn't specify, but we can assume that they fit within typical integer limits used in programming challenges.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Ratio**: For each rectangle, compute the width-to-height ratio.
2. **Store in HashMap**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of these ratios.
3. **Count Pairs**: For each ratio stored in the hashmap, use the combination formula to determine the number of ways to pick 2 rectangles from `n` rectangles with the same ratio (\(C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\)).

### Plan
1. Iterate through each rectangle to calculate its ratio.
2. Using a hashmap to store the frequency of each ratio.
3. Iterate through the hashmap and for each ratio with count `n`, compute the number of pairs that can be formed using the combination formula mentioned above.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

def interchangeableRectangles(rectangles):
    ratio_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for width, height in rectangles:
        ratio_gcd = gcd(width, height)
        ratio = (width // ratio_gcd, height // ratio_gcd)
        ratio_count[ratio] += 1
    
    pairs = 0
    for count in ratio_count.values():
        if count > 1:
            pairs += count * (count - 1) // 2
    
    return pairs

# Example
rectangles = [[4, 8], [3, 6], [10, 20], [15, 30]]
print(interchangeableRectangles(rectangles))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Computing GCD**: Each ratio calculation involves a GCD operation which is \(O(\log(\min(width, height)))\).
- **First Loop (O(n))**: Iterating through the list of rectangles to compute the ratio.
- **Second Loop (O(r))**: r is the number of unique ratios.
- **Overall Complexity**: The dominating factor is the number of rectangles, hence approximately \(O(n \log (largest_dimension))\), where `largest_dimension` is the largest width or height from the input rectangles.

By following this strategy, we ensure that our solution is efficient and scalable to large inputs.
