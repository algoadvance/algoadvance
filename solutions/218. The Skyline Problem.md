title:  The Skyline Problem-out
permalink: /s218
---

"The Skyline Problem" is a well-known algorithm problem that can be stated as follows:

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

Each building is represented by a triplet of integers `[Li, Ri, Hi]`, where:

- `Li` is the x-coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
- `Ri` is the x-coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
- `Hi` is the height of the ith building.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" - a key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Each key point is represented as a pair `[x, y]`, denoting that there is a horizontal line segment at coordinate `x` with height `y`. Key points should be sorted by the x-coordinate.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the coordinates and heights for the buildings?**
   - Typically, the range can be large, but it is usually ensured to fit within typical integer constraints.
   
2. **What is the expected output if no buildings are provided?**
   - The output should be an empty list.

3. **Can buildings overlap completely or partially?**
   - Yes, buildings can overlap both completely and partially.

### Strategy

1. **Event Processing**:
   - Treat each building as two separate events: 
      - Starting point `(Li, Hi, start)`
      - Ending point `(Ri, Hi, end)`

2. **Sort Events**:
   - Sort these events. Strategy for sorting:
     - If two events have the same x-coordinate:
       - Process the `start` event before the `end` event.
       - If both are `start` events, process the one with the higher height first.
       - If both are `end` events, process the one with the lower height first.

3. **Max-Heap for Heights**:
   - Use a max-heap to keep track of the current building heights as you sweep from left to right through the events.
   - Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default, so we use negative heights to simulate a max-heap.

4. **Key Point Extraction**:
   - For each event, update the max-heap and then decide if this event changes the current maximum height of the skyline.
   - If there's a height change, record the new key point.

5. **Construct Result**:
   - Traverse through all events and maintain a list of key points based on changes in the height found from the heap.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
import heapq

def getSkyline(buildings):
    # Preparing a list of events
    events = []
    for L, R, H in buildings:
        events.append((L, -H, 'start'))  # starting point, height is negative
        events.append((R, H, 'end'))     # ending point, height is positive
    
    # Sort events by x-coordinate and taking care of tie-breaking
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

    # Result list and a max-heap (using negative heights for max-heap effect)
    result = []
    max_heap = [(0, float('inf'))]  # (height, position), the sentinel end point

    # Process the sweep line
    for x, h, typ in events:
        if typ == 'start':
            if -h > -max_heap[0][0]:
                result.append([x, -h])
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (h, x))
        else:
            for i in range(len(max_heap)):
                if max_heap[i][1] == x:
                    max_heap[i] = max_heap[-1]
                    heapq.heappop(max_heap)
                    if i < len(max_heap):
                        heapq._siftup(max_heap, i)
                        heapq._siftdown(max_heap, 0, i)
                    break
            if -h > -max_heap[0][0]:
                result.append([x, -max_heap[0][0]])

    return result

# Example usage:
buildings = [[2, 9, 10], [3, 7, 15], [5, 12, 12], [15, 20, 10], [19, 24, 8]]
print(getSkyline(buildings))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of events.
- **Heap Operations**: Each event involves at most \(O(\log n)\) time for insertion and deletion.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for this problem.
