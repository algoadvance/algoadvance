title:  Count Operations to Obtain Zero-out
permalink: /s2169
---
You are given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, if `num1 >= num2`, you must subtract `num2` from `num1`, otherwise subtract `num1` from `num2`.

Return the number of operations required to make either `num1` or `num2` equal to `0`.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3 -> num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1 -> num1 = 2 - 1 = 1, num2 = 1
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1 -> num1 = 1 - 1 = 0, num2 = 1
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10 -> num1 = 10 - 10 = 0, num2 = 10
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= num1, num2 <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the function return the count of operations only once either `num1` or `num2` becomes zero?
   - Yes, as stated in the problem.

2. Is it guaranteed that the integers provided will always be non-negative?
   - Yes, as per the problem constraints.

## Strategy
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of operations.
2. Use a loop to perform the described operations until either `num1` or `num2` becomes zero.
3. If `num1 >= num2`, subtract `num2` from `num1`, otherwise subtract `num1` from `num2`.
4. Increment the counter for each operation performed.
5. Return the counter when the loop ends.

## Code
Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def countOperations(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    
    while num1 != 0 and num2 != 0:
        if num1 >= num2:
            num1 -= num2
        else:
            num2 -= num1
        count += 1
        
    return count
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(min(num1, num2))` - In the worst case, we may subtract `1` from the smaller of either `num1` or `num2` at each step, leading to `min(num1, num2)` steps.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - As we use only a constant amount of extra space for the integer variables `count`, `num1`, and `num2`.

In most scenarios, if the number differences are large enough, the number of operations could be significantly less than the minimum value of `num1` and `num2`, closer to `log(min(num1, num2))`.
