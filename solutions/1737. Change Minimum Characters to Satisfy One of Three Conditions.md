title:  Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions-out
permalink: /s1737
---

You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one move, you can change any character in either string to any lowercase English letter.

Your task is to return the minimum number of moves needed to make one of these three conditions true:

1. Every character in `a` is strictly less than every character in `b` in the alphabet.
2. Every character in `b` is strictly less than every character in `a` in the alphabet.
3. Both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the strings `a` and `b` allowed to be empty?
    - No, the problem assumes that both `a` and `b` have at least one character.
   
2. Can we assume that `a` and `b` will only contain lowercase English letters?
    - Yes, all characters in `a` and `b` are lowercase English letters.

3. Should the function return 0 if one of the conditions is already satisfied?
    - Yes, the function should return 0 if any of the conditions is initially satisfied.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the three conditions separately and find the minimum changes for each:

1. **Condition 1:** Every character in `a` is strictly less than every character in `b`.
    - We need to find a point in the alphabet where all characters in `a` are below this point and all characters in `b` are above it.
    - For each possible breaking point `ch`, count how many changes are needed to make all characters in `a` less than `ch` and all characters in `b` greater than or equal to `ch`.

2. **Condition 2:** Every character in `b` is strictly less than every character in `a`.
    - Similar to Condition 1 but in reverse. For each breaking point `ch`, count the changes to make all characters in `b` less than `ch` and `a` greater than or equal to `ch`.

3. **Condition 3:** Both `a` and `b` consist of only one distinct letter.
    - For this, we can count the frequency of each letter in `a` and `b`. The minimum moves would be the length of `a` minus the maximum frequency in `a` plus the length of `b` minus the maximum frequency in `b`.

After computing the minimal changes required for each condition, return the smallest of these values.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def minCharacters(a: str, b: str) -> int:
    freq_a = Counter(a)
    freq_b = Counter(b)
    
    # Precompute prefix sums for frequencies of each letter in a and b
    prefix_a = [0] * 26
    prefix_b = [0] * 26
    
    for i in range(26):
        ch = chr(i + ord('a'))
        prefix_a[i] = freq_a[ch] + (prefix_a[i-1] if i > 0 else 0)
        prefix_b[i] = freq_b[ch] + (prefix_b[i-1] if i > 0 else 0)
    
    len_a = len(a)
    len_b = len(b)
    
    min_moves = float('inf')
    
    # Condition 1 and Condition 2
    for i in range(25):  # Breaking point at character chr(i + ord('a')+1)
        # Condition 1
        moves1 = (len_a - prefix_a[i]) + prefix_b[i]
        # Condition 2
        moves2 = (len_b - prefix_b[i]) + prefix_a[i]
        min_moves = min(min_moves, moves1, moves2)
    
    # Condition 3
    max_freq_a = max(freq_a.values())
    max_freq_b = max(freq_b.values())
    moves3 = (len_a - max_freq_a) + (len_b - max_freq_b)
    min_moves = min(min_moves, moves3)
    
    return min_moves

# Example Input and Output
print(minCharacters("aba", "caa"))  # Expected output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- Computing the frequencies and prefix sums for each string takes O(n + m) time, where `n` is the length of `a` and `m` is the length of `b`.
- Evaluating the cost for all 25 breaking points requires O(25) which is essentially O(1).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m) which is efficient for the given constraints.
