title:  Number of Excellent Pairs-out
permalink: /s2354
---

You are given a **0-indexed** positive integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.

A pair of numbers `(num1, num2)` is called excellent if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. Both `num1` and `num2` exist in `nums`.
2. The sum of the number of set bits (1-bits) in `num1 OR num2` and `num1 AND num2` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Return the number of distinct excellent pairs.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
There are 5 excellent pairs:
- (1, 2) with 1 OR 2 = 3 and 1 AND 2 = 0. The sum of the number of set bits is 2 + 1 = 3.
- (1, 3) with 1 OR 3 = 3 and 1 AND 3 = 1. The sum of the number of set bits is 2 + 1 = 3.
- (2, 3) with 2 OR 3 = 3 and 2 AND 3 = 2. The sum of the number of set bits is 2 + 2 = 4.
- (3, 3) with 3 OR 3 = 3 and 3 AND 3 = 3. The sum of the number of set bits is 2 + 2 = 4.
- (3, 1) with 3 OR 1 = 3 and 3 AND 1 = 1. The sum of the number of set bits is 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Clarifying Questions**

1. **Is the array sorted?**
   No, the array `nums` is not necessarily sorted.
   
2. **Can numbers appear multiple times in `nums`?**
   Yes, but we are interested in distinct elements only when counting pairs.

3. **What is the range of the integers in the array?**
   The integers will be positive, and within typical constraints for such problems, so we can assume they fit within standard integer ranges for Python.

4. **Can elements in the pair be the same number?**
   Yes, `(num, num)` is considered a valid pair if it meets the `k` condition.

## Strategy

This is a combinatorial problem with bitwise operations. Here's a step-by-step approach to solve it:

1. **Remove Duplicates:** Since we only care about distinct numbers, convert `nums` to a set.
2. **Calculate Bit Counts:** For each number in `nums`, calculate the number of set bits.
3. **Count Valid Pairs:** Use a double loop to count pairs `(num1, num2)` such that their combined set bits using the OR and AND operations satisfy the condition.

### Code

```python
def countExcellentPairs(nums, k):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Remove duplicates by converting to set
    distinct_nums = list(set(nums))
    
    # Create a map to count occurrence of each bit count
    bit_count_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Function to calculate number of set bits in a number
    def set_bits(x):
        return bin(x).count('1')
    
    # Fill bit_count_map with the number of set bits for each number
    for num in distinct_nums:
        bit_count_map[set_bits(num)] += 1
    
    # Collect all bit counts and sort them
    bit_counts = sorted(bit_count_map.keys())
    
    # Initialize the total pairs counter
    total_pairs = 0
    
    # Count pairs
    for i in bit_counts:
        for j in bit_counts:
            if i + j >= k:
                total_pairs += bit_count_map[i] * bit_count_map[j]
    
    return total_pairs

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
k = 3
print(countExcellentPairs(nums, k))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Removing duplicates:** O(N) where N is the number of elements in the list.
2. **Calculating set bits:** O(N) for traversing each unique element and calculating its bit count.
3. **Nested Loop for Counting Pairs:** O(M^2), where M is the number of unique bit count values (small, usually about 32 due to the bit lengths of integer representations).

Overall, the approach should operate efficiently within these constraints.
