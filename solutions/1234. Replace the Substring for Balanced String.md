title:  Replace the Substring for Balanced String-out
permalink: /s1234
---

You are given a string containing only four kinds of characters: `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.

A string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears `n / 4` times where `n` is the length of the string.

Return the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make the original string balanced.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace a single 'Q' to 'R', so that "QWER" (or any permutation of it) is balanced.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "QQQQ"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can replace three "Q" to "WER". 
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to consider uppercase and lowercase as the same character?
   - No, the given characters are strictly uppercase `Q`, `W`, `E`, `R`.

2. If the string is already balanced, should I return 0?
   - Yes, if the string is already balanced, return 0.

3. Is the substring that we replace also allowed to contain characters not in {`'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, `'R'`}?
   - No, the replaced substring should only contain characters from the set {`'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, `'R'`}.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique.

Steps:
1. Calculate the target count for each character, which is `n / 4` where `n` is the length of the string.
2. Use a sliding window to find the smallest substring that can be replaced to make the string balanced.
3. Calculate the excess characters that cause the imbalance.
4. Try to keep expanding the right end of the window.
5. When the window is valid (i.e., removing this window makes the rest of the string balanced), attempt to shrink the window from the left to find the minimal length.

## Code

```python
def balancedString(s: str) -> int:
    from collections import Counter
    
    n = len(s)
    count = Counter(s)
    target = n // 4
    min_len = n
    
    def is_balanced():
        return all(count[ch] <= target for ch in 'QWER')
    
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        count[s[right]] -= 1
        while is_balanced():
            min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
            count[s[left]] += 1
            left += 1
    
    return min_len

# Test cases
print(balancedString("QWER"))  # Expected: 0
print(balancedString("QQWE"))  # Expected: 1
print(balancedString("QQQW"))  # Expected: 2
print(balancedString("QQQQ"))  # Expected: 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each character is processed and moved at most twice (once moved into the window, once out of the window). The space complexity is `O(1)` since the count of characters is fixed to four types.
