title:  Bricks Falling When Hit-out
permalink: /s803
---

You are given an `m x n` binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick and 0 represents an empty space. A brick is considered stable if:
- It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
- At least one of its adjacent bricks is stable.

You are also given an array `hits`, which represents the positions of bricks that will be removed one by one. Each position in `hits` is a pair of integers `(i, j)` that represents the location of a brick in the grid that will be removed. The brick at the position (i, j) in the hits might not actually be present, as it could also be a hit where there is no brick.

Return an array `result`, where each element `result[k]` is the number of bricks that will fall after the k-th hit. If a brick becomes unstable and falls, it can cause other bricks to become unstable and fall.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Will all coordinates in the hits array be within the bounds of the grid?
   - **A**: Yes, all positions given in the hits array will be valid.

2. **Q**: Can there be duplicate hits for the same (i, j) position?
   - **A**: No, the hits array will have unique entries.

3. **Q**: Will the grid and hits array be non-empty?
   - **A**: Yes, the grid will have at least one cell and the hits array will have at least one hit.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Removal Preparation:**
   - Mark the bricks to be hit in the grid by temporarily removing them.
   
2. **Initial Stabilization:**
   - Use a DFS or Union-Find to mark the stable bricks that are connected to the top row after removing the bricks in hits.

3. **Reverse Simulation:**
   - Reverse iterate through the hits array and "undo" the hits one by one, checking how many bricks each undone hit stabilizes or causes to fall.

4. **Union-Find Approach:**
   - Use a Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage the connectivity of bricks:
     - Create a virtual top node to which all stable bricks in the top row are connected.
     - Union and find operations to keep track of connected components of bricks.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def hitBricks(self, grid: List[List[int]], hits: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        parent = list(range(m * n + 1))
        rank = [0] * (m * n + 1)

        def find(x):
            if parent[x] != x:
                parent[x] = find(parent[x])
            return parent[x]

        def union(x, y):
            rootX = find(x)
            rootY = find(y)
            if rootX != rootY:
                if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
                    parent[rootY] = rootX
                elif rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
                    parent[rootX] = rootY
                else:
                    parent[rootY] = rootX
                    rank[rootX] += 1

        def index(x, y):
            return x * n + y

        for x, y in hits:
            if grid[x][y] == 1:
                grid[x][y] = 2

        for i in range(n):
            if grid[0][i] == 1:
                union(index(0, i), m * n)

        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    if i == 0:
                        union(index(i, j), m * n)
                    for d in directions:
                        ni, nj = i + d[0], j + d[1]
                        if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                            union(index(i, j), index(ni, nj))

        res = []
        for x, y in reversed(hits):
            if grid[x][y] == 2:
                count_before = -find(m * n)
                grid[x][y] = 1
                if x == 0:
                    union(index(x, y), m * n)
                for d in directions:
                    ni, nj = x + d[0], y + d[1]
                    if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and grid[ni][nj] == 1:
                        union(index(x, y), index(ni, nj))
                count_after = -find(m * n)
                res.append(max(0, count_after - count_before - 1))
            else:
                res.append(0)
        
        return res[::-1]

# Example Usage:
# solution = Solution()
# grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]]
# hits = [[1,0]]
# print(solution.hitBricks(grid, hits)) # Output: [2]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is approximately `O(m * n + k * α(m * n))`, where `m` is the number of rows in the grid, `n` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of hits, and `α` is the inverse Ackermann function which grows very slowly. This ensures the solution is efficient and scalable.
