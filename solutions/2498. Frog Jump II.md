title:  Frog Jump II-out
permalink: /s2498
---

We have a frog starting at the point 0 on a number line. The frog can jump to any other point. There are `n` stones at positions given by the integer array `stones` sorted in a strictly increasing order. The goal is to find the minimum distance the frog must jump in a single jump if the frog traverses the stones in the order they appear in the array.

You need to return the minimum distance the frog can achieve in a single jump while traversing through all stones.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the frog start directly at any of the stones or must it always start at position 0?**
   - The frog starts at position 0 and needs to traverse all the stones in the given order.

2. **Does the frog need to land on every stone exactly once?**
   - Yes, the frog must visit each stone exactly once in the given order.

3. **Can the frog make multiple jumps of varying distances?**
   - Yes, the frog can make multiple jumps, but we need to keep track of the maximum jump distance it makes.

4. **Are there any constraints on the number of stones (n)?**
   - Typical constraints should be given in the complete problem statement, so we should be prepared for the general case.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Maximum Jump**: Start with an initial maximum jump of 0.
2. **Iterate Through Stones**: Traverse the list of stones, calculating the jump distance from each stone to the next.
3. **Update Maximum Jump**: Compare each jump distance to the current maximum jump distance, updating the maximum if the current jump is greater.
4. **Consider Start**: Calculate the jump from position 0 to the first stone as well.
5. **Result**: The maximum jump distance encountered while traversing all the stones will be the minimum distance that the frog must be able to jump to traverse all stones.

## Code

```python
def maxJump(stones):
    # Initialize the maximum jump distance
    max_jump = 0
    
    # Calculate the initial jump from 0 to the first stone
    max_jump = max(max_jump, stones[0])
    
    # Traverse the list of stones to find the maximum jump distance
    for i in range(1, len(stones)):
        current_jump = stones[i] - stones[i - 1]
        max_jump = max(max_jump, current_jump)
    
    return max_jump

# Example Usage
stones = [2, 5, 9, 14, 20]
print(maxJump(stones))  # Output should give us the maximum single jump required
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** since we are iterating through the list of stones once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
