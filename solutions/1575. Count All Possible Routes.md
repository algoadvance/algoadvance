title:  Count All Possible Routes-out
permalink: /s1575
---

You are given an array of distinct integers `locations` where `locations[i]` represents the position of city `i`. You are also given integers `start`, `finish`, and `fuel`.

At the start, you are at the city `start` and you want to go to the city `finish`. You can move from city `i` to city `j` only if `0 <= i, j < locations.length` and `i != j`. Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the fuel by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. 

Return the count of all possible routes from `start` to `finish`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
```
Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
Output: 4
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we revisit the same city multiple times if fuel allows?
   - Yes.

2. Is the fuel consumption strictly based on the absolute difference in locations' positions?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming with memoization.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. **State Representation**:
    - Define a memoization table `dp` where `dp[i][f]` represents the number of ways to reach city `finish` starting from city `i` with `f` units of fuel.

2. **Transition**:
    - From city `i` with `f` units of fuel, for every other city `j`, if `|locations[i] - locations[j]| <= f`, you can move to city `j` which will decrease the fuel by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`.

3. **Base Case**:
    - When reaching `finish`, any amount of fuel left counts as one valid way.

4. **Recurrence Relation**:
    - Sum all the ways to go from `i` to `finish` through every possible next city `j` with enough fuel to make the trip.

5. **Modulo**:
    - Use the modulo `10^9 + 7` at each addition to ensure the numbers do not get too large.

### Time Complexity:
- With `n` locations and `F` fuel, the complexity is `O(n * F * n)` considering each city and each fuel level.

## Code

```python
def countRoutes(locations, start, finish, fuel):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(locations)
    
    # Memoization table to store results
    memo = [[-1] * (fuel + 1) for _ in range(n)]
    
    def dp(curr, remaining_fuel):
        # If we reached the destination
        if remaining_fuel < 0:
            return 0
        if memo[curr][remaining_fuel] != -1:
            return memo[curr][remaining_fuel]
        
        count = 1 if curr == finish else 0
        
        for next_city in range(n):
            if next_city != curr:
                fuel_needed = abs(locations[curr] - locations[next_city])
                if remaining_fuel >= fuel_needed:
                    count = (count + dp(next_city, remaining_fuel - fuel_needed)) % MOD
        
        memo[curr][remaining_fuel] = count
        return count
    
    return dp(start, fuel)

# Example
locations = [2, 3, 6, 8, 4]
start = 1
finish = 3
fuel = 5
print(countRoutes(locations, start, finish, fuel))  # Output: 4
```

This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently count all possible routes from the `start` city to the `finish` city with the given fuel constraints.
