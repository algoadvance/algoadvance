title:  Find First Palindromic String in the Array-out
permalink: /s2108
---

Given an array of strings `words`, find the first palindromic string in the array. A string is considered palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward. If there is no such string, return an empty string `""`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the palindrome check be case-sensitive?
   - Yes, by default, the problem is case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.

2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of the array and the strings within it?
   - It is typically reasonable to assume that the array length and each string length will fit within typical problem constraints (e.g., thousands of elements and lengths).

### Code

```python
def first_palindromic_string(words):
    for word in words:
        if word == word[::-1]:  # Check if word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse
            return word
    return ""

# Example usage:
# words = ["abc", "car", "ada", "racecar", "cool"]
# print(first_palindromic_string(words))  # Output: "ada"
```

### Strategy

1. **Iteration through the Array**: Loop through each word in the given list of strings.
2. **Check for Palindrome**: For each word, check if the word is a palindrome by comparing the word with its reverse (`word[::-1]`).
3. **Return the First Palindrome**: Once a palindrome is found, immediately return it.
4. **Handle No Palindrome Case**: If no palindrome is found after checking all words, return an empty string.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \( O(n \cdot m) \), where \( n \) is the number of words in the list, and \( m \) is the average length of the words. This is because for each of the \( n \) words, checking if it is a palindrome involves comparing \( m \) characters.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for storing intermediary variables, though some additional space is used to store the reversed string, which also scales with the length of the words.
