title:  Number of Matching Subsequences-out
permalink: /s792
---

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return the number of `words[i]` that are subsequences of `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are subsequences of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `words` contain duplicate strings?
   - Yes, but they should still be counted individually.
   
2. Is `s` always guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, you can assume `s` is not empty.

3. Can we assume that all characters in `s` and `words` are lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, we can assume that.

4. What are the constraints on the inputs?
   - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
   - `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
   - `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`

## Strategy

The naive approach would involve checking each word in `words` against `s` to see if it is a subsequence. This involves iterating over both the string `s` and each word in `words`, which may not be efficient for larger inputs. Instead, a more efficient approach can involve the following steps:

1. **Preprocess the string `s`:** Create a mapping from each character to all its positions in `s`.
2. **Subsequence Matching:** For each word in `words`, use the preprocessed mapping to check if the word can be constructed by following the increasing order of indices.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Preprocess `s`:**
    - Create a dictionary `pos` where each key is a character, and the value is a list of indices where this character appears in `s`.
2. **Check for Subsequences:**
    - For each word in `words`, use the `pos` dictionary to find positions of characters in `s` and ensure they appear in increasing order.

This approach ensures that each character lookup in `s` is done in logarithmic time relative to the length of `s`, resulting in a more efficient solution.

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing `s`:** O(n), where n is the length of `s`.
- **Checking each word:** For each word in `words`, the lookup steps take O(k log n) where k is the length of the word, leading to O(m * k log n) for all words (m being the number of words).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n + m * k log n)**, which is efficient given the constraints.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import bisect

def numMatchingSubseq(s, words):
    # Create a dictionary to map each character to a list of indices where they appear in `s`
    pos = defaultdict(list)
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        pos[char].append(i)
    
    def is_subsequence(word):
        # Current index in `s` to match characters of `word`
        prev_index = -1
        for char in word:
            if char not in pos:
                return False
            # Use binary search to find the smallest index in pos[char] which is greater than prev_index
            indices = pos[char]
            idx = bisect.bisect_right(indices, prev_index)
            if idx == len(indices):
                return False
            prev_index = indices[idx]
        return True
    
    # Count the number of words that are subsequences of `s`
    return sum(is_subsequence(word) for word in words)
```

This code efficiently counts the number of subsequences in `s` for the list of `words`.
