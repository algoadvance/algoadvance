title:  Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists-out
permalink: /s632
---

You have `k` lists of sorted integers. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the input and output?**
   - **Input:** A list of `k` lists of sorted integers.
   - **Output:** A list of two integers representing the smallest range [start, end].

2. **Can there be duplicate numbers within a list or across lists?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate numbers both within a list and across lists.

3. **Will the lists always be non-empty?**
   - Yes, each list will contain at least one integer.

4. **Is there a constraint on the size of the lists?**
   - Each list can have a varying number of elements, and the overall problem should be solvable with an efficient solution.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to utilize a min-heap along with pointers to identify the smallest range. Hereâ€™s the detailed strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a min-heap to keep track of the current smallest elements from each list.
   - Also, keep track of the maximum current element to compute the range dynamically.

2. **Heap Operations:**
   - Populate the heap initially with the first element of each list. Store both the value and the index of the list it came from.
   - Track the current maximum element among these first elements.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - Continuously extract the minimum element from the heap (smallest element among the currently considered elements from each list).
   - Calculate the current range ([smallest, max_so_far]) and update the smallest range if the current range is smaller.
   - Move the pointer in the list of the extracted element to the next element and push the new value into the heap.
   - Update the maximum value if the new value is larger than the current max.

4. **Termination:**
   - The process stops when any list is exhausted (i.e., you can no longer push an element from that list).

### Code

```python
import heapq

def smallestRange(nums):
    min_heap = []
    current_max = float('-inf')
    
    # Initialize the heap
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (nums[i][0], i, 0))
        current_max = max(current_max, nums[i][0])
    
    smallest_range = [float('-inf'), float('inf')]
    
    while min_heap:
        min_elem, i, j = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # Check if we have a smaller range
        if current_max - min_elem < smallest_range[1] - smallest_range[0]:
            smallest_range = [min_elem, current_max]
        
        if j + 1 < len(nums[i]):
            next_elem = nums[i][j + 1]
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (next_elem, i, j + 1))
            current_max = max(current_max, next_elem)
        else:
            break
    
    return smallest_range

# Example usage:
# nums = [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
# print(smallestRange(nums)) # Output: [20, 24]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** \(O(K)\) for inserting the first element of each list into the heap.
- **Heap Operations:** Each insertion and extraction from the heap takes \(O(\log K)\).
- **Total Operations:** The total number of operations will be proportional to the number of elements across all lists, denoted by N. Each element is pushed and popped from the heap once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(N \log K)\), where N is the total number of elements across all `k` lists.
