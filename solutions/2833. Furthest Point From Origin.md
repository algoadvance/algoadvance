title:  Furthest Point From Origin-out
permalink: /s2833
---

You are given a string `moves` of length `n` representing the moves of an object in the coordinate plane. The object starts at the origin `(0, 0)`, and each character in the string represents a move:
- 'L' signifies a move one unit left (decreasing the x-coordinate)
- 'R' signifies a move one unit right (increasing the x-coordinate)
- 'U' signifies a move one unit up (increasing the y-coordinate)
- 'D' signifies a move one unit down (decreasing the y-coordinate)

You need to determine the Manhattan distance of the object's furthest point from the origin after performing all the moves.

The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the string `moves` always be non-empty?**
   - For the purpose of this problem, let's assume that the input will always be non-null and non-empty.

2. **Do the moves only consist of 'L', 'R', 'U', and 'D'?**
   - Yes, we assume the string only contains valid move characters as specified.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string `moves`?**
   - We'll assume the given length of the string `moves` is within a reasonable limit for computation in a coding interview setting.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Starting Position:**
   - Initialize `x` and `y` to `0` representing the starting coordinates.
   
2. **Iterate Through Moves:**
   - For each move in the string, update the coordinates `(x, y)` accordingly:
     - 'L' decreases the x-coordinate.
     - 'R' increases the x-coordinate.
     - 'U' increases the y-coordinate.
     - 'D' decreases the y-coordinate.
   
3. **Calculate Manhattan Distance:**
   - After processing all moves, calculate the Manhattan distance from the origin using the formula `|x| + |y|`.

### Code

```python
def furthest_point_from_origin(moves: str) -> int:
    x, y = 0, 0
    
    for move in moves:
        if move == 'L':
            x -= 1
        elif move == 'R':
            x += 1
        elif move == 'U':
            y += 1
        elif move == 'D':
            y -= 1
    
    return abs(x) + abs(y)

# Example usage:
moves = "LURDURD"
print(furthest_point_from_origin(moves))  # Output calculation based on the moves
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `moves`. This is because we iterate through each character in the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only use a fixed amount of additional space to store the coordinates `x` and `y`.
