### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**:
    - Are all numbers in the input array unique?
    - What is the range of values for the numbers in the input array and the length of the array?

2. **Output Format**:
    - Should the result be returned as a single integer representing the number of possible binary trees?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - We need to find the number of binary trees we can form using values from the input array such that each node value is a product of any two node values from the tree.
    - For example, given an array `[2, 4]`, we can form the trees `2` and `4(2,2)`.

2. **Steps**:
    - Sort the array to make the processing simpler.
    - Use dynamic programming to count the number of binary trees that can be formed with each element as the root.
    - Use a dictionary to store the number of ways to form a tree with a particular root.
    - Iterate through the sorted array, and for each element, iteratively check every pair `(x, y)` such that `x * y = element`.
    - Sum up all possible trees considering all valid pairs for each element.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a dictionary `dp` where `dp[x]` represents the number of binary trees with root `x`.
    - Initialize each `dp[x]` to 1 to account for the single node tree.
    - Iterate through each element in the sorted array and check for pairs `(a, b)` such that `a * b = element`.
        - For each valid pair, multiply the number of trees that can be formed with roots `a` and `b` (`dp[a] * dp[b]`).
        - Keep a running total and add it to `dp[element]`.
    - The final result is the sum of all values in the `dp` dictionary modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```python
def numFactoredBinaryTrees(arr):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    arr.sort()
    dp = {}
    
    for num in arr:
        dp[num] = 1  # Each number can at least form a single node tree by itself.
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        for j in range(i):
            if num % arr[j] == 0:  # arr[j] is the left child
                right = num // arr[j]
                if right in dp:
                    dp[num] = (dp[num] + dp[arr[j]] * dp[right]) % MOD

    return sum(dp.values()) % MOD

# Example usage
arr = [2, 4, 5, 10]
print(numFactoredBinaryTrees(arr))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Main loop**: Each number is processed and for each number, we're checking pairs up to `n`, resulting in a nested loop which is `O(n^2)`.
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n^2)` due to the nested loop after sorting.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently calculates the number of binary trees with factors using dynamic programming while adhering to the constraints and providing an optimal solution.
