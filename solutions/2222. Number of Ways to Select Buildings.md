title:  Number of Ways to Select Buildings-out
permalink: /s2222
---

You are given a binary string `s`, which represents a row of buildings, where:

- '0' represents an office building.
- '1' represents a residential building.

You want to select exactly three buildings, such that the selected buildings meet the following criteria:
- The selected buildings are in the order of '0', '1', '0'.

Return the number of ways to select three buildings.

Example:
```
Input: s = "001101"
Output: 6
Explanation: Following are the ways:
             0 at index 0, 1 at index 2, 0 at index 3
             0 at index 0, 1 at index 2, 0 at index 5
             0 at index 0, 1 at index 3, 0 at index 5
             0 at index 1, 1 at index 2, 0 at index 3
             0 at index 1, 1 at index 2, 0 at index 5
             0 at index 1, 1 at index 3, 0 at index 5
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the indices in the string guaranteed to be within some reasonable bounds?
2. Can we assume that the input string only contains '0's and '1's?
3. Should the substring '010' be strictly non-overlapping or can overlapping substrings be considered?

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage prefix sums to keep track of counts of '0's and '1's before and after each position, and then use these counts to determine the number of valid building triplets '0-1-0'. Here’s the approach we’ll follow:

1. Traverse the string from left to right to calculate prefix sums for the number of '0's before each position.
2. Traverse the string from right to left to calculate suffix sums for the number of '0's after each position.
3. Iterate through each position of the string, and whenever the position `i` contains '1', use the prefix and suffix arrays to calculate the number of '0's before and after this position to find all the valid '0-1-0' triplets.

## Code

```python
def numberOfWays(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    prefix_zeroes = [0] * n
    suffix_zeroes = [0] * n
    
    # Compute prefix sums for zeroes
    count_0 = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            count_0 += 1
        prefix_zeroes[i] = count_0
    
    # Compute suffix sums for zeroes
    count_0 = 0
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            count_0 += 1
        suffix_zeroes[i] = count_0
    
    ways = 0
    
    # Iterate through each '1' in the string and use counts from prefix and suffix arrays
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            ways += prefix_zeroes[i] * (suffix_zeroes[i] - (s[i] == '0'))
    
    return ways

# Example usage
s = "001101"
print(numberOfWays(s))  # Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we make three linear passes over the string:
1. To compute the prefix sums.
2. To compute the suffix sums.
3. To count the number of valid '0-1-0' triplets.

Thus, the solution is efficient and suitable for reasonably large input sizes.
