Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, return a list of all the **powerful integers** that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

A **powerful integer** is an integer that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` (where `i` >= 0 and `j` >= 0).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique.

**Example:**
```
Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
Explanation:
2 = 2^0 + 3^0
3 = 2^1 + 3^0
4 = 2^0 + 3^1
5 = 2^1 + 3^1
7 = 2^2 + 3^1
9 = 2^3 + 3^0
10 = 2^2 + 3^2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can x or y be 1?**
   Yes, `x` and `y` can be 1. If either is 1, the terms involving that variable will be limited.

2. **Do we need to account for cases where bound is 0 or negative?**
   It is unnecessary to consider these cases, as they wouldn't produce meaningful results within the context.

3. **How large can x, y, and bound be?**
   We can assume the numbers are reasonably large but manageable within Python's constraints. Typically, these values could be on the order of up to `10^4`.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through Powers:**
   - We'll start by iterating powers of `x` and `y` from `0` upwards.
   - For each combination of these powers, calculate `x^i + y^j`.

2. **Check Bound:**
   - If the sum is within the specified bound, add it to a set to ensure unique entries.

3. **Stop Conditions:**
   - Stop iterating when the power of `x` exceeds the bound or the sum exceeds the bound.
   - Similarly for `y`.

4. **Result:**
   - Convert the set of results to a list and return it.

## Code

```python
def powerfulIntegers(x, y, bound):
    result = set()
    
    if bound < 2:
        return []
    
    i = 0
    while x ** i <= bound:
        j = 0
        while y ** j <= bound:
            value = x ** i + y ** j
            if value <= bound:
                result.add(value)
            else:
                break
            if y == 1:
                break
            j += 1
        if x == 1:
            break
        i += 1
    
    return list(result)

# Example usage:
print(powerfulIntegers(2, 3, 10))   # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is driven by the levels of iteration. Assuming `log_n` steps based on powers:
- The outer loop runs `O(log(bound) / log(x))` times.
- The inner loop runs `O(log(bound) / log(y))` times.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(log(bound) / log(x) * log(bound) / log(y))`.

In practice, this double logarithmic construction ensures that the solution is efficient even for reasonably large bounds.
