title:  Number of Employees Who Met the Target-out
permalink: /s2798

You are given a list of integers, `hours`, where each integer represents the number of hours an employee has worked in a week. You are also given an integer `target` which represents the target number of hours an employee needs to meet or exceed. Your task is to write a function that returns the number of employees who have met or exceeded the target number of hours.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def number_of_employees_met_target(hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the `hours` list contain negative numbers?
   - **A:** No, the hours worked by an employee cannot be negative.
2. **Q:** What is the size limit for the `hours` list?
   - **A:** The size of the list can go up to \(10^5\).
3. **Q:** Can `target` be zero?
   - **A:** Yes, `target` can be zero, indicating that any number of hours worked would meet the target.
4. **Q:** Will the input always be valid, i.e., no null or edge cases like very large numbers?
   - **A:** You can assume the input is valid within the reasonable constraint parameters specified.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate** through the `hours` list.
2. **Count** the number of elements in `hours` that are greater than or equal to `target`.

This approach is straightforward and leverages simple iteration and comparison, ensuring an efficient solution.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `hours` list. This is because we need to iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def number_of_employees_met_target(hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for hour in hours:
        if hour >= target:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
hours = [40, 35, 50, 45, 30]
target = 40
print(number_of_employees_met_target(hours, target))  # Output should be 3
```

This function `number_of_employees_met_target` will iterate through the `hours` list, count every hour value that meets or exceeds the `target`, and return this count. Here, we assume the `hours` list and `target` are given as input parameters.

### Example Execution

For `hours = [40, 35, 50, 45, 30]` and `target = 40`:
- We iterate through `hours`.
- `40 >= 40` -> count += 1 (count = 1)
- `35 < 40` -> count unchanged
- `50 >= 40` -> count += 1 (count = 2)
- `45 >= 40` -> count += 1 (count = 3)
- `30 < 40` -> count unchanged

The function returns 3, indicating 3 employees have met or exceeded the target of 40 hours.
