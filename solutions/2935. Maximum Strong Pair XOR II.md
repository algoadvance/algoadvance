title:  Maximum Strong Pair XOR II-out
permalink: /s2935
---

Given an array of integers `nums`, return the maximum value of `nums[i] XOR nums[j]` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range and constraints on the length of the input array?**
   - The length of the array can help us understand the possible performance bottlenecks and choose the right data structures.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers within the array?**
   - Knowing the constraints helps in designing the optimal solution and in selecting appropriate data structures.

### Code

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_number = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, num, max_bits):
        node = self.root
        for i in range(max_bits, -1, -1):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            if bit not in node.children:
                node.children[bit] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[bit]
        node.is_end_of_number = True

    def find_max_xor_pair(self, num, max_bits):
        node = self.root
        max_xor = 0
        for i in range(max_bits, -1, -1):
            bit = (num >> i) & 1
            toggled_bit = 1 - bit
            if toggled_bit in node.children:
                max_xor |= (1 << i)
                node = node.children[toggled_bit]
            else:
                node = node.children[bit]
        return max_xor

class Solution:
    def findMaximumXOR(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        max_num = max(nums)
        max_bits = max_num.bit_length() - 1
        
        trie = Trie()
        max_xor = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            # For the current number find max XOR with any of the previously processed numbers
            trie_max_xor = trie.find_max_xor_pair(num, max_bits)
            max_xor = max(max_xor, trie_max_xor)
            
            # Insert the current number into the Trie
            trie.insert(num, max_bits)
        
        return max_xor

# Example Usage:
# nums = [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.findMaximumXOR(nums))  # Output: 28
```

### Strategy

1. **Trie Data Structure:**
    - Use a Trie (prefix tree) to store the binary representation of numbers.
    - Each node in the Trie will have two children representing binary 0 and 1.

2. **Insertion into Trie:**
    - For each number in the array, traverse its binary bits from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB) and insert it into the Trie.

3. **Finding Maximum XOR Pair:**
    - For every number in the array, use the Trie to find the number that, when XORed with the current number, gives the maximum possible XOR result up to that point.
    - This is done by attempting to follow the path in the Trie that leads to maximizing the current bit position.

### Time Complexity

1. **Insertion in Trie:**
    - Inserting a number into the Trie takes O(L), where L is the number of bits in the binary representation of the maximum number in `nums`. This is because we traverse L levels for each insertion.

2. **Finding Max XOR:**
    - Finding the maximum XOR for a number similarly takes O(L) time per number.

Given that we process each number once for insertion and once for finding the max XOR, the overall time complexity is **O(N * L)**, where N is the number of elements in the array and L is the number of bits required to represent the maximum number.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity for storing the Trie is also **O(N * L)** due to the potential number of nodes created during insertion.

This solution is efficient, leveraging the Trie data structure to achieve a balance between clarity and performance.
