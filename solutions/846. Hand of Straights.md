Alice has a hand of cards, each card has a card number printed on it. Alice wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `W`, and consists of `W` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` of size `n` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `i-th` card and an integer `W`, return `true` if and only if she can rearrange the cards into groups of size `W`, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done if `n` is not a multiple of `W`?**
   - The length of the hand should be a multiple of `W` to form `W` groups. If not, return `false`.

2. **What kinds of values can the cards have?**
   - The values of the cards are integers, which can be negative, zero, or positive.

3. **Do we need to handle any specific edge cases?**
   - Yes, if `hand` is empty, the result is trivially `true`. If `W` is 1, the result is trivially `true` because each individual card can be its own group.

### Strategy

1. **Check for Trivially Impossible Cases**: If the size of the hand `n` is not a multiple of `W`, return `false` immediately.
2. **Sort the Cards**: Sorting the `hand` array will allow us to easily check for consecutive sequences.
3. **Use a Counter**: Use a counter to maintain the frequency of each card.
4. **Form Consecutive Groups**:
   - Iterate through the sorted hand array.
   - For each card, if it still needs to be placed in a group, try to form a consecutive group starting from that card.
   - Reduce the count of cards as they are placed in groups.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the `hand` array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Iterating through the array to check and form groups takes \(O(n \cdot W)\) in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \cdot W)\).

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def isNStraightHand(hand, W):
    if len(hand) % W != 0:
        return False
    
    count = Counter(hand)
    
    for num in sorted(count):
        if count[num] > 0:  # Only if the card needs to be part of a group
            card_count = count[num]
            for i in range(W):
                if count[num + i] < card_count:
                    return False
                count[num + i] -= card_count
    
    return True

# Example usage
print(isNStraightHand([1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], 3))  # Expected output: True
print(isNStraightHand([1,2,3,4,5], 4))  # Expected output: False
```

This code uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each card. It then sorts the cards and tries to form groups starting with the smallest card available. If at any point it can't form a required group, it returns `false`. If it successfully forms all required groups, it returns `true`.
