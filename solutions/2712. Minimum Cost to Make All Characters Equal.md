title:  Minimum Cost to Make All Characters Equal-out
permalink: /s2712
---
Given a string `s`, we need to ensure that all characters in the string are the same. We can change any character to match any other character. Each change has a cost equal to the absolute difference between the positions of the characters in the string. We need to determine the minimum cost to make all characters in the string equal.

### Example
```text
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: 4
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Character Set**: Are we only dealing with lowercase letters (`a-z`)?
   - Yes.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Is the cost purely based on the position difference?
   - Yes. Changing `s[i]` to `s[j]` has a cost of `|i - j|`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can follow a strategy based on choosing the most stable pivot point to minimize the total cost. This issue resembles finding a median in a list of positions:
1. Convert the string into a list of positions per character.
2. Find the median of these positions. The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations (the cost function in this problem).
3. Calculate the total cost using the median position.

### Steps:
1. Extract positions for each unique character.
2. For each character, compute the cost to make all characters same as that character.
3. Return the minimum cost.

## Code
```python
def minCostToMakeAllCharsEqual(s: str) -> int:
    def calculate_cost(positions, median):
        return sum(abs(pos - median) for pos in positions)
    
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Create a list of positions for each character
    char_positions = defaultdict(list)
    for index, char in enumerate(s):
        char_positions[char].append(index)
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Step 2: For each character's positions, find the median and compute the cost
    for char, positions in char_positions.items():
        positions.sort()  # sort the positions to find the median
        n = len(positions)
        median = positions[n // 2] if n % 2 == 1 else (positions[n // 2 - 1] + positions[n // 2]) // 2
        cost = calculate_cost(positions, median)
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

# Example usage:
s = "aabb"
print(minCostToMakeAllCharsEqual(s))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Position Gathering**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.
2. **Median Calculation**: For each character (worst case 26 characters), sorting positions list of up to length `n` would take O(n log n).
3. **Cost Calculation**: O(n) for each character type.

Overall, the time complexity is approximately O(26 * n log n) which simplifies to O(n log n) for practical purposes since 26 is a constant.

This solution is efficient and ensures that the minimum cost is computed using a strategic approach based on the median.
