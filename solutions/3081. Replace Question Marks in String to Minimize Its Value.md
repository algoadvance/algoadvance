title:  Replace Question Marks in String to Minimize Its Value-out
permalink: /s3081
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and `?` characters. You need to replace all `?` characters such that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest string and does not contain any consecutive characters that are the same.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `s` be empty?**
   - The problem description does not specify, but generally, an empty string should return an empty string.

2. **What is the maximum length of `s`?**
   - Generally, LeetCode strings can go up to 10^5 characters.

3. **Are there any special characters in `s` other than lowercase English letters and `?`?**
   - No, `s` only contains lowercase English letters and `?`.

4. **Can I always replace `?` with a lowercase English letter such that there are no consecutive same letters?**
   - Yes, if you choose the replacements carefully, it is always possible to ensure that there are no consecutive same letters.

## Strategy

1. **Traverse Through the String:**
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   
2. **Replace `?` Characters:**
   - For each `?`, choose the lexicographically smallest letter that does not match the previous or next characters. The letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' will usually suffice to handle this without conflicts.

3. **Construct the Result:**
   - Construct the resultant string as we iterate through the original string.

## Code

```python
def replaceQuestionMarks(s: str) -> str:
    s = list(s)  # Convert to list for mutability

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '?':
            for char in 'abc':  # Use 'a', 'b', 'c' to avoid conflicts
                if (i > 0 and s[i - 1] == char) or (i < len(s) - 1 and s[i + 1] == char):
                    continue
                s[i] = char
                break

    return ''.join(s)

# Example Usage
s = "?a?b?"
print(replaceQuestionMarks(s))  # Example output: "cabac" or other valid result
```

## Time Complexity

- Iterating through the string is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- For each `?`, we check up to three characters ('a', 'b', 'c'), which is a constant time operation O(1).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

This solution ensures that the resultant string is lexicographically smallest and there are no consecutive identical characters after replacing all `?` characters.
