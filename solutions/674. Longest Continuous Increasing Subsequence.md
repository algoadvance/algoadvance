title:  Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence-out
permalink: /s674
---
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e., subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.

A continuous increasing subsequence is defined as the largest subsequence where the consecutive elements are strictly increasing.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1, 3, 5] with a length of 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are all elements in the input array integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the input array contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes.
3. **What is the maximum length of the input array?**
   - The maximum length of the input array can be up to 10^4.
4. **Are there any constraints on the value of individual integers in the array?**
   - No specific constraints, integers can be of any value within standard integer limits.

### Code:

```python
def findLengthOfLCIS(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the count and max length
    max_length = 1
    current_length = 1
    
    # Iterate through the array
    for i in range(1, nums.length):
        # Check if the current element is greater than the previous element
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1  # Increment current length
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            current_length = 1  # Reset current length
    
    # After the loop ends, we must check once more to update the max_length.
    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    return max_length
```

### Strategy:
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `max_length` to track the maximum length of continuous increasing subsequence found.
   - `current_length` to track the length of the current continuous increasing subsequence.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - Start iterating from the second element (index 1).
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element, increment `current_length`.
   - If the current element is not greater than the previous element, update `max_length` if `current_length` is greater, and reset `current_length` to 1.
   
3. **Final Comparison**:
   - After the loop, there might be a case where the longest subarray ends at the last element. Hence, perform a final update check for `max_length`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We only need a single pass through the array hence it is linear.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of additional space irrespective of the input size.

This implementation ensures that we're efficiently finding the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence with optimal time and space complexity.
