title:  Palindrome Partitioning-out
permalink: /s131
---
Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: 
    - What is the length range of the input string `s`?
        - Typically, LeetCode constraints specify that `1 <= s.length <= 16`.
    - Will the input string `s` contain only lowercase English letters?
        - Yes, usually.

2. **Output format**:
    - Should the solution return lists of lists of strings?
        - Yes, it should return a list of lists where each list represents one possible palindrome partitioning.

3. **Edge cases**:
    - How should the function handle an empty string?
        - If `s` is empty, the function should return a list containing an empty list, i.e., `[[]]`.

## Strategy
1. **Backtracking Approach**:
    - Use a backtracking approach to explore all potential partitions of the string.
    - For each partition, check if the current substring is a palindrome.
    - If it is, recursively attempt to partition the remaining substring in the same way.
    - If the entire string is successfully partitioned into palindromes, add the current partition to the result.

2. **Palindrome Check Function**:
    - Create a helper function to determine if a given substring is a palindrome.

3. **Base and Recursive Cases**:
    - Base case: If we reach the end of the string, add the current path (partition) to the result list.
    - Recursive case: For each potential substring starting from the current position, if it forms a palindrome, recursively process the remaining substring.

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def partition(self, s: str):
        res = []
        
        def is_palindrome(sub):
            return sub == sub[::-1]
        
        def backtrack(start, path):
            if start == len(s):
                res.append(path[:])
                return
            for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
                substring = s[start:end]
                if is_palindrome(substring):
                    path.append(substring)
                    backtrack(end, path)
                    path.pop()
        
        backtrack(0, [])
        return res
```

## Explanation
1. **Palindrome Check**:
    ```python
    def is_palindrome(sub):
        return sub == sub[::-1]
    ```

2. **Backtracking Function (`backtrack`)**:
    - `start`: index in the string `s` from where we start trying to partition.
    - `path`: stores the current list of palindromic substrings.
    - If `start` equals the length of `s`, it means we've partitioned the entire string, so we add the current `path` to `res`.

3. We iterate over each possible ending position for a substring starting at the current `start` position.
    - If the substring from `start` to `end` is a palindrome, add it to the current path and recurse with the new start position (`end`).
    - After recursing, remove the last added substring to backtrack and explore other partitions.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is hard to quantify exactly due to the branching nature of potential partitions and palindrome checks. Generally, it can be approximated as:
    - O(N * 2^N): For each character, we may choose to partition or not partition creating exponential branching.
    - The palindrome check itself takes O(N).
- This leads to a backtrack solution with a complexity of O(N * 2^N).
