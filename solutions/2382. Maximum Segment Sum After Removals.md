title:  Maximum Segment Sum After Removals-out
permalink: /s2382
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer array `removeQueries`, both of length `n`. For the `i`-th query, the value of `removeQueries[i]` is the index of the element in `nums` that we remove in the `i`-th query. After each removal, the maximum segment sum of the array should be computed. Once an element is removed from the array, it is no longer considered part of any segment (contiguous subarray).

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the maximum segment sum after the removal of the element `nums[removeQueries[i]]`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
1. After removing the 0th element, the array becomes [2,5,6,1]. The maximum segment sum is 14.
2. After removing the 3rd element, the array becomes [2,5,6]. The maximum segment sum is 13.
3. After removing the 2nd element, the array becomes [2,6]. The maximum segment sum is 8.
4. After removing the 4th element, the array becomes [2,6]. The maximum segment sum is 8.
5. After removing the 1st element, the array becomes [6]. The maximum segment sum is 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if the array becomes empty (all elements are removed)?**
   - Return `0` for the remaining items in `answer`.
   
2. **Are the elements in `removeQueries` unique and valid indices?**
   - Yes, they should cover all indices exactly once.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Computation**: Compute the total sum of the array `nums`, which represents the segment sum before any removal.
2. **DSU/Union-Find with Intervals**: We can use a union-find (disjoint-set) data structure to manage the merging of segments dynamically.
3. **HashSet for Tracking**:
   - Track which elements have been removed.
   - After each removal, check the segments formed using union-find and compute the maximum segment sum dynamically.

### Pseudocode Steps:
1. Initialize `current_sum` to the sum of `nums`.
2. Initialize a list to store the segment sums.
3. Use a union-find data structure to handle dynamic connectivity.
4. Iterate through each `removeQuery`, adjust the current segment sums dynamically and store the maximum current segment sum after each removal.

### Code
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [0] * size
        self.sum = [0] * size

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]
    
    def union(self, u, v):
        u_root = self.find(u)
        v_root = self.find(v)
        if u_root != v_root:
            if self.rank[u_root] > self.rank[v_root]:
                self.parent[v_root] = u_root
                self.sum[u_root] += self.sum[v_root]
            elif self.rank[u_root] < self.rank[v_root]:
                self.parent[u_root] = v_root
                self.sum[v_root] += self.sum[u_root]
            else:
                self.parent[v_root] = u_root
                self.sum[u_root] += self.sum[v_root]
                self.rank[u_root] += 1
            return True
        return False
    
    def add_to_set(self, u, value):
        u_root = self.find(u)
        self.sum[u_root] += value

def maximumSegmentSum(nums, removeQueries):
    n = len(nums)
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    answer = [0] * n
    max_sum = 0
    
    for i in reversed(removeQueries):
        uf.sum[i] = nums[i]
        if i > 0 and uf.sum[i - 1] > 0:
            uf.union(i, i - 1)
        if i < n - 1 and uf.sum[i + 1] > 0:
            uf.union(i, i + 1)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, uf.sum[uf.find(i)])
        answer[i] = max_sum
        
    return answer

# Testing the implementation with the provided example
nums = [1, 2, 5, 6, 1]
removeQueries = [0, 3, 2, 4, 1]
print(maximumSegmentSum(nums, removeQueries))
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: \(O(n)\)
- **Union-Find Operations**: Almost \(O(1)\) per operation due to path compression and union by rank, leading to \(O(n)\) for all operations.
- **Total Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) which should be efficient for the input size constraints in typical interview settings.
