title:  Kth Largest Element in a Stream-out
permalink: /s703

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the stream finite, and what are its characteristics (size, range of values)?**
2. **Can elements be added dynamically to the stream?**
3. **How frequently do we need to query the Kth largest element?**
4. **What is the acceptable time complexity for adding elements and querying the Kth largest element?**

Usually, the problem description on platforms like LeetCode will provide sufficient details that:
- You will be given an initial list of integers.
- You need to design a class that allows adding new integers to the stream.
- Each addition operation will also provide the Kth largest element in the stream.

### Strategy:

We will use a min-heap (priority queue) of fixed size `k` to efficiently track the Kth largest element.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a min-heap with the first `k` elements.
   - If there are fewer than `k` elements initially, initialize the heap with all elements.
2. **Adding New Elements:**
   - If the heap contains fewer than `k` elements, add the new element directly to the heap.
   - Otherwise, compare the new element with the smallest element (root of the heap):
     - If the new element is larger, replace the smallest element with the new element.
3. **Fetching the Kth Largest Element:**
   - The Kth largest element will always be the root of the min-heap.

### Code:

```python
import heapq

class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: list):
        self.k = k
        self.min_heap = []
        for num in nums:
            self.add(num)

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        if len(self.min_heap) < self.k:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, val)
        elif val > self.min_heap[0]:
            heapq.heapreplace(self.min_heap, val)
        
        return self.min_heap[0]

# Example usage:
# kthLargest = KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2])
# print(kthLargest.add(3))  # returns 4
# print(kthLargest.add(5))  # returns 5
# print(kthLargest.add(10))  # returns 5
# print(kthLargest.add(9))  # returns 8
# print(kthLargest.add(4))  # returns 8
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Building the initial heap with `n` elements where `n` is the number of elements: `O(n log k)`.
2. **Adding an Element:**
   - Adding an element to the heap of size `k`: `O(log k)`.
3. **Fetching the Kth Largest Element:**
   - Fetching the minimum element in the heap (Kth largest element): `O(1)`.

### Summary:

- The `KthLargest` class maintains a min-heap of size `k` to keep track of the Kth largest element efficiently.
- The `add` method ensures we maintain the correct heap size and immediately provide the Kth largest element after each insertion.
