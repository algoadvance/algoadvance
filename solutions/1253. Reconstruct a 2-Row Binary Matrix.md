title:  Reconstruct a 2-Row Binary Matrix-out
permalink: /s1253
---

You have a matrix with 2 rows and some number of columns. Given an array `colsum` where `colsum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the i-th column (i.e., the sum of the elements in the i-th column of the matrix), return any binary matrix that satisfies the given `colsum`.

The matrix should:

1. Have the sum of the elements in the i-th column equal to `colsum[i]`.
2. Have exactly two rows.
3. Only contain 0s and 1s.

If there are multiple answers, you can return any of them. If no such matrix exists, return an empty list.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
upper = 2
lower = 3
colsum = [2, 2, 1, 1]
```

**Output:**
```
[[1, 1, 0, 0], 
 [1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `colsum` contain values other than 0, 1, or 2? 
    - No, `colsum` contains only 0, 1, and 2.
2. Is it guaranteed that a solution will exist for every possible input?
    - No, if it's not possible to create such a matrix, we should return an empty list.

## Strategy

1. Initialize two lists `row1` and `row2` with the length of `colsum` and fill them with zeros.
2. Traverse through the elements in `colsum` and for each element:
    - If `colsum[i]` is 2, then place 1 at both `row1[i]` and `row2[i]`, and decrement both `upper` and `lower`.
    - If `colsum[i]` is 1, then check which of `upper` or `lower` is still greater than 0 and place the 1 accordingly, then decrement the respective `upper` or `lower`.
3. After processing all elements in `colsum`, if both `upper` and `lower` are zero, return the matrix `[row1, row2]`; otherwise, return an empty list because it's not possible to construct the required matrix.

## Code

```python
def reconstructMatrix(upper, lower, colsum):
    n = len(colsum)
    row1 = [0] * n
    row2 = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        if colsum[i] == 2:
            row1[i] = 1
            row2[i] = 1
            upper -= 1
            lower -= 1
        elif colsum[i] == 1:
            if upper > lower:
                row1[i] = 1
                upper -= 1
            else:
                row2[i] = 1
                lower -= 1
    
    if upper == 0 and lower == 0:
        return [row1, row2]
    return []

# Testing the function with the given example
upper = 2
lower = 3
colsum = [2, 2, 1, 1]
print(reconstructMatrix(upper, lower, colsum))
# Expected Output: [[1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of `colsum`. This is because we are traversing through the `colsum` list only once to fill `row1` and `row2`.
