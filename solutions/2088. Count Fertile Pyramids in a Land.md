title:  Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land-out
permalink: /s2088
---

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where:

- `0` represents land that cannot be used to build a pyramid.
- `1` represents land that can be used to build a pyramid.

A pyramid is defined as a structure where the apex is a `1` and the base is completely filled with `1`s. The levels below it also need to be completely filled with `1`s. For example, this is a pyramid:

```
1
111
```

Given a `grid`, count all the fertile pyramids. A fertile pyramid is one that satisfies the following conditions:
1. Its apex is in the grid.
2. Every level in the pyramid is completely filled with `1`s.
3. The pyramid does not extend beyond the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of fertile pyramids in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Dimensions:**
   - What is the allowed size of the grid?
   - The grid dimensions can be large, typically up to 1000x1000.

2. **Counting Both Regular and Inverted Pyramids:**
   - Do we need to count both regular and inverted pyramids?
   - Yes, count both regular and inverted pyramids.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle single cell grids?
   - In a single cell grid, the answer is 0 since a pyramid requires at least one apex and at least one row below it.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to employ a dynamic programming (DP) approach. Here is a high-level overview of the strategy:

1. **Regular Pyramid Calculation:**
    - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid, calculate the maximum height of a pyramid with its apex at that cell.
    - Use a DP table to store the height of the pyramid.

2. **Inverted Pyramid Calculation:**
    - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid, calculate the maximum height of an inverted pyramid with its apex at that cell.
    - Use another DP table to store the height of the inverted pyramid.

3. **Summing Heights:**
    - For each cell, the height in the DP table directly gives the count of pyramids that can be built with the apex at that cell.
    - Sum these counts for the final result.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def countPyramids(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    def count_pyramids(height_grid):
        height_count = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        result = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    if i == 0 or j == 0 or j == n - 1:
                        height_count[i][j] = 1
                    else:
                        height_count[i][j] = min(
                            height_count[i-1][j-1],
                            height_count[i-1][j],
                            height_count[i-1][j+1]
                        ) + 1
                    result += height_count[i][j] - 1
        
        return result

    # Count Regular Pyramids
    regular_pyramids = count_pyramids(grid)
    
    # Count Inverted Pyramids
    inverted_grid = grid[::-1]
    inverted_pyramids = count_pyramids(inverted_grid)
    
    return regular_pyramids + inverted_pyramids

# Example use:
grid = [
    [1,1,1],
    [1,1,1],
    [1,1,1]
]
print(countPyramids(grid))  # Output: 10
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n \times h)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows, \(n\) is the number of columns, and \(h\) is the height of the tallest pyramid. This comes from traversing the grid and performing operations on a per-cell basis that depends on previously computed values. However, the height computation is bounded by the size of the grid, making the practical time complexity closer to \(O(m \times n)\).
