title:  Prison Cells After N Days-out
permalink: /s957
---

There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant. Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied the next day; otherwise, it becomes vacant.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days have passed.

**Example:**

```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
```

**Note:**

1. cells.length == 8
2. cells[i] is either 0 or 1
3. 1 <= N <= 10^9

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the initial states guaranteed to have exactly 8 cells?
   - Yes, as the problem statement specifies that there are always 8 prison cells.
2. Can N be any number up to 1 billion?
   - Yes, as stated that 1 <= N <= 10^9.

## Strategy

1. Understand the pattern: Given the cyclic nature of the problem, after certain days the patterns of the cell might start repeating. This will help to optimize for large values of N.
2. Use a hashmap (or dictionary) to detect cycles. Map the current state of the cells and store the day it first appeared.
3. Upon detecting a cycle, we can reduce the number of days `N` by calculating the effective days using the cycle length.

The steps are as follows:
1. Process each day's change in the cells' state.
2. Check if the current state has been seen before:
    - If so, compute the cycle length and use it to reduce `N`.
    - If not, continue simulating until the cycle is detected or N days are simulated.
3. After computing the cycle, simply determine the final state using the modulus of `N` and the cycle length.

## Code

```python
def prisonAfterNDays(cells, N):
    seen = {}
    
    while N > 0:
        state_key = tuple(cells)
        
        if state_key in seen:
            cycle_length = seen[state_key] - N
            N %= cycle_length
        seen[state_key] = N
        
        if N > 0:
            N -= 1
            cells = nextDayCells(cells)
    
    return cells

def nextDayCells(cells):
    new_cells = [0] * 8
    for i in range(1, 7):
        new_cells[i] = 1 if cells[i-1] == cells[i+1] else 0
    return new_cells
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) per each simulated day since the cells' count is fixed at 8. If cycles are detected early, the overall complexity can be highly reduced to O(1) for large N due to the modular arithmetic.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^8) in the worst case for storing seen states in the dictionary, which is effectively constant due to the limited number of unique states (256 possible states).

This algorithm effectively combines cycle detection with a state transition simulation and ensures that we can handle the large inputs efficiently.
