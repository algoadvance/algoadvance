title:  Sort Characters By Frequency-out
permalink: /s451
---

Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return the sorted string. 

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "tree"`
   Output: `"eert"`

2. Input: `s = "cccaaa"`
   Output: `"aaaccc"`

3. Input: `s = "Aabb"`
   Output: `"bbAa"`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the casing (uppercase/lowercase) matter?
   - Yes, case matters, meaning 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters.

2. If multiple characters have the same frequency, can their order be arbitrary in the output?
   - Yes, their order can be arbitrary in the output.

## Strategy

1. **Character Frequency Calculation**: Use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the characters based on their frequency in descending order.
3. **Reconstruct the String**: Reconstruct the string by repeating each character as per its frequency and concatenate them to form the result.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Import the `Counter` from `collections`.
2. Count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
3. Create a list of characters sorted by their frequency in descending order.
4. Build the result string by multiplying characters by their frequency and joining them together.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def frequencySort(s: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character
    frequency = Counter(s)
    
    # Step 2: Sort the characters based on their frequency in descending order
    sorted_chars = sorted(frequency, key=lambda x: (-frequency[x], x))
    
    # Step 3: Reconstruct the string
    result = ''.join([char * frequency[char] for char in sorted_chars])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(frequencySort("tree"))    # Output: "eert"
print(frequencySort("cccaaa"))  # Output: "aaaccc"
print(frequencySort("Aabb"))    # Output: "bbAa"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Sorting**: `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of unique characters (at most this is 62, for 26 lowercase + 26 uppercase + 10 digits, thus this can be considered O(1)).
- **Reconstructing String**: `O(n)` since we concatenate `n` characters.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log m + n)` which simplifies to `O(n log m)` and can be approximated to `O(n)` given that `m` is a constant (bounded by 62).
