title:  Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation-out
permalink: /s1237
---

You are given a function `f(x, y)` and the goal is to find all pairs of positive integers `(x, y)` such that `f(x, y) == z` where `z` is a given integer.

The function `f(x, y)` is a monotonic function which means that:

1. For any fixed `x`, `f(x, y)` strictly increases with increasing `y`.
2. For any fixed `y`, `f(x, y)` strictly increases with increasing `x`.

We need to create a list of all possible pairs `(x, y)` such that `f(x, y) == z`.

Here, the function `f` is encapsulated in a callable class `CustomFunction` that has a method `f(x, y)`.

```python
class CustomFunction:
    # Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integers x and y.
    def f(self, x, y):
        pass
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of possible values for `x` and `y`?  
   This is typically given as `1 <= x, y <= 1000`, but for an optimal solution, we'll assume that the constraints can be handled reasonably within this range.

2. What is the input format?  
   We are given an integer `z` and a `CustomFunction` object that can compute `f(x, y)`.

### Strategy

Given that the function `f` is monotonic, we can use a two-pointer approach to find the solutions efficiently.

**Approach:**

1. Initialize `x` to 1 and `y` to a high value (e.g., 1000).
2. Compute `f(x, y)`.
3. If `f(x, y) < z`, increment `x`.
4. If `f(x, y) > z`, decrement `y`.
5. If `f(x, y) == z`, add `(x, y)` to the result and adjust pointers.
6. Stop when pointers go out of the valid range.

This approach ensures that we are checking the pairs efficiently without redundant calculations.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
class CustomFunction:
    # Dummy function for illustration; the actual implementation will be provided by the problem.
    def f(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        return x + y  # Example monotonic function (this will not be part of the actual solution)

def findSolution(customfunction: CustomFunction, z: int):
    results = []
    x, y = 1, 1000  # Start with x at minimum and y at maximum value
    
    while x <= 1000 and y >= 1:
        value = customfunction.f(x, y)
        if value == z:
            results.append([x, y])
            x += 1
            y -= 1
        elif value < z:
            x += 1
        else:  # value > z
            y -= 1
    
    return results

# Example usage
# custom_function = CustomFunction()
# z = 5
# print(findSolution(custom_function, z))
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, and in the worst case, it will make at most `1000 + 1000` comparisons (one for each increment or decrement of the pointers).
- Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the maximum value of `x` and `y`, typically 1000.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) excluding the space used for the result list.

This approach ensures the solution is both time-efficient and straightforward to implement.
