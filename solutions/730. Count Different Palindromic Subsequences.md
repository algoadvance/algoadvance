title:  Count Different Palindromic Subsequences-out
permalink: /s730
---

Given a string `s`, return _the number of different non-empty palindromic subsequences in_ `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a sequence that can be derived from the string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` is less than or equal to 1000.

2. **What characters does the string `s` consist of?**
   - The characters in `s` consist of only lowercase English letters.

3. **Should single-character subsequences be counted as palindromic subsequences?**
   - Yes, single characters are considered palindromic sequences as they read the same forward and backward.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We'll use dynamic programming (DP) to incrementally build up the count of palindromic subsequences for substrings of `s`.
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the number of distinct palindromic subsequences in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
   - To fill the DP table, we consider substrings of increasing lengths:
     - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then palindromic subsequences can be built by:
       - Taking the palindromic subsequences within the substring `s[i+1:j]` (let's call this set `A`).
       - Adding the character `s[i]` to each palindromic subsequence in `A` to form new palindromic subsequences.
       - Counting the characters `s[i]` and `s[j]` themselves as palindromic subsequences.
     - If `s[i] != s[j]`, then palindromic subsequences can be built by considering the subsequences in the subproblems `s[i:j]` and `s[i+1:j+1]` and subtracting the intersecting subsequences in `s[i+1:j]`.

### Code

```python
def countPalindromicSubsequences(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1  # Every single character is a palindrome

    for length in range(2, n+1):  # consider substrings of length 2 to n
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                l, r = i + 1, j - 1
                while l <= r and s[l] != s[i]:
                    l += 1
                while l <= r and s[r] != s[i]:
                    r -= 1
                if l > r:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] * 2 + 2
                elif l == r:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] * 2 + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] * 2 - dp[l+1][r-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j-1] - dp[i+1][j-1]

            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + MOD) % MOD  # ensure non-negative result

    return dp[0][n-1]

# Example Usage
s = "bccb"
print(countPalindromicSubsequences(s))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n^3)**. This comes from the three nested loops used:
  - One to control the substring length.
  - One to control the starting index `i` of the substring.
  - One (inside the conditional block) to find the first and last occurrence of the character `s[i]` within the substring.
  
- The space complexity is **O(n^2)** due to the `dp` table storing results for all substrings.
