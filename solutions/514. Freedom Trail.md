You are given a string `ring` of lowercase letters and another string `key` of lowercase letters. In the ring, there are several characters, each of which may appear multiple times. You need to spell the word `key` by rotating the ring either clockwise or counterclockwise to align characters from the ring with the 12:00 position, then pressing a button to select the character under the 12:00 position. Each rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) takes 1 unit of time, and selecting a character takes 1 unit of time.

The goal is to find the minimum number of steps required to spell the word `key`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `ring` or `key` is an empty string?
   - Are there any constraints on the lengths of `ring` and `key`?
   
2. **Multiple Occurrences**:
   - How do we handle characters that appear multiple times in the `ring`?

3. **Initial Position**:
   - Do we start at the 'a' character, or any specific starting position in the `ring`?

For this problem, let's assume the following:
- The length of `ring` will be between 1 and 100.
- The length of `key` will be between 1 and 100.
- Both `ring` and `key` contain only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: 
   - Use dynamic programming to store intermediate results and avoid recalculating the same state multiple times.
   - Use a dictionary to map each character in the `ring` to its indices for quick access.

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore each step where we align each character in `key` with a corresponding position in the `ring`.
   - For each character match, consider both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations to find the minimum steps.
   
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Calculate the steps for each possible alignment and choose the minimum as it progresses through the `key`.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Store the minimal steps required to reach each state to avoid re-computation.

### Code

```python
def findRotateSteps(ring: str, key: str) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    import functools

    # Map each character in ring to list of indices
    char_to_index = defaultdict(list)
    for i, ch in enumerate(ring):
        char_to_index[ch].append(i)

    n = len(ring)
    
    @functools.lru_cache(None)
    def dp(pos, k):
        if k == len(key):
            return 0
        min_steps = float('inf')
        for index in char_to_index[key[k]]:
            # Calculate distance clockwise and counterclockwise
            distance = min(abs(pos - index), n - abs(pos - index))
            # +1 for pressing the button
            steps = distance + 1 + dp(index, k + 1)
            min_steps = min(min_steps, steps)
        return min_steps
    
    return dp(0, 0)

# Example usage:
ring = "godding"
key = "gd"
print(findRotateSteps(ring, key))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: O(n) to map all characters to their indices, where n is the length of the `ring`.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Each state `(pos, k)` can be solved in O(m) where `m` is the number of occurrences of `key[k]` in the `ring`. Since there can be at most `nm` states, and we are solving each state once, the overall complexity is O(n * m * m), which simplifies to O(n * m^2) for the worst case where every character appears in every position.

### Conclusion

This approach uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently calculate the minimum number of steps needed to spell the `key` from the `ring`. Each characterâ€™s possible indices are precomputed for quick access, and the recursive function explores all possible alignments while storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
