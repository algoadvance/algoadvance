title:  Count Zero Request Servers-out
permalink: /s2747
---
You are given n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by a network. They receive multiple requests to servers in the form of an array `logs`, where each `logs[i] = [server_id, time]`.

You are also given an integer `x` and an integer `queries`. Your task is to process each query `queries[i]` and return the number of servers that have not received any request within the time frame `[queries[i], queries[i] + x - 1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Sizes and Constraints:**
   - Number of servers `n`: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - Number of `logs`: 1 ≤ `logs.length` ≤ 10^4
   - Each `logs[i]` contains `[server_id, time]` with 0 ≤ `server_id` < n and 1 ≤ `time` ≤ 10^6
   - Number of `queries`: 1 ≤ `queries.length` ≤ 10^4
   - x is guaranteed to be positive but no upper bound given
   
2. **Output Format:**
   - Return a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the result for each query.

3. **Sorting Necessity:**
   - Are the `logs` sorted by time? If not, should they be sorted?

Let's assume `logs` are sorted by time to streamline the initial problem understanding.

### Strategy
1. **Preprocessing Logs by Server:**
   - Store the logs in a dictionary where the key is the `server_id` and the value is a list of request times.

2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Queries:**
   - For each query, determine the start and end time of the interval.
   - Use binary search (or dynamic programming as feasible) to determine if any request times fall within this interval for each server.

3. **Count Servers with No Requests:**
   - For each query, count the servers that have no logs within the specified time frame.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import bisect

def countServers(n, logs, x, queries):
    # Step 1: Create a dictionary of logs for each server
    server_logs = defaultdict(list)
    for server_id, time in logs:
        server_logs[server_id].append(time)
    
    # Sort the logs for each server for binary search
    for log_times in server_logs.values():
        log_times.sort()
    
    results = []
    
    for query in queries:
        start_time = query
        end_time = query + x - 1
        count_zero_request_servers = 0
        
        for server_id in range(n):
            times = server_logs[server_id]
            
            # Using binary search to find the range of logs in [start_time, end_time]
            left_index = bisect.bisect_left(times, start_time)
            right_index = bisect.bisect_right(times, end_time)
            
            if left_index == right_index:
                count_zero_request_servers += 1
        
        results.append(count_zero_request_servers)
    
    return results

# Example usage
n = 3
logs = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 4]]
x = 2
queries = [3, 4]
print(countServers(n, logs, x, queries))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing Time:** O(m log m), where m is the length of the logs. This is due to sorting the log times for each server.
- **Query Time:** O(q * n log m), where q is the number of queries. For each query, we check log times for each server using binary search, which takes O(log m) for each server.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(m log m + q * n log m)

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity:** O(m + q), where m is the number of logs and q is the number of queries. The space is required to store the logs and the results of the queries.

This approach efficiently counts the zero-request servers for the given queries by leveraging sorting and binary search for range checks.
