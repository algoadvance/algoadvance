title:  Operations on Tree-out
permalink: /s1993

You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array `parent` where `parent[i]` is the parent of the `i-th` node. The root of the tree is node `0`.

Implement a class `LockingTree` that has the following functions:

- `LockingTree(int[] parent)`: Initializes the data structure with the parent array.
- `bool lock(int num, int user)`: Locks the node `num` for the user `user`. If the node is already locked, the operation will fail and return `false`. Otherwise, it locks the node and returns `true`.
- `bool unlock(int num, int user)`: Unlocks the node `num` for the user `user`. If the node is not locked by the given user, the operation will fail and return `false`. Otherwise, it unlocks the node and returns `true`.
- `bool upgrade(int num, int user)`: Upgrades the node `num` for the user `user` if all of the following conditions are met:
  - The node `num` is not locked.
  - There is at least one locked descendant of `num`.
  - All the ancestors of `num` are not locked. If the upgrade is possible, the node `num` will be immediately locked for the user `user`, all of its locked descendants will be unlocked, and then the operation returns `true`. Otherwise, the operation will return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size Constraints**: What is the expected size of the tree (e.g., maximum `n`)?
2. **Multiple Users**: Can the same user lock/unlock multiple nodes?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider any specific edge cases, such as the node `num` being the root or leaf node?

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a dictionary to map each node to its locking user. If the node is not in the dictionary, it means it's unlocked.
   - Use a set or dictionary to keep track of children for each node for quick descendant checking.

2. **Functions**:
   - **Lock**: Simply check if the node is currently locked. If not, lock it.
   - **Unlock**: Check if the node is locked by the current user. If so, unlock it.
   - **Upgrade**:
     - Check if the node is not locked.
     - Ensure none of the ancestors are locked.
     - Ensure at least one descendant is locked.
     - If conditions are met, unlock all descendants and lock the current node.

### Code

Here's a Python implementation that follows the outlined strategy:

```python
class LockingTree:

    def __init__(self, parent: List[int]):
        self.parent = parent
        self.locked = {}
        self.children = [[] for _ in range(len(parent))]
        for i in range(1, len(parent)):
            self.children[parent[i]].append(i)

    def lock(self, num: int, user: int) -> bool:
        if num in self.locked:
            return False
        self.locked[num] = user
        return True

    def unlock(self, num: int, user: int) -> bool:
        if num not in self.locked or self.locked[num] != user:
            return False
        del self.locked[num]
        return True

    def upgrade(self, num: int, user: int) -> bool:
        if num in self.locked:
            return False
        
        # Check if any ancestors are locked
        current = num
        while current != -1:
            if current in self.locked:
                return False
            current = self.parent[current]
        
        # Check if there's at least one locked descendant
        def has_locked_descendant(node):
            if node in self.locked:
                return True
            for child in self.children[node]:
                if has_locked_descendant(child):
                    return True
            return False

        if not has_locked_descendant(num):
            return False
        
        # Unlock all descendants
        def unlock_all_descendants(node):
            if node in self.locked:
                del self.locked[node]
            for child in self.children[node]:
                unlock_all_descendants(child)

        unlock_all_descendants(num)
        self.locked[num] = user
        return True
```

### Time Complexity

- `lock`: O(1)
- `unlock`: O(1)
- `upgrade`: O(n) in the worst case due to recursive checking and unlocking of descendants.

This ensures that the operations are efficient enough for typical constraints found in competitive programming problems.
