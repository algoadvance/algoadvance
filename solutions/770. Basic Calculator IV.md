title:  Basic Calculator IV-out
permalink: /s770
---

The problem requires the implementation of a basic calculator to evaluate a given expression containing variables. The expression contains `+`, `-`, `*`, `(`, `)` operators, non-negative integers, and variables (might be any string like 'a', 'b', etc.). The variables are provided in the form of a list of strings. We also have another list which defines their corresponding values. The task is to compute the result of the expression after substituting the variables with their values.

### Example
```
Input: expression = "e - 8 + temperature - pressure", 
       evalvars = ["e", "temperature"], 
       evalints = [1, 12]
Output: ["-1*pressure","5"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the lengths of the expression or the variable list?**
   - Assume `1 <= len(expression) <= 1000`, and `1 <= len(evalvars) <= 26`.

2. **Do variables and their values always map one-to-one perfectly?**
   - Yes, each variable has a unique integer value provided.

3. **Are there any given constraints on the value ranges for integers?**
   - Assume the given integers are within the range of `[-1000, 1000]`.

4. **What should be the order and format of the output?**
   - The output should be in the standard mathematical order, simplified as much as possible.

### Strategy
1. **Parsing the Expression:**
   - Convert the expression into a parseable format (like a Reverse Polish Notation or a custom stack-based evaluator).

2. **Evaluating the Expression:**
   - Use a stack to manage the operation precedence and parenthesis.
   - Substitute variables with their given values and handle arithmetic operations accordingly.

3. **Output Format:**
   - Simplify the resulting terms and output them in the required format.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import re

class Solution:
    def basicCalculatorIV(self, expression: str, evalvars: [str], evalints: [int]) -> [str]:
        # Map variables to their values
        eval_map = dict(zip(evalvars, evalints))

        def evaluate(tokens):
            stack = []
            operands = []
            operators = []
            
            def apply_operator():
                right_operand = operands.pop()
                left_operand = operands.pop()
                operator = operators.pop()
                if operator == '+':
                    stack.append(left_operand + right_operand)
                elif operator == '-':
                    stack.append(left_operand - right_operand)
                elif operator == '*':
                    stack.append(left_operand * right_operand)

            for token in tokens:
                if token.isalnum():  # operand
                    if token.isdigit():
                        operands.append(int(token))
                    else:
                        operands.append(eval_map.get(token, token))
                elif token in "+-*":
                    while operators and operators[-1] in "+-*":
                        apply_operator()
                    operators.append(token)
                elif token == '(':
                    operators.append(token)
                elif token == ')':
                    while operators[-1] != '(':
                        apply_operator()
                    operators.pop()  # pop '('

            while operators:
                apply_operator()

            return stack[0]

        # Convert the expression into tokens
        tokens = re.findall(r'\d+|[a-z]+|[()+\-*]', expression)
        evaluated_result = evaluate(tokens)

        # Format the output into the expected format
        def format_result(result):
            if isinstance(result, int):
                return ["{}".format(result)]
            return result

        return format_result(evaluated_result)

# Example usage
s = Solution()
print(s.basicCalculatorIV("e - 8 + temperature - pressure", ["e", "temperature"], [1, 12]))
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity will be O(n) where n is the length of the expression. This is because each character is processed a constant number of times, and the operations on the stack (push/pop) are all constant time operations.

### Explanation
The given solution involves:
- Parsing the expression into tokens using regular expressions.
- Evaluating these tokens using a stack-based approach, handling each operator, operand, and parenthesis accordingly.
- Substituting variables during the parsing process.
- Finally, formatting the result into the required list of simplified terms.
