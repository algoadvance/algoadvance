title:  Maximum Performance of a Team-out
permalink: /s1383
---

You are given two integers `n` and `k` and two integer arrays `speed` and `efficiency` both of length `n`. There are `n` engineers numbered from `1` to `n`. `speed[i]` and `efficiency[i]` represent the speed and efficiency of the `i-th` engineer respectively.

Choose at most `k` different engineers out of the `n` engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.
The performance of a team is defined as the sum of their speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their chosen engineers.

Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a large number, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We have the maximum performance of (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
Output: 68
Explanation: 
This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can choose the engineers with speeds [10, 5, 3] and the minimum efficiency will be 4. So the answer is (10 + 5 + 3) * 4 = 72.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned if there are no engineers (`n = 0`)?
   - The scenario shouldn't occur based on constraints.
2. Is every engineer's speed and efficiency guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, it's implied by the problem's context.

## Strategy

1. **Sort Engineers by Efficiency**: Start by sorting the engineers by their efficiency in descending order. This ensures that when we consider the next engineer, the current minimum efficiency is always set by that engineer or by another engineer with better efficiency.
2. **Use a Min-Heap to Maintain Top K Speeds**: While iterating through the sorted list, maintain a min-heap for the fastest `k` speeds encountered so far. This approach ensures that you can efficiently remove the smallest speed if adding a new engineer causes the team size to exceed `k`.
3. **Calculate Performance**: For each engineer considered as the minimum efficiency, calculate the potential performance by summing the current top speeds in the min-heap and multiplying by the current engineer's efficiency.
4. **Max Performance**: Track the maximum performance encountered during the iterations.

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def maxPerformance(n, speed, efficiency, k):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Pair up efficiency and speed and sort by efficiency descending
    engineers = sorted(zip(efficiency, speed), reverse=True)
    
    max_perf = 0
    speed_heap = []
    speed_sum = 0
    
    for eff, spd in engineers:
        # Add current speed to the heap
        heappush(speed_heap, spd)
        speed_sum += spd
        
        # If we exceed k engineers, remove the one with the lowest speed
        if len(speed_heap) > k:
            speed_sum -= heappop(speed_heap)
        
        # Calculate performance with the current engineer's efficiency as the minimum
        max_perf = max(max_perf, speed_sum * eff)
    
    return max_perf % MOD

# Example usage:
n = 6
speed = [2, 10, 3, 1, 5, 8]
efficiency = [5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 2]
k = 2
print(maxPerformance(n, speed, efficiency, k))  # Output: 60
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity can be broken down as follows:
- **Sorting**: Sorting engineers by efficiency takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Heap Operations**: Maintaining the heap (insertion and removal) takes \(O(\log k)\) per operation, leading to a total of \(O(n \log k)\) for iterating through all engineers.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log k)\).

The space complexity is \(O(n + k)\) due to storing the engineers and the heap.
