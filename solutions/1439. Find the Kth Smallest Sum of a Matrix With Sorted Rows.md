title:  Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows-out
permalink: /s1439
---
You are given an `m x n` matrix `mat` of integers in which each row is sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer `k`. You should return the `kth` smallest sum out of all possible sums of one element from each row of `mat`.

# Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the values in the matrix?**
   - Typically constraints might be given in the problem statement, but we can assume that `mat[i][j]` values are within typical integer limits.
   
2. **Matrix dimensions?**
   - Similarly, these should be specified. If not, typical constraints might be `2 <= m, n <= 40` given that combinations grow exponentially.

3. **Can elements repeat in the rows?**
   - Yes, elements in a row can repeat as each row is just sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Is `k` guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, the problem should ensure that `k` is within the range of possible sums.

# Strategy
Since the matrix has sorted rows, we can use a heap (priority queue) to efficiently find the k-th smallest sum. The approach can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initialize the Priority Queue**: Start by putting the smallest possible sum (first elements of all rows) into the priority queue.
2. **Iteratively Extract and Expand**: Extract the smallest sum from the priority queue, and then generate new sums by replacing each element in the current sum with the next element in its row (if it exists). Insert these new sums back into the priority queue.
3. **Repeat Until k-th Sum is Found**: Continue the process of extraction and expansion until we have extracted `k` times, at which point the `k-th` extracted value is our desired result.

# Code

```python
import heapq

def kthSmallest(mat, k):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    
    # Initialize min heap
    min_heap = [(sum(row[0] for row in mat), [0] * m)]  # Tuple of (current sum, indices in rows)
    visited = set()
    visited.add((0, ) * m)
    
    for _ in range(k):
        current_sum, indices = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # Generate new sums by moving one step in each row
        for i in range(m):
            if indices[i] + 1 < n:
                new_indices = list(indices)
                new_indices[i] += 1
                new_sum = current_sum - mat[i][indices[i]] + mat[i][new_indices[i]]
                new_indices = tuple(new_indices)
                
                if new_indices not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (new_sum, new_indices))
                    visited.add(new_indices)
    
    return current_sum

# Example usage
mat = [
    [1, 3, 11],
    [2, 4, 6]
]
k = 5
print(kthSmallest(mat, k))  # Output should be 17 if k = 5
```

# Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach involves using a heap to maintain the k smallest sums efficiently.

- **Heap Operations**: Each operation (insertion into the heap) is logarithmic in the size of the heap. Since we only push a limited number of items (bounded by `k`), each extraction is `O(logk)`.
- **Overall Complexity**: In the worst case, if we have to push and pop `k` elements where each push and pop are `O(logk)`, the total time complexity becomes `O(k * log k)`.

This is efficient in practical terms for reasonable values of `k`, leveraging the sorted property of the rows.
