title:  Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings-out
permalink: /s712
---

The problem is to find the minimum ASCII delete sum for two strings `s1` and `s2`. The ASCII delete sum is the sum of the ASCII values of deleted characters to make the two strings equal.

Here's the problem stated more formally:
- Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return the minimum ASCII delete sum of making `s1` and `s2` equal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of the strings `s1` and `s2`?
      - Typically, for these problems, the strings can be up to 1000 characters long.
    - Are the strings composed only of lowercase English letters, or can they include other characters?
      - Assume the strings are composed of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output Format**:
    - Should the function return an integer representing the minimum ASCII delete sum?

### Strategy

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we need to minimize the total ASCII values deleted to make `s1` and `s2` equal. Here is the step-by-step strategy to solve this problem:

1. **Define a DP Table**:
    - Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII delete sum to make `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]` equal.

2. **Initialization**:
    - `dp[0][0] = 0`: Deleting both empty prefixes results in zero cost.
    - For the first row and column, if one of the strings is empty, the cost is the ASCII sum of the other string up to that point.

3. **State Transition**:
    - If the characters `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]` are the same, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` since no deletion is needed.
    - Otherwise, take the minimum of deleting the character from `s1` or `s2`:
      `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + ord(s1[i-1]), dp[i][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1]))`.

4. **Return the Result**:
    - The value in `dp[m][n]` gives the minimum ASCII delete sum for `s1` and `s2`.

### Code

```python
def minimumDeleteSum(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Initializing base cases
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + ord(s1[i-1])
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1])
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j] + ord(s1[i-1]), dp[i][j-1] + ord(s2[j-1]))
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - Here `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s1` and `s2`, respectively. We fill up a 2D DP table of dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the storage required for the 2D DP table.

By following this approach, we can efficiently determine the minimum ASCII delete sum to make the two strings equal.
