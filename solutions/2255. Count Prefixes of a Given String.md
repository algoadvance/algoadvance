title:  Count Prefixes of a Given String-out

Given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`, determine the number of strings in `words` that are a prefix of `s`.

A string `word` is a prefix of `s` if `s` starts with `word`.

**Example:**
```
Input: words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"], s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The strings in words that are prefixes of s are "a", "ab", and "abc".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string `s` be empty?**
   - It is assumed that `s` will be a non-empty string as per typical problem constraints.
   
2. **Can the words in the list `words` be empty or contain empty strings?**
   - It's generally best to consider and handle edge cases. An empty string as a word cannot be a prefix of any non-empty string.

3. **What should be the return type?**
   - The return type should be an integer representing the count of prefixes.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each word in the list `words`.**
2. **Check if the word is a prefix of the string `s`.**
   - Utilize Python's string method `.startswith()` which returns `True` if the given string starts with the specified prefix.
3. **Count the number of words that satisfy this condition.**

### Code

```python
def countPrefixes(words, s):
    count = 0
    for word in words:
        if s.startswith(word):
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
words = ["a","b","c","ab","bc","abc"]
s = "abc"
print(countPrefixes(words, s))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Checking if a word is a prefix:** The `.startswith()` method has a time complexity of O(m) where `m` is the length of the word.
- **Iterating through each word in `words`:** Let `n` be the number of words in the list.
- **Overall complexity:** O(n * m) in the worst case where `m` is the maximum length of any word in `words`.

Thus, the time complexity is generally efficient given that string comparison operations are fast in Python. This should handle typical constraints comfortably unless `words` or `s` are exceptionally large.
