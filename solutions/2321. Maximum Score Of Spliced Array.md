title:  Maximum Score Of Spliced Array-out
permalink: /s2321
---

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both of length n.

You can choose two integers left and right where 0 <= left <= right < n and simultaneously replace the subarray nums1[left...right] with the subarray nums2[left...right].

- For example, if nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5] and nums2 = [5,6,7,8,9], you may choose left = 1 and right = 3, then nums1 becomes [1,6,7,8,5].
  
Compute the maximum possible sum of nums1 after doing the optimal subarray replacement operation once or not doing any operation at all.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the chosen subarray be of length 0?**
   - Yes, if left == right, it's possible to consider a subarray of length 1 (single element).

2. **Is it mandatory to replace any subarray?**
   - No, it's not mandatory; we can choose not to replace any subarray if it results in a lower score.

3. **What if the arrays have negative numbers?**
   - The solution should handle negative numbers appropriately.

4. **What is the range of n (length of the arrays)?**
   - Typically n <= 10^5 which is a manageable size for efficient solutions.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, note that we do not need to test every possible subarray explicitly. Instead:

1. Calculate the initial sum of `nums1`.
2. Determine the maximum possible increment we can get by replacing a subarray of `nums1` with the corresponding subarray of `nums2`.

By using Kadane's algorithm, we can efficiently find the subarrays that have the maximum difference (`nums2[i] - nums1[i]`) and (`nums1[i] - nums2[i]`). This is because replacing subarray in `nums1` with `nums2` is equivalent to adding the differences (`nums2[i] - nums1[i]`) over that subarray.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
def find_max_subarray_diff(nums1, nums2):
    max_ending_here1 = max_so_far1 = nums2[0] - nums1[0] 
    max_ending_here2 = max_so_far2 = nums1[0] - nums2[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums1)):
        max_ending_here1 = max(nums2[i] - nums1[i], max_ending_here1 + nums2[i] - nums1[i])
        max_so_far1 = max(max_so_far1, max_ending_here1)
        
        max_ending_here2 = max(nums1[i] - nums2[i], max_ending_here2 + nums1[i] - nums2[i])
        max_so_far2 = max(max_so_far2, max_ending_here2)
    
    return max_so_far1, max_so_far2

def maximumsSplicedArray(nums1, nums2):
    initial_sum1 = sum(nums1)
    initial_sum2 = sum(nums2)
    
    max_increase1, max_increase2 = find_max_subarray_diff(nums1, nums2)
    
    max_sum1 = initial_sum1 + max_increase1
    max_sum2 = initial_sum2 + max_increase2
    
    return max(max_sum1, max_sum2)

# Example usage:
nums1 = [60, 60, 60]
nums2 = [10, 90, 10]
print(maximumsSplicedArray(nums1, nums2))  # Output should be 210

nums1 = [20,40,20,70,30]
nums2 = [50,20,50,40,20]
print(maximumsSplicedArray(nums1, nums2))  # Output should be 220
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding Initial Sums:** O(n)
- **Kadane's Algorithm for Both Differences:** O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for constraints n <= 10^5.

By following this approach, we maximize the score of the spliced array in a manner that is both time-efficient and optimal.
