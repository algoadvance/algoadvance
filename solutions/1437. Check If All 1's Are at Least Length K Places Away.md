title:  Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away-out
permalink: /s1437
---

You are given an integer array `nums` representing a binary array, and an integer `k`.

Return `True` if all `1's` are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `False`.

### Example:

```python
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: True

Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: False
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= nums.length - 1`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array contain elements other than `0` and `1`?
   * **A:** No, the problem explicitly states that `nums` is a binary array.
   
2. **Q:** Is the array always non-empty?
   * **A:** Yes, based on the constraint `1 <= nums.length`.

3. **Q:** What should the function return if `k` is `0`, i.e., the required spacing is zero?
   * **A:** The function should return `True` since no spacing is required between `1`s.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the index of the last encountered `1`. For each new `1` we encounter, we check the distance from the previous `1`. If the distance is less than `k`, we return `False`. If we complete the iteration without finding any `1`s that are too close, we return `True`.

## Code

```python
def kLengthApart(nums: list[int], k: int) -> bool:
    last_position = -1  # Initialize to -1 which indicates no 1 has been found yet.
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == 1:
            if last_position != -1 and i - last_position - 1 < k:
                return False
            last_position = i
    
    return True

# Test Cases
print(kLengthApart([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1], 2))  # True
print(kLengthApart([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1], 2))  # False
print(kLengthApart([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 0))  # True
print(kLengthApart([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], 2))  # True
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.

The space complexity is \( O(1) \) because we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
