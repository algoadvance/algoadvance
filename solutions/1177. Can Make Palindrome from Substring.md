title:  Can Make Palindrome from Substring-out
permalink: /s1177

The problem "1177. Can Make Palindrome from Substring" on LeetCode requires solving the following:

You are given a string `s` and array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i, k_i]`. 

For each query, you want to determine if:
- For the substring from the index `left_i` to `right_i` (both inclusive)
- It can be transformed into a palindrome by changing at most `k_i` characters.

Return a list of boolean values where each element is the answer to the corresponding query.

### Example
```python
s = "abcda"
queries = [[3, 3, 0], [1, 2, 0], [0, 3, 1], [0, 3, 2], [0, 4, 1]]
```
Output:
```python
[True, False, False, True, True]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the given indexes inclusive?**
   - Yes, both `left_i` and `right_i` are inclusive.

2. **What are the constraints on the length of the string and number of queries?**
   - The string length `s` can be up to `10^5`.
   - The number of queries can be up to `10^5`.

3. **Are all characters in the string lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the string `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Prefix Frequency Array:** Use prefix frequency arrays to count occurrences of each character up to any point in the string. This helps in quickly calculating character frequencies for any substring.
2. **Odd Character Count:** For each query, count how many characters in the substring have an odd frequency. A substring can form a palindrome if at most one character has an odd frequency for even-length palindromes, or is allowed up to one odd for the central character in odd-length substrings.
3. **Transformation Check:** For a substring with `odd_count` odd frequency characters, determine if `odd_count // 2 <= k_i`. 

## Implementation

```python
def canMakePaliQueries(s, queries):
    # Step 1: Create a prefix frequency array
    n = len(s)
    prefix = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            prefix[i + 1][j] = prefix[i][j]
        prefix[i + 1][ord(s[i]) - ord('a')] += 1

    results = []
    
    for left, right, k in queries:
        total_chars = [0] * 26
        for j in range(26):
            total_chars[j] = prefix[right + 1][j] - prefix[left][j]
        
        odd_count = sum(freq % 2 for freq in total_chars)
        
        # A substring can become a palindrome if we can change odd_count // 2 characters
        if odd_count // 2 <= k:
            results.append(True)
        else:
            results.append(False)
    
    return results

# Example usage
s = "abcda"
queries = [[3, 3, 0], [1, 2, 0], [0, 3, 1], [0, 3, 2], [0, 4, 1]]
print(canMakePaliQueries(s, queries))  # Output: [True, False, False, True, True]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Prefix Array Construction:** `O(n * 26)` where `n` is the length of the string (`s`).
- **Processing Queries:** Each query takes `O(26)`, and for `q` queries, this is `O(q * 26)`.
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(n + q)`, which is efficient considering the constraints.
