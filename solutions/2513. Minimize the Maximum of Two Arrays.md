title:  Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays-out
permalink: /s2513

### Problem Statement

**Problem: 2513. Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays**

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, your goal is to create a new integer array `nums3` such that:
1. nums3[i] = max(nums1[i], nums2[i]) for all `i` from 0 to the smaller dimension of the two given arrays.

Return the minimized array `nums3`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums1` and `nums2` have different lengths?
2. What should be done if one array is longer than the other?
3. Are there any constraints on the elements of the arrays, like range or sorting?
4. Are the input arrays sorted or need sorting?

### Code

Initial assumptions:
1. Both arrays may have different lengths.
2. Only consider the pairwise elements up to the smaller length of the two arrays.

Let's create a function to solve the problem.

```python
from typing import List

def minimize_max_of_two_arrays(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Determine the smaller length
    min_length = min(len(nums1), len(nums2))
    
    # Initialize the resulting array
    nums3 = []
    
    # Iterate over the arrays up to the min_length
    for i in range(min_length):
        nums3.append(max(nums1[i], nums2[i]))
    
    return nums3

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]
nums2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(minimize_max_of_two_arrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Smaller Length**: First, find the minimum length of the two arrays to ensure you only process elements up to this length.
2. **Initialize the Result Array**: Create an empty list to store the result.
3. **Iterate and Compare**: Loop through the arrays up to the smaller length, and for each index, append the maximum of the two array elements to the result array.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the shorter array. This complexity comes from iterating once through the minimum length of the two arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the resulting array, assuming `n` is the length of the shorter array.
