title:  Count Vowel Substrings of a String-out
permalink: /s2062
---

You are given a string `word`. A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within the string. A vowel substring is a substring that consists only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and has all five vowels present at least once.

Write a function `countVowelSubstrings(word: str) -> int` that returns the number of vowel substrings in word.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters can the input string contain?**
   - The input string can contain lowercase English letters only.

2. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - No, the problem specifies a non-empty string.

3. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - This isn't explicitly stated but typically, problems like these assume reasonable constraints (n â‰¤ 10^4 or similar).

4. **Do vowel substrings need to contain unique instances of all five vowels or just at least one instance of each?**
   - Each vowel substring must contain at least one instance of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Vowel Substrings:**
   - Traverse the string and identify substrings made up entirely of vowels.
   
2. **Substrings with All Vowels:**
   - For each starting position of a vowel substring, continue to expand until the substring contains all five vowels.
   
3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window technique to count and check substrings efficiently.

### Code

Here's a Python solution implementing the above strategy:

```python
def countVowelSubstrings(word: str) -> int:
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    total_count = 0
    n = len(word)

    for start in range(n):
        if word[start] in vowels:
            seen_vowels = set()
            for end in range(start, n):
                if word[end] in vowels:
                    seen_vowels.add(word[end])
                    if len(seen_vowels) == 5:
                        total_count += 1
                else:
                    break

    return total_count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop (`for start in range(n)`):**
  - Runs `n` times.

- **Inner Loop (`for end in range(start, n)`):**
  - The worst case scenario runs `n` times for each start.

Overall, the worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the length of the input string `word`.

This solution should be efficient enough for typical constraints found in coding interview problems.
