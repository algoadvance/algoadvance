title:  Removing Minimum Number of Magic Beans-out
permalink: /s2171
---

You are given an array of positive integers `beans`, where each integer represents a bag that contains `beans[i]` magic beans. You are allowed to remove as many beans as you want from any bag. However, the goal is to ensure that all remaining bags (those that contain magic beans after some of them are potentially removed) contain the same number of beans. Your task is to find the minimum number of beans to remove to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the `beans` array possible?
2. **Value Range**: What is the range of values that each element in the `beans` array can have?
3. **Output**: Should the output be the exact number of beans removed or the resultant state of the array?

### Strategy

To achieve the minimal removal of beans:
1. **Sort the array**: Begin by sorting the array. Sorting helps to consider the costs in an efficient order.
2. **Calculate Cost**: For each bag, assume it is the target amount that all non-empty bags should contain. Calculate the cost to remove beans to make all the bags either empty or containing exactly as many beans as the current bag.
3. **Iterate Over Possible Bean Counts**: Try each unique bean count in the sorted list as the target number of beans for the non-empty bags and calculate the total beans to be removed.
4. **Minimum Calculation**: Keep track of the minimum removal cost observed during these iterations.

### Code

```python
def minBeansRemoval(beans):
    # Sort the bean array
    beans.sort()
    
    total_beans = sum(beans)
    min_removal = float('inf')
    
    n = len(beans)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Target is to make all non-empty bags have beans[i] beans
        current_target_beans = beans[i]
        # Remaining beans if the current bag is the target for remaining beans
        remaining_beans = current_target_beans * (n - i)
        # Total beans to remove to achieve this configuration
        removal_cost = total_beans - remaining_beans
        # Minimize the removal cost
        min_removal = min(min_removal, removal_cost)
    
    return min_removal
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the `beans` array is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Traversal/Calculation**: The for loop that traverses through each element is \(O(n)\).
- **Total Complexity**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step, which dominates the traversal step.

By following this strategy and using the provided code, we can efficiently compute the minimum number of magic beans to be removed to ensure all remaining bags contain the same number of beans.
