title:  Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2684
---

You are given an `m x n` grid `grid` consisting of positive integers. You can start at any cell in the first column and need to reach any cell in the last column by making the maximum number of moves. In one move, you can go from cell `(r, c)` to another cell `(r + 1, c + 1)`, `(r, c + 1)`, or `(r - 1, c + 1)`, if the integer value of the destination cell is greater than the integer value of the current cell.

Return the maximum number of moves you can make.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - What are the constraints on the dimensions `m` and `n` of the grid?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the grid?

   The constraints might influence how we approach implementing the solution efficiently.

2. **Movement and Constraints:**
   - Is it guaranteed that there is at least one valid path to the last column?
   - Do diagonal moves need to stay within the grid boundaries?

3. **Output:**
   - Should the output be the total number of moves, or is there additional information required?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - We will use dynamic programming where `dp[r][c]` represents the maximum moves from `(r, c)` to any cell in the last column.

2. **Traverse the Grid:**
   - Start from each cell in the first column and try to move to the last column while keeping track of the maximum number of moves.

3. **Recursive DP with Memorization:**
   - Define a recursive function `dfs(r, c)` representing the maximum moves starting from cell `(r, c)`. 

4. **State Transition:**
   - From `(r, c)`, you can move to:
     - `(r + 1, c + 1)`
     - `(r - 1, c + 1)`
     - `(r, c + 1)`
     - if the destination cell value is greater than the current cell.

5. **Base Case:**
   - If `c` is the last column, return 0 (no more moves can be made from here).

6. **Memoization:**
   - Use a memoization dictionary to store results of subproblems to avoid re-computation.

### Code

```python
def maxMoves(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Memoization cache
    memo = {}
    
    # Recursive function to compute the maximum moves from (r, c)
    def dfs(r, c):
        if (r, c) in memo:
            return memo[(r, c)]
        
        if c == n - 1:  # Last column
            return 0
        
        max_moves = 0
        for dr, dc in [(1, 1), (-1, 1), (0, 1)]:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] > grid[r][c]:
                max_moves = max(max_moves, 1 + dfs(nr, nc))
        
        memo[(r, c)] = max_moves
        return max_moves
    
    max_result = 0
    for row in range(m):
        max_result = max(max_result, dfs(row, 0))
    
    return max_result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) because each cell is visited at most once and the result is memoized.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) for the memoization table and the recursion stack depth.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of moves possible in a grid to reach any cell in the last column starting from any cell in the first column.
