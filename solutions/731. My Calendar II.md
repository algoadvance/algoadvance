## Problem Statement

**731. My Calendar II**

Implement a `MyCalendarTwo` class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

Your class will have one method, `book(int start, int end)`, where `start` and `end` represent the start and end times of the event. The method should return `true` if the event can be added without causing a triple booking, and `false` otherwise.

An event is a triple booking if there are three events that overlap at some point.

### Example

```plaintext
MyCalendarTwo myCalendar = new MyCalendarTwo();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
myCalendar.book(50, 60); // returns true
myCalendar.book(10, 40); // returns true
myCalendar.book(5, 15);  // returns false
myCalendar.book(5, 10);  // returns true
myCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does an event include the end time?**
   - No, the event is considered to start at `start` and end just before `end`.

2. **What is the range of time values we can expect for `start` and `end`?**
   - Typically, time values are non-negative integers, with `start < end`.

3. **Can `start` and `end` values be negative or zero?**
   - In usual scenarios, time values are positive integers.

4. **What are the constraints on the number of operations?**
   - Typically, constraints are around a reasonable limit to ensure performance (e.g., 1 ≤ `start`, `end` ≤ 10^9).

### Strategy

We can keep track of two calendars:
1. **Single Bookings:** Track events that have at least one booking.
2. **Double Bookings:** Track events that have exactly two overlapping events.

When trying to book a new event, we first check if it will cause a triple booking by overlapping with any of the double bookings. If it does, we return `false`. If not, we then update our single and double booking tracks accordingly and return `true`.

### Code

```python
class MyCalendarTwo:

    def __init__(self):
        self.bookings = []
        self.overlaps = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        for o_start, o_end in self.overlaps:
            if start < o_end and end > o_start:
                return False
        
        for b_start, b_end in self.bookings:
            if start < b_end and end > b_start:
                self.overlaps.append((max(start, b_start), min(end, b_end)))
        
        self.bookings.append((start, end))
        return True

# Example usage:
# myCalendar = MyCalendarTwo()
# print(myCalendar.book(10, 20)) # returns True
# print(myCalendar.book(50, 60)) # returns True
# print(myCalendar.book(10, 40)) # returns True
# print(myCalendar.book(5, 15))  # returns False
# print(myCalendar.book(5, 10))  # returns True
# print(myCalendar.book(25, 55)) # returns True
```

### Time Complexity

Let \( n \) be the number of events booked so far.

- **Initialization:** The constructor (`__init__`) runs in O(1) time.
- **Booking an Event:** In the worst case, for every booking, we need to check against all the previous bookings and overlaps. Therefore, the complexity for booking an event is O(n), where n is the number of bookings made before the current one.

Overall, the implementation ensures that we iteratively check and record overlaps, maintaining efficiency within acceptable limits for typical input sizes expected in such problems.
