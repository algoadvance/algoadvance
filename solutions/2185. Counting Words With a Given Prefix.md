title:  Counting Words With a Given Prefix-out
permalink: /s2185
---

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`. A string is considered a suitable word if it starts with the prefix `pref`.

Return the number of strings in `words` that are suitable.

#### Example 1
```plaintext
Input: words = ["pay", "attention", "practice", "attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2
```plaintext
Input: words = ["leetcode", "win", "loops", "success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `words` array be empty?**
   - Yes, if the `words` array is empty, the output should be 0.
   
2. **Is the prefix guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the problem statement implies that `pref` is non-empty.

3. **Are all characters in `words` and `pref` lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, it is stated that all strings contain lowercase English letters.

4. **What is the maximum length for `words` and `pref`?**
   - Constraints generally allow up to reasonable lengths typical for such problems on LeetCode. For our implementation, we assume `words` can have up to 10^4 elements and each string can be up to 100 characters long.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the list `words`.**
2. Check if each word starts with the prefix `pref` using the `startswith` method.
3. Count the number of words that match the condition.

### Code

```python
def count_words_with_prefix(words, pref):
    count = 0
    for word in words:
        if word.startswith(pref):
            count += 1
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where:
- `n` is the number of words in the `words` list.
- `m` is the length of the prefix `pref`.

This is because the `startswith` method internally checks up to `len(pref)` characters for each word, leading to a complexity of O(m) per word. Looping through all words results in the total time complexity of O(n * m). This is efficient given typical constraints in competitive programming.

### Example Execution

Let's walk through the example in the problem statement:

For `words = ["pay", "attention", "practice", "attend"]` and `pref = "at"`:

1. "pay" does not start with "at" (count remains 0).
2. "attention" starts with "at" (count increases to 1).
3. "practice" does not start with "at" (count remains 1).
4. "attend" starts with "at" (count increases to 2).

Therefore, the function returns 2.

The code is designed to handle the general case and efficiently count words with a given prefix.
