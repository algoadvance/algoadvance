title:  Smallest Missing Non-negative Integer After Operations-out
permalink: /s2598
---

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to perform operations in such a way that the smallest missing non-negative integer is identified after the operations. Specifically, you can increment any element of `nums` by `k` any number of times. Your goal is to return the smallest non-negative integer that cannot be obtained after performing the operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Inputs**: What is the possible range of values for `nums` and `k`?
2. **Number of Operations**: Is there a limit on the number of times we can perform the increment operation on the array elements?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints provided for the problem in terms of the size of the array or the range of integers in the array?

Let's assume the following for simplicity:
- The array `nums` can have a length of up to `10^4`.
- The values in `nums` and `k` can range between `-10^9` and `10^9`.

### Strategy
1. **Normalize the Array**: Convert all elements modulo `k` to handle the increments. For example, if an element `x` exists in the array, then after increments of `k`, it can be represented as `x % k`.
2. **Use a Set**: To keep track of all possible remainders (0 to k-1) encountered after normalizing the array.
3. **Identify Missing Integer**: Iterate through numbers from `0` upwards and check the smallest missing integer that cannot be represented using the remainders obtained above.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a Python function to implement the solution:

```python
def findSmallestMissing(nums, k):
    # Using set to store otherwise repeatedly handled number properties.
    remainders = set()
    
    # Normalize the array elements modulo k and store in the set
    for num in nums:
        remainders.add(num % k)

    # The smallest integer that cannot be formed starting from 0
    # Iterate over all possible integers to find the missing one
    for i in range(len(remainders) + 1):
        if i % k not in remainders:
            return i

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 1
print(findSmallestMissing(nums, k))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **Normalization**: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element is processed once.
- **Checking Missing Integer**: O(k) in the worst case where we might need to check up to `k` elements for the smallest missing integer.

This solution is efficient and leverages the mod operation to simplify the problem, ensuring that we stay within linear time complexity relative to the size of the input array.
