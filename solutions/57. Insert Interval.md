title:  Insert Interval-out
permalink: /s57
---

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represent the start and the end of the `i-th` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start_i`. 

You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by start_i and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals. Return `intervals` after the insertion.

### Example:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: intervals = [], newInterval = [5,7]
Output: [[5,7]]
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,3]
Output: [[1,5]]
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,5]], newInterval = [2,7]
Output: [[1,7]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the size of the intervals array or the values of start and end?
2. **Merge Logic:** If the new interval's start or end is already covered by an existing interval, can we assume it is part of the merging rule?
3. **Empty Input:** Is it correct to return a single interval if the input intervals array is empty?
4. **Output Format:** Can we assume the output should be the intervals array with the new interval inserted in the appropriate place and merged if necessary?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty list to store the result.
2. **Iterate Through Intervals:**
    - Add all intervals that end before the start of the new interval to the result.
    - While the current interval overlaps with the new interval, merge them.
    - Add remaining intervals to the result.
3. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where `intervals` is empty or the new interval does not overlap with any current interval.
4. **Return the Result:** The merged and sorted intervals.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def insert(intervals, newInterval):
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(intervals)
    
    # Add intervals before the new interval
    while i < n and intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]:
        result.append(intervals[i])
        i += 1
    
    # Merge overlapping intervals with new interval
    while i < n and intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]:
        newInterval[0] = min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0])
        newInterval[1] = max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])
        i += 1
    
    result.append(newInterval)
    
    # Add remaining intervals after new interval
    while i < n:
        result.append(intervals[i])
        i += 1
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm iterates through the intervals list once, resulting in a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of intervals.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` as we are storing the resulting intervals, which may be equal to the input size in the worst case.
