title:  Make Sum Divisible by P-out
permalink: /s1590

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is not allowed to remove the whole array. Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or `-1` if it's impossible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the length of array `nums`?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   
2. **What is the range of each element in the `nums` array?**
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
   
3. **Can the entire array be removed?**
   - No, it's not allowed to remove the entire array.

4. **If there's no valid subarray that can be removed, should the function return `-1`?**
   - Yes, the function should return `-1`.

### Strategy
1. **Compute Total Sum**:
   - Calculate the total sum of the array `nums`.
   
2. **Check Total Sum Divisibility**:
   - If the total sum is already divisible by `p`, then the answer is `0` since no subarray needs to be removed.

3. **Compute Remainder**:
   - Calculate the remainder when the total sum is divided by `p` (let's call this `total_sum % p`).

4. **Use Prefix Sums with Hash Map**:
   - Maintain a prefix sum while iterating through the array and store the prefix sum modulo `p` in a hash map along with the index.
   - For each index, try to find if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals the required remainder to make the sum of the rest of the elements divisible by `p`.
   
5. **Track Minimum Subarray Length**:
   - Calculate the length of the potential subarray to be removed and keep track of the minimum length.

### Code

```python
def minSubarray(nums, p):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    remainder = total_sum % p
    if remainder == 0:
        return 0

    prefix_sums = {0: -1}
    current_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        current_sum += num
        current_mod = current_sum % p
        target_mod = (current_mod - remainder) % p
        
        if target_mod in prefix_sums:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - prefix_sums[target_mod])
        
        prefix_sums[current_mod] = i 

    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
print(minSubarray([3,1,4,2], 6))  # Output: 1
print(minSubarray([6,3,5,2], 9))  # Output: 2
print(minSubarray([1,2,3], 3))    # Output: 0
print(minSubarray([1,2,3], 7))    # Output: -1
print(minSubarray([1000000000,1000000000,1000000000], 3))  # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity
- Computing the sum of the array takes **O(n)**.
- The iteration through the array to track prefix sums and calculate the minimum length also takes **O(n)**.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
