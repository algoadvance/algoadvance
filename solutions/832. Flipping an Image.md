title:  Flipping an Image-out
permalink: /s832

Given an `n x n` binary matrix `image`, we perform the following operations on each row of the matrix:
1. Reverse the row.
2. Invert the image (flipping `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).

Return the resulting image.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Format**: Can we assume that the input matrix contains only binary values (0s and 1s)?
   - Yes, the matrix contains only binary values.
2. **Size Constraints**: Can we assume the matrix will always be square, i.e., `n x n`?
   - Yes, assume that the input matrix is always a square matrix.
3. **Output**: Can I return a new matrix, or should the operations be in-place?
   - You can return a new matrix or modify the existing matrix in-place.

### Strategy:
1. **Reverse Each Row**: We need to reverse each row of the matrix.
2. **Invert Each Element**: After reversing, we invert each element of the row (change `0` to `1` and `1` to `0`).

To implement this, we can use a nested loop:
- The outer loop will iterate through each row of the matrix.
- The inner loop will iterate through each element of the row. Instead of manually reversing and inverting, we can combine both operations in one pass.

### Strategy Steps:
1. Traverse each row of the matrix.
2. For each row, reverse it.
3. Invert each element by simply applying `1 - value` (since `1 - 0` gives `1` and `1 - 1` gives `0`).

### Example:
Given the input:
```
[[1,1,0],
 [1,0,1],
 [0,0,0]]
```

After reversing each row:
```
[[0,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [0,0,0]]
```

After inverting each element:
```
[[1,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,1,1]]
```

### Code:
```python
def flipAndInvertImage(image):
    for row in image:
        # Reverse the row and invert each element
        for i in range((len(row) + 1) // 2):
            # Simultaneously reverse and invert with a two-pointer approach
            row[i], row[~i] = 1 - row[~i], 1 - row[i]
    return image

# Example usage
image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
print(flipAndInvertImage(image))
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Reversal and Inversion**: O(n/2) per row which simplifies to O(n) due to the constant factor being negligible.
- **Total Time for n rows**: O(n * n)

Thus, the total time complexity of this approach is **O(n^2)** where `n` is the number of rows or columns in the square matrix.
