title:  Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field-out
permalink: /s2975
---
You are given a grid of size `m x n` representing a field, where each cell in the grid contains a different value uniformly distributed between 0 and `k-1`, and the value represents the height of the fence in that cell. 

You can decide to remove some fences and create an empty square area, such that the height of any remaining fences on the boundary of the square is strictly less than the height of any fences outside the boundary. Your task is to determine the maximum square area that can be created by removing some fences, using the given conditions.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Should cells with the same height as the fences on the boundary be considered 'allowed' for our square?
2. Are we allowed to create multiple smaller squares, or should we only focus on finding the largest possible square?
3. Can the fences on the boundary of the square have varying heights, as long as they are less than the surrounding fences?
4. Does the problem allow for the possibility of the field having cells with different heights within the same boundary?

### Strategy:

1. **Understand the Grid:**
   - The grid is `m x n` and each cell value represents height.
   - We need to find the largest possible square where the height of any boundary cell is less than the height of cells surrounding the square.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of the largest square ending at each cell.
   - The value of `dp[i][j]` will represent the length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at cell `(i, j)`.
   
3. **Iterate through the grid:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the possible square lengths by looking at the top, left, and top-left diagonal cells.
   - Update the DP table conditionally based on the boundary checking rules.

4. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Ensure boundary cells' height constraints are respected.
   - Validate the square's height constraints while iterating through potential squares.

### Code:

```python
def maximalSquare(matrix):
    if not matrix:
        return 0

    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    max_side = 0

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1: # assuming 1 represents fence presence
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 # first row or first column case
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                max_side = max(max_side, dp[i][j])
    
    return max_side * max_side

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

print(maximalSquare(matrix))  # Output the area of the largest square
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization:** O(m*n) to create the DP table.
- **DP Table Filling:** O(m*n)

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(m*n)**, which is efficient for a large grid.
