title:  Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I-out
permalink: /s3029
---

You are given a word consisting of lowercase English letters. You are allowed to replace any character in the word with '?' to represent a wildcard that can match any lowercase English letter. However, once the characters have been modified to '?', you cannot revert them back to their original state.

Given a word, return the minimum number of operations required to revert it to its initial state after an unknown number of characters have been changed to '?'. Each replacement operation counts as one operation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input**
    - Is the input guaranteed to be a non-empty string?
    - Can the input consist of only lowercase English letters and possibly '?' characters?

2. **Output**
    - The output is an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to revert to the initial state.

3. **Operations**
    - Can only the '?' be replaced with its corresponding initial letter?

Let's assume:
- The input is guaranteed to be a non-empty string.
- The input consists of only lowercase English letters and the '?' character.
- Only the '?' character can be reverted to its corresponding initial letter.

### Strategy
1. **Traverse the String**:
   - We iterate through the string and count the number of '?' characters.
2. **Replacement Count**:
   - The number of operations required to revert the word back to its initial state is equal to the count of '?' characters.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the word. We only need to traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Code

```python
def min_operations_to_revert(word):
    # Initialize operation count
    operation_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the word
    for char in word:
        # Count the number of '?' characters
        if char == '?':
            operation_count += 1
            
    return operation_count

# Example Usage
word = "a?bc?"
print(min_operations_to_revert(word))  # Output should be 2
```

This straightforward approach ensures that we count the necessary operations efficiently.
