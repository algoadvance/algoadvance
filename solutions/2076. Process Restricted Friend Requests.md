title:  Process Restricted Friend Requests-out
permalink: /s2076
---

We are given two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of users on a social media platform and the number of restricted friend requests, respectively. We also have two lists of pairs, `restrictions` and `requests`.

- `restrictions[i] = [a, b]` implies that user `a` and user `b` cannot be friends.
- `requests[j] = [c, d]` means user `c` wants to be friends with user `d`.

Return a list of booleans, where the `j-th` boolean is `true` if the friendship between `c` and `d` can be formed without violating any of the restrictions, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same request appear multiple times?**
   - Yes, but the result for each request would be considered independently.

2. **Can a user appear in multiple restrictions?**
   - Yes, a user can have multiple restrictions with different users.

3. **Is there any specific order to the restrictions or requests?**
   - No specific order is mentioned; they should be processed in the given order.

4. **What is the range for the values for `n` and `m`?**
   - Typically, constraints will be provided, but assume it should handle relatively large datasets efficiently.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the **Union-Find** (or Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure for efficient merging and querying of connected components. 

Here's an outline of the approach:

1. **Initialize Union-Find Structure**: Create a parent and rank array for Union-Find to manage the merging of friend groups.
2. **Process Each Request**:
   - For each request [c, d], check if merging these users would violate any restrictions.
   - If merging does not violate any restrictions, union the friend groups.
   - Maintain a record of the merge status for each request.

### Time Complexity
- Initializing Union-Find structure: `O(n)`
- Processing each request: Each union/find operation is effectively `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function — very efficient.

So, the overall complexity becomes `O((n + k) * α(n))`, where `n` is the number of users and `k` is the number of requests.

### Code

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [0] * size
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        
        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

def process_friend_requests(n, restrictions, requests):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    result = []
    
    for c, d in requests:
        rootC = uf.find(c)
        rootD = uf.find(d)
        
        can_be_friends = True
        for a, b in restrictions:
            rootA = uf.find(a)
            rootB = uf.find(b)
            
            if (rootC == rootA and rootD == rootB) or (rootC == rootB and rootD == rootA):
                can_be_friends = False
                break
        
        if can_be_friends:
            uf.union(c, d)
        
        result.append(can_be_friends)
        
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 4
restrictions = [[0, 1], [2, 3]]
requests = [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1]]
print(process_friend_requests(n, restrictions, requests))
# Expected output: [True, False, True]
```

### Explanation
- **UnionFind Class**: Manages union and find operations.
- **Process Requests**: For each request, checks if union is possible without violating restrictions and tracks the result for each request.

Using this approach ensures efficient handling of the friend request problem within the constraints provided.
