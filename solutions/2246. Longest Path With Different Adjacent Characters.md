title:  Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters-out
permalink: /s2246
---

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) rooted at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to the `i-th` node.

Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= n <= 10^5`, ensuring we need an efficient algorithm.
   - `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
   - The number of edges in the tree is `n-1`.

2. **Output:**
   - We need to return an integer representing the length of the longest valid path.

3. **Example:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     n = 7
     parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2,2]
     s = "abacbea"
     ```
   - **Output:**
     ```
     4
     ```

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree. The root node has no parent, the other nodes have one parent each.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the root.
   - Use recursive DFS to compute the longest path for each node.
   - For each node, calculate the longest child paths that do not share the same character.

3. **Path Evaluation:**
   - For each node, maintain the two longest child paths that meet the criteria.
   - Calculate the path length ending at each node including the node itself.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - Track the maximum path length during the DFS traversal.

### Code

```python
def longestPath(parent, s):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Building the tree representation using adjacency list
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    n = len(parent)
    for child in range(1, n):
        par = parent[child]
        tree[par].append(child)
    
    max_path = 0
    
    def dfs(node):
        nonlocal max_path
        max1, max2 = 0, 0  # Variables to store top two longest paths

        for child in tree[node]:
            child_length = dfs(child)
            # Only consider the path if the current node and child node have different characters
            if s[child] != s[node]:
                if child_length > max1:
                    max1, max2 = child_length, max1
                elif child_length > max2:
                    max2 = child_length
        
        # The maximum path through the current node
        max_path = max(max_path, max1 + max2 + 1)
        
        # Return the length of the longest path ending at the current node
        return max1 + 1
    
    dfs(0)  # DFS starting from the root
    return max_path

# Example usage:
n = 7
parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2,2]
s = "abacbea"
print(longestPath(parent, s))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal:** The function performs a DFS traversal of the tree, visiting each node exactly once. This results in a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity also is `O(n)` due to the adjacency list and call stack (in the worst-case scenario).

This solution is efficient given the constraints of the problem (up to `10^5` nodes).
