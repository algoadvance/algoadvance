title:  Minimum Time to Complete All Tasks-out
permalink: /s2589

### Problem Statement

You are given an array `tasks` where each task is represented by a tuple `(start, end, duration)`, and you need to determine the minimum time required for completing all the tasks. Each task can only be performed in a specific time window from `start` to `end`, and it requires exactly `duration` units of time to complete. You can only work on one task at a time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length of the `tasks` array?
    - What is the range for the `start`, `end`, and `duration` values?

2. **Task Overlaps:**
    - Can tasks overlap or fully encapsulate another task?

3. **Output:**
    - Should we return the overall minimum time required, despite the time windows of the tasks?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, here's a proposed approach:

1. **Sort Tasks:**
    - Sort the tasks based on their `end` times to ensure we always consider the task with the earliest deadline first.

2. **Greedy Scheduling:**
    - Use a greedy algorithm to schedule the tasks. Try to fit each task into its available window in a way that minimizes the total time required to complete all tasks.
    - Track the current time and attempt to start new tasks after the current time while respecting their time windows.

3. **Feasibility Check:**
    - Check if it is possible to fit the task within the available window and adjust the current time accordingly.

### Code

Here's the Python code that implements the above strategy:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def min_time_to_complete_tasks(tasks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> int:
    # Sort tasks by their end time
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    current_time = 0
    
    for start, end, duration in tasks:
        # If current_time is before the task's start, move current_time to start
        if current_time < start:
            current_time = start
        
        # Check if the task can be completed within the allowed window
        if current_time + duration <= end:
            current_time += duration
        else:
            # If we can't fit the task within its window, return -1
            return -1
    
    return current_time

# Example usage
tasks = [(1, 4, 2), (2, 5, 3), (3, 6, 1)]
print(min_time_to_complete_tasks(tasks))  # Output should be a minimum time or -1 if not possible
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the tasks takes \(O(n \log n)\) where `n` is the number of tasks.
- **Iterating** through the tasks takes \(O(n)\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we are efficiently allocating time to each task within their respective windows while respecting the constraints. If fitting a task within its window is impossible, the function returns `-1`.
