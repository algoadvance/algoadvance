title:  Optimal Division-out
permalink: /s553
---
Given a list of positive integers `nums`, you need to return a string that represents the optimal division of these numbers such that the value of the expression is maximized. In other words, you want to maximize the result of `nums[0] / nums[1] / nums[2] / ... / nums[n-1]`.

**Example 1:**

- Input: `nums = [1000, 100, 10, 2]`
- Output: `"1000/(100/10/2)"`
- Explanation: `1000/(100/10/2) = 1000/5 = 200`, but `1000/100/10/2 = 0.5`.

**Example 2:**

- Input: `nums = [2, 3, 4]`
- Output: `"2/(3/4)"`
- Explanation: `2/(3/4) = 2 * 4/3 = 8/3`, but `2/3/4 = 1/6`.

**Example 3:**

- Input: `nums = [2]`
- Output: `"2"`

Your task is to return the optimal division as a string.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the list have only one element?**
   - Yes, the list can have only one element, in which case the output is simply that element.
2. **Can the list have exactly two elements?**
   - Yes, and in this situation, the optimal division is simply represented as `nums[0] / nums[1]`.
3. **Is there always a valid solution?**
   - Yes, because the list will have at least one positive integer.
4. **Are there any constraints on the size of `nums` or the value of its elements?**
   - The problem doesn't specify constraints, so we assume typical constraints as per LeetCode problems.

## Strategy:

The key to maximize the result of division is to minimize the denominator resulting from the division.
- For a list with more than two elements, the strategy is to enclose all numbers after the first in parenthesis. This ensures that we divide `nums[0]` by a value that is as small as possible.
- For `nums = [a]`, output just `a`.
- For `nums = [a, b]`, output `a/b`.
- For `nums = [a, b, c, ...]`, output `a/(b/c/...)`.

## Code:

```python
def optimalDivision(nums):
    if not nums:
        return ""
        
    # If there's only one number, just return that number
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return str(nums[0])
    
    # If there are two numbers, just return the division of the two
    if len(nums) == 2:
        return f"{nums[0]}/{nums[1]}"
    
    # For more than two numbers, encloses the rest of the numbers in parenthesis
    result = '{}/({})'.format(nums[0], '/'.join(map(str, nums[1:])))
    return result

# Test cases
print(optimalDivision([1000, 100, 10, 2]))  # "1000/(100/10/2)"
print(optimalDivision([2, 3, 4]))           # "2/(3/4)"
print(optimalDivision([2]))                 # "2"
print(optimalDivision([2, 3]))              # "2/3"
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this problem is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` list. The most time-consuming operation is joining the strings with slashes, which is linear in the size of the list.
