title:  Maximum Number of Words You Can Type-out
permalink: /s1935
---

Given a text string and a string containing broken letters (characters that cannot be pressed), your task is to determine the maximum number of words in the text that can be typed using the remaining non-broken letters. Each word in the text is separated by a single space.

**Example:**
- Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"
- Output: 1
- Explanation: Only "world" can be typed out, because "hello" contains the broken letter "d".

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are all characters in the text lowercase letters?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume all input text consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.

2. **Q:** Can brokenLetters be an empty string?
   - **A:** Yes, if brokenLetters is an empty string, it means no keys are broken.

3. **Q:** Can there be multiple spaces between words in the text?
   - **A:** No, words in the text are separated by single spaces only.

4. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the text and the brokenLetters?
   - **A:** The length of the text and brokenLetters will be within reasonable limits (Not provided, but assume typical problem constraints like < 10^4).

## Strategy

1. **Split the Text:** 
   - Use the `split()` method to break the text into individual words.

2. **Check Each Word:**
   - For each word, check if any character in the word is in the set of broken letters.

3. **Count Typable Words:**
   - If a word can be typed (i.e., no characters in the word are broken), add to a counter.

4. **Return the Count:**
   - Return the final count of words that can be typed.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(N * M), where N is the number of words in the text and M is the average length of a word. The `split()` method and iterating over each character of each word contributes to this complexity.

## Code

```python
def canBeTypedWords(text, brokenLetters):
    broken_set = set(brokenLetters)  # Create a set of broken letters for quick lookup
    words = text.split()  # Split the text into individual words
    
    typable_count = 0
    
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word contains any broken letter
        if all(char not in broken_set for char in word):
            typable_count += 1
    
    return typable_count

# Example usage:
text = "hello world"
brokenLetters = "ad"
print(canBeTypedWords(text, brokenLetters))  # Output should be 1
```

### Explanation:
- **broken_set:** A set containing the broken letters for fast membership checking.
- **words:** A list obtained by splitting the input text by spaces.
- **typable_count:** A counter to keep track of how many words can be typed without using broken letters.
- **if all(char not in broken_set for char in word):** This condition checks if all characters in a word are not in the set of broken letters.
