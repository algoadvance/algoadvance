title:  Height Checker-out

---
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of the students in the order they are currently standing. Return the number of indices where the heights do not match the order when sorted.

### Example:
```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]
expected: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, the problem ensures there is at least one student.
2. **Are there any constraints on the elements of the input array?**
   - The lengths of the heights are between 1 and 100.
3. **Should we consider heights with equal values as matching?**
   - Yes, identical heights in their respective positions are considered matching.

### Strategy
The solution involves comparing the given array with a sorted version of the same array and counting the number of discrepancies between the two lists.

1. **Copy and Sort**: Create a sorted copy of the heights array.
2. **Count Mismatches**: Compare the original and sorted arrays element by element and count how many indices differ.

### Code
```python
def heightChecker(heights):
    expected = sorted(heights)
    mismatch_count = 0
    
    for i in range(len(heights)):
        if heights[i] != expected[i]:
            mismatch_count += 1
    
    return mismatch_count
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting the Array**: O(n log n), where n is the length of the heights array.
2. **Comparison Loop**: O(n), since we iterate through the array once.

Overall time complexity: **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step, which is the most time-consuming operation.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's take the example provided: `heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]`

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Original: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3]
   - Sorted: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]

2. **Compare Elements**:
   - Index 0: 1 == 1 → match
   - Index 1: 1 == 1 → match
   - Index 2: 4 != 1 → mismatch
   - Index 3: 2 == 2 → match
   - Index 4: 1 != 3 → mismatch
   - Index 5: 3 != 4 → mismatch

3. **Count of Mismatches**: 3

Thus, the function returns 3.
