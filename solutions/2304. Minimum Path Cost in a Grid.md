title:  Minimum Path Cost in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2304
---

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n` and a 2D cost matrix `moveCost` of size `n x n`. The grid has only non-negative integers. The cost matrix represents the cost of moving from one cell in the grid to another. Specifically, `moveCost[i][j]` represents the cost of moving from a cell with value `i` to an adjacent cell holding value `j`.

You start in any cell of the first row of the grid. You can move to a cell in the next row by going to the cell directly below or to the left or right diagonal. Your goal is to find the minimum path cost to reach any cell in the last row.

Return the minimum path cost starting from any cell in the first row to any cell in the last row of the grid.

### Constraints:
- `m`, `n` in range [1, 50]
- Values in `grid` and `moveCost` are all non-negative.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Movement Directions:** We are allowed to move vertically downward or diagonally to the left or right to an adjacent cell in the next row. Is that correct?
2. **Initial Position:** Can we start from any cell in the first row?
3. **Final Goal:** The goal is to reach any cell in the last row with minimum path cost. Is that correct?

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a DP matrix `dp` of the same size as the `grid` to store the minimum cost to reach each cell.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - Initialize the first row of the `dp` matrix with the values of the first row of the grid since those are the starting costs.
   
3. **Fill DP Matrix**:
   - For each cell in the grid, calculate the path cost from possible previous cells (directly above, left diagonal, and right diagonal).
   - Use the `moveCost` matrix to determine the additional cost for moving from previous cell to current cell.
   
4. **Result**:
   - The final result will be the minimum value in the last row of the DP matrix.

## Code
```python
def minPathCost(grid, moveCost):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # DP table to store minimum path costs
    dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize the first row of dp with the first row of grid
    for j in range(n):
        dp[0][j] = grid[0][j]
        
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(n):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + moveCost[grid[i-1][k]][grid[i][j]] + grid[i][j])
                
    # The result is the minimum value in the last row of the dp table
    return min(dp[m-1])

# Example usage
grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
moveCost = [[1,1,2],[2,3,3],[3,4,2]]
print(minPathCost(grid, moveCost))  # Expected output is 17
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: `O(m * n)` to initialize the DP matrix.
- **DP Table Fill**: For each cell in the grid, we're iterating over each possible previous cell, resulting in a time complexity of `O(m * n^2)`.
  
  Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n^2)`. This should be efficient given the problem constraints.
