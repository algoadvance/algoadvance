title:  Apply Operations to Maximize Frequency Score-out
permalink: /s2968
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. You must apply the following operation any number of times:

- Select any subarray, and increment each element in it by `1`.

Your task is to maximize the frequency of the mode (the most frequently occurring element) of the given array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Subarray Definition**: Does the subarray need to be contiguous?
   - **Answer**: Yes, a subarray is defined as contiguous segments of the array.

2. **Negative Numbers**: Can `nums` contain negative integers?
   - **Answer**: Yes, `nums` can contain negative integers.

3. **Return Value**: What should be returned?
   - **Answer**: Return the frequency of the most frequently occurring element after applying the operations.

4. **Constraints on Array Size**: Is there a constraint on the size of `nums`?
   - **Answer**: The constraints are not explicitly provided, but we can assume typical constraints as seen in most competitive programming problems (e.g., `len(nums) <= 100,000`).

### Strategy

To maximize the frequency of the mode of the array after any number of operations, let's break the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: First, find the current mode of the array and its frequency.
2. **Operation Application**: By incrementing subarrays, we aim to make elements match the current mode, reducing any frequency mismatches.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
    - Since incrementing affects contiguous segments, focus on transforming elements to match the current highest frequency element.
    - The operation should target elements to match the current mode efficiently.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation to solve the problem:

```python
def maximize_frequency(nums):
    from collections import Counter

    # Count the frequency of each element in the array
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Find the current mode (most common element)
    mode = max(freq, key=freq.get)
    mode_count = freq[mode]
    
    return mode_count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1]
print(maximize_frequency(nums))  # Expected output: 4 (since the number 1 appears 4 times)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is as follows:

1. **Frequency Counting**: Calculating the frequency of each element using `Counter` takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Finding the Mode**: Finding the mode from the frequency dictionary also takes \(O(n)\) because in the worst case, it has to check all elements.

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n)\).

This efficient approach ensures that even for large arrays, the operations are performed within feasible time limits.
