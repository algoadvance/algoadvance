title:  Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros-out
permalink: /s1869
---

You are given a binary string `s` that consists only of zeros and ones. Return `true` if the longest contiguous segment of ones is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of zeros in the binary string. Return `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the input string `s`?**
   - Constraints: \( 1 \leq \text{len}(s) \leq 1000 \).

2. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, according to the constraints.

3. **Can the input have only zeros or only ones?**
   - Yes, the input can be entirely zeros or entirely ones.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize variables**:
   - `max_ones` to track the maximum length of contiguous ones segment.
   - `max_zeros` to track the maximum length of contiguous zeros segment.
   - `current_ones` and `current_zeros` to track the current length of contiguous segments while traversing the string.

2. **Traverse the string from left to right**:
   - If the character is '1', increment `current_ones` and reset `current_zeros` to zero.
   - If the character is '0', increment `current_zeros` and reset `current_ones` to zero.
   - After updating counters for each character, update `max_ones` and `max_zeros` accordingly.

3. **Compare the `max_ones` and `max_zeros`**:
   - Return `True` if `max_ones` is greater than `max_zeros`, otherwise return `False`.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we are traversing the string only once.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def checkZeroOnes(self, s: str) -> bool:
        max_ones = max_zeros = 0
        current_ones = current_zeros = 0
        
        for char in s:
            if char == '1':
                current_ones += 1
                current_zeros = 0
            else:
                current_zeros += 1
                current_ones = 0
            
            max_ones = max(max_ones, current_ones)
            max_zeros = max(max_zeros, current_zeros)
        
        return max_ones > max_zeros
```

By following these steps, the solution efficiently determines whether the longest contiguous segment of ones is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of zeros.
