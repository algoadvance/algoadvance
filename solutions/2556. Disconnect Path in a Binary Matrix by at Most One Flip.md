title:  Disconnect Path in a Binary Matrix by at Most One Flip-out
permalink: /s2556
---

You are given a binary matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. You are allowed to change at most one `0` to a `1`. 

Your goal is to determine if it is possible to do so such that there is no path from the top-left cell `(0,0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m-1,n-1)`.

A path in the matrix is a sequence of cells `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ..., (rk, ck)` such that:
- Each `(ri, ci)` is within the grid.
- `(r1, c1) = (0,0)` (the top-left cell).
- `(rk, ck) = (m-1,n-1)` (the bottom-right cell).
- For each valid `i`, `(ri+1, ci)` or `(ri, ci+1)` is `1` (a neighboring cell containing `1`).

Return `True` if it is possible to change at most one `0` to `1` such that there is no path from `(0, 0)` to `(m-1, n-1)`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the grid contain only `0`s and `1`s? 
2. What should we return if there is already no path before any modification?
3. Does a path have to only navigate through cells with value `1` or through cells with value `0` as well?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Path Check**: First, we will check if there is an already existing path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid using a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
2. **Edge Case**: If there is already no path without any modifications, we simply return `True`.
3. **Count of Non-Zero Turnable Points**: We iterate through the matrix and count the `0`s in the grid and see if flipping any one of the selected `0`s affects the path from the start to the end.
4. **Try to Disconnect**: For each `0` point, we flip it to `1` and check if the path from `(0, 0)` to `(m-1, n-1)` is disconnected. If at any point we successfully disconnect by flipping one `0`, we return `True`. Otherwise, after all possibilities are exhausted, we return `False`.

### Code

```python
def isPossibleToDisconnect(grid):
    def bfs(grid):
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        if grid[0][0] == 0 or grid[m-1][n-1] == 0:
            return False
        
        queue = [(0, 0)]
        visited = set(queue)
        
        while queue:
            i, j = queue.pop(0)
            if (i, j) == (m-1, n-1):
                return True
            
            for x, y in [(i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i-1, j), (i, j-1)]:
                if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and (x, y) not in visited and grid[x][y] == 1:
                    visited.add((x, y))
                    queue.append((x, y))
        
        return False
    
    if not bfs(grid):
        return True
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                grid[i][j] = 1
                if not bfs(grid):
                    return True
                grid[i][j] = 0
    
    return False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial BFS**: \(O(m \times n)\)
- **Flipping each `0` and BFS**: Since flip and BFS are nested, this will be \(O(z \times m \times n)\), where \(z\) is the number of `0`s in the matrix.
- **Total Time Complexity**: The total time complexity hence becomes \(O(z \times m \times n)\). In the worst case, `z` can be \(m \times n\), particularly for an all `0` matrix, making the worst-case scenario \(O((m \times n)^2)\).

This solution efficiently navigates through the matrix and attempts to disconnect the path by flipping at most one `0`.
