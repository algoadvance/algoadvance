title:  Number of Distinct Averages-out
permalink: /s2465
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of *even* length. As long as `nums` is **not empty**, you must repetitively:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in `nums`.
2. Compute the average of these two values.
3. Remove both the minimum and maximum values from `nums`.

Your task is to return the number of **distinct averages** computed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints?**
   - The array length is even.
   - All elements are integers.

2. **Range of Values?**
   - The values in the array can range from `-10^6` to `10^6`.

3. **Output?**
   - Output should be an integer representing the number of distinct averages.

Now, we'll proceed with implementing the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the given array to easily find the minimum and maximum values.

2. **Two Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (left) and one from the end (right) of the sorted array.

3. **Compute Averages**: Iteratively compute the average of the values at the two pointers, store the average in a set (to keep track of distinct averages), and move the pointers towards each other.

4. **Remove Values**: After computing the average, increment the `left` pointer and decrement the `right` pointer to remove both the minimum and maximum from the array implicitly.

5. **Continue Until the Pointers Meet**: Repeat steps 3-4 until the pointers meet.

6. **Return the Size of the Set**: Finally, return the size of the set containing distinct averages.

### Code Implementation

```python
def distinct_averages(nums):
    # Sort the array to facilitate the two-pointer technique
    nums.sort()
    distinct_avg_set = set()
    
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    # Loop until pointers meet
    while left < right:
        # Compute the average of nums[left] and nums[right]
        avg = (nums[left] + nums[right]) / 2
        # Add it to the set of distinct averages
        distinct_avg_set.add(avg)
        # Move pointers
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    # The number of distinct averages is the size of the set
    return len(distinct_avg_set)

# Example usage:
nums = [4,1,4,0,3,5]
print(distinct_averages(nums))  # Output should be the number of distinct averages
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The sorting step will take \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Two-Pointer Traversal**: The traversal with two pointers takes \(O(n/2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is **O(n \log n)** due to the sorting step.

The space complexity is **O(1)** for the two-pointer technique plus **O(D)** for the set storing distinct averages where **D** is the number of distinct averages (in the worst case **D** could be up to \(n/2\)).
