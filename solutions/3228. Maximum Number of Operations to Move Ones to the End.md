title:  Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End-out
permalink: /s3228
---
You are given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of characters '0' and '1'). In one operation, you can:
- Choose any subsequence of `s` consisting only of '1's and move it to the end of the string.

Return the maximum number of such operations that you can perform to move all '1's in the binary string to the end.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I choose multiple subsequences in one operation?**
   - No, each operation allows you to choose only one subsequence of '1's.
2. **What if the string consists of only '0's or only '1's?**
   - If the string consists of only '0's, no operations are needed.
   - If the string consists of only '1's, no operations are possible since all '1's are already at the end.
3. **What are the constraints on the string length?**
   - There is no explicit length constraint provided, but you might want to infer typical ranges to optimize the solution.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **Step 1:** Identify all subsequences of '1's.
2. **Step 2:** Count how many times we can perform operations to move '1's.
3. **Step 3:** Emphasize maximizing the number of operations.

A crucial observation is whenever we have a '1' right next to a '0', it means we can perform an operation to move that '1' across the '0's at the end until we're left with no '0' to the right of any '1'.

### Code
Here's the Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
def max_operations_to_move_ones(s: str) -> int:
    consecutive_zeroes = 0
    operations = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '0':
            consecutive_zeroes += 1
        elif char == '1' and consecutive_zeroes > 0:
            operations += 1
            consecutive_zeroes = 0
    
    return operations

# Example usage:
s = "1001101"
print(max_operations_to_move_ones(s))  # Output should reflect the explanation
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** We traverse the string and count the number of '0's that are adjacent to '1's (this indicates that we can perform at least one operation here).
- **Step 2:** We increment our operation count whenever we switch from counting '0's to encountering a '1'.
- **Step 3:** Reset the `consecutive_zeroes` counter to avoid overcounting.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are making a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a few variables for counting and not storing additional data structures.

This approach ensures we traverse the string efficiently and determine the maximum operations required to move all the '1's to the end.
