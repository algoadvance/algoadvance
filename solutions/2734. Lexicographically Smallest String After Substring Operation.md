title:  Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation-out
permalink: /s2734
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You have to perform one operation which involves choosing a non-empty substring of `s` and replacing it with its lexicographically smallest permutation. Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after performing exactly one such operation.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   **A**: Typically, constraint details would be provided in the on LeetCode, but you can assume it ranges from 1 to a large number, often up to 10^5.

2. **Q**: Can the entire string be considered as the substring for replacement?
   **A**: Yes, any non-empty substring can be considered, including the entire string.

3. **Q**: What is meant by the lexicographically smallest permutation?
   **A**: A permutation of a string is one of its arrangements. The lexicographically smallest permutation is the one that appears first in dictionary order (typically, this would be the sorted order of its letters).

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we will apply the following steps:

1. **Initial Observation**:
   Since we need one operation to achieve the result, and any non-empty substring can be chosen,
   - One safe approach is to consider sorting the entire string array to achieve the smallest permutation, then returning the minimal result from various possible permutations.

2. **Smallest Permutation for All Substrings**:
   - Generate all possible substrings of the string.
   - Sort each substring and replace it in the original string while keeping track of the lexicographically smallest result.

### Time Complexity:

- Generating all substrings has a complexity O(n^2).
- Sorting each substring has a complexity O(k log k) where k is the length of the substring.
- Therefore, the combined worst-case time complexity would typically be much higher.

However, analyzing and implementing such inefficiencies are not practical for larger inputs. Thus, focusing on better intuitions specific to the smallest lexicographic permutations within the context is advisable.

### Python Code:

Here's how to implement this conceptually straightforward plan:

```python
def lexicographically_smallest_string(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    smallest_string = s  # initialize with the original string
    
    # Iterate over all possible substrings:
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            substring = s[i:j]
            # Get the sorted version of the substring
            sorted_substring = ''.join(sorted(substring))
            # Form the new string
            new_string = s[:i] + sorted_substring + s[j:]
            # Update the smallest string found
            if new_string < smallest_string:
                smallest_string = new_string
    
    return smallest_string

# Example Run
s = "dcba"
print(lexicographically_smallest_string(s))  # Output: "abcd"
```

By executing the above code, the solution evaluates all substring combinations and their respective permutations to determine the smallest lexicographic combination achievable with a single operation. 

Though it can still be optimized, the above approach iteratively improves our solution approach.
