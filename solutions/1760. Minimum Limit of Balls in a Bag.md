title:  Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag-out
permalink: /s1760
---

You are given an integer array `nums` where `nums[i]` represents the number of balls in the `i-th` bag. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

1. Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

For example, a bag of `5 balls` can become two new bags of `1 and 4`, or `2 and 3`.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum number of balls in a bag. Formally, you want to minimize the value of `x` such that after performing the operations, no bag contains more than `x` balls.

Return the minimum possible value of `x`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` be empty?**
   - No, there will be at least one bag.
2. **What is the size range of `nums` and the range of numbers in `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to `10^5`, and each element of `nums` can be up to `10^9`.
3. **What is the range of `maxOperations`?**
   - `maxOperations` can range from `1` to `10^9`.
4. **Should the result be an integer?**
   - Yes, `x` should be an integer.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use binary search because we are looking for the minimum possible value of the maximum number of balls in a bag after performing the operations.

1. **Identify the Search Range:**
   - The minimum possible value of `x` is `1` (if every bag contains exactly one ball).
   - The maximum possible value of `x` is `max(nums)` (if we do no operations).

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Use binary search to find the optimal value of `x`.
   - For each candidate value of `x` (midpoint of current search range), calculate the required number of operations to ensure that no bag has more than `x` balls.
   - If the number of operations is within `maxOperations`, it means we can try for a smaller `x`.
   - Otherwise, increase the value of `x`.

## Code

```python
def minimumSize(nums, maxOperations):
    def can_divide(x):
        operations = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num > x:
                # To reduce num to x, we need ceil(num / x) - 1 operations
                operations += (num - 1) // x
                if operations > maxOperations:
                    return False
        return True

    left, right = 1, max(nums)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_divide(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
            
    return left

# Usage
nums = [9, 6, 13, 5, 8]
maxOperations = 2
print(minimumSize(nums, maxOperations))  # Output should fit the constraints provided.
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The number of iterations is `O(log(max(nums)))`, where `max(nums)` can be up to `10^9`.
- **Operations Calculation:** For each candidate `x`, we traverse `nums` which takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums` (up to `10^5`).

Overall time complexity: `O(n * log(max(nums)))`. This is efficient given the constraints.
