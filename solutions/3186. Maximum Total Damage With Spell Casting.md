title:  Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting-out
permalink: /s3186
---

You have a group of heroes and a group of monsters. Each hero can cast a unique spell that targets a specific monster, dealing a certain amount of damage. You are given two lists:
- `heroes`: a list of integers where each integer represents the amount of damage a hero can deal.
- `monsters`: a list of integers where each integer represents the health of a monster.

The objective is to maximize the total damage dealt to the monsters by pairing each hero's spell with a monster's health. A hero can only cast one spell, and a monster can only be targeted once. If a hero's damage exceeds a monster's health, the excess damage is wasted.

Your task is to write a function that returns the maximum total damage.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start writing the code, let's clarify a few aspects of the problem:
1. Are the lengths of the `heroes` and `monsters` lists always the same?
2. Is the input guaranteed to be non-empty?
3. Can we assume that the damage and health values are non-negative integers?
4. Should we return the total damage dealt to monsters as the sum of effective damages?

Given these assumptions, let's proceed with the solution.

### Strategy

To maximize the total damage dealt:
1. Sort both the `heroes` and `monsters` lists in descending order.
2. Pair the highest damage-dealing hero with the strongest monster (highest health), the second highest damage-dealing hero with the second strongest monster, and so on.
3. Keep track of the total effective damage dealt, ensuring we do not exceed the monster's health, thus avoiding wasted damage.

### Code

```python
def max_total_damage(heroes, monsters):
    # Sort both lists in descending order
    heroes.sort(reverse=True)
    monsters.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_damage = 0
    
    # Iterate over the paired lists
    for hero_damage, monster_health in zip(heroes, monsters):
        total_damage += min(hero_damage, monster_health)
        
    return total_damage

# Example usage
heroes = [10, 5, 7]
monsters = [8, 6, 2]
print(max_total_damage(heroes, monsters))  # Output should be 21
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `heroes` and `monsters` lists both take O(n log n) time, where `n` is the number of elements in each list.
- The subsequent pairing and summing takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity for this solution is O(n log n).

If there are any specific conditions or variations in input sizes or constraints that we missed out on, please let us know to refine the solution further.
