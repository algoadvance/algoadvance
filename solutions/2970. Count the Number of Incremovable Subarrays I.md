title:  Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I-out
permalink: /s2970
---
You are given an array of integers, `arr`. A subarray is called incrementable if the sum of its elements can be increased by exactly 1 by incrementing exactly one of its elements by 1.

Your task is to return the number of such incrementable subarrays.

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`

### Clarifying Questions
To better understand the problem, here are some clarifying questions:
1. **What is considered a valid incrementable subarray?**
   - A subarray is valid if you can pick exactly one element from it and increase it by 1, causing the sum of the entire subarray to increase by exactly 1.

2. **Can the subarrays be of any length?**
   - Yes, subarrays can be of any length from 1 to the length of `arr`.

3. **Does the order of elements in the subarray need to be retained from the original array?**
   - Yes, the subarray must be contiguous as per its occurrence in the original array.

### Strategy
Given the problem requirements and constraints, the approach involves:
1. Each subarray of any length can potentially be incremented by 1 by simply adding 1 to one of its elements. 
2. To count the incremovable subarrays, observe that for any contiguous subarray of length `L`, there are `L` possible ways to increment it. Thus, the count of subarrays of length `L` is straightforward.
3. The simplest way to count required subarrays is to exploit the overlapping nature of subarrays:
    - For an array of length `n`, the total number of subarrays is the sum from 1 to `n`.
4. Use the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers: `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`.

Thus, the total number of incrementable subarrays in `arr` is simply the sum of the lengths of all possible subarrays.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the above logic:

```python
def count_incremovable_subarrays(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    return n * (n + 1) // 2

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(count_incremovable_subarrays(arr))  # Output: 10
```

### Explanation and Time Complexity
1. **Calculation**:
   - `n`: Length of the array.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the total number of all incrementable subarrays.

2. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is `O(1)` since it only involves a few arithmetic operations.

3. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is `O(1)` as it only uses a small, constant amount of space for storing variables.

This approach efficiently counts the number of incrementable subarrays in linear time, making it effective given the constraint limits.
