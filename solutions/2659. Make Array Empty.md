**2659. Make Array Empty [Leetcode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-empty/) (Hypothetical)**

You are given an array of integers. In each operation, you can select any element from the array and remove it. The goal is to make the array empty. However, there is a catch: if the index of the element you want to remove is greater than the length of the array minus 2, you'll have to replace it with the element at the last position of the current array before removing it.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array empty.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same element be selected more than once before removing it?**
   - No, once an element is selected for removal, it is removed permanently.

2. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array or value of elements inside the array?**
   - The array size can be up to \(10^5\) and the values of elements can range between \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to carefully consider the operations to minimize them while adhering to the removal rules.

1. **Initialization**: We will initialize a count to keep track of the number of operations performed.
2. **Iterate through the array**: We will iterate through the array to remove elements one by one.
3. **Conditions for Removal**:
   - If the index of the element being removed is less than or equal to `length - 2`, simply remove the element.
   - If the index is greater, swap the element with the last element first and then remove it.
  
We can use a list data structure to keep track of the remaining elements and their current indexes.

### Code

```python
def min_operations_to_empty(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    count = 0
    while arr:
        index_to_remove = 0  # Always remove the element at the 0th index in each iteration
        if index_to_remove <= len(arr) - 2:
            arr.pop(index_to_remove)
        else:
            # This should not occur due to our current strategy of always removing from the start
            arr[-2], arr[-1] = arr[-1], arr[-2]
            arr.pop()
        count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
example_array = [4, 3, 2, 1]
print(min_operations_to_empty(example_array))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for our solution is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case because each `pop` operation could take \(O(n)\) time, and we are performing `n` operations. For input size \(n\) up to \(10^5\), this could be inefficient.

Consider more advanced data structures like an index-based heap or balanced tree to optimize further.

However, based on our current understanding and straightforward approach:
- **Best Case:** \(O(n)\)
- **Worst Case:** \(O(n^2)\) when repeatedly removing the first element in a large list.

This solution is functional but may not be optimal for very large arrays. Depending on specific problem constraints and additional observations, more optimized methods may be devised.
