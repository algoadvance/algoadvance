**817. Linked List Components**

You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array `nums` that contains a subset of values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in `nums` where two values are connected if they appeared consecutively in the linked list.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does "connected components" mean in this context?**
   It means consecutive sequences in the original linked list where every element in the sequence is part of the `nums` array.
   
2. **Can `nums` be empty?**
   No, according to the problem, `nums` will always have at least one element.
   
3. **What should be returned if no elements in `nums` appear as consecutive in the linked list?**
   In that case, every element in `nums` will be its own connected component.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Convert `nums` into a set for O(1) average-time complexity for membership checking.
2. Traverse the linked list while maintaining a flag to track if we are in a connected component.
3. If the current value is in `nums` and we are not currently in a connected component, increment the count of components and set the flag indicating a connection.
4. If the current value is not in `nums`, reset the flag indicating the end of a connection.

### Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def numComponents(head: ListNode, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums_set = set(nums)  # Convert nums to a set for O(1) lookups
    current = head
    in_component = False
    count = 0

    while current:
        if current.val in nums_set:
            if not in_component:
                count += 1
                in_component = True
        else:
            in_component = False
        current = current.next

    return count

# Example usage
# Constructing the linked list: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
head = ListNode(0)
head.next = ListNode(1)
head.next.next = ListNode(2)
head.next.next.next = ListNode(3)

# nums array
nums = [0, 1, 3]

# Call the function
print(numComponents(head, nums))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the linked list exactly once. The space complexity is **O(M)**, where **M** is the number of elements in `nums`, primarily due to storing the elements in a set for fast lookup.
