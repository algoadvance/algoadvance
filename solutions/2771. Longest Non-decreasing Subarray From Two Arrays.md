title:  Longest Non-decreasing Subarray From Two Arrays-out
permalink: /s2771
---
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n`, you need to return the **length of the longest non-decreasing subarray** of length `k` such that:
- The subarray is formed by choosing elements from the same positions in `nums1` and `nums2`.

In other words, you need to find the longest subarray which satisfies:
- len(subarray) = k
- For all `i < k`, subarray[i] is formed by either `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]`
- The values of the subarray are non-decreasing

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the arrays always of the same length?**
   - Yes, both `nums1` and `nums2` have the same length, `n`.
2. **What is the range of values for the integers in the arrays?**
   - The problem does not specify any constraints on the values, so they can be assumed to be any valid integers.
3. **What constraints exist on the length `n` of the arrays?**
   - The constraints are not given in the problem statement.
4. **Is an empty subarray considered?**
   - No, we only consider subarrays of length `k`.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization and Variables**: We will maintain a length counter for the current non-decreasing subarray and a maximum length counter to store the longest length found so far.
2. **Iterating Through the Array**: Loop through the arrays and at each position `i`, decide whether to take `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]` in order to continue the non-decreasing subarray.
3. **Check Conditions**: Update the current length counter based on whether adding the element from `nums1` or `nums2` continues the non-decreasing property. If a position can continue the non-decreasing subarray, increment the current counter. Otherwise, reset it.
4. **Update Maximum Length**: At each step, compare the current non-decreasing subarray length with the maximum length and update if necessary.

## Code
```python
def maxNonDecreasingLength(nums1, nums2):
    n = len(nums1)
    max_len = 1  # Minimum subarray length would be 1 (one element)
    
    # Initialize current subarray lengths
    current_len1 = 1
    current_len2 = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Determine current subarray length if taking element from nums1 or nums2
        new_len1 = new_len2 = 1
        
        # If we continue with nums1[i]
        if nums1[i] >= nums1[i - 1]:
            new_len1 = current_len1 + 1
        if nums1[i] >= nums2[i - 1]:
            new_len1 = max(new_len1, current_len2 + 1)
        
        # If we continue with nums2[i]
        if nums2[i] >= nums1[i - 1]:
            new_len2 = current_len1 + 1
        if nums2[i] >= nums2[i - 1]:
            new_len2 = max(new_len2, current_len2 + 1)
        
        # Update the current lengths for the next iteration
        current_len1 = new_len1
        current_len2 = new_len2

        # Update the maximum length found
        max_len = max(max_len, current_len1, current_len2)
    
    return max_len
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We process each of the `n` elements exactly once in the loop.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space for the variables.

This approach ensures that we effectively track the longest non-decreasing subarray across both input arrays by maintaining meaningful state updates while iterating through the elements.
