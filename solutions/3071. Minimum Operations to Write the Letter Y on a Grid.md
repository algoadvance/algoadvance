title:  Minimum Operations to Write the Letter Y on a Grid-out
permalink: /s3071
---

You are given an `m x n` grid initially containing all zeros. You are also given an array `operations` where each operation contains three integers: `x`, `y`, and `type`. Each operation modifies the grid in different ways:

- If `type` is `1`, set the cell `(x, y)` to `1`.
- If `type` is `2`, set the entire row `x` to `1`.
- If `type` is `3`, set the entire column `y` to `1`.
- If `type` is `4`, set the entire `x`-th row and the `y`-th column to `1`.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to write the letter 'Y' on the grid in such a way that:

- The 'Y' is formed such that its stem is a vertical column of '1's.
- Its two arms are diagonal lines (i.e., forming a +/- 45 degrees angles with the vertical stem).

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints on grid size (m x n)?**
    - Needed to handle edge cases and performance considerations.

2. **What are the exact coordinates for the arms and stem of 'Y'?**
    - To compute the minimal operations, the exact positions of these elements are necessary.

3. **Can the operations overlap and, if so, how are they resolved?**
    - Determines if there's any need for sequence optimization or if operations can be considered individually.

4. **Do diagonal cells included in the arms need to be included or just the stem?**
    - Clarifies the exact scope of changes required.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialization:** Define the grid and mark all required positions (stem and arms of 'Y').

2. **Track Changes:** Use auxiliary structures (like sets) to keep track of changes required.

3. **Evaluate Operations:** Iterate through the array of operations and mark the covered cells accordingly:

    - If the operation fully contributes to marking the required 'Y', count it.

4. **Optimization:** Calculate the minimal number of operations needed based on intersections and overlaps.

### Time Complexity:
- The complexity mainly revolves around iterating over the list of operations and the size of the grid, leading generally to `O(m * n + k)`, where `k` is the number of operations, considering worst-case evaluations.

Given the above understanding, here's a draft of the code in Python.

### Code:

```python
def min_operations_to_form_y(m, n, operations):
    needed_cells = set()
    
    # Hypothetically placing 'Y' centered on some position (x, y) on the grid
    center_x, center_y = m // 2, n // 2

    # Mark needed cells for arms and stem
    for i in range(m):
        if i == center_x:
            for j in range(n):
                needed_cells.add((i, j))
    
    for i in range(center_x):
        needed_cells.add((center_x+i, center_y+i))
        needed_cells.add((center_x+i, center_y-i))
    
    # We'll keep a set of how many unique cells are actually needed
    marked_cells = set()
    operations_count = 0
    
    for op in operations:
        x, y, op_type = op
        current_cells = set()
        
        if op_type == 1:
            current_cells.add((x, y))
        elif op_type == 2:
            for j in range(n):
                current_cells.add((x, j))
        elif op_type == 3:
            for i in range(m):
                current_cells.add((i, y))
        elif op_type == 4:
            for j in range(n):
                current_cells.add((x, j))
            for i in range(m):
                current_cells.add((i, y))
        
        # Check if the current operation helps achieve required cells
        if not marked_cells.union(current_cells).issuperset(needed_cells):
            marked_cells.update(current_cells)
            operations_count += 1

        # Early termination if all needed cells are covered
        if needed_cells.issubset(marked_cells):
            return operations_count

    return operations_count if needed_cells.issubset(marked_cells) else -1


# Sample test run with dummy data
m = 5
n = 5
operations = [(2, 2, 1), (2, 0, 4), (0, 2, 2), (-1, -1, -1)]  # Add the actual test cases

print(min_operations_to_form_y(m, n, operations))
```

This is a basic representation and may need adjustments based on specific requirements in the prompt or additional constraints.
