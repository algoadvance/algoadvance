title:  Map Sum Pairs-out
permalink: /s677

### Problem Statement
You need to implement the `MapSum` class:

- `MapSum()` Initializes the `MapSum` object.
- `void insert(String key, int val)` Inserts the key-val pair into the map. If the key already existed, the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one.
- `int sum(String prefix)` Returns the sum of all the pairs' value whose key starts with the given prefix.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the keys contain any characters, or are they just lowercase English letters?
2. Are the key and prefix guaranteed to be non-empty?

Let's assume for simplicity that keys are non-empty strings consisting of lowercase English letters and that they can be of any length.

### Strategy
We'll use a combination of a hashmap and a Trie (prefix tree) to efficiently manage the insert and prefix sum operations.

1. **Insert Operation**: This will involve storing the key-value pairs in a dictionary. We'll also update/add the key in a Trie structure to keep track of all keys that start with given prefixes.
  
2. **Sum Operation**:
   - Navigate the Trie to find the node corresponding to the prefix.
   - Accumulate the sums of all nodes in the subtree of this prefix node.

### Code Implementation
Here's how we can implement this:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.value = 0

class MapSum:

    def __init__(self):
        self.map = {}
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, key: str, val: int) -> None:
        if key in self.map:
            delta = val - self.map[key]
        else:
            delta = val
        self.map[key] = val

        node = self.root
        node.value += delta
        for char in key:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
            node.value += delta

    def sum(self, prefix: str) -> int:
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return 0
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.value
```

### Time Complexity
- **Insert Operation**: O(m), where `m` is the length of the key. We need to update nodes in the Trie up to the length of the key.
- **Sum Operation**: O(p), where `p` is the length of the prefix. We traverse the Trie up to the length of the prefix.

This approach ensures efficient insert and sum operations by leveraging both a hashmap for direct key access and a Trie for prefix-based sum calculations.
