title:  Repeated Substring Pattern-out
permalink: /s459
---

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You need to determine if `s` can be constructed using any substring with more than one character.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length range for the input string `s`?
   - The input string length ranges from 1 to 10^4.

2. Can the input string `s` contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?
   - No, `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

3. Should we consider edge cases such as the input string being of length 1?
   - Yes, we should consider such cases. A single character string cannot form a repeated substring pattern.

### Strategy

1. **Observation**: If a string `s` can be formed by repeating a substring `p`, then concatenating `s` with itself (i.e., `s + s`) and removing the first and last characters must contain the original string `s` in some position other than the start.

2. **Steps**:
   - Create a new string `ss` by concatenating `s` with itself.
   - Remove the first and last characters from `ss`.
   - Check if the original string `s` exists in the modified `ss`.
   - If `s` exists in the modified `ss`, then `s` can be constructed by repeating a substring.

3. **Return**:
   - Return `True` if `s` is found in modified `ss`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of creating `ss` and modifying it is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `s`.
- The time complexity for checking if `s` is a substring of the modified `ss` is also O(n) using Python's `in` operator.
- Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n), which is efficient given the problem constraints.

### Code

```python
def repeatedSubstringPattern(s: str) -> bool:
    # Concatenate the string with itself
    ss = (s + s)[1:-1]
    # Check if the original string s is inside the modified ss
    return s in ss

# Example Usage
print(repeatedSubstringPattern("abab"))  # Output: True
print(repeatedSubstringPattern("aba"))   # Output: False
print(repeatedSubstringPattern("abcabcabc")) # Output: True
print(repeatedSubstringPattern("abcab")) # Output: False
```

The above code provides a straightforward and efficient method to determine if a string can be constructed by repeating a substring, leveraging string manipulation and pattern recognition techniques.
