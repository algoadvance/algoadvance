2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock. A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days such that the price on each day is one less than the price on the preceding day.

Return the number of smooth descent periods.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 6 smooth descent periods: [3], [2], [1], [4], [3, 2], [2, 1], [3, 2, 1]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can prices be negative?**
   - No, the prices are positive integers.
2. **What is the range of the length of the `prices` array?**
   - The length of `prices` will be between 1 and 10^5.
3. **Is there a maximum value for the prices?**
   - Prices are positive integers, but specifics aren't bounded.

### Strategy

The goal is to identify and count all valid smooth descent periods. Each period consists of elements that steadily descend by 1 each day. For instance, a smooth descent period `[3, 2, 1]` can be split into multiple periods `[3], [2], [1], [3, 2], [2, 1], [3, 2, 1]`. 

Here's the approach:

1. Traverse the array while keeping track of the length of the current descent period.
2. At each step, if the current price is exactly one less than the previous price, increment the length of the descent.
3. Otherwise, reset the descent length to 1 (since each single element is a valid descent period).
4. Add the length of the current descent period to a cumulative counter.

### Code

```python
def getDescentPeriods(prices):
    # Edge Case: Empty prices list
    if not prices:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize variables
    n = len(prices)
    total_periods = 1  # Each single element is a descent period
    current_length = 1
    
    # Iterate through the list starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, n):
        if prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            current_length = 1
        
        total_periods += current_length
    
    return total_periods

# Example usage:
prices = [3, 2, 1, 4]
print(getDescentPeriods(prices))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `prices` array. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

This algorithm efficiently counts the number of smooth descent periods by leveraging a linear scan and maintaining a running count of the lengths of valid descent segments.
