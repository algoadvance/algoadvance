title:  Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes-out
permalink: /s1557
---

Given a directed acyclic graph, with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` represents a directed edge from the node `from_i` to the node `to_i`. Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph can be reached.

Constraints:
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= from_i, to_i < n`
- All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the graph have multiple sources?**
   - Yes, as it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), there may be multiple sources.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that the graph is connected?**
   - No, it's not guaranteed, but we need to find the smallest set of vertices which can reach all nodes.

3. **What if a node has no incoming edges?**
   - Nodes that have no incoming edges must be included in the result as they can't be reached from any other node.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we observe that:
- If a node has no incoming edges, it means that this node cannot be reached from any other node.
- Thus, the set of nodes with no incoming edges forms the minimal set of starting vertices.

### Steps:
1. Create an array to keep track of incoming edges for each node.
2. Iterate through the list of edges, updating the incoming edge count for each target node.
3. Collect all nodes that have zero incoming edges as they are necessary to reach all nodes in the DAG.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n + e)\), where \(n\) is the number of vertices and \(e\) is the number of edges. This is because we iterate through all nodes and all edges once.

## Code

```python
def findSmallestSetOfVertices(n, edges):
    # Step 1: Initialize an array to count incoming edges
    incoming = [0] * n
    
    # Step 2: Populate the incoming edges count
    for edge in edges:
        incoming[edge[1]] += 1
        
    # Step 3: Collect nodes with zero incoming edges
    result = [node for node in range(n) if incoming[node] == 0]
    
    return result

# Example usage
n = 6
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]

print(findSmallestSetOfVertices(n, edges))  # Output: [0, 3]
```

This solution efficiently identifies the minimal set of vertices from which all other nodes can be reached by leveraging the properties of incoming edges in a directed acyclic graph.
