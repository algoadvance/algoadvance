title:  Validate Binary Tree Nodes-out
permalink: /s1361
---

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and two arrays `leftChild` and `rightChild` of length `n`, where `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]` contain the left and right child of the `i-th` node, respectively. `leftChild[i]` or `rightChild[i]` is `-1` if the `i-th` node doesn't have a left or right child.

Write a function to determine if the nodes form a valid binary tree.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,-1]
Output: true
```
Explanation: The binary tree is:
```
    0
   / \
  1   2
 /
3
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,3,-1,-1]
Output: false
```
Explanation: Node 3 has two parents (2 and 0), so it's not a valid binary tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can any node be isolated?
   - No, all nodes should be connected (to form one single tree).
   
2. Is it guaranteed all node labels are unique?
   - Yes, each node label from 0 to `n-1` is unique.
   
3. Should we consider the possibility of cycles?
   - Yes, a valid binary tree cannot have cycles.

### Strategy

1. **Check for Single Root:** There should be exactly one root node in the binary tree. A root node is identified as a node with no parents.
2. **Child Parent Mapping:** Ensure no node has more than one parent.
3. **Cycle Detection:** Use Depth First Search (DFS) or Union-Find to ensure there are no cycles, starting from the root node and ensuring all nodes are visited starting from the root.

### Code

```python
def validateBinaryTreeNodes(n, leftChild, rightChild):
    # Step 1: Determine in-degrees of nodes
    indegree = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        if leftChild[i] != -1:
            indegree[leftChild[i]] += 1
        if rightChild[i] != -1:
            indegree[rightChild[i]] += 1
    
    # Step 2: Find the root
    root = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            if root == -1:
                root = i
            else:
                # More than one node with no parent means invalid
                return False
    
    if root == -1:
        # No root found
        return False
    
    # Step 3: DFS to check for connectivity and cycles
    visited = [False] * n
    
    def dfs(node):
        if visited[node]:
            return False
        visited[node] = True
        for child in (leftChild[node], rightChild[node]):
            if child != -1 and not dfs(child):
                return False
        return True
    
    if not dfs(root):
        return False
    
    # Check all nodes are reached
    return all(visited)

# Example usage:
print(validateBinaryTreeNodes(4, [1,-1,3,-1], [2,-1,-1,-1])) # Output: true
print(validateBinaryTreeNodes(4, [1,-1,3,-1], [2,3,-1,-1])) # Output: false
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)**. This is because we iterate over the nodes multiple times:
1. First pass to calculate the indegree of each node, which takes O(n) time.
2. Identifying the root node also takes O(n) time.
3. The DFS traversal from the root in the worst case visits all nodes, again taking O(n) time.
