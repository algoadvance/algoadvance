title:  Transform to Chessboard-out
permalink: /s782
---

An `n x n` binary grid is considered to be a valid "chessboard" if every cell in the grid adheres to the following rules:
1. Each cell is either a 0 or a 1.
2. No two adjacent cells (both vertically and horizontally) are the same.

Given a binary grid, return the minimum number of moves required to transform it into a chessboard. If it is impossible to do so, return -1.

A move consists of swapping any two rows or any two columns.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - Can we assume the grid is always a square matrix (n x n)?
     - Yes.

2. **Value Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the value of n (grid size)?
     - Typically, constraints would be like `2 <= n <= 30`.

3. **Output:**
   - What should the function return if the transformation is not possible?
     - Return `-1` if the transformation is not possible.

## Strategy

1. **Validation:**
   - Ensure the grid is theoretically transformable into a chessboard:
     - Each row and column should have roughly half 1’s and half 0’s (an allowance of one more if `n` is odd).
     - The first row/column must have exactly two forms to ensure alternation is possible.
   
2. **Operation Calculation:**
   - Calculate the number of swaps required to rearrange rows and columns to make the grid into an alternating 0 and 1 pattern.
   - Ensure both rows and columns follow the pattern after sorting them.

3. **Final Transformation:** 
   - The optimal number of swaps can be calculated by comparing the current configuration with valid chessboard configurations and determining the minimum swaps necessary.

## Code

```python
def movesToChessboard(board):
    from collections import Counter
    
    n = len(board)
    moves = 0

    # Check validity of the board
    # Count rows and columns
    row_count = Counter(tuple(row) for row in board)
    col_count = Counter(tuple(board[row][col] for row in range(n)) for col in range(n))

    # There should be exactly 2 types of rows and cols
    if len(row_count) != 2 or len(col_count) != 2:
        return -1

    rows = list(row_count.keys())
    cols = list(col_count.keys())

    # Check if rows and cols can form valid chessboard lines
    if not all((sum(r) in [n//2, (n+1)//2]) for r in row_count.values()) or \
       not all((sum(c) in [n//2, (n+1)//2]) for c in col_count.values()):
        return -1

    mask = (1 << n) - 1

    def min_swaps(lines):
        line1, line2 = lines
        line1_count = bin(line1).count('1')
        line2_count = bin(line2).count('1')

        if abs(line1_count - line2_count) > 1:
            return -1
        
        if line1 ^ line2 != mask:
            return -1

        line1_positions = [i for i in range(n) if (line1 >> i) & 1]
        ideal_positions = [i for i in range(n) if i % 2 == 0]

        swaps1 = sum(1 for a, b in zip(line1_positions, ideal_positions) if a != b)

        if n % 2 == 0:
            ideal_positions = [i for i in range(n) if i % 2 == 1]
            swaps2 = sum(1 for a, b in zip(line1_positions, ideal_positions) if a != b)
            return min(swaps1, swaps2)
        else:
            return swaps1

    row_values = [sum(cell << i for i, cell in enumerate(row)) for row in board]
    col_values = [sum(board[row][col] << row for row in range(n)) for col in range(n)]

    row_swaps = min_swaps(Counter(row_values).keys())
    col_swaps = min_swaps(Counter(col_values).keys())

    if row_swaps == -1 or col_swaps == -1:
        return -1

    return (row_swaps + col_swaps) // 2

# Example:
board = [[0, 1, 0, 1], 
         [1, 0, 1, 0], 
         [0, 1, 1, 0], 
         [1, 0, 0, 1]]
print(movesToChessboard(board))  # Expected: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Validation Step**:
  - Counting rows/columns and checking `O(n^2)` operations.
- **Transformation Calculation**:
  - Calculating the swaps involves iterating over rows and columns, making the complexity `O(n)` per part (rows and columns).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the need to iterate over the matrix multiple times for validation and calculation steps.
