title:  Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Substrings-out
permalink: /s1520
---
Given a string `s`, you are allowed to choose some substrings from `s` and distort them by reversing their characters or swapping characters at two positions. You need to make the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings chosen such that all the characters in each substring appear also as its both first and last characters.

Your task is to find out the maximum number of such substrings in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed, let's clarify the problem with a few questions:
1. Are all characters in the substring required to be the same character?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s` or the characters it can contain?
3. Is the order in which substrings are outputted important, or just the count?
4. Can you provide an example or edge cases?

### Strategy
1. **Identify Character Ranges:** First, identify the first and last occurrence of each character in the string.
2. **Merge Overlapping Ranges:** Use these ranges to construct the substrings. Handle merging of overlapping ranges to ensure that the substrings are non-overlapping.
3. **Optimal Selection:** Using a greedy approach, select the maximum non-overlapping substrings by iterating through the character ranges sorted by their end indices.

### Code
Let's implement the solution based on the above strategy:

```python
def maxNumOfSubstrings(s: str):
    # Step 1: Identify the first and last occurrence of each character
    first = {}
    last = {}
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if c not in first:
            first[c] = i
        last[c] = i

    # Step 2: Define ranges with valid substrings
    valid_ranges = []
    for c in set(s):
        start = first[c]
        end = last[c]
        valid = True
        i = start
        while i <= end:
            if first[s[i]] < start:
                valid = False
                break
            end = max(end, last[s[i]])
            i += 1
        if valid:
            valid_ranges.append((start, end))

    # Step 3: Sort ranges by their end index
    valid_ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    # Step 4: Select the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings
    result = []
    end = -1
    for start, stop in valid_ranges:
        if start > end:
            result.append(s[start:stop + 1])
            end = stop

    return result

# Example usage
s = "adefaddaccc"
print(maxNumOfSubstrings(s)) # Output: ['e', 'f', 'ccc']
```

### Time Complexity
- **Identifying first & last positions:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Determining valid ranges:** O(n) since each character is checked in linear time.
- **Sorting the ranges:** O(m log m) where `m` is the number of unique characters in `s`.
- **Selecting maximum non-overlapping substrings:** O(m).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m log m).

### Summary
We identified character ranges, merged overlapping ranges, and used a greedy approach to select the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings. The problem involves linear scans and sorting, leading to an efficient solution within the time complexity O(n + m log m).
