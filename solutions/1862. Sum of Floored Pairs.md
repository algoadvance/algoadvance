title:  Sum of Floored Pairs-out
permalink: /s1862
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of `floor(nums[i] / nums[j])` for all pairs of indices `0 <= i, j < nums.length` in the array.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values in `nums`?**
   - The values in `nums` are positive integers.

2. **What is the size of the array `nums`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify the limit directly here, but let's assume it can go up to tens of thousands based on typical LeetCode constraints.

3. **Should we handle multiple test cases or just one single case?**
   - The problem assumes the function will handle one single test case.

### Strategy

To efficiently compute the sum of `floor(nums[i] / nums[j])` for all pairs `(i, j)`, a brute-force approach might be too slow (O(n^2) time complexity). Instead, we can take advantage of the properties of flooring and counting elements.

#### Steps:

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - Calculate the frequency of each number in `nums` to assist in optimizing the pair calculations.

2. **Prefix Sum for Count Array**:
   - Use a prefix sum array to help efficiently calculate the sum of floors.

3. **Iterate Over Possible Divisors**:
   - For each possible divisor, calculate the contribution to the result from all multiples of that divisor within the range of nums.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` at each addition operation.

### Code

```python
def sumOfFlooredPairs(nums):
    from collections import Counter
    import itertools
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    max_val = max(nums)
    
    # Step 1: Frequency count of elements in nums
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Step 2: Prefix sum array for counting occurrences
    count = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for num in nums:
        count[num] += 1
    
    prefix_sum = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_val + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + count[i]
    
    result = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over each possible divisor (from 1 to max_val)
    for divisor in range(1, max_val + 1):
        if count[divisor] > 0:
            for multiple in range(divisor, max_val + 1, divisor):
                upper_bound = min(multiple + divisor - 1, max_val)
                total_count = prefix_sum[upper_bound] - prefix_sum[multiple - 1]
                result += total_count * count[divisor] * (multiple // divisor)
                result %= MOD
    
    return result % MOD

# Example usage
nums = [2, 5, 9]
print(sumOfFlooredPairs(nums))  # Expected output: 10
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: O(n) for counting frequency, O(max_val) for creating and filling the prefix sum array.
- **Main Loop**: O(max_val * log(max_val)) approximately because each divisor iterates through its multiples.

Overall complexity is approximately O(n + max_val * log(max_val)), where `n` is the length of `nums` and `max_val` is the largest value in `nums`. This is efficient enough for large inputs within typical competitive programming constraints.
