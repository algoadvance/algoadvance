A "good base" of a number `n` is defined as a base `k` where `n` can be expressed as the sum of increasing powers of `k` with only 1s as coefficients. For example, the number `13` can be expressed as `1 + 3 + 9` in base 3 (i.e., 13 = 1*3^0 + 1*3^1 + 1*3^2), so 3 is a good base for 13. Given an integer `n` represented as a string, return the smallest good base of `n`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = "13"
Output: "3"
Explanation: 13 = 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = "4681"
Output: "8"
Explanation: 4681 = 8^0 + 8^1 + 8^2 + 8^3
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = "1000000000000000000"
Output: "999999999999999999"
Explanation: 1000000000000000000 = 999999999999999999^0 + 999999999999999999^1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are we guaranteed that the input will always be a valid integer string?
   - **Assume yes**, the input is always a valid integer string.
2. What is the range of `n`?
   - Typically `1 <= n <= 10^18`.
3. Should the result be returned as a string?
   - Yes, return the smallest good base of `n` as a string.

### Strategy

1. The goal is to find the smallest integer base `k > 1` such that `n` can be represented as `1 + k^1 + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)` for some integer `m > 1`.

2. For a given `m`, the sum of the series can be expressed as `(k^m - 1) / (k - 1)`. We need to find such `k` and `m` for which this equation holds true.

3. The upper bound for `m` can be determined by the logarithmic relationship:
   - \( m \leq \log_2(n + 1) \)
   - This is because the smallest sum grows exponentially with the number of terms.

4. We cycle through possible values of `m` from the largest to the smallest, and for each `m`, we use binary search to find an appropriate base `k`.

5. Using binary search for each `m` in the range will help efficiently narrow down the smallest good base.

### Code
```python
import math

def smallestGoodBase(n: str) -> str:
    n = int(n)
    
    for m in range(int(math.log(n, 2)), 1, -1):
        k = int(n**m**(-1))
        if (k**(m+1) - 1) // (k - 1) == n:
            return str(k)
    
    return str(n - 1)

# Example usage
print(smallestGoodBase("13"))     # Output: "3"
print(smallestGoodBase("4681"))   # Output: "8"
print(smallestGoodBase("1000000000000000000"))  # Output: "999999999999999999"
```

### Time Complexity

- Time complexity: \(O(\log n \cdot \log n)\), because:
  1. The outer loop runs \(\log_2(n)\) times.
  2. The binary search for each \(m\) is logarithmic with respect to \(n\).
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\), as we are using a few extra variables.

This solution ensures we systematically search for the smallest good base in an efficient manner.
