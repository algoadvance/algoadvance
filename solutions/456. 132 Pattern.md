title:  132 Pattern-out
permalink: /s456
---

Given an array of `n` integers `nums`, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`. Return `true` if there is a 132 pattern in `nums`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [-1, 3, 2, 0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are several 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2] and [-1, 3, 0].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of the array unique?**
   - No, the elements can have duplicates.
   
2. **What is the range of the elements in the array?**
   - The elements can be any integer within typical integer limits.
   
3. **Is there any specific time complexity requirement?**
   - Ideally, an efficient solution would be preferable, preferably better than O(n^2).

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, an O(n) time complexity solution can be used via a stack-based approach. Here's the strategy:

1. **Maintain a stack and a variable `sec` (second highest)**:
   - Traverse the array from the end to the beginning.
   - Use the stack to track potential `nums[k]` (values which might be the middle one in the 132 pattern).
   - `sec` will help us ensure we have a valid candidate for `nums[i]`.

2. **Iterate from the end of the array**:
   - For each element, the key idea is to determine if it can be `nums[i]`.
   - Compare the current element to `sec` to see if `nums[i] < nums[k]` where `nums[k]` is a previously seen value.
   - Pop elements from the stack if they are less than the current value (possible `nums[k]` for a future `nums[j]`).
   - Push the current element onto the stack to be a potential future `nums[j]`.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def find132pattern(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return False
    
    stack = []
    sec = float('-inf')  # This will hold the second highest number in the 132 pattern
    
    # Traverse backwards
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] < sec:
            return True
        while stack and nums[i] > stack[-1]:
            sec = stack.pop()
        stack.append(nums[i])
    
    return False

# Test cases
print(find132pattern([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: False
print(find132pattern([3, 1, 4, 2]))  # Output: True
print(find132pattern([-1, 3, 2, 0])) # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Using a stack to maintain potential `nums[j]` values. 

This solution efficiently finds the 132 pattern using stack operations, ensuring optimal performance for larger inputs.
