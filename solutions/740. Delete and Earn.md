title:  Delete and Earn-out

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the amount of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. However, after picking `nums[i]`, you must also delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and `nums[i] + 1` from the array.

Your task is to return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation.

### Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: `nums = [3, 4, 2]`
  - Output: `6`
  - Explanation: Delete `4` to earn `4` points, resulting in `nums = [3, 2]`.
                 Then, delete `2` to earn `2` points, resulting in `nums = [3]`.
                 Then, delete `3` to earn `3` points, resulting in an empty list.
                 You earn a total of `4 + 2 + 3 = 9` points.

- Example 2:
  - Input: `nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `9`
  - Explanation: Delete `3` to earn `3` points, resulting in `nums = [2, 2, 4]`.
                 Then, delete `3` to earn `3` points, resulting in `nums = [2, 2, 4]`.
                 Then, delete `4` to earn `4` points, resulting in `nums = [2, 2]`.
                 Now you can't delete `2` anymore since there are no more `3`s in the array.
                 You earn a total of `3 + 3 + 4 = 9` points.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array `nums` be empty?
   - No.
2. What is the range of values for `nums` and its elements?
   - The length of the array is up to \(10^4\), and each element in `nums` can be between `1` and `10^4`.

### Strategy
The problem can be reduced to a variant of the "House Robber" problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Frequency Mapping**: First, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in `nums`. This helps in calculating the total points we can earn from each unique number.
  
2. **Convert Problem**: Once we have the total points for each number, the problem converts to a dynamic programming problem similar to the house robber: should we "rob" this house (pick this number) or skip it (avoid picking this number and picking adjacent numbers).

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We'll use a dp array where `dp[i]` will represent the maximum points we can earn considering numbers from 1 up to `i`.

4. **State Transition**: For each unique number, we can decide to either:
    - Take points including `i` and skip `i-1`, i.e., `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], points[i] + dp[i-2])`
    - Skip the current number `i`, i.e., `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`

5. **Initialize Base Cases**: Start with initial conditions for `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`.

6. **Return Result**: The maximum points achievable considering all numbers up to the maximum value in `nums`.

### Code
```python
def deleteAndEarn(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Calculate total points for each unique number
    points = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        points[num] += num
    
    # Create a sorted list of unique numbers
    unique_nums = sorted(points.keys())
    
    # Initialize dp array
    prev2 = 0
    prev1 = points[unique_nums[0]]
    
    for i in range(1, len(unique_nums)):
        current = unique_nums[i]
        if unique_nums[i] == unique_nums[i-1] + 1:
            current_points = max(prev1, prev2 + points[current])
        else:
            current_points = prev1 + points[current]
        
        prev2, prev1 = prev1, current_points
    
    return prev1

# Example usages
print(deleteAndEarn([3, 4, 2]))       # Output: 6
print(deleteAndEarn([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]))  # Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the frequency dictionary takes \(O(n)\).
- Sorting the unique elements takes \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique elements (maximum \(10^4\)).
- Iterating through the sorted elements and computing `dp` values takes \(O(k)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + k \log k)\).
