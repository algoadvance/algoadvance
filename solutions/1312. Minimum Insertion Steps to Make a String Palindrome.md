title:  Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome-out
permalink: /s1312
---
Given a string `s`. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string. Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the input string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` can be up to 500 characters.
   
2. **Are there any restrictions on the characters in `s`?**
   - No, the problem does not specify any restrictions, so we can assume `s` consists of standard alphanumeric characters.

3. **What is the desired output?**
   - The desired output is a single integer representing the minimum number of insertions needed to make the string a palindrome.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the problem:** To convert string `s` to a palindrome with the minimum insertions, one approach is to use dynamic programming to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in `s`. The minimum number of insertions needed would then be the difference between the length of the string and the length of this longest palindromic subsequence.

2. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS):** 
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of substring `s[i:j+1]`.
   - Base cases:
     - If `i == j`, `dp[i][j] = 1` because a single character is always a palindrome of length 1.
     - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`.
     - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Relation to the original problem:**
   - Let `L` be the length of the input string `s`.
   - Let `LPS` be the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
   - The minimum number of insertions required would be `L - LPS`.

### Code

```python
def minInsertions(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    # Create a 2D array to store the length of LPS
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Build the dp array
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    # The length of the longest palindromic subsequence
    LPS = dp[0][n - 1]
    
    # Minimum insertions needed
    return n - LPS
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string. This is due to the nested loops used to fill the `dp` table.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for the `dp` array used to store the results of subproblems.
