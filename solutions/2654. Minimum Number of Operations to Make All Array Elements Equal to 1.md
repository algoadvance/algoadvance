title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to 1-out
permalink: /s2654
---

Given an integer array `nums` made up of positive integers, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal to 1. In one operation, you can select an index `i` (0 <= i < nums.length) and modify the elements at index `i` and at adjacent indices `i-1`, `i+1` by the bitwise OR operation with the value at index `i`.

Write a function that returns the minimum number of operations required to achieve this. If it is not possible to make all elements equal to 1, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in `nums`**: What is the range of values that the integers in `nums` can take?
2. **Length of `nums`**: What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
3. **Initial elements**: Are there specific constraints on the distribution of initial values in the array?
4. **Value modification rules**: Is the bitwise OR operation applied repeatedly to the same indices as possible?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Operations**: Each operation involves selecting an index `i` and performing a bitwise OR on `nums[i-1]`, `nums[i]`, and `nums[i+1]`. This indicates that the value at each position depends on its neighbors.

2. **Identify Dependencies**: If there is any position where the value is not 1, its neighbor should ideally be made 1 eventually.

3. **Key Insight**: To make every element in the array equal to 1, every zero should eventually be turned into a 1 through consecutive operations.

4. **Combining Elements**: For a zero to become 1 in an optimal way, we must consider the adjacent values and the cumulative OR operations.

### Code

```python
def minOperations(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Early exit if nums is already all ones
    if sum(nums) == n:
        return 0

    # First, check if there is even a single 1 in the array
    if 1 not in nums:
        return -1

    min_operations = float('inf')
    
    # We traverse the array to find the minimum distance between two 1s
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] == 1:
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if nums[j] == 1:
                    dist = j - i - 1
                    if dist > 0:
                        min_operations = min(min_operations, dist)
                    break
    
    if min_operations == float('inf'):
        return -1
    return n - 1 + min_operations

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 0, 1, 1]
print(minOperations(nums))  # Expected output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(n) if the array is already all 1's.
- **General Case**: O(n^2) for the nested loop that finds the minimum distance between 1's for appropriate transformations.

With the above solution, considerations include ensuring that the initial values support the given operations to achieve an optimized solution efficiently.
