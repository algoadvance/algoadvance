You are given the following problem on LeetCode:

**297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree**

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarifying Questions**

1. **Can the values of the tree nodes be negative or zero?**
   - Yes, the values can be any integer.
   
2. **Is the tree guaranteed to be a binary tree?**
   - Yes, the tree is guaranteed to be a binary tree.

3. **Should the algorithm handle edge cases like empty trees?**
   - Yes, the algorithm should correctly handle empty trees (null roots).

### Strategy

**Serialization:**

1. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) while traversing the tree.
2. Use 'None' to represent null nodes.
3. Store values in a list and convert it to a string joined by a delimiter (e.g., comma).

**Deserialization:**

1. Split the serialized string by the delimiter to get the list of values.
2. Use a queue to reconstruct the tree level by level.
3. Attach child nodes appropriately while traversing.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Codec:
    def serialize(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> str:
        """Encodes a tree to a single string."""
        if not root:
            return "None"
        
        queue = deque([root])
        res = []
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                res.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                res.append("None")
                
        return ",".join(res)

    def deserialize(self, data: str) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree."""
        if data == "None":
            return None
        
        nodes = data.split(",")
        root = TreeNode(int(nodes[0]))
        queue = deque([root])
        i = 1
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if nodes[i] != "None":
                node.left = TreeNode(int(nodes[i]))
                queue.append(node.left)
            i += 1
            
            if nodes[i] != "None":
                node.right = TreeNode(int(nodes[i]))
                queue.append(node.right)
            i += 1
            
        return root
```

### Time Complexity

**Serialization:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We process each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the serialized values in the result list.

**Deserialization:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We rebuild each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store nodes in the queue during the level-order reconstruction.

This should cover the serialization and deserialization mechanism for a binary tree efficiently, handling both empty and non-empty trees.
