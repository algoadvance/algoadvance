title:  Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array-out
permalink: /s2022
---
You are given a 1D array `original` and two integers, `m` and `n`, which represent the dimensions of a 2D array. You need to transform the 1D array into a 2D array with `m` rows and `n` columns. If it is not possible to meet the desired dimensions, return an empty 2D array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output if the conversion is not possible?**
   - If the conversion is not possible, return an empty 2D array.
2. **Will the input always be a valid 1D array?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the input is always a valid 1D array.
3. **Can `m` or `n` be zero or negative?**
   - No, `m` and `n` will always be positive integers.

### Strategy
1. **Check if Conversion is Possible:**
   - The conversion is possible if the length of the `original` array equals `m * n`.
   - If not, return an empty list.
2. **Reshape the Array:**
   - Iterate over the elements of `original` and fill a 2D array row by row.

### Code
```python
def construct2DArray(original, m, n):
    # Check if conversion is possible
    if len(original) != m * n:
        return []

    # Initialize the 2D array
    result = []
    for i in range(m):
        # Create a row and insert the correct elements
        row = original[i * n:(i + 1) * n]
        result.append(row)

    return result

# Example usage:
original = [1, 2, 3, 4]
m = 2
n = 2
print(construct2DArray(original, m, n))  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` or equivalently `O(len(original))`
  - We iterate through the list exactly once to create the 2D array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)`
  - We use extra space to store the resultant 2D array.
