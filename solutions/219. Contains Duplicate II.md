title:  Contains Duplicate II-out

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers or only positive integers?**
    - The array can contain both negative and positive integers.

2. **What is the range of values for `k`?**
    - `k` can be any non-negative integer within the constraints of typical LeetCode problems, commonly up to `10^5`.

3. **What should we return if the `nums` array is empty or contains a single element?**
    - If the `nums` array is empty or has only one element, return `false` since no indices `i` and `j` can satisfy the condition.

4. **Is the input always valid?**
    - Yes, you can assume that `nums` and `k` are always valid inputs.

## Strategy

We need to track the indices of elements we have seen while traversing the array. Here's a concise plan to achieve this:

1. Use a dictionary to store the last index of each element.
2. As we traverse the list, for each element, check if it exists in the dictionary:
    - If it exists, calculate the absolute difference between the current index and the stored index.
    - If the difference is less than or equal to `k`, return `true`.
    - Otherwise, update the dictionary with the current index of the element.
3. If we finish traversing the list without finding any such pairs, return `false`.

## Code

```python
def containsNearbyDuplicate(nums, k):
    index_map = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num in index_map and i - index_map[num] <= k:
            return True
        index_map[num] = i
    
    return False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. We traverse the list once, and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) are on average O(1).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, k)), as the dictionary will at most store `k` elements due to the sliding window constraint.

This solution efficiently checks for duplicate elements within the given index distance constraint, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs.
