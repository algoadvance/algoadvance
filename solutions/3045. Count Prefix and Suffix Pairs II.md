title:  Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs II-out
permalink: /s3045
---

You are given two lists of strings `pref` and `suff`. A pair of strings (p, s) is considered valid if there is a string `t` such that:
- `t` starts with the prefix `p`
- `t` ends with the suffix `s`

Determine the number of valid pairs (p, s).

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed with solving the problem, here are a few clarifying questions to ensure we understand the requirements correctly:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length of the lists `pref` and `suff`?
   - What is the length of each string within these lists?
  
2. **Output:**
   - Should The output be an integer representing the number of valid pairs?
  
3. **Examples:**
   - Can you provide an example input and expected output?

Assuming that:
- Both `pref` and `suff` lists contain strings of length up to 100 and list sizes up to 1000.
- We're interested in the number of valid pairs (p, s).

### Strategy

**Approach:**
1. **Brute-Force Approach:**
    - For each prefix in `pref`, and each suffix in `suff`, concatenate the prefix and suffix and ensure that they can form a valid string.
    - This will involve nested loops to check each combination.
    
2. **Optimized Approach:**
    - Extract all possible valid combinations of prefixes and suffixes which can form a string.
    - Use set operations or pre-generated substrings to check validity.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize a counter for valid pairs.
2. Iterate over each prefix in `pref`.
3. For each prefix, iterate over each suffix in `suff`.
4. Construct the potential string by concatenating prefix and suffix.
5. Check if the constructed string starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix.
6. If valid, increment the counter.
7. Return the counter.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def count_prefix_suffix_pairs(pref, suff):
    count = 0
    
    for p in pref:
        for s in suff:
            if len(p) + len(s) <= 100:  # Reasonable length constraint
                # Construct potential string and validate
                t = p + s
                if t.startswith(p) and t.endswith(s):
                    count += 1
                    
    return count

# Example usage:
pref = ["a", "ab"]
suff = ["b", "ab"]
print(count_prefix_suffix_pairs(pref, suff))  # Should print 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Brute-force method runs in O(n * m)**, where `n` is the length of the `pref` list and `m` is the length of the `suff` list.
- For each pair (p, s), the time complexity to check if `t` starts with `p` and ends with `s` is O(k) where `k` is the length of the concatenated string. Since the length is limited (<=100) and treated as a constant, overall complexity still remains practical.

### Conclusion

This solution ensures that we cover all possible pairs and check their validity efficiently with a time complexity of O(n * m), which should be performant given the constraints. A more sophisticated approach might involve trie data structures for better performance, but the current approach is straightforward and aligns well with typical interpretive programming practices.
