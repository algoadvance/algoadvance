title:  Reverse Pairs-out
permalink: /s493
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. A reverse pair is a pair `(i, j)` where:
- `0 <= i < j < nums.length` and 
- `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]`.

Return the number of reverse pairs in the array.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,1]
Output: 2

Input: nums = [2,4,3,5,1]
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?
   **A:** The size of `nums` can be up to `50000` elements.
   
2. **Q:** What are the constraints on the values within `nums`?
   **A:** The values can be between `-2^31` and `2^31 - 1`.

3. **Q:** Are there any specific performance requirements?
   **A:** Yes, since the array can be quite large, we need an efficient solution, ideally better than O(nÂ²).

## Strategy

Given the constraints, a brute-force approach (O(nÂ²)) would be too slow. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach leveraging a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm naturally divides the array and sorts it, which can be adapted to count the reverse pairs during the merging step.

Here's the strategy:

1. Implement a modified merge sort that counts reverse pairs while merging.
2. Split the array into left and right halves and recursively sort them.
3. During the merging process, count the pairs `(i, j)` where `nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]` for the left and right parts.
4. Merge the sorted halves back together.

This will work in O(n log n) time complexity.

## Code

```python
def reversePairs(nums):
    def mergeSort(nums, start, end):
        if start >= end:
            return 0
        
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        count = mergeSort(nums, start, mid) + mergeSort(nums, mid + 1, end)
        
        # Count reverse pairs
        j = mid + 1
        for i in range(start, mid + 1):
            while j <= end and nums[i] > 2 * nums[j]:
                j += 1
            count += j - (mid + 1)
        
        # Merge the two halves
        left = nums[start:mid + 1]
        right = nums[mid + 1:end + 1]
        i = 0
        j = 0
        k = start
        
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] <= right[j]:
                nums[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                nums[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        
        while i < len(left):
            nums[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        
        while j < len(right):
            nums[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
        
        return count

    return mergeSort(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1)

# Test cases
print(reversePairs([1,3,2,3,1]))  # Output: 2
print(reversePairs([2,4,3,5,1]))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The `mergeSort` function runs in O(n log n) time complexity due to the divide-and-conquer approach and the linear merge operation at each level of recursion.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) because of the additional arrays used during the merging process.

This provides an efficient solution to count reverse pairs in the array.
