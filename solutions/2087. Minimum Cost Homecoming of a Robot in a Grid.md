title:  Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2087
---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` representing a cost grid where `grid[i][j]` is the cost of moving to the cell `(i, j)`.

You want to start at cell `(startRow, startCol)` and go to cell `(homeRow, homeCol)` in a single homecoming. The homecoming requires you to move only up, down, left, or right. You cannot move diagonally or outside the grid.

Return the minimum cost needed for the homecoming.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: 
grid = [[1, 3, 1, 1], 
        [1, 5, 1, 2],
        [4, 2, 1, 3]]
startRow = 0
startCol = 0
homeRow = 2 
homeCol = 3

Output: 9
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we traverse a cell more than once?** 
   - Yes, you're allowed to revisit cells, since the cost to move to a cell does not change.

2. **How do we interpret the cost when starting the journey from `startRow` and `startCol`?**
   - The robot incurs no cost to be on the starting cell initially but will incur the cost when moving from the starting cell to an adjacent cell.

3. **What is the range of the grid dimensions as well as the costs?**
   - Typically, the dimensions of the grid `m` and `n` would fall within standard constraints (1 <= m, n <= 100) ensuring feasible solutions with efficient approaches.

## Strategy

Given the constraints and requirements, the strategy would involve:
1. Utilizing a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's algorithm, which is ideal for grids with non-negative weights.
2. Implementing minimum priority queue to store and retrieve the next cell with minimal cost efficiently.
3. Maintaining a distance matrix to record the minimal cost to reach each cell.

### Code
```python
import heapq

def minCostHomecoming(grid, startRow, startCol, homeRow, homeCol):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up

    # Min heap priority queue, initialized with the starting position
    pq = [(0, startRow, startCol)]  # (cost, row, col)
    distances = {(startRow, startCol): 0}

    while pq:
        current_cost, current_row, current_col = heapq.heappop(pq)

        # If we reach the home cell, return the cost
        if (current_row, current_col) == (homeRow, homeCol):
            return current_cost

        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = current_row + dr, current_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < m and 0 <= new_col < n:
                new_cost = current_cost + grid[new_row][new_col]

                if new_cost < distances.get((new_row, new_col), float('inf')):
                    distances[(new_row, new_col)] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, new_row, new_col))

    # If we exit the while loop without returning, there's no valid path (shouldn't happen with given problem constraints)
    return float('inf')

# Example usage
grid = [[1, 3, 1, 1], [1, 5, 1, 2], [4, 2, 1, 3]]
startRow, startCol = 0, 0
homeRow, homeCol = 2, 3
print(minCostHomecoming(grid, startRow, startCol, homeRow, homeCol))  # Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n * log(m * n))
  - Each cell is processed once, with complexity dominated by the operations on the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - The distances dictionary and priority queue can both hold up to `m * n` elements in the worst case.

This ensures the solution is efficient and feasible for typical grid sizes within the provided constraints.
