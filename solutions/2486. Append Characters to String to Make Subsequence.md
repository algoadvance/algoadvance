title:  Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence-out
permalink: /s2486
---
You are given two strings `s` and `t` consisting of only lowercase English letters.

You want to obtain `t` as a subsequence of `s`. Append the minimum number of characters to the end of `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of the resulting string.

Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to `s`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are both input strings `s` and `t` non-empty?
2. Do the strings contain only lowercase English letters?

Assuming the answers are:
1. Yes, both `s` and `t` are guaranteed to be non-empty.
2. Yes, the strings consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
To determine the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to `s` to make `t` a subsequence, we can follow these steps:
1. Initialize a pointer for both `s` (`ptr_s`) and `t` (`ptr_t`).
2. Iterate through `s` with `ptr_s` and try to match characters with `t` using `ptr_t`.
3. If characters from `t` are found in sequence in `s`, increment `ptr_t`.
4. If `ptr_t` reaches the end of `t`, it means `t` is already a subsequence of `s`.
5. If not, the remaining characters from `t` starting from `ptr_t` must be appended to `s`.

The number of characters that need to be appended to `s` will be the length of `t` minus the number of characters that matched (which is `ptr_t`).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`. This is because we need to potentially iterate through both strings once.

## Code

```python
def append_characters(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    ptr_s, ptr_t = 0, 0
    n, m = len(s), len(t)
    
    while ptr_s < n and ptr_t < m:
        if s[ptr_s] == t[ptr_t]:
            ptr_t += 1
        ptr_s += 1
    
    # If ptr_t has reached the end of t, no more characters need to be appended
    if ptr_t == m:
        return 0
    else:
        return m - ptr_t

# Example usage:
s = "abc"
t = "abdc"
print(append_characters(s, t))  # Output would be 1
```

In this implementation:
1. `ptr_s` iterates through `s`.
2. `ptr_t` iterates through `t`.
3. If `s[ptr_s]` matches `t[ptr_t]`, increment `ptr_t` to move to the next character in `t`.
4. After the loop, if `ptr_t` equals the length of `t`, it means all characters of `t` are a subsequence in `s`.
5. Otherwise, the number of characters to append to `s` is the remaining length of `t` starting from `ptr_t`.
