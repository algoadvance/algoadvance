We need to solve a problem from LeetCode, and the problem statement is as follows:

Given an integer array `arr` of size `n` and an integer target, you should find all pairs `(i, j)` (where `0 <= i, j < n` and `i != j`) such that the following condition is met:

\[ arr[i] \oplus arr[j] = \text{{target}} \]

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy the condition.

### Example 1
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 pairs (i, j) that satisfy the condition:
- arr[0] ^ arr[3] = 1 ^ 4 = 5
- arr[2] ^ arr[1] = 3 ^ 2 = 5
```

### Example 2
```
Input: arr = [7, 1, 13, 4], target = 8
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 pair (i, j) that satisfies the condition:
- arr[0] ^ arr[1] = 7 ^ 1 = 8
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can pairs include the same element at different indices?**
   - No, we need `i != j`.

2. **Are negative numbers in the array valid inputs?**
   - The problem does not specify restrictions regarding negative numbers, so we assume they can be part of the array.

## Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach**: Iterate through all pairs `(i, j)` and check if the condition `arr[i] ^ arr[j] == target` holds. This will have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

2. **Optimized Approach Using a HashMap**: 
   - We can use a hash map to store each number and its index while iterating through the array.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, we check if `arr[i] ^ target` exists in the hash map.
     - If it exists, it means `(arr[j], arr[i])` is a valid pair.
     - This approach reduces the time complexity to \(O(n)\) since accessing elements in a hash map is \O(1)\).

## Code
We'll implement the optimized approach using a hash map.

```python
def countPairs(arr, target):
    # HashMap to store the elements with their counts
    hashmap = {}
    count = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        # Desired number to get XOR result to target
        desired = num ^ target
        
        # If desired number exists in hashmap, we have found pairs
        if desired in hashmap:
            count += hashmap[desired]
        
        # Update the hashmap for current number
        if num in hashmap:
            hashmap[num] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[num] = 1
            
    return count

# Example usage
print(countPairs([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)) # Output: 2
print(countPairs([7, 1, 13, 4], 8)) # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array because:
1. We iterate through the array once.
2. Insertions and lookups in the hash map are \(O(1)\) average.

This approach ensures efficient handling of the problem constraints and provides a scalable solution for larger inputs.
