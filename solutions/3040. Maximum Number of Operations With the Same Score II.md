title:  Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score II-out
permalink: /s3040
---

You are given two positive integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both sorted in ascending order. A maximum operation consists of removing the largest elements from both arrays. The score of an operation is the sum of the two removed elements. The goal is to determine the maximum score of such operations that can be achieved and count how many such operations can be performed.

More formally, you have to:
1. Choose two elements `a` from `nums1` and `b` from `nums2` such that `a` and `b` are the largest elements of the arrays respectively.
2. Remove these elements from the arrays.
3. Record the score `a + b`.
4. Repeat the above steps until one of the arrays is empty.
5. Return the maximum score that is achievable and how many times the operations resulting in this maximum score can be performed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Element Constraints**: Is there any constraint on the size of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - **Response**: The size of `nums1` and `nums2` can be up to 10^5.

2. **Value Constraints**: What is the range of integers within `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - **Response**: The integers are positive and within the range of usual integer values.

3. **Output Format**: What should be the output format?
   - **Response**: Return as a tuple `(max_score, count)` where `max_score` is the maximum score achievable and `count` is the number of operations resulting in this score.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing pointers at the end of both arrays `nums1` and `nums2` (i.e., their largest elements) and start counting from there.
2. **Score Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the two elements pointed to by the pointers. If this score is greater than the current maximum score, update the maximum score and reset the count. If the score equals the current maximum score, increment the count.
3. **Move Pointers**: Move the pointers to the next largest element in both arrays and repeat the calculation until one of the pointers goes out of bounds (i.e., one of the arrays is exhausted).

### Code

```python
def max_operations_same_score(nums1, nums2):
    n, m = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    
    # Initialize pointers
    i, j = n - 1, m - 1

    max_score = float('-inf')
    count = 0

    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        score = nums1[i] + nums2[j]
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            count = 1
        elif score == max_score:
            count += 1
        
        # Move the pointers to the next largest elements
        i -= 1
        j -= 1

    return (max_score, count)

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 2, 3]
nums2 = [2, 3, 4]
print(max_operations_same_score(nums1, nums2))  # Output should be (7, 1)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is \(O(\min(n, m))\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is because the algorithm processes elements in pairs from the largest to the smallest, terminating as soon as one of the arrays is exhausted.

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We initialize pointers at the end of both arrays, i.e., the largest elements.
- **Score Calculation**: For each pair of elements pointed to by the pointers, their sum is calculated and compared to the current maximum score updating it if necessary.
- **Pointer Movement**: Both pointers are decremented simultaneously to continue the process with the next largest pair until one array is exhausted.

This approach ensures we find the maximum possible score and the number of times it occurs efficiently.
