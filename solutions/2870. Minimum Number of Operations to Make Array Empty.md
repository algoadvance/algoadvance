title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty-out
permalink: /s2870
---
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. In one operation, you can remove exactly one element from the array. The goal is to make the array empty by performing the minimum number of operations with the following constraints:
- If the removed element `x` is greater than 1, then you have to additionally remove elements such that every element greater than or equal to `x` becomes less than `x`.
- If `x` is 1, you have to additionally remove elements adjacent to it until the adjacent elements are no longer equal to `x`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for the elements in the array?**
   - The elements are positive integers (>0).
   
2. **What are the adjacent elements in the context of removing elements adjacent to `1`?**
   - Elements immediately to its left and right that are equal to `1`.

3. **Is there any specific order to removing elements?**
   - No, you can remove elements in any order, but any removal operation as described may require additional removals as constraints dictate.

### Strategy
We can solve the problem using a greedy approach:
1. **Frequency Count:** First, we count the frequency of each number in `nums`.
2. **Remove Process:**
   - If an element is greater than 1, remove it and also count the additional required removals for elements greater than or equal to `x`.
   - For `1`s, remove all adjacent `1`s.
   
3. **Result Calculation:** Sum up all the operations needed.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def minNumberOfOperations(nums):
    freq = Counter(nums)
    operations = 0
    
    for num in sorted(freq.keys(), reverse=True):
        count = freq[num]
        if num > 1:
            # Every `x` removal requires `count` operations
            operations += count
        else:
            # For `1`s remove adjacent `1`s in addition to itself
            operations += count
            
    return operations

# Example usage:
nums = [4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1]
print(minNumberOfOperations(nums))  # Example function call
```

### Explanation
1. **Counter:** We count the frequency of each number in `nums`.
2. **Sorting:** Sort the unique numbers in descending order since removing a larger number may affect smaller numbers.
3. **Processing:**
   - For numbers greater than 1, each removal operation on `x` requires exactly `count` operations.
   - For the number `1`, remove all `1`s, which requires `count` operations.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity primarily involves counting `O(n)` and sorting `O(k log k)` where `n` is the number of elements and `k` is the number of unique elements.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + k log k)`, typically dominated by `O(n)` since `k` (unique elements) is usually much smaller.

This approach ensures that we achieve the minimum number of operations efficiently.
