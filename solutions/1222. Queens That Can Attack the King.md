1222. Queens That Can Attack the King

On an `8x8` chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.

You are given the positions of the Black Queens and the White King. Return the positions of all the Black Queens that can directly attack the King (i.e., there exists a line either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally that connects a queen to the king without any other pieces in between).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation: 
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king at [0,0] directly.
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king at [0,0] directly.
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king at [0,0] directly.
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king because there is a queen in the way at [0,1].
The queen at [4,0] is out of range of the king at [0,0].
The queen at [2,4] is out of range of the king at [0,0].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]
Output: [[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: queens = [[5,6],[7,7],[2,1],[0,7],[1,6],[5,1],[3,7],[0,3],[4,0],[1,2],[6,3],[5,5],[4,5],[2,3],[3,0],[4,1]], king = [3,4]
Output: [[2,3],[3,0],[3,7],[4,5],[4,1]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume the input `queens` list will always have valid queen positions within the `8x8` board?
2. Is there exactly one `king` on the board?
3. Should we return the output in any specific order?

## Strategy
1. Convert the list of queen positions to a set for `O(1)` look-up times.
2. Define 8 possible directions to search for the queens: vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.
3. For each direction, start from the king's position and move step by step.
4. If a queen is found in a direction, add it to the result and stop further exploration in that direction.
5. Continue the process for all 8 directions.

## Code
```python
def queensAttacktheKing(queens, king):
    # Convert queens list to a set for O(1) look-up
    queen_set = set(map(tuple, queens))
    result = []

    # Directions: up, down, left, right, diagonals
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), 
                  (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]
    
    for dx, dy in directions:
        x, y = king
        while 0 <= x < 8 and 0 <= y < 8:
            x += dx
            y += dy
            if (x, y) in queen_set:
                result.append([x, y])
                break  # stop exploring further in this direction
    
    return result

# Example usage
queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]]
king = [0,0]
print(queensAttacktheKing(queens, king))  # Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
```

## Time Complexity
The function involves iterating over the 8 potential directions and for each direction, it could theoretically traverse up to 7 cells (since the King is within an 8x8 board), leading to a time complexity of `O(8 * 7)`, which simplifies to `O(1)` due to the fixed upper-bound operation count.

The function's space complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of queens. The `queen_set` creation involves storing the coordinates of all queens.

Overall, the complexity is efficient and suitable for the given constraints.
