title:  K-th Smallest in Lexicographical Order-out
permalink: /s440
---
Given integers `n` and `k`, find the k-th smallest number in lexicographical order from 1 to n.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range Understanding**: Is the range inclusive of both 1 and n?
   - Yes, the range is inclusive of both 1 and n.

2. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases like when `n` is very small or very large, or when `k` is 1 or n?
   - Yes, handling all possible edge cases including minimal (n = 1, k = 1) and maximal boundary conditions should be considered.

3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?
   - The value of `n` can be up to `10^9`, and `k` will be a valid number in the range [1, n].

### Strategy
To find the k-th smallest number in lexicographical order, we need a strategy that efficiently ranks the numbers without needing to generate all of them, especially since n can be very large.

1. **Trie (Prefix Tree) Concept**: Leverage the properties of a trie-like structure to navigate through numbers lexicographically. We can visualize the number set as a tree where each node represents a digit.

2. **Counting Steps**: Use a helper function to count how many numbers are there between two bounds within the `1` to `n` range, restricted by lexicographical order.

3. **Traverse**: Start from 1 and use the counting function to determine if we need to move to the next prefix or go deeper into the current prefixâ€™s tree.

### Code

Let's go ahead and implement the solution:

```python
def findKthNumber(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    def count_steps(prefix, n):
        current = prefix
        next = prefix + 1
        steps = 0
        while current <= n:
            steps += min(n + 1, next) - current
            current *= 10
            next *= 10
        return steps
    
    current = 1
    k -= 1  # We start from 1 already, so we seek for the k-1 next steps
    
    while k > 0:
        steps = count_steps(current, n)
        if steps <= k:
            current += 1
            k -= steps
        else:
            current *= 10
            k -= 1
    
    return current
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **count_steps Function**: 
   - Calculate the number of numerical entries between `prefix` and the next lexicographical prefix within the boundary of `n`.
   - Move through the possible range by going from `prefix` to `prefix * 10` to cover all child nodes in the numerical tree.

2. **Main Algorithm**: 
   - Start from `current` node 1.
   - For each iteration, calculate the steps required to move to the new prefix node.
   - Compare `steps` to `k` to decide whether to go deeper into the current prefix (moving lexicographically within the same initial digit) or move to the next prefix (moving to the next immediate numerical value).
   - Adjust `k` accordingly to reflect the steps taken.

### Time Complexity
- **Counting Steps**: This involves checking each level of lexical hierarchy, and since we can have at most `log10(n)` levels and each level checks constant time operations, it is `O(log n)`.
- **Main While Loop**: We decrease `k` each time, and since each decrement operation is followed by `count_steps`, the complexity is essentially `O(log n * log n)` in the worst-case scenario.

This combined approach ensures we efficiently reach the k-th smallest lexicographical number without explicitly generating all possible values which would be infeasible for large `n`.
