title:  Three Divisors-out
permalink: /s1952
---

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `m` has exactly three positive divisors if and only if it is equal to the square of a prime number. For example, `9` has exactly three divisors: `1, 3,` and `9`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input `n`?**
   - The input `n` will be a positive integer, but knowing the upper limit can help in optimizing the solution.

2. **Are there any time constraints for solving this problem?**
   - Typically, a solution should run within a reasonable time fitting the constraints of competitive coding (usually a few seconds at most).

By default, we will assume typical constraints, such as \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:
1. Check if `n` is a perfect square. If `n` is not a perfect square, it cannot have exactly three divisors.
2. If `n` is a perfect square, check if the square root of `n` is a prime number. 
3. If both conditions are met, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Steps:

1. **Check if `n` is a perfect square**:
   - Compute the integer square root of `n` (let's call it `root`), using `math.isqrt(n)`.
   - Verify if `root * root == n`.

2. **Check if `root` is a prime number**:
   - Iterate over possible divisors from `2` to \(\sqrt{root}\).
   - If `root` has any divisor other than `1` and itself, then it is not a prime.

Let's implement this strategy in Python.

## Code
```python
import math

def isThree(n: int) -> bool:
    # Step 1: Check if `n` is a perfect square
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    if root * root != n:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Check if `root` is a prime number
    if root <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(root)) + 1):
        if root % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example Usage:
print(isThree(9))  # Output should be True (divisors are 1, 3, 9)
print(isThree(10)) # Output should be False (divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10)
print(isThree(25)) # Output should be True (divisors are 1, 5, 25)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Step 1** (Checking if `n` is a perfect square): 
  - This involves a computation of the integer square root and a multiplication, both of which are \(O(1)\) operations.

- **Step 2** (Checking if `root` is a prime number):
  - This requires checking divisors up to \(\sqrt{root}\). In the worst case, this takes \(O(\sqrt[4]{n})\).

Given the operations involved, the overall time complexity is \(O(\sqrt[4]{n})\). This is efficient and should work well within typical constraints.
