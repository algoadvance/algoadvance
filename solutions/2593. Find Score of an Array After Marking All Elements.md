title:  Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements-out
permalink: /s2593
---
You are given an array `nums`.

Initially, an integer `score = 0`. You perform the following operations until the array is empty:

1. Find the smallest element in `nums` and increment `score` by its value.
2. Remove that element and its immediate neighbors (if they exist) from `nums`.

Return the score after performing the above operations.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- Pick 1, increment score to 1. Remove 1 and neighbors, resulting in [3, 5, 3].
- Pick 3 next, increment score to 1+3=4. Remove 3 and neighbors, resulting in [5].
- Pick 5, increment score to 4+5=9. `nums` is now empty, so return 9.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all elements in the list unique?**
    - No, the elements can be repeated.
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the list?**
    - The list can have up to \(10^5\) elements, and each element can be between 1 and \(10^7\).
3. **What should be done if multiple minimum elements exist?**
    - You can pick any one of them.

### Strategy
1. **Data Structures:**
    - A heap can be used to efficiently retrieve the smallest element.
2. **Step-by-Step Approach:**
    - Convert the array into a min-heap.
    - While the heap is not empty:
        1. Pop the smallest element from the heap and add its value to the score.
        2. Mark the popped element and its neighbors for removal.
        3. Use a set to keep track of indices that are removed.
3. **Index and Sync:**
    - Maintain a mapping of elements to their indices for identification since heap operations do not provide indices directly.
    - Use a while loop to ensure all elements and neighbors to remove are considered correctly.

### Code
```python
def findScore(nums):
    import heapq

    # Create a min-heap from the array elements with their indices
    min_heap = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)
    
    score = 0
    removed = set()  # To track the indices of elements removed
    
    while min_heap:
        num, idx = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if idx in removed:
            continue
        
        # Add current number to score
        score += num
        # Mark current element and its neighbors as removed
        removed.add(idx)
        if idx - 1 >= 0:
            removed.add(idx - 1)
        if idx + 1 < len(nums):
            removed.add(idx + 1)
    
    return score
```

### Time Complexity
- **Heap creation time:** \( O(n) \)
- **Heap operations:** Each pop and subsequent removal marking will occur \(O(\log n)\) times for \(O(n \log n)\) complexity overall.
- **Total complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\)

This is efficient given the constraints. Each operation ensures we are processing elements in an optimal order while adhering to the problem's requirements.
