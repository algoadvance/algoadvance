title:  Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2658
---

You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell of the grid contains some number of fish. You need to find the maximum number of fish you can collect by starting at any one cell in the grid and moving to any of the adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) repeatedly to collect fish from those cells. You can only visit each cell once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the grid have cells with zero fish?
   - Yes, cells may contain zero fish.
2. Are negative numbers of fish allowed in cells?
   - Assume that the grid contains non-negative numbers only.
3. Is it allowed to start collecting fish from any cell?
   - Yes, starting from any cell is allowed.
4. How should we handle the edges of the grid?
   - Moving off the grid is not allowed; the movement should be restricted within the grid boundaries.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force with DFS/Recursion:**
   - We'll perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from each cell in the grid to determine the maximum number of fish collected starting from that cell.
   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible paths, collecting fish and marking cells as visited to prevent revisiting.
   - Use a helper function to keep track of the sum of fish collected at each step.

2. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a 2D list to track visited cells.
   - Use a stack or recursion to implement DFS.
   - For each cell, initialize the DFS, and track the maximum fish collected.

### Code

```python
def getMaximumFish(grid):
    def dfs(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x >= len(grid) or y < 0 or y >= len(grid[0]) or visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] == 0:
            return 0
        visited[x][y] = True
        fish_count = grid[x][y]
        
        # Explore all 4 possible directions
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            fish_count += dfs(x + dx, y + dy)
        
        return fish_count
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    max_fish = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
            if grid[i][j] > 0:
                max_fish = max(max_fish, dfs(i, j))
    
    return max_fish
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
    - Performing DFS from each cell leads to a worst-case time complexity of \(O(m \times n \times (m \times n))\),
        - where the outer loop iterates through each cell once (\(m \times n\)) and the DFS potentially explores all cells in each call (\(m \times n\)).

2. **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) due to the visited matrix and the recursive stack space.

This solution ensures that we explore all potential paths to find the maximum fish collection starting from any cell in the grid.
