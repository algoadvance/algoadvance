You are given a positive integer `num` consisting only of digits 6 and 9. Your task is to return the maximum number you can obtain by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

**Example:**
- Input: `num = 9669`
- Output: `9969`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the number `num` be empty or have any digit other than 6 and 9?
   **A**: No, `num` is a positive integer and will only consist of the digits 6 and 9.

2. **Q**: Can we change more than one digit?
   **A**: No, we are allowed to change at most one digit.

3. **Q**: What is the range of the number of digits in `num`?
   **A**: Since `num` is a positive integer, it can range from 1 to as many digits as representable in Python.

### Strategy

1. **Convert `num` to a String:** Strings are easier to manipulate since we can easily access each character and modify them.
2. **Find the First Occurrence of 6:** The optimal strategy is to find the first occurrence of the digit 6 and change it to 9. Changing 9 to 6 would not help in maximizing the number.
3. **Change and Return:** Change the first 6 to 9, then convert the string back to an integer and return it.

### Code

```python
def maximum69Number(num: int) -> int:
    # Convert number to list of characters to modify
    num_str = list(str(num))
    
    # Traverse through the characters in num_str
    for i in range(len(num_str)):
        if num_str[i] == '6':
            num_str[i] = '9'
            break  # Change only the first 6 and break
    
    # Convert list of characters back to integer
    return int(''.join(num_str))

# Example Usage
print(maximum69Number(9669))  # Output: 9969
print(maximum69Number(9996))  # Output: 9999
print(maximum69Number(6666))  # Output: 9666
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of digits in `num`. This is because, in the worst case, we may need to iterate over all the digits to find the first occurrence of 6.

The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, due to the string conversion which temporarily stores `num` as a character list.

This solution effectively and efficiently maximizes the given number by altering at most one digit.
