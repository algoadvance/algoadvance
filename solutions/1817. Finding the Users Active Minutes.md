title:  Finding the Users Active Minutes-out
permalink: /s1817
---
You are given the logs representing the user activities for a certain day. The logs are represented as a 2D array where each element is a list `[user_id, minute]`. The `user_id` is an integer and `minute` is an integer representing the exact minute the user was active (in minute). Multiple elements in the logs can have the same `user_id`.

A user is considered "active" during a minute if there is an entry in logs with this user_id at that minute. We want to summarize the user activity data by calculating the number of minutes each user was active, but we don't want the same minute to be counted more than once for the same user.

Your task is to find the distribution of the users active minutes (UAM). You need to output an array where the `i-th` element is the number of users that were active exactly `i+1` minutes in total, in alphabetical order of users.

## Example:
```python
logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3],[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5]]
k = 5
Output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: 
- User 1 was active for 4 different minutes: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- User 2 was active for 3 different minutes: 2, 3, 5.
Hence, there are no users who were active for 1 minute, 2 users who were active for 2 minutes (i.e., [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]).
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the user IDs unique?**
   - No, the same user ID can appear multiple times with different or the same minutes.
  
2. **What should we do if `k` is higher than the actual maximum user active minutes?**
   - We should still output an array of length `k`, filling zeros where necessary.

3. **Do we need to sort users based on their UAM values?**
   - No, the problem states we need to return the count of users active for each possible number of minutes.

## Strategy:
1. **Use a Dictionary:** Use a dictionary to keep track of each user's active minutes.
2. **Using Sets:** Utilize sets to avoid counting the same minute more than once for each user.
3. **UAM Distribution:** Create an array to store the distribution of user active minutes.
4. **Count Users:** Loop through the dictionary to count how many users are active for exactly `i` minutes.
5. **Result Compilation:** Fill the result array accordingly.

## Code:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def findingUsersActiveMinutes(logs, k):
    user_minutes = defaultdict(set)
    
    # Populate the dictionary with user activities
    for user_id, minute in logs:
        user_minutes[user_id].add(minute)
    
    # Count the number of users for each number of unique active minutes
    uam_count = [0] * k
    for minutes in user_minutes.values():
        if len(minutes) <= k:
            uam_count[len(minutes) - 1] += 1
    
    return uam_count

# Example Usage
logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3],[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5]]
k = 5
print(findingUsersActiveMinutes(logs, k))  # Output: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Insertions into Dictionary:** O(n) where n is the length of logs.
- **Counting Unique Minutes:** Outer loop iterates over all users, and inner operations are O(1) on average due to set operations.
- **Final Counts:** O(m) where m is the number of unique users.

Overall: **O(n + m)** where n is the number of log entries and m is the number of unique users.
