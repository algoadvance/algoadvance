title:  Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares II-out
permalink: /s2916
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of squares of the number of distinct elements in all possible subarrays of `nums`.

For example, given `nums = [1, 2, 1, 2]`, the subarrays are:
- `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1]`, `[1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 1]`, `[2, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 1, 2]`
- The distinct element counts are:
  - `[1]` -> 1
  - `[2]` -> 1
  - `[1]` -> 1
  - `[2]` -> 1
  - `[1, 2]` -> 2
  - `[2, 1]` -> 2
  - `[1, 2]` -> 2
  - `[1, 2, 1]` -> 2
  - `[2, 1, 2]` -> 2
  - `[1, 2, 1, 2]` -> 2
- Sum of squares of these counts: `1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 6 * 4 = 28`

Thus, the output for the example should be `28`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of array size**: How large can the array `nums` be?
2. **Range of values**: What is the range of the integer values in `nums`?
3. **Expected performance**: Are there any specific performance constraints we should be aware of?

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to avoid recomputing the distinct elements for every possible subarray. Instead, we can use a sliding window technique combined with a hash map to keep track of the count of each unique element in the current window.

Here is the strategy:
1. **Sliding Window**: Use two pointers, start from `left = 0` and `right = 0`.
2. **Hash Map**: Use a hash map to count the occurrences of elements within the window `[left, right]`.
3. **Iteration**:
    - Expand the window by moving `right` to the right.
    - For each new position of `right`, compute the number of distinct elements in the current subarray `[left, right]` and add the square of this count to the result.
    - If the window becomes invalid (i.e., a duplicate element is included), adjust the `left` pointer to maintain at most one window with unique elements.
    
## Code

Here is how you can implement the above approach in Python:

```python
def sumOfSquares(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = 0
    
    left = 0
    freq = {}
    
    for right in range(n):
        # Add current element to the frequency map or increase its count
        if nums[right] in freq:
            freq[nums[right]] += 1
        else:
            freq[nums[right]] = 1
        
        # Calculate number of distinct elements in the current window
        num_distinct = len(freq)
        
        # Sum of squares of the number of distinct elements for subarrays ending at 'right'
        result += num_distinct ** 2
        
        # Now handle the shift of the left window boundary
        while right + 1 < n and nums[right + 1] in freq:
            left += 1
            freq[nums[left - 1]] -= 1
            if freq[nums[left - 1]] == 0:
                del freq[nums[left - 1]]
            
            # Recalculate the number of distinct elements and add to result
            num_distinct = len(freq)
            result += num_distinct ** 2

    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 1, 2]
print(sumOfSquares(nums))  # Output: 28 (as provided in the problem statement)
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is determined by the sliding window and hash map operations:
- Adjusting the window typically takes linear time: O(n).
- Hash map operations (insertion, deletion) take average O(1) time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n^2) in the worst case due to the nested while loop.

As a result, this solution should generally be efficient for moderate-sized input arrays. For very large arrays, further optimizations might be necessary.
