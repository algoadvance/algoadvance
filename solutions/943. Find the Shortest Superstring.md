title:  Find the Shortest Superstring-out
permalink: /s943
---

Given an array of strings `words`, find the shortest string that contains each string in `words` as a substring. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How many strings will `words` contain? (Typical constraint: 1 ≤ words.length ≤ 12)
   - What is the maximum length of each string in `words`? (Typical constraint: 1 ≤ words[i].length ≤ 20)
   
2. **Overlap Handling:**
   - Can we assume that each string can appear multiple times if it minimizes the length?
   - Should the overlapping part between two strings be maximized to minimize the resultant superstring?

3. **Output:**
   - Should the resulting string contain `words` as exact substrings, considering overlapping regions?

Given the usual constraints, these clarifications help structure our approach effectively.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Overlaps:**
   - Calculate the maximum overlap between each pair of strings.
   - For instance, if `S1` ends with a substring that `S2` begins with, record the length of this overlap.

2. **Dynamic Programming (Bitmasking):**
   - Use a bitmask to represent subsets of strings.
   - Let `dp[mask][i]` be the shortest superstring that can be formed with subset represented by `mask` and ending with the `i-th` string.
   - Transition: Update `dp[mask | (1 << j)][j]` considering the overlap with the `i-th` string.

3. **Reconstruct the Superstring:**
   - Trace back from the final states to construct the shortest superstring using the previously calculated overlaps.

### Code

```python
def shortestSuperstring(words):
    n = len(words)

    # Calculate the overlap between all pairs i, j
    overlaps = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                m = min(len(words[i]), len(words[j]))
                for k in range(m, 0, -1):
                    if words[i].endswith(words[j][:k]):
                        overlaps[i][j] = k
                        break

    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
    parent = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]
    
    # Base case: Single word (no overlap needed)
    for i in range(n):
        dp[1 << i][i] = len(words[i])
        
    # Fill DP table
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        for i in range(n):
            if not (mask & (1 << i)):
                continue
            for j in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << j):
                    continue
                next_mask = mask | (1 << j)
                overlap_length = overlaps[i][j]
                candidate_length = dp[mask][i] + len(words[j]) - overlap_length
                if dp[next_mask][j] == 0 or candidate_length < dp[next_mask][j]:
                    dp[next_mask][j] = candidate_length
                    parent[next_mask][j] = i

    # Find the endpoint with the shortest length
    min_len = float('inf')
    last_word = -1
    final_mask = (1 << n) - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if dp[final_mask][i] < min_len:
            min_len = dp[final_mask][i]
            last_word = i

    # Reconstruct the superstring
    super_string = []
    mask = final_mask
    current = last_word
    while current != -1:
        super_string.append(current)
        next_current = parent[mask][current]
        mask ^= (1 << current)
        current = next_current

    super_string.reverse()

    # Now build the string according to the order
    answer = words[super_string[0]]
    for k in range(1, len(super_string)):
        i, j = super_string[k - 1], super_string[k]
        answer += words[j][overlaps[i][j]:]

    return answer

# Example Usage:
words = ["catg", "ctaagt", "gcta", "ttca", "atgcatc"]
print(shortestSuperstring(words))  # One possible output: gctaagttcatgcatc
```

### Time Complexity

- **DP Table Initialization:** \(O(N^2)\) for calculating overlaps.
- **Filling DP Table:** \(O(N^2 \cdot 2^N)\) since for each subset we consider additional strings.
- Overall Complexity: \(O(N^2 \cdot 2^N)\), feasible for \(N \leq 12\).

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and provides a systematic way to find the shortest superstring.
