title:  First Completely Painted Row or Column-out
permalink: /s2661
---
You are given a matrix with values in increasing order both row-wise and column-wise. Your job is to determine the first row or column that gets completely painted.

Here's the detailed description:
- The rows and columns of the matrix are painted based on given sequences of row and column indices.
- The task is to find out the first row or column that gets completely painted.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Matrix Dimensions**: What are the specific dimensions for the matrix?
2. **Painting Order**: How is the sequence of painting indices provided?
3. **Multiple Sequences**: Are there multiple sequences of painting indices to consider, and do they overlap?

For simplicity, let us assume:
- The matrix size is `n x m`.
- The sequence of painted indices is given as a list of tuples, where each tuple is either a row index (for painting a row) or a column index (for painting a column).

### Strategy
1. **Initialize Count Arrays**: Use two arrays to keep track of the painted elements in each row and column.
2. **Iterate Through Given Sequences**: Update the count arrays as per the given painting sequence.
3. **Check Completion**: After each update, check if the current row or column is completely painted (i.e., all cells in that row or column have been painted).
4. **Return the First Fully Painted Row/Column**: Determine if the now fully painted row/column is the first one to be completed.

### Code
Here is a possible implementation in Python for solving the problem:

```python
def first_completely_painted(matrix, paint_sequence):
    n = len(matrix)
    m = len(matrix[0])
    
    row_painted_count = [0] * n
    col_painted_count = [0] * m
    
    total_elements = n * m
    
    row_complete_threshold = m
    col_complete_threshold = n
    
    painted_set = set()
    
    for index in paint_sequence:
        if index[0] == 'row':
            row_idx = index[1]
            if row_idx not in painted_set:
                row_painted_count[row_idx] += 1
                for col in range(m):
                    painted_set.add((row_idx, col))
                if row_painted_count[row_idx] == row_complete_threshold:
                    return f"Row {row_idx} is completely painted first"
        elif index[0] == 'column':
            col_idx = index[1]
            if col_idx not in painted_set:
                col_painted_count[col_idx] += 1
                for row in range(n):
                    painted_set.add((row, col_idx))
                if col_painted_count[col_idx] == col_complete_threshold:
                    return f"Column {col_idx} is completely painted first"
    
    return "Neither row nor column got completely painted"

# Example Usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
paint_sequence = [('row', 0), ('column', 1), ('row', 1), ('row', 2), ('column', 2)]

print(first_completely_painted(matrix, paint_sequence))
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: O(1) for setting up the count arrays.
- **Painting Sequence Processing**: O(k), where k is the length of the painting sequence.
- **Checking Completion**: O(m) for rows painting and O(n) for columns painting, but since it is done inside the iterative loop, it integrates into O(k).
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity will be O(k) * O(m) or O(n) combined operations in the worst case.

However, the specific optimization and stopping once a row/column is fully painted usually means fewer iterations in practice.
