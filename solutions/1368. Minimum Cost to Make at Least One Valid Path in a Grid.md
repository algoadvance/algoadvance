title:  Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid-out
permalink: /s1368
---

You are given an `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of the grid has a directional arrow pointing to the next cell you may move to. The direction is represented by integers:

- `1` means move to the cell in the right direction,
- `2` means move to the cell in the left direction,
- `3` means move to the cell in the downward direction,
- `4` means move to the cell in the upward direction.

You can modify the direction of the arrow in each cell with a cost of 1. To start, the direction is given by the elements grid[i][j].

Your task is to find the minimum cost to make at least one valid path from the upper left corner (0,0) to the bottom right corner (m-1,n-1).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the grid size?
    - The grid size is within the range 1 <= m, n <= 100.

2. **Edge Cases:** Should we consider edge cases such as the smallest grid size and uniform direction grids?
    - Yes, these cases should be considered to ensure correctness.

3. **Cost Definition:** Is the cost always 1 for changing the direction?
    - Yes, it is explicitly mentioned in the problem.

### Code

Here is a Python implementation to solve the problem.

```python
import heapq

def minCost(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Directions represented as (dx, dy) and their associated costs
    directions = [ (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0) ]
    
    # Min-heap priority queue (cost, (x, y))
    pq = [(0, 0, 0)]
    
    # Cost to reach each cell, initialize with infinity
    cost = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cost[0][0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        curr_cost, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if x == m-1 and y == n-1:
            return curr_cost
        
        for dir_index, (dx, dy) in enumerate(directions):
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            
            if 0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n:
                new_cost = curr_cost + (grid[x][y] != dir_index + 1)
                
                if new_cost < cost[new_x][new_y]:
                    cost[new_x][new_y] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, new_x, new_y))

    return cost[m-1][n-1]
```

### Strategy

1. **Use Dijkstra's Algorithm:** We use a priority queue (min-heap) to implement Dijkstra's algorithm where each cell's position and the cost to reach it are tracked.
2. **Track Costs:** Initialize a cost matrix where each cell initially has an infinite cost except for the starting point (0,0) which has a cost of zero.
3. **Update Costs Dynamically:** For each cell node, explore its possible moves to adjacent cells in all 4 directions. If moving in the current direction matches the cell's arrow, it inherits the current cost; otherwise, it adds 1 to the current cost.
4. **Use Priority Queue:** Push the neighboring cell positions and their updated costs into the priority queue and update the cell costs.
5. **Terminate Early:** If we reach the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1), return the cost to stop further exploration.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n * log(m * n)), where m*n is the number of cells, and log(m * n) corresponds to the heap operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the cost matrix and priority queue storage.
