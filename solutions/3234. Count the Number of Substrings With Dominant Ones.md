title:  Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones-out
permalink: /s3234
---
You are given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'). We define a substring of `s` as dominant in ones if the number of '1's in the substring is greater than the number of '0's in that substring. Your task is to count the number of such dominant-in-ones substrings of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of the binary string `s`?
   - The maximum length of the string `s` is not specified in the problem statement. (Assume it could be large)
  
2. Are all characters in the string guaranteed to be either '0' or '1'?
   - Yes, the string only contains characters '0' and '1'.

3. Is there any specific scenario where the string can be empty or contain only one character?
   - An empty string or a single character string would have zero dominant substrings.

### Strategy
1. **Brute-Force Approach**:
   - Generate all possible substrings of `s`.
   - For each substring, count the number of '1's and '0's.
   - Check if the number of '1's is greater than the number of '0's.
   - If so, increment the count.

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Use a prefix sum array to keep track of the number of '1's and '0's encountered up to each index.
   - For a given substring `s[i:j]`, use the prefix sums to quickly determine the counts of '1's and '0's.
   - Maintain a running balance (difference between counts of '1's and '0's) to efficiently check the dominance condition.

### Code

```python
def count_dominant_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Length of the string
    n = len(s)
    
    # Difference array to keep track of the difference between counts of '1's and '0's
    balance = 0
    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each balance
    balance_count = {0: 1}
    
    dominant_count = 0
    
    for ch in s:
        if ch == '1':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        # We are looking for count of previous balances which are smaller than current balance
        for prev_balance in range(balance):
            if prev_balance in balance_count:
                dominant_count += balance_count[prev_balance]
        
        # Update the balance_count for the current balance
        if balance in balance_count:
            balance_count[balance] += 1
        else:
            balance_count[balance] = 1
    
    return dominant_count

# Example Usage:
s = "110100110"
print(count_dominant_substrings(s))  # Output should reflect the count of dominant substrings
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - The outer loop iterates over each character (O(n)), and for each character, the inner loop checks balances up to that character (O(n) in worst case).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - The balance_count dictionary can hold at most n different balance values.

This solution uses an efficient prefix sum approach to optimize the checking of substrings, reducing redundant computations compared to a brute-force method.
