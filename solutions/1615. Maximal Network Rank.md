title:  Maximal Network Rank-out
permalink: /s1615
---

You are given an integer `n`, which represents the number of cities in a country labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given a 2D integer array `roads`, where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `a_i` and `b_i`. The **network rank** of two different cities is defined as the total number of roads directly connected to either city. However, if there is a road directly connecting the two cities, it is counted only once. 

The task is to return the *maximal network rank* of the city network.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and size of `roads`?**
   - Yes, typically `1 <= n <= 100` and `0 <= |roads| <= n * (n-1) / 2`.

2. **Can there be duplicate roads or self-loops in the input list?**
   - No, the input guarantees unique roads with no self-loops.

3. **Is there any particular format for the output?**
   - Return a single integer indicating the maximal network rank.

### Strategy

1. **Count the roads connected to each city:**
   - Use an array `degree` to keep track of the number of roads each city is connected to.

2. **Keep track of direct connections between cities:**
   - Use a set or dictionary to remember if there is a direct road between two cities.

3. **Compute the network rank for each pair of cities:**
   - Iterate over all pairs of cities and compute the network rank for each pair.
   - Adjust the count if there is a direct road between the two cities to avoid double counting.

4. **Return the maximum network rank found:**

### Code

```python
def maximalNetworkRank(n, roads):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Degree array to count number of connections for each city
    degree = [0] * n

    # Set to keep track of direct connections
    connections = set()
    
    for road in roads:
        u, v = road
        degree[u] += 1
        degree[v] += 1
        connections.add((min(u, v), max(u, v)))
    
    max_rank = 0
    
    # Compare each pair of cities
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if (i, j) in connections or (j, i) in connections:
                max_rank = max(max_rank, degree[i] + degree[j] - 1)
            else:
                max_rank = max(max_rank, degree[i] + degree[j])
    
    return max_rank

# Example usage
n = 4
roads = [[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
print(maximalNetworkRank(n, roads))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing:** Iterating through roads to fill the `degree` array and `connections` set takes O(|roads|).
- **Comparison:** Comparing all pairs of cities takes O(n^2).
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^2 + |roads|), where n is the number of cities and |roads| is the number of roads.

This solution should be efficient for the constraints usually provided by the problem.
