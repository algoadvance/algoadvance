title:  Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls-out
permalink: /s2350
---

Given an array of integers `rolls` of length `n` and an integer `k`, determine the length of the shortest sequence that cannot be generated as a subsequence of `rolls`, where the subsequence is made of rolling a k-sided dice.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n` and `k`?**
   - Assume `1 <= k <= 50` and `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

2. **Will `rolls` only contain integers from `1` to `k`?**
   - Yes, all elements in `rolls` are integers from `1` to `k`.

3. **Can the solution use extra memory?**
   - Yes, but efficiently, given `k` and `n`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Understand the concept that the length of the shortest non-existent sequence will increase each level when all possible sequences of a certain length have been exhausted.

2. **Track Sequences**: Track how many unique sequences of every length can be formed.

3. **Simulation**: Simulate iterating through the roll while keeping track of which numbers have appeared in the current sequence.

4. **Break Condition**: As soon as any length is not able to form all its possible sequences, that will be the shortest impossible sequence length.

### Code

Here's a solution using the described strategy:

```python
def shortestSequence(rolls, k):
    # The shortest sequence of length 1 is the minimum possible answer
    length = 1
    seen = set()

    for roll in rolls:
        seen.add(roll)
        # When all k different rolls for the current length have been seen
        if len(seen) == k:
            length += 1
            seen = set()

    return length

# Example usage:
rolls = [4,2,1,2,3,3,3,4]
k = 4
print(shortestSequence(rolls, k))  # Expected output: 3
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Track Seen Rolls**: Maintain a set `seen` to keep track of unique rolls for the current sequence length `length`.

2. **Loop Through Rolls**: Iterate through each roll in `rolls`. Add each roll to the `seen` set.

3. **Check Full Set**: Every time the `seen` set reaches the size of `k` (i.e., contains at least one of each possible face of the dice), increment the length of the sequence and reset the `seen` set.

4. **Returning the Result**: The moment we finish checking all rolls, `length` will contain the smallest sequence length that couldn't be represented as a subsequence.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - We traverse the list of `rolls` exactly once, checking and updating our set in constant average time.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`
  - The set can grow up to a maximum of `k` elements, which is a constant factor as `k` is significantly smaller than `n`.

This approach efficiently finds the shortest sequence that cannot be formed as a subsequence of the given rolls.
