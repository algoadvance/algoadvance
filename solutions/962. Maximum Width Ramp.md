title:  Maximum Width Ramp-out
permalink: /s962
---
Given an array `A` of integers, a *ramp* is a pair `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `A[i] <= A[j]`. The width of such a ramp is `j - i`. Find the maximum width of a ramp in the given array. If no ramp exists, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size and Values:**
   - What is the expected size of the array, `A`? 
   - Are there any constraints on the values in the array elements?

2. **Output:**
   - If there are multiple ramps with the same maximum width, should we just return the width itself?

3. **Special Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the array contains less than 2 elements?

### Strategy
To find the maximum width ramp efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. **Step 1:** Create a list of tuples pairing each element in `A` with its index, and sort this list by the values in `A`.
2. **Step 2:** Iterate through the sorted list to find the maximum ramp width by keeping track of the minimum index seen so far.

### Code

```python
def maxWidthRamp(A):
    # Step 1: Create pairs of (value, index) and sort by value
    value_index_pairs = sorted((a, i) for i, a in enumerate(A))
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the minimum index seen so far and max width
    min_index_so_far = float('inf')
    max_width = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted pairs to compute the maximum width ramp
    for value, index in value_index_pairs:
        max_width = max(max_width, index - min_index_so_far)
        min_index_so_far = min(min_index_so_far, index)
    
    return max_width

# Example usage:
A = [6,0,8,2,1,5]
print(maxWidthRamp(A))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array `A`.
- **Iteration:** The iteration step to calculate the maximum width takes \(O(n)\).
- **Overall Complexity:** The total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity
- We need additional space for storing pairs of values and indices, which takes \(O(n)\).
- Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).

This efficient approach ensures that the maximum width ramp can be found quickly even for larger arrays.
