title:  Spiral Matrix IV-out

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n` and a list `head` representing the head of a linked list. The linked list will be filled in a spiral order while maintaining the order of the linked list. If there are any remaining empty spaces in the grid after filling the linked list, they should be filled with `-1`.

- You need to return the modified grid with the linked list values filled in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner.
  
**Example:**
```
Input:
grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0]]
head = [3, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1, 7, 3, 4]

Output:
[[3, 0, 2, 6],
 [8, 1, 7, 3],
 [4, -1, -1, -1]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if the grid is smaller than the linked list length?**
   - Assume that the linked list will add additional elements to fill the grid.

2. **Is the linked list always guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes.

3. **What are the constraints on the `grid` size and the linked list length?**
   - Typically normal problem constraints (1 <= m, n <= 100, and list elements are arbitrary integers).

### Strategy

1. **Spiral Order Movement:**
   - Use a `direction` to indicate the direction of movement (right, down, left, up).
   - Use boundaries (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to keep track of the limits.
   
2. **Filling in the Grid:**
   - Start from the top-left corner and iterate over the linked list to fill elements according to the spiral order.
   - Once finished with the linked list, fill remaining places with `-1`.

3. **Edge cases:**
   - Handle cases where without enough linked list elements, fill the `grid` to prevent IndexError on iteration.

### Code

```python
from typing import List, Optional

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, next: Optional['ListNode'] = None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def fill_grid_spiral_order(grid: List[List[int]], head: Optional[ListNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not head:
        return grid
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    top, bottom = 0, m - 1
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    current = head
    
    while current is not None and top <= bottom and left <= right:
        # Move right
        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            if current:
                grid[top][i] = current.val
                current = current.next
            else:
                grid[top][i] = -1
        top += 1
        
        # Move down
        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
            if current:
                grid[i][right] = current.val
                current = current.next
            else:
                grid[i][right] = -1
        right -= 1
        
        # Move left
        if top <= bottom:
            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                if current:
                    grid[bottom][i] = current.val
                    current = current.next
                else:
                    grid[bottom][i] = -1
            bottom -= 1
        
        # Move up
        if left <= right:
            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                if current:
                    grid[i][left] = current.val
                    current = current.next
                else:
                    grid[i][left] = -1
            left += 1
    
    # If any elements in the grid are still 0, fill them with -1
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                grid[i][j] = -1
    
    return grid
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the row size and `n` is the column size of the grid. This is because each cell in the grid is accessed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) additional space excluding the input since we are modifying the grid in place.
