**LeetCode 1465: Maximum Area of a Piece of Cake After Horizontal and Vertical Cuts**

Given a rectangular cake with height `h` and width `w`, and arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where:
- `horizontalCuts[i]` is the distance from the top of the cake to the i-th horizontal cut, and
- `verticalCuts[j]` is the distance from the left of the cake to the j-th vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the cuts array be empty?**
   - It is guaranteed that there will be at least one cut in each of the arrays.
   
2. **Do the cuts always lie within the dimensions of the cake?**
   - Yes, cuts are valid and lie within the dimensions of the cake.

3. **Are the arrays given in sorted order?**
   - No, the arrays are not guaranteed to be in sorted order.

4. **What are the constraints on h and w?**
   - The values for h and w can be large, up to \(10^9\).

### Strategy:
1. **Sort the Arrays:**
   - Since the cuts can be given in any order, start by sorting both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`.

2. **Determine Largest Gap Between Cuts:**
   - For horizontal pieces, calculate the largest gap between consecutive cuts including the edges (top of the cake and the bottom of the cake).
   - Similarly, do the same for vertical cuts.

3. **Calculate Maximum Area:**
   - The maximum piece of the cake will be the product of the largest horizontal gap and the largest vertical gap.

4. **Handle Large Numbers:**
   - Since the result can be very large, return the computed area modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code:
```python
from typing import List

def maxArea(h: int, w: int, horizontalCuts: List[int], verticalCuts: List[int]) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Sort cuts
    horizontalCuts.sort()
    verticalCuts.sort()
    
    # Determine maximum gaps in horizontal cuts
    max_h_gap = max(horizontalCuts[0], h - horizontalCuts[-1])
    for i in range(1, len(horizontalCuts)):
        max_h_gap = max(max_h_gap, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i - 1])
    
    # Determine maximum gaps in vertical cuts
    max_v_gap = max(verticalCuts[0], w - verticalCuts[-1])
    for i in range(1, len(verticalCuts)):
        max_v_gap = max(max_v_gap, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i - 1])
    
    # Calculate maximum area and return
    return (max_h_gap * max_v_gap) % MOD

# Example usage
h = 5
w = 4
horizontalCuts = [1, 2, 4]
verticalCuts = [1, 3]
print(maxArea(h, w, horizontalCuts, verticalCuts))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting Cuts:**
  - Sorting `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` each takes \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\) respectively, where `n` is the number of horizontal cuts and `m` is the number of vertical cuts.
- **Finding Maximum Gaps:**
  - Finding the maximum gaps is \(O(n)\) for horizontal cuts and \(O(m)\) for vertical cuts.
  
Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting steps, thus it is:
\[ O(n \log n + m \log m) \]
