title:  Statistics from a Large Sample-out
permalink: /s1093
---

We are given a large array of numbers representing the results of our sample. The numbers are in the range `[0, 255]` (inclusive). We're tasked to find the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of this sample. The results should be in `[min, max, mean, median, mode]` format.

**Statistics Definitions**:
- **Minimum**: The smallest value in the sample.
- **Maximum**: The largest value in the sample.
- **Mean**: The average value of the sample.
- **Median**: The middle value of the sample when sorted. If the number of sample elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
- **Mode**: The most frequent value in the sample.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the sample always integers?**
   - Yes, values are always integers between 0 and 255.

2. **Can there be multiple modes? If so, how should we handle it?**
   - We are required to return one mode, and typically, the smallest value is preferred if there are multiple modes.

3. **What is the expected size of the input sample array?**
   - The problem specifically mentions a "large" sample, so we should consider both time and space complexity carefully.

4. **Are we provided with the input as an array or as a dictionary where keys are values and values are their frequencies?**
   - This isn't specified, but we'll assume it's an array. If it were a dictionary, it would simplify our mode calculation significantly.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: We'll keep track of various statistics using a frequency counter (dictionary from collections module).
2. **Compute Minimum and Maximum**: By scanning through the sample.
3. **Compute Mean**: Sum all elements and divide by the number of elements.
4. **Compute Median**: Sort the array and find the middle element(s).
5. **Compute Mode**: Maintain counters to find the most frequent element.

### Time Complexity
- Time complexity is mainly driven by sorting the input sample for computing the median, resulting in O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the sample.
- Other operations can be done in O(n) time.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def sampleStats(sample: List[int]) -> List[float]:
    # Initialize frequency counter
    counter = Counter(sample)
    
    # Compute min and max
    min_val = min(counter)
    max_val = max(counter)
    
    # Total sum and count
    total_sum = sum(value * count for value, count in counter.items())
    total_count = len(sample)
    
    # Compute mean
    mean_val = total_sum / total_count
    
    # Compute median
    sorted_sample = sorted(sample)
    if total_count % 2 == 1:
        median_val = sorted_sample[total_count // 2]
    else:
        median_val = (sorted_sample[total_count // 2 - 1] + sorted_sample[total_count // 2]) / 2
    
    # Compute mode
    mode_val = max(counter.keys(), key=lambda k: counter[k])
    
    return [min_val, max_val, mean_val, median_val, mode_val]

# Example usage:
sample = [0,1,2,2,3,4,4,4,5]  # Example input
print(sampleStats(sample))
```
### Explanation
1. **Counter**: This counts the frequency of each element.
2. **min/max**: Extracted directly from the counter keys.
3. **mean**: Calculated as the total sum of elements divided by the count.
4. **median**: Determined by sorting and considering the middle element(s).
5. **mode**: Found by locating the element with the highest frequency using the counter.

This approach ensures efficient and correct computation of the required statistics from large samples.
