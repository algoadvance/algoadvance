### Problem Statement

A company has a secret document it wants to share with its employees according to the following rules:
1. On day 1, one person discovers the secret.
2. After discovering the secret, each person shares it with a new person on each subsequent day.
3. Each person stops sharing the secret after passing it on `forget` days since they first discovered it.
4. Find the number of people aware of the secret after `n` days.

Given integers `n`, `delay`, and `forget`, return the number of people aware of the secret at the end of day `n`. If someone discovers the secret on day `i`, they will start sharing it from day `i + delay` and stop sharing it after day `i + forget`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can multiple people start sharing the secret on the same day?
   - Yes, multiple people can start sharing the secret on the same or subsequent days.
2. Is the initial person included in the final count of people aware of the secret?
   - Yes, the initial person and anyone who discovers the secret within the given days should be included.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in Python.

```python
def peopleAwareOfSecret(n: int, delay: int, forget: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    people = [0] * (n + 1)  # Array to store the number of people who discover the secret each day
    people[1] = 1  # Initially, 1 person knows the secret on day 1
    
    new_sharers = 0  # To keep the count of new sharers each day
    
    for day in range(2, n + 1):
        if day > delay:
            new_sharers += people[day - delay]  # People who started sharing the secret after `delay` days
        
        if day > forget:
            new_sharers -= people[day - forget]  # People who forget the secret after `forget` days
        
        people[day] = new_sharers % MOD
    
    total_aware = sum(people[-forget:]) % MOD
    
    return total_aware

# Example usage:
n = 6
delay = 2
forget = 4
print(peopleAwareOfSecret(n, delay, forget))  # Output should be according to the problem statement
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Setup a list `people` to keep track of the number of people who discover the secret on each day. Initialize the number of people who discover the secret on day 1 to 1.

2. **Iterate through days**:
   - For each day from 2 to `n`:
     - Calculate how many new sharers are there (`new_sharers`), which includes adding the people who can start sharing the secret (i.e., people who discovered the secret `delay` days ago).
     - Subtract from `new_sharers` the people who forget the secret (i.e., people who discovered the secret `forget` days ago).

3. **Accounting for total people**:
   - Sum the number of people who are still aware of the secret from the last `forget` days.
   - Use modulus operation to handle large numbers for the result as specified (`MOD = 10**9 + 7`).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through each day up to `n` and perform constant-time operations per day.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use a list of size `n+1` to store the number of people aware of the secret each day.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of people aware of the secret by day `n` while adhering to the constraints provided.
