title:  Rearrange Array to Maximize Prefix Score-out
permalink: /s2587
---

You are given a **1-indexed** integer array `nums`. Rearrange the array to maximize the score of its prefix. The score of an array is the maximum value of the prefix sums of the array. A prefix sum is the sum of the first \( i \) numbers of the array for any \( i \).

**Constraints:**
- \(1 \leq nums.length \leq 10^5\)
- \(-10^6 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^6\)

**Objective:**
Rearrange the `nums` array such that the maximum prefix sum is maximized.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should the function return?**
   The function should return the maximum possible prefix sum after rearranging the given array.

2. **What if we have negative numbers in the array?**
   Negative numbers should be handled optimally by considering their impact on prefix sums.

3. **Is it possible to have all negative or zero elements in the array?**
   Yes, it is possible, and we should handle this edge case appropriately, although the naive approach will suffice.

### Strategy
To maximize the prefix sum, we should rearrange the numbers in such a way that the largest numbers come first. This way, we ensure that our prefix sums are as large as possible.

**Steps:**
1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Compute the prefix sums and identify the maximum prefix sum in this sorted order.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- Calculating the prefix sums will take \(O(n)\).
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code
```python
def maxPrefixSum(nums):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    max_prefix_sum = float('-inf')
    current_prefix_sum = 0
    
    # Calculate the prefix sums and find the maximum
    for num in nums:
        current_prefix_sum += num
        if current_prefix_sum > max_prefix_sum:
            max_prefix_sum = current_prefix_sum
    
    return max_prefix_sum

# Example usage
print(maxPrefixSum([1, -2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 6 (rearranged as [4, 3, 1, -2])
print(maxPrefixSum([-1, -2, -3, -4]))  # Output: -1 (rearranged as [-1, -2, -3, -4])
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting:** By sorting the array in descending order, we ensure that larger (more positive) numbers are considered first in the prefix sums.
2. **Prefix Calculation:** We iterate through the sorted array, calculate the running sum (`current_prefix_sum`), and update `max_prefix_sum` whenever `current_prefix_sum` surpasses it.

This approach ensures that the prefix sums increase rapidly and the maximum prefix sum is reached effectively.
