title:  Kth Missing Positive Number-out
permalink: /s1539

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th missing positive number starting from the left.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
    - What is the size range of the input array `arr`?
    - What is the range of integers in `arr`?
    - What is the acceptable range for `k`?

2. **Output expectations:**
    - Should the output always be within the range of positive integers?
    - What should be returned if `k` is impossibly large?

### Strategy

1. **Define the problem with sample cases:**
    - For example:
        - Input: `arr = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11]`, `k = 5`
        - Output: `9` (Missing numbers sequence: [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...])

2. **Outline the plan:**
    - Maintain a pointer `missing_count` to track the number of missing numbers.
    - Iterate through the natural numbers starting from `1` and compare with elements in `arr`.
    - Keep a counter for missing numbers until we reach the `k`-th missing number.
    - Use a while loop to continue checking each number for whether it is missing from the array `arr`.

### Time Complexity
- The solution has a linear complexity in the worst case, `O(n + k)`, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the `k`-th missing number being checked.

### Code

```python
def findKthPositive(arr, k):
    missing_count = 0
    current = 1
    index = 0
    n = len(arr)
    
    while missing_count < k:
        if index < n and arr[index] == current:
            index += 1
        else:
            missing_count += 1
        
        if missing_count < k:
            current += 1
    
    return current

# Test the function
print(findKthPositive([2, 3, 4, 7, 11], 5))  # Output: 9
print(findKthPositive([1, 2, 3, 4], 2))      # Output: 6
```

### Explanation of Code:
- Initialize `missing_count` to count the missing numbers.
- Initialize `current` to evaluate each natural number sequentially.
- Use `index` to track the position within `arr`.
- Loop until the `k`-th missing number is found:
  - If `current` is present in `arr`, move to the next element in `arr`.
  - If `current` is missing in `arr`, increment the `missing_count`.
  - Increment `current` after updating either `missing_count` or `index`.
- Once `missing_count` equals `k`, the last value of `current` will be the k-th missing number.
