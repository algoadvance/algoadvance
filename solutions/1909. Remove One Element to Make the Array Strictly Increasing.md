title:  Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing-out
permalink: /s1909
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You are allowed to remove exactly one element from the array. Return `true` if it can be made strictly increasing after removing exactly one element, otherwise return `false`.

An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` for every index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the input array?**
   - The size may vary but usually falls within the constraints such that `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`.

2. **What should be returned if the array is already strictly increasing?**
   - If the array is already strictly increasing, we should return `true` since removing any element will still maintain the order.

3. **Are there any edge cases we should consider?**
   - Yes, edge cases like when the array length is `1` or `2`, as they are trivially strictly increasing after removing one element.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check for Strictly Increasing Array**
   - Check if the array is already strictly increasing. If it is, return `true`.

2. **Validation of Increasing Properties on Removal**
   - Traverse the array and identify points where the strict increasing property is violated.
   - For each violation, attempt two things:
     1. Remove the element that violates the property.
     2. Remove the element right after the violation.
   - For each removal scenario, check if the remaining elements maintain the strictly increasing property.

3. **Helper Function**
   - Create a helper function `is_strictly_increasing(arr)` to check if a given subarray is strictly increasing.

4. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Naturally, removing one element from arrays of size `1` and `2` should always return `true` since they can't violate the strictly increasing property.

### Code

```python
def can_be_increasing(nums):
    def is_strictly_increasing(arr):
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
                return False
        return True
    
    n = len(nums)
    
    if n <= 2:
        return True
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]:
            # Try removing nums[i]
            if is_strictly_increasing(nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]):
                return True
            # Try removing nums[i+1]
            if is_strictly_increasing(nums[:i+1] + nums[i+2:]):
                return True
            return False
    
    return True

# Example Test Cases
print(can_be_increasing([1,2,10,5,7]))  # Expected True
print(can_be_increasing([2,3,1,2]))     # Expected False
print(can_be_increasing([1,1,1]))       # Expected False
print(can_be_increasing([1,2,3]))       # Expected True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The `is_strictly_increasing` function checks the array in O(n) time. As we might call this function twice in one traversal for an array of length `n`, the overall complexity is `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` additional space since we are only creating a few variables and not using any extra space that scales with input size.

This strategy efficiently identifies whether the array can be made strictly increasing by removing one element, ensuring a linear runtime.
