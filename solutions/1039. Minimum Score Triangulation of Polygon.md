title:  Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon-out
permalink: /s1039
---

You are given a convex polygon with `n` vertices. You need to triangulate the polygon into `n - 2` triangles. Your goal is to minimize the score of the triangulation. The score of a triangulation is the sum of the scores of all n - 2 triangles in the triangulation.

The score of a triangle is the product of the values of its vertices, given in the array `values`.

Return the minimum score of a triangulation of the polygon.

### Example:
```text
Input: values = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already a triangle, so the only triangulation has score 1*2*3 = 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` (number of vertices)?**
   - Typically, `n` is up to 50 for such problems.
   
2. **Are all the values in the array positive?**
   - Yes, values are positive integers.

3. **Can we assume the polygon is convex?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees the polygon is convex.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming to find the minimum score of triangulation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define subproblems:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum score triangulation of the polygon formed by vertices from index `i` to `j`.

2. **Base cases:**
   - When `j - i < 2`, the polygon is already a line or a point and does not need any triangulation, so `dp[i][j] = 0`.

3. **Recursive relation:**
   - For each pair of points `(i, j)`, iterate over all possible third points `k` between `i` and `j` to form a triangle `(i, k, j)`.
   - Calculate the score as `values[i] * values[k] * values[j]` plus the optimal triangulation of `i to k` and `k to j`.
   - Update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum score found.

4. **Compute the solution:**
   - Initialize a `dp` array.
   - Fill the `dp` table using the recursive relation.
   - The answer will be in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the number of vertices.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is \(O(n^3)\), where `n` is the number of vertices. This is because we have a nested loop structure with three indices iterating over the vertices. 

## Code

```python
def minScoreTriangulation(values):
    n = len(values)
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill the table using bottom-up approach
    for length in range(2, n):
        for i in range(n - length):
            j = i + length
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i + 1, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[k] * values[j])
    
    return dp[0][n-1]

# Example usage
values = [1, 2, 3]
print(minScoreTriangulation(values))  # Output: 6
```

This code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum score triangulation for a given convex polygon with vertex values.
