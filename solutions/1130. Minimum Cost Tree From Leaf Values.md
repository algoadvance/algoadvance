title:  Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values-out
permalink: /s1130
---

Given an array `arr` of positive integers, consider all binary trees such that:

- Each node has exactly zero or two children.
- The values of `arr` correspond to the values of each leaf in an in-order traversal of the tree.
- The value of each non-leaf node is equal to the product of the largest leaf value in its left and right subtree, respectively.

Among all possible binary trees considered, return the minimum possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node in such a tree.

Here's a more precise definition of the problem:

- You need to return an integer which represents the minimum possible sum of the values of each non-leaf node.

Example:

```
Input: arr = [6,2,4]
Output: 32
Explanation:
There are two possible trees:
    1. 6      2       4              1.       6      2       4
      \    /     \       or             \     /   \
   2   4       6       intuition than      4       6

The two trees can be constructed as follows:
1.   Tree 1:
      6
       \
         2
           \
              4
        
    Non-leaf nodes' values: (6*2) + (2*4) = 12+8=20
2.   Tree 2:
      4
     / \
    6   2

    Non-leaf nodes' values: (6*4) + (4*2) = 24+8=32

So the minimum possible sum of values of non-leaf nodes is 32.
```

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. Will the array always have more than one element?
2. Do all elements represent unique positive integers, or can elements be repeated?

**Strategy:**

The goal is to minimize the sum of the values of the non-leaf nodes. To achieve this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming.

1. We'll store the results in a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum cost to build the tree from `arr[i]` to `arr[j]`.
2. Another 2D array `max_val` will store the maximum leaf value in subarray `arr[i..j]`.
3. We will use a bottom-up approach to build these arrays. The transitions will consider the partition point `k` and take the best combination of left and right subtree values.
4. The final result will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`.

**Code:**

```python
def mctFromLeafValues(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    max_val = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for i in range(n):
        max_val[i][i] = arr[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            max_val[i][j] = max(max_val[i][j - 1], arr[j])

    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] + max_val[i][k] * max_val[k + 1][j])

    return dp[0][n-1]
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Building the `max_val` table takes \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- The nested loops used to fill the `dp` table run in \(O(n^3)\) in the worst case, as they iterate over all subarray lengths and partition points.
- Overall, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^3)\).
