title:  Minimum Score by Changing Two Elements-out
permalink: /s2567
---
You are given a list of integers, `nums`. Your task is to minimize the score by changing exactly two elements in the list. The score is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the modified list. 

Return the minimum possible score after changing exactly two elements.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of values**: What is the range of values for each element in `nums`?
   - Assume the element values are within standard integer limits.
   
2. **Length of `nums`**: What is the minimum and maximum length of `nums`?
   - Assume a reasonable length for interview purposes, e.g., 1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5.

3. **Exact modification**: Do we have to change exactly two elements or can we leave them as is if it minimizes the score?
   - Change exactly two elements.


### Strategy:
1. **Sort the List**: First, sort the list to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Consider Different Change Scenarios**:
   - Replace the two largest elements.
   - Replace the two smallest elements.
   - Replace a combination of one smallest and one largest element.
3. **Evaluate Each Scenario**: Calculate the potential scores for each scenario by adjusting the respective elements and finding the differences.

### Steps:
1. Sort the list.
2. Calculate potential scores for:
   - Changing the two largest elements.
   - Changing the two smallest elements.
   - Changing one smallest and one largest element.
3. Return the minimum of the calculated scores.

### Code:

```python
def minimize_score(nums):
    # Sort the nums array to simplify accessing smallest and largest values
    nums.sort()
    
    # Consider the four smallest and four largest elements (since we are allowed to modify the threshold by 2 changes)
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 4:
        return 0  # If there are 4 or fewer elements, we can make them all equal by changing just two of them
    
    # Possible outcomes by changing two elements
    option1 = nums[n-1] - nums[2]
    option2 = nums[n-2] - nums[1]
    option3 = nums[n-3] - nums[0]
    
    # Return the minimum score of these options
    return min(option1, option2, option3)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 5, 6, 2, 8, 10]
print(minimize_score(nums))  # Output: 4 (Example calculation scenario)
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting the List**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the list.
- **Calculating Options**: `O(1)` as we are only accessing and subtracting values a few times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, i.e., `O(n log n)`.
