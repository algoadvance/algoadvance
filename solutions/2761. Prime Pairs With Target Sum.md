title:  Prime Pairs With Target Sum-out
permalink: /s2761
---

Given an integer `n`, return all prime pairs `[p1, p2]` such that `p1 <= p2` and `p1 + p2 == n`. The solution should only include pairs where both numbers are prime.

Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^6`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the output be in any specific order?
   - Typically, we include pairs in ascending order of `p1`.
2. If no such pairs exist, should we return an empty list?
   - Yes, if no prime pairs exist for the given `n`, return an empty list.
3. Is `n` guaranteed to be an integer?
   - Yes, as per the constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Identify All Primes Up to `n`**:
   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to `n`. This will be efficient and give us a list of primes that we can work with to find the pairs.

2. **Find Prime Pairs**:
   - Iterate through the list of primes and for each prime `p1`, check if `n - p1` is also a prime.
   - To avoid repetition and ensure `p1 <= p2`, ensure that the current prime `p1` is less than or equal to `n - p1`.

3. **Return the Results**:
   - Collect all valid pairs and return them.

### Time Complexity

- The Sieve of Eratosthenes runs in O(n log log n) time, which is efficient for our constraint.
- The subsequent check to find pairs will run in O(n) as we iterate over the list of primes.

### Code

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(max_num):
    is_prime = [True] * (max_num + 1)
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    p = 2
    while p * p <= max_num:
        if is_prime[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, max_num + 1, p):
                is_prime[i] = False
        p += 1
    primes = [p for p in range(max_num + 1) if is_prime[p]]
    return primes, is_prime

def prime_pairs_with_sum(n):
    if n < 2:
        return []  # No pairs can form a sum of less than 2
    
    primes, is_prime = sieve_of_eratosthenes(n)
    result = []
    
    for p1 in primes:
        p2 = n - p1
        if p2 >= p1 and is_prime[p2]:
            result.append([p1, p2])
    
    return result

# Example
print(prime_pairs_with_sum(10))  # Output: [[3, 7], [5, 5]]
print(prime_pairs_with_sum(28))  # Output: [[11, 17]]
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - Generate primes up to `n`.
   - Create a boolean list `is_prime` where `is_prime[i]` indicates whether `i` is a prime.

2. **Finding Prime Pairs**:
   - Iterate through all primes `p1`.
   - Calculate `p2` as `n - p1`.
   - Check if `p2` is a prime and ensure `p1 <= p2`.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - Collect the pairs into a list which is returned.

This method ensures finding all prime pairs efficiently by leveraging the Sieve of Eratosthenes and direct prime lookups.
