title:  Check if an Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings-out
permalink: /s2060
---
You are given two **encoded** strings, `s1` and `s2`. To decode an encoded string:
- Replace each substring of the form `k[decoded_string]` (where `k` is a positive integer) with `decoded_string` repeated exactly `k` times.
  
The strings can contain digits and letters. Implement a function to determine if there exists a possible fully decoded string that can match both encoded strings, `s1` and `s2`.

### Example
**Input:**
- `s1 = "3[a]2[bc]"`
- `s2 = "aabcbcbc"`

**Output:**
- `False`

**Input:**
- `s1 = "3[a]"`
- `s2 = "aaa"`

**Output:**
- `True`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `k` be multiple digits (e.g., `12[ab]`)?
    - Yes, `k` can be any positive integer.
2. Are the strings `s1` and `s2` always valid according to the encoding rules?
    - Yes, the encoded strings `s1` and `s2` will always be valid.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to decode the strings `s1` and `s2` and then check for a match. However, directly decoding could be computationally expensive. Instead, a more efficient approach involves using dynamic programming or a recursive function to compare the strings as we "decode" them on-the-fly.

We can identify whether the partially decoded substrings can match by using a two-pointer technique combined with recursion:

1. **Recursive Function**:
   We'll define a recursive function that takes indices in `s1` and `s2` and checks if the remaining substrings can match.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If both indices reach the end of their respective strings, return `True`.
   - If one index reaches the end before the other, return `False`.

3. **Character Matching**:
   - If both characters at the current indices of `s1` and `s2` are letters and they match, recursively check the next indices.
   - If the current character in `s1` or `s2` is a digit, decode the corresponding substring and recursively check if the expanded substring matches the counterpart.

4. **Memoization**:
   Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

### Code
Here's the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def isPossibleToMatch(s1, s2):
    def helper(i, j):
        if (i, j) in memo:
            return memo[(i, j)]

        if i == len(s1) and j == len(s2):
            return True
        
        if i == len(s1) or j == len(s2):
            return False

        if s1[i].isdigit() and s2[j].isdigit():
            return False  # Two numbers cannot directly match each other without decoding

        elif s1[i].isdigit():
            k = 0
            while i < len(s1) and s1[i].isdigit():
                k = k * 10 + int(s1[i])
                i += 1
            saved_i = i
            count_i = 0
            while count_i < k:
                if helper(saved_i, j):
                    count_i += 1
                    saved_i += 1
                else:
                    break
            if count_i == k:
                memo[(i, j)] = True
                return True

        elif s2[j].isdigit():
            k = 0
            while j < len(s2) and s2[j].isdigit():
                k = k * 10 + int(s2[j])
                j += 1
            saved_j = j
            count_j = 0
            while count_j < k:
                if helper(i, saved_j):
                    count_j += 1
                    saved_j += 1
                else:
                    break
            if count_j == k:
                memo[(i, j)] = True
                return True

        elif s1[i] == s2[j]:
            memo[(i, j)] = helper(i + 1, j + 1)
            return memo[(i, j)]

        memo[(i, j)] = False
        return False

    memo = {}
    return helper(0, 0)

# Example usage
s1 = "3[a]2[bc]"
s2 = "aaabcbc"
print(isPossibleToMatch(s1, s2))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is theoretically high due to the recursion and the possibility of exponential branches due to `k` being potentially large. However, memoization significantly reduces the number of unique subproblems, making the practical performance reasonable for typical input sizes. Due to memoization, the complexity is roughly proportional to the product of the lengths of `s1` and `s2`.
