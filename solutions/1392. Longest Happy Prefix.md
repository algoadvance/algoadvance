title:  Longest Happy Prefix-out
permalink: /s1392
---

A string is called a **happy prefix** if it is a non-empty prefix which is also a suffix (but not the whole string). Given a string `s`, return the longest happy prefix of `s`. If there is no such prefix return an empty string.

### Example 1:
``` 
Input: s = "level"
Output: "l"
```

### Example 2:
``` 
Input: s = "ababab"
Output: "abab"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "leetcodeleet"
Output: "leet"
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.


## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the string contain uppercase letters or special characters?
   - No, the string contains only lowercase English letters.
   
2. Can the string have a length of 1?
   - Yes, but in that case, the output should be an empty string because there cannot be a non-empty prefix that is also a suffix.

3. Is the entire string considered a prefix or suffix in this context?
   - No, the prefix and suffix should be proper, which means they should not be the entire string.

Now let's move to the coding part.

## Strategy

1. **Use the KMP Algorithm's LPS Array**:
   - The KMP algorithm's preprocessing step can be very useful here. We will construct the Longest Prefix which is also Suffix (LPS) array. 
   - The LPS array for a given string gives us the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring ending at each index.

2. **Generate the LPS Array**:
   - Construct the LPS array for string `s`.
   
3. **Determine the Longest Happy Prefix**:
   - The value at the last position of the LPS array will give us the length of the required longest happy prefix.
   - Extract the prefix from the original string.

## Code

Here is Python code which follows the above strategy:

```python
def longestPrefix(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    lps = [0] * n  # Longest Prefix Suffix array
    length = 0  # length of the previous longest prefix suffix
    
    # the loop calculates lps[i] for i = 1 to n-1
    i = 1
    while i < n:
        if s[i] == s[length]:
            length += 1
            lps[i] = length
            i += 1
        else:
            if length != 0:
                length = lps[length - 1]
            else:
                lps[i] = 0
                i += 1
    
    # Longest happy prefix
    longest_happy_prefix_length = lps[-1]
    return s[:longest_happy_prefix_length]

# Test cases
print(longestPrefix("level"))        # Output: "l"
print(longestPrefix("ababab"))       # Output: "abab"
print(longestPrefix("leetcodeleet")) # Output: "leet"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the LPS Array**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each index is processed at most twice.
- **Extracting the Prefix**: `O(k)`, where `k` is the length of the longest happy prefix, which is at most `O(n)`.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n)\).

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the LPS array.
