The problem "1024. Video Stitching" from LeetCode is as follows:

You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that last from time `0` to time `T`. These video clips can vary in length, and each clip is a pair of integers `[start, end]` where `0 <= start < end <= 100`.

You need to select the minimum number of clips needed to cover the whole event `[0, T]`. If it is impossible to cover the event with the given clips, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```python
Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We take the clips [0,2], [1,9], and [8,10].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are clips guaranteed to be non-overlapping or can they overlap?**
   - Clips can overlap in their intervals.
2. **Is the list `clips` guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, as the problem implicitly assumes there are clips to consider.
3. **What if `T` is not presentable by any combination of clips?**
   - Return `-1` as specified.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Clips:** Sort the clips by their starting time, and for clips with the same starting time, sort by their ending time in descending order.
2. **Extend Coverage:** Use a variable to track the furthest end we've covered, and another to track the end of the longest clip covering the current segment.
3. **Greedy Approach:** Iterate through the clips and extend the current coverage to the maximum possible using the least number of clips. If at any point a gap is found that can't be covered, return `-1`.
4. **Break Early:** Break the loop early if the current segment can already cover time `T`.

### Code

```python
def videoStitching(clips, T):
    # Sort clips based on starting time, and if equal, by ending time (descending)
    clips.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    # Initialize variables
    end = 0
    farthest = 0
    count = 0
    i = 0
    n = len(clips)
    
    # Iterate over sorted clips
    while i < n and end < T:
        # If we encounter a gap
        if clips[i][0] > end:
            return -1
        
        # Find the farthest end we can reach for the current segment
        while i < n and clips[i][0] <= end:
            farthest = max(farthest, clips[i][1])
            i += 1
        
        # Move our end point and increment count
        count += 1
        end = farthest
        
        # If we have covered or exceeded `T`
        if end >= T:
            return count
    
    # If we exit the loop and still not covered `T`
    return -1

# Example usage
print(videoStitching([[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], 10))  # Output: 3
print(videoStitching([[0,1],[1,2]], 5))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` because we need to sort the given list of clips.
- **Single Pass through clips:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of clips.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which is dominated by the sorting step. 

### Summary

1. Sort the clips.
2. Use a greedy approach to extend coverage using the fewest number of clips.
3. Check for gaps and break early if the event is already covered.
