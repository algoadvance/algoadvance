Given an `m x n` matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the matrix size?**
   - Both the number of rows `m` and columns `n` can range from 1 to 10. This ensures that our solution doesn't need to concern itself with extreme memory management or performance issues.

2. **What is the range of the matrix's elements?**
   - The elements of the matrix can be any integer.

3. **Are there any constraints regarding time complexity?**
   - Since the dimensions are relatively small, the problem can be solved with a time complexity of O(m*n) to ensure efficiency.

4. **Should we consider any special cases?**
   - Yes, consider matrices with only one row or one column, and the smallest case where `m = 1` and `n = 1`.

### Strategy
1. **Boundary Pointers**: Use four boundary pointers (`top`, `down`, `left`, `right`) to keep track of the edges of the matrix that are not yet traversed.
2. **Direction Control**: Track the current direction of traversal (`right`, `down`, `left`, `up`) using an index.
3. **Traversal Loop**:
   - Traverse the matrix in the specified direction.
   - After completing a direction, update the respective boundary pointer.
   - Switch direction and repeat until all elements are covered.

### Code
```python
def spiralOrder(matrix):
    if not matrix:
        return []

    # Initialize boundary pointers
    top, down = 0, len(matrix) - 1
    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1
    result = []
    direction = 0  # 0 -> right, 1 -> down, 2 -> left, 3 -> up

    while top <= down and left <= right:
        if direction == 0:  # Move right
            for col in range(left, right + 1):
                result.append(matrix[top][col])
            top += 1
        elif direction == 1:  # Move down
            for row in range(top, down + 1):
                result.append(matrix[row][right])
            right -= 1
        elif direction == 2:  # Move left
            for col in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                result.append(matrix[down][col])
            down -= 1
        elif direction == 3:  # Move up
            for row in range(down, top - 1, -1):
                result.append(matrix[row][left])
            left -= 1
        
        # Update direction for next iteration
        direction = (direction + 1) % 4

    return result
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - Every element of the matrix is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (excluding the output list).
  - The space is constant for the pointers and direction variable. The main memory usage is for the output list which is required by the problem's specification.
