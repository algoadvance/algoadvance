title:  Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum-out
permalink: /s2099
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Return the subsequence of `nums` that has the largest sum and is of length `k`.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums`?**
   - The element values in `nums` can be positive, negative or zero.

2. **Can `k` be greater than the length of `nums`?**
   - No, `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

3. **Can `nums` contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate values.

4. **What should be returned if `nums` is empty?**
   - The problem states that `k <= len(nums)`, so this scenario shouldn't occur.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the k largest elements:**
   - We need to identify the k largest numbers in the array. This can be efficiently done using a min-heap of size k. Python's `heapq` can be helpful here.

2. **Maintain the original order:**
   - Once we have identified the k largest elements, we need to extract them in the original order they appear in the array. This means we need to keep track of the indices of these elements.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Create a list of tuples containing each element and its index.
   - Sort the list of tuples primarily by value in descending order, but essentially we'll construct a max-heap to easily get the top k elements.
   - From these tuples, pick the top k elements.
   - Sort the picked elements by their original indices to maintain the order they appear in the original array.
   - Extract the values from these sorted tuples.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def maxSubsequence(nums, k):
    # Create a list of tuples (value, index).
    enumerated_nums = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]

    # Get the k largest elements along with their indices using a heap.
    largest_k = heapq.nlargest(k, enumerated_nums, key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Sort these k elements by their original indices to maintain the order.
    largest_k.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    # Extract the values from the sorted tuples.
    return [num for num, _ in largest_k]

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 4, 3, 3]
k = 2
print(maxSubsequence(nums, k))  # Output: [4, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Enumeration and Tuple Creation:**
   - This step takes O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.

2. **Finding k Largest Elements:**
   - Using `heapq.nlargest`, this step takes O(n log k).

3. **Sorting k Elements by Index:**
   - This step takes O(k log k).

4. **Final Extraction:**
   - This step takes O(k).

The overall time complexity is dominated by the `heapq.nlargest` operation, i.e., `O(n log k)`.

By following this approach, we ensure that we are efficiently finding the required subsequence while maintaining the original order of elements.
