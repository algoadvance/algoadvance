title:  Generate Random Point in a Circle-out
permalink: /s478
---

You are given a circle represented as `(x_center, y_center, radius)`. Implement a class `Solution` with two methods:

1. `__init__(self, radius: float, x_center: float, y_center: float)`: This initializes the class with the circle's radius and center.
2. `randPoint(self) -> List[float]`: This method returns a random point inside the circle. Each point must be uniformly distributed inside the circle.

Here's the problem from [LeetCode 478. Generate Random Point in a Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-random-point-in-a-circle/):

```python
class Solution:

    def __init__(self, radius: float, x_center: float, y_center: float):
        pass

    def randPoint(self) -> List[float]:
        pass
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Uniform Distribution:** Should the points be uniformly distributed inside the circle? *(Assumption: Yes, they should be covered uniformly.)*
2. **Precision of Points:** Is there any specific precision required for the floating points? *(Assumption: Standard floating-point precision should be fine.)*
3. **Bounding Box Usage:** Can we use a bounding box and rejection sampling to generate points within the circle? *(Assumption: Yes, this can be a valid strategy.)*

### Strategy
To ensure the points are uniformly distributed inside the circle, we should follow these steps:

1. **Random Radius and Angle:**
   - Generate a random radius `r` using the square root of a uniformly generated random number. This ensures uniform distribution over the area.
   - Generate a random angle `theta` between 0 and `2*pi`.

2. **Conversion to Cartesian Coordinates:**
   - Convert the polar coordinates `(r, theta)` to Cartesian coordinates using the formulas:
     - `x = x_center + r * cos(theta)`
     - `y = y_center + r * sin(theta)`

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use Python's `random` module to generate random numbers.
   - Ensure that the points are calculated accurately within the desired range.

### Code
Here's the implementation based on the discussed strategy:

```python
import random
import math
from typing import List

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, radius: float, x_center: float, y_center: float):
        self.radius = radius
        self.x_center = x_center
        self.y_center = y_center

    def randPoint(self) -> List[float]:
        # Generate a random radius with sqrt scaling to ensure uniform distribution over the area
        r = self.radius * math.sqrt(random.random())
        # Generate a random angle
        theta = random.uniform(0, 2 * math.pi)
        # Convert polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates
        x = self.x_center + r * math.cos(theta)
        y = self.y_center + r * math.sin(theta)
        return [x, y]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`__init__` method):** O(1) - It's a straightforward assignment of values.
- **Generating Random Point (`randPoint` method):** O(1) - All operations are constant time operations including random number generation and mathematical calculations. 

This solution efficiently ensures uniformly distributed random points inside a given circle.
