title:  Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays-out
permalink: /s2956
---
You are given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. Your task is to find all the elements that are common between the two arrays. Both the arrays can contain duplicates, but you should return each common element only once. The result can be returned in any order.

**Example:**
```python
arr1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]
arr2 = [2, 2]
Output: [2]

arr1 = [4, 9, 5]
arr2 = [9, 4, 9, 8, 4]
Output: [9, 4]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be returned if there are no common elements?
   **A:** Return an empty list.
2. **Q:** Can the input arrays be empty?
   **A:** Yes, the arrays can be empty. If both or one of the arrays is empty, the result should be an empty list.
3. **Q:** How should the results be ordered?
   **A:** The order of the result does not matter.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we can use a two-step approach:
1. Convert the arrays to sets which inherently handle duplicate elements.
2. Compute the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the common elements without duplicates.

#### Steps:
1. Convert `arr1` to a set called `set1`.
2. Convert `arr2` to a set called `set2`.
3. Find the intersection of `set1` and `set2`.
4. Convert the result back to a list and return.

### Time Complexity
- Converting a list to a set takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the list.
- Finding the intersection of two sets each of size n and m respectively takes O(min(n, m)) time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two input arrays.

### Code
```python
def find_common_elements(arr1, arr2):
    # Convert arrays to sets
    set1 = set(arr1)
    set2 = set(arr2)
    
    # Find the intersection of both sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert the result back to a list
    return list(common_elements)

# Example usage
arr1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]
arr2 = [2, 2]
print(find_common_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [2]

arr1 = [4, 9, 5]
arr2 = [9, 4, 9, 8, 4]
print(find_common_elements(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [9, 4]
```

This code correctly finds the common elements between two arrays, ensures no duplicates in the result, and handles empty inputs gracefully.
