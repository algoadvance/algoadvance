title:  Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum-out
permalink: /s1911
---

Given an array `nums`, a sequence `seq` is considered an alternating sequence if the `difference` between adjacent elements in `seq` are all alternating (i.e., positive, negative, positive, ... or negative, positive, negative, ...).

The alternating sum of a subsequence `seq` is the sum `seq[0] - seq[1] + seq[2] - seq[3] + ...`.

Return the maximum alternating sum of any subsequence of `nums`.

Example: 
```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
One possible subsequence is [4, 2, 5, 3], with the alternating sum being 4 - 2 + 5 - 3 = 4.
Another possible subsequence is [4, 5], with the alternating sum being 4 - 5 = -1.
The maximum alternating sum among all subsequences is 7.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the problem statement does not specify that the elements of the array are strictly positive.
   
2. What is the constraint on the size of the array?
   - Based on a typical LeetCode problem, we can assume the input size is sufficiently large but manageable within common algorithmic constraints.

3. Are we allowed to use any subsequence, or does it need to be contiguous?
   - We are allowed to use any subsequence, and it does not need to be contiguous.

4. Should we assume that the input array is non-empty?
   - Yes, we can assume that the input array is non-empty as the problem does not specify conditions for an empty array.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming. We need to keep track of two states for each element in the array:
1. The maximum sum if the current element is included as part of the 'positive position' (i.e., we are adding this element).
2. The maximum sum if the current element is included as part of the 'negative position' (i.e., we are subtracting this element).

Let's denote:
- `even` as the maximum alternating sum ending at an 'even' index.
- `odd` as the maximum alternating sum ending at an 'odd' index.

The idea is to iterate through the array and update these states efficiently.

## Code

```python
def maxAlternatingSum(nums):
    even, odd = 0, 0
    for num in nums:
        next_even = max(even, odd + num)
        next_odd = max(odd, even - num)
        even, odd = next_even, next_odd
    return even
```

## Explanation

1. Initialize two variables, `even` and `odd`, to 0. These are used to track the maximum alternating sum.
2. Iterate through each element in `nums`:
   - Calculate the new value for `even` as the maximum of the current value of `even` and the sum of `odd` with the current number `num`.
   - Calculate the new value for `odd` as the maximum of the current value of `odd` and the sum of `even` and the negative of the current number `num`.
3. Update `even` and `odd` with the new values.
4. Return the value of `even` since it holds the maximum alternating sum starting from an 'even' index.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we only make a single pass through the array.

Space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables `even` and `odd`.

This approach ensures an optimal solution with respect to both time and space constraints.
