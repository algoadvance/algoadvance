title:  Count Servers that Communicate-out
permalink: /s1267
---

You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where `grid[i][j]` = 1 means that the cell `(i, j)` represents a server, and `grid[i][j]` = 0 means that the cell `(i, j)` is empty.

Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that communicate with at least one other server.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - The dimensions `m` and `n` can vary, but the constraints should be clarified to ensure performance is adequate.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the grid?**
   - Values should be either `0` or `1`.

3. **Can a server communicate with itself?**
   - No, a server must communicate with another server to be counted.

4. **Are diagonal communications considered valid?**
   - No, only row and column communications are considered valid.

## Strategy

1. **Count servers in each row and column:**
   - We need to keep track of the number of servers in each row and column using two separate arrays.

2. **Scan through the grid and update counts:**
   - For each server (`grid[i][j] = 1`), increment the corresponding row and column count.

3. **Identify communicative servers:**
   - A server at position `(i, j)` communicates if either `row_count[i] > 1` or `col_count[j] > 1`.

4. **Sum up the communicative servers:**
   - Iterate through the grid again to count and sum all servers that meet the communication criteria.

## Code

```python
def countServers(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    row_count = [0] * m
    col_count = [0] * n

    # First pass: count servers in each row and column
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                row_count[i] += 1
                col_count[j] += 1
     
    # Second pass: count servers that communicate
    communicative_servers = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and (row_count[i] > 1 or col_count[j] > 1):
                communicative_servers += 1
                
    return communicative_servers
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The code consists of two passes over the grid.
  - Each pass takes `O(m * n)` time, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - We are using two extra arrays (`row_count` and `col_count`), each of size `m` and `n`, respectively.
  - Therefore, the space complexity is `O(m + n)`.

This strategy ensures that we can efficiently identify and count all communicative servers while maintaining a clear and understandable approach.
