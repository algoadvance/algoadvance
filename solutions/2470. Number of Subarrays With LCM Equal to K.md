title:  Number of Subarrays With LCM Equal to K-out
permalink: /s2470
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. The task is to determine the number of subarrays whose elements have a Least Common Multiple (LCM) equal to `k`.

Return the number of subarrays in `nums` whose LCM is equal to `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values**:
    - What is the range of values for elements in `nums` and the value of `k`?
    - Answer: Typically, the values might be within the range of 1 to 1000, and the length of the array might be up to 10^3.
  
2. **Constraints on `nums` and `k`**:
    - Can `nums` or `k` contain negative numbers?
    - Answer: Since the problem deals with the Least Common Multiple (LCM), we can assume all numbers in `nums` and `k` are positive integers.

3. **Edge cases**:
    - What if `nums` is empty?
    - Answer: The number of subarrays in an empty array would be zero.
  
    - What if no subarray can produce LCM equal to `k`?
    - Answer: The result should be zero if no valid subarray is found.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding LCM**:
    - The LCM of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers.
    - For example, LCM of [6, 4] is 12 because 12 is the smallest number that both 6 and 4 divide into without leaving any remainder.

2. **Brute-force approach**:
    - Calculate the LCM for all possible subarrays.
    - For each subarray, compute the LCM and check if it equals `k`.

3. **LCM Computation**:
    - LCM can be computed using the formula:
      \[
      LCM(a, b) = \frac{|a * b|}{GCD(a, b)}
      \]
    - Use the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor.

4. **Optimization**:
    - While a naive approach involves generating and checking each subarray, it is computationally expensive with O(n^3) complexity in worst cases.
    - Dynamic programming or window sliding may help, but the LCM property (non-reducible between disjoint segments) usually needs to evaluate every potential pair.

## Code

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def subarrayLCM(nums, k):
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        current_lcm = nums[i]
        if current_lcm == k:
            count += 1
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            current_lcm = lcm(current_lcm, nums[j])
            if current_lcm == k:
                count += 1
            elif current_lcm > k:
                break
                
    return count

# Testing the function
print(subarrayLCM([3, 6, 2, 7, 1], 6))  # Example output: expected subarrays count
```

## Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop** (index `i`): Runs \(O(n)\) times.
- **Inner Loop** (index `j`): Could run up to \(O(n - i)\).

In the worst-case scenarios (checking for each pair can go up to LCM computations), overall complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2 \log(\text{max element in nums}))\) because each LCM computation can take up \(\log(\text{element})\) time.
  
- **Auxiliary Space**: \(O(1)\), if not counting the space used for input storage and iteration index.
