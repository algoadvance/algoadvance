title:  Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table-out
permalink: /s668
---

Given the integers `m` and `n`, return the `kth` smallest element in the `m x n` multiplication table.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Range:** What are the constraints on `m`, `n`, and `k`?
   - Constraints are typically provided in the problem statement, but let's assume reasonable constraints considering the problem's context: `1 <= m, n <= 300` and `1 <= k <= m * n`.

2. **Unique Elements:** Are all elements in the multiplication table unique?
   - The elements are not necessarily unique because, for example, `2 * 3` and `3 * 2` produce the same product.

3. **Output:** Should the function output the `kth` smallest element directly?
   - Yes, the function should return the `kth` smallest element.

### Strategy:

To find the `kth` smallest element in an `m x n` multiplication table, a binary search approach is efficient compared to a brute-force search. Here's the plan:

1. **Binary Search Range:** 
   - The smallest possible value is `1 * 1 = 1`.
   - The largest possible value is `m * n`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:** 
   - Use binary search to find the `kth` smallest number. 
   - For a midpoint `mid` in the current search interval, count how many numbers in the table are less than or equal to `mid`.
   - Adjust the search interval based on the count.

3. **Counting Function:**
   - For a number `mid`, count how many numbers in the multiplication table are less than or equal to `mid`.
   - For each row `i`, the number of values less than or equal to `mid` is the minimum of `mid // i` and `n`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def findKthNumber(m: int, n: int, k: int) -> int:
    def count_less_equal(x):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            count += min(x // i, n)
        return count

    low, high = 1, m * n
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if count_less_equal(mid) < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low

# Example Usage:
# m = 3, n = 3, k = 5 should return 3
print(findKthNumber(3, 3, 5))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Binary Search:** O(log(m * n))
- **Counting Elements:** O(m log(n))
- Combining both, the overall time complexity is O(m * log(m * n)).

This approach efficiently narrows down the `kth` smallest element using binary search, ensuring that it is suitable for the given constraints.
