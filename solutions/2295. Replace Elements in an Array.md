title:  Replace Elements in an Array-out
permalink: /s2295
---
You are given a 0-indexed array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace any element of the array with any other element.

You are also given `queries`, where each `queries[i] = [a, b]`. For each query, you should replace every occurrence of `a` in the array `nums` with `b`.

Return the final array after performing all the queries.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `queries` contain duplicate entries, and if so, should multiple replacements be applied to the same number in `nums`?
2. Are the elements of `nums` unique, or can they have duplicates?
3. What should be the behavior if `a` does not appear in `nums`?

### Inputs and Outputs
- Input: 
  - `nums`: List[int], list of integers.
  - `queries`: List[List[int]], list of queries.

- Output: 
  - List[int], list representing the final state of `nums` after performing all the queries.

### Example
```python
nums = [1, 2, 4, 6]
queries = [[1, 3], [4, 7], [6, 1]]

# Output: [3, 2, 7, 1] 
```

### Strategy
1. Iterate through each query in `queries`.
2. For each query:
   - Iterate through all elements in `nums`.
   - If the current element is equal to the element to be replaced (query[0]), replace it with the new element (query[1]).
3. Return the final state of `nums`.

### Code Implementation
```python
def arrayChange(nums, queries):
    # Process each query
    for a, b in queries:
        # Replace all occurrences of 'a' with 'b' in the array nums
        nums = [b if x == a else x for x in nums]
    return nums

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 4, 6]
queries = [[1, 3], [4, 7], [6, 1]]
print(arrayChange(nums, queries))  # Output: [3, 2, 7, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `m` is the number of queries. This is because for each query, we potentially iterate over the entire list `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the size of `nums`, due to the list comprehension creating a new list.

This solution can be optimized if we maintain a mapping of the replacements that should be done, avoiding redundant iterations of `nums`. But for simplicity and readability, this approach will generally be sufficient.
