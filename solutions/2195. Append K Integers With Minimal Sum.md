title:  Append K Integers With Minimal Sum-out
permalink: /s2195
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Append `k` unique positive integers that do not appear in `nums` to `nums` such that the sum of the `k` integers is minimal.

Return the sum of the `k` integers appended to `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicates in `nums`**: Can `nums` contain duplicate values?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate values, but each of the `k` integers we append must be unique and not present in `nums`.

2. **Value Range**: What are the constraints on the values of elements in `nums` and `k`?
   - `nums.length` can be up to `10^5`.
   - The elements in `nums` are positive integers up to `10^9`.
   - `k` will be a positive integer up to `10^5`.

3. **Sorted `nums`**: Will `nums` be given in sorted order?
   - Not necessarily. The array `nums` might not be sorted.

4. **Output**: Should the output be the sum of appended elements or the modified array?
   - The output should be the sum of the `k` appended integers.

### Code

```python
def minimalKSum(nums, k):
    nums = sorted(set(nums))  # Remove duplicates and sort
    total_sum = 0
    current = 1

    for num in nums:
        if num > current:
            # Count how many numbers we can fit between current and num
            count = min(num - current, k)
            total_sum += (current + count - 1) * count // 2
            k -= count
            if k == 0:
                return total_sum
        current = num + 1

    # If we still have k numbers to add
    if k > 0:
        total_sum += (current + current + k - 1) * k // 2
        
    return total_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [5, 6]
k = 6
print(minimalKSum(nums, k))  # Output should be 25
```

### Strategy

1. **Remove Duplicates and Sort**: Remove duplicates from the `nums` array and sort it. This helps to efficiently find gaps where we can append new integers.
   
2. **Iterate and Append**: Start from 1 and iterate through the sorted `nums`. For each current number in `nums`, try to fill the gaps with the smallest possible integers.
   
3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Add the smallest integers that are missing (not in `nums`) until reaching the value of the current number in `nums`.
   - Track the count of numbers remaining to be added (`k`) and decrement it accordingly.
   
4. **Finish the Remaining**: If there are still integers to append after going through the list, simply append the next `k` consecutive integers and sum them.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `nums` array takes **O(n log n)** time complexity.
- The iteration and summation steps are linear in terms of **O(n + k)**.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step, which will dominate the subsequent linear operations.
