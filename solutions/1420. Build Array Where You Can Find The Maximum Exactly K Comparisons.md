title:  Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K Comparisons-out
permalink: /s1420
---

You are given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. Consider the following algorithm to construct an array of length `n`:

1. Initialize the array with zeros: `arr = [0, 0, ..., 0]` with length `n`.
2. For each position `i` (from 1 to n-1), you can set `arr[i]` to an integer from a range 1 to `m`.
3. After setting the elements, you can compare two neighbouring elements of the array to check which one is greater.

You need to build such arrays for which there are exactly `k` such comparisons where one element is greater than its neighbor. Return the number of ways you can build such an array. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array zero-indexed?**
   - Yes, we typically assume zero-indexed arrays in such problem statements.

2. **Are there any specific constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k`?**
   - Yes, typically in such problems, the constraints will be provided, such as `1 <= n <= 50`, `1 <= m <= 100`, and `0 <= k <= n-1`.

3. **What constitutes a "comparison"?**
   - A comparison here specifically means counting instances where a number is greater than its previous neighbor.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Define a 3D DP table `dp[i][j][l]` where:
     - `i` is the length of the prefix considered (from 1 to `n`).
     - `j` is the maximum number in the prefix.
     - `l` is the number of comparisons made so far.
   
   - **Transitions**:
     - To fill `dp[i][j][l]`, we need to consider extending the prefix by a new number `x`.
     - `x <= j` means it will not increase the number of comparisons.
     - `x >  j` means it will increase the number of comparisons by 1.
   
   - **Initialization**:
     - `dp[0][0][0] = 1` because with an empty array, there's exactly one way to start: doing nothing.
   
   - **Final Calculation**:
     - The answer will be the sum of all valid `dp[n][j][k]` values where 1 <= `j` <= `m`.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Use the provided modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.

### Code

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def numOfArrays(n: int, m: int, k: int) -> int:
    if k == 0:
        return 0  # It's impossible to have k == 0 valid comparisons in a non-trivial way.
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base Case
    for j in range(1, m + 1):
        dp[1][j][1] = 1  # There's exactly one way to form a single-element array with exactly one peak
    
    # DP filling
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            for l in range(1, k + 1):
                # Case 1: Extend current max to new length, no new comparison (new element <= j)
                dp[i + 1][j][l] = (dp[i + 1][j][l] + dp[i][j][l] * j) % MOD
                
                # Case 2: New peak; we choose new j2 > j
                for j2 in range(j + 1, m + 1):
                    dp[i + 1][j2][l + 1] = (dp[i + 1][j2][l + 1] + dp[i][j][l]) % MOD
    
    # Sum up the ways we can get exactly k comparisons with arrays of length n
    return sum(dp[n][j][k] for j in range(1, m + 1)) % MOD

# Example usage
print(numOfArrays(2, 3, 1))  # Output: 6
print(numOfArrays(5, 2, 2))  # Output: 0
print(numOfArrays(9, 1, 1))  # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n * m * k * m), where `n`, `m`, and `k` are the constraints provided by the problem.
- The space complexity is O(n * m * k) due to the use of the 3D DP array.

This solution ensures we systematically build the required solution by considering all subproblems and using previously computed values to build up to the full answer.
