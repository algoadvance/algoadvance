title:  Maximum Points Inside the Square-out

### Problem Statement

You are given an array of points `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represent coordinates of points on an XY plane. Additionally, you are given an integer `k` which is the side length of the square. Your task is to determine the maximum number of points that can lie inside or on the boundary of any square with side length `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure that we have a clear understanding of the problem, here are some clarifying questions:

1. **Are the points distinct?**
   - Yes, each point is unique in the list.
   
2. **Does the square have to be axis-aligned?**
   - Yes, the sides of the square are parallel to the X and Y axes.

3. **Can the square be positioned anywhere on the plane?**
   - Yes, we need to find the optimal position such that the maximum number of points lie inside or on the boundary of the square.

4. **What if there are no points provided?**
   - If the `points` list is empty, the answer should be 0.

### Strategy

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - For each point `(xi, yi)`, consider it as the bottom-left corner of a potential square with side length `k`.
   - Calculate how many points fall inside or on the boundary of this square.
   - Track the maximum count of points for any such square.

2. **Optimization Considerations:**
   - Instead of considering every point as the bottom-left corner, consider each point both as a potential bottom-left and top-right corner, which allows fewer evaluations.
   - Sort the points by their coordinates to facilitate counting inside a sliding window.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def maxPoints(points, k):
    n = len(points)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    max_count = 0
    
    # Check every point as bottom-left corner
    for i in range(n):
        x0, y0 = points[i]
        
        # Compute current points within the square with (x0, y0) as the bottom-left corner
        count = 0
        for j in range(n):
            x, y = points[j]
            if x0 <= x <= x0 + k and y0 <= y <= y0 + k:
                count += 1
        
        max_count = max(max_count, count)
    
    return max_count

# Testing the function
points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]]
k = 2
print(maxPoints(points, k)) # Output should be 3 (square with bottom-left corner at (1,2) or (3,2) covers three points)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst Case:** O(n^2), where `n` is the number of points. This is because for each of the `n` points, we are potentially checking every other point.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), assuming only a fixed amount of space is used for variables, not considering input data storage.

This brute force approach ensures correctness but may need optimization for very large inputs. Further optimizations might include using a sweep line algorithm with event points to count points within sliding windows efficiently, but the provided solution gives a clear and understandable method which can be incrementally improved based on performance needs.
