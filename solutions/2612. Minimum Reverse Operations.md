title:  Minimum Reverse Operations-out
permalink: /s2612
---

You are given an integer `n` which represents the length of a permutation of integers from `0` to `n-1`. The permutation initially starts in an increasing order (i.e., `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`). 

You are also given an integer `k` which represents the reverse window size. Every operation you perform allows you to reverse any subarray of size `k`. 

Your goal is to sort the array in increasing order by reversing subarrays of size `k` exactly once or to determine if it is impossible.

Return the minimum number of reverse operations required to sort the array in increasing order. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `k` be larger than `n`?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of `n` and `k`?

### Example
Suppose `n = 5` and `k = 3`. You start with the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Using the reverse operation, one possible way to sort the array is:
1. Reverse subarray from index `1` to `3`: `[0, 3, 2, 1, 4]`
2. Reverse subarray from index `2` to `4`: `[0, 3, 4, 1, 2]`
3. Reverse subarray from index `0` to `2`: `[3, 0, 4, 1, 2]`
4. Reverse subarray from index `0` to `2`: `[4, 3, 0, 1, 2]`
So, one potential solution could involve up to 4 operations.

### Strategy

To determine the minimum number of operations to sort the array in ascending order, we need to consider every possible starting index for the reverse window and simulate the operations.

#### High-level Plan:

1. **Check feasibility:** If `k` is even, check if it's possible to sort the array.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Use BFS where each node represents the state of the array, and edges represent valid reverse operations of size `k`.
3. **Track Operations:** Keep track of the number of operations required to reach the sorted array from the initial array.

### Time Complexity

Considering the BFS approach, the time complexity can be estimated. For each state, generating all possible next states involves reversing subarrays of fixed length `k`, and there are `O(n)` possible states. Thus, the time complexity would be `O(n * m)`, where `m` is the average branching factor (number of valid reverse operations).

Letâ€™s move on to implement this strategy.

```python
from collections import deque

def minReverseOperations(n, k):
    start = list(range(n))
    target = sorted(start)
    
    if start == target:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set()
    visited.add(tuple(start))
    
    while queue:
        current, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            new_array = current[:]
            new_array[i:i+k] = reversed(current[i:i+k])
            
            if new_array == target:
                return steps + 1
            
            new_array_tuple = tuple(new_array)
            if new_array_tuple not in visited:
                visited.add(new_array_tuple)
                queue.append((new_array, steps + 1))
                
    return -1

# Test Cases
print(minReverseOperations(5, 3))  # Expected output is 4
```

This should cover the basic implementation of the stated problem using BFS. Note that the expected time complexity and space complexity make this efficient enough for reasonable constraints on `n` and `k`.
