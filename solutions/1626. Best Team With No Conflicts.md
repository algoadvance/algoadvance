title:  Best Team With No Conflicts-out
permalink: /s1626
---

You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to select the best team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the team must be selected under the following conditions:

1. The age of each player must be kept in non-decreasing order.
2. Players of the same age can be selected together without any restrictions.

Given two lists `scores` and `ages`, where `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represent the score and age of the `i-th` player, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.

**Example:**
```text
Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 34
Explanation: You can choose all the players.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the ages be in any order initially? 
   **A**: Yes, the ages do not follow any strict order in the input.

2. **Q**: Is it guaranteed that scores and ages arrays will be of the same length?
   **A**: Yes, the problem statement guarantees that both arrays have the same length.

3. **Q**: Are all the scores and ages non-negative integers?
   **A**: Yes, it is implied that scores and ages are non-negative integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Pair and Sort**: Combine the scores and ages into pairs and sort them; first by age, and in the case of a tie, by score. This ensures we can process players while keeping the age requirement in mind.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the highest score we can achieve by considering players from the first player up to the `i-th` player. 

   - Iterate over each player, and for each player update the dp array to reflect the best score that can be achieved by potentially including this player.
   - For each player `i`, compare it with all previous players `j` such that the age and score conditions are maintained, and update the DP value accordingly.

3. **Result**: The maximum value in the DP array gives the highest overall score of the team.

### Code

```python
def bestTeamScore(scores, ages):
    # Pair the ages and scores together and sort primarily by age and secondarily by score
    players = list(zip(ages, scores))
    players.sort()
    
    n = len(players)
    dp = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = players[i][1]  # Initialize dp[i] with the player's own score
        for j in range(i):
            if players[j][1] <= players[i][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + players[i][1])
    
    return max(dp)

# Example usage:
scores = [1, 3, 5, 10, 15]
ages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(bestTeamScore(scores, ages))  # Output: 34
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n^2)\):

- Sorting the `players` list takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The dynamic programming involves double nested loops that iterate over every pair of indices, which requires \(O(n^2)\) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by \(O(n^2)\), making it suitable for moderately large values of `n`.
