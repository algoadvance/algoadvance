title:  Palindrome Rearrangement Queries-out
permalink: /s2983
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and a two-dimensional integer array `queries` where each `queries[i] = [li, ri, k]`. For each query, you need to determine if you can rearrange the substring of `s` from index `li` to `ri` (inclusive) to form a palindrome. You can rearrange the characters in the substring in any order, and `k` is the maximum number of character swaps you are allowed to make.

Return a boolean array `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if you can rearrange the substring to form a palindrome using at most `k` swaps, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be included in the output array `answer`?**
   - Each element should be `true` or `false` based on whether the substring can be rearranged into a palindrome with at most `k` swaps.

2. **What are the constraints on the input string and the queries?**
   - The string `s` length and the number of queries `n` can be up to `10^5`.

3. **Can the substring be empty?**
   - Typically, substrings mentioned in the problem are non-empty, but if required, we can consider how to manage empty substrings, usually returning `false`.

4. **What characters does the string consist of?**
   - The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

### Strategy:

1. **Counts of Characters:**
   - For each substring, count the frequency of each character.
   - Determine the number of characters that have an odd frequency. For a string to be rearranged into a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd frequency.

2. **Check Feasibility with `k` Swaps:**
   - Calculate the minimum swaps required to form a palindrome from the substring.
   - Compare the calculated swaps with `k`. If the swaps required are less than or equal to `k`, return `true`; else, return `false`.

### Code:

```python
def can_make_palindrome(s: str, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
    def can_form_palindrome(freq, k) -> bool:
        odd_count = sum(1 for count in freq if count % 2 != 0)
        # Minimum swaps = (odd_count // 2)
        return (odd_count // 2) <= k

    # Precompute frequency prefix sums
    prefix_freq = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        for j in range(26):
            prefix_freq[i + 1][j] = prefix_freq[i][j]
        prefix_freq[i + 1][ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    
    result = []
    
    for li, ri, k in queries:
        freq = [prefix_freq[ri + 1][j] - prefix_freq[li][j] for j in range(26)]
        result.append(can_form_palindrome(freq, k))
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Precomputation:** O(n)
- **Handling Queries:**
  - Each query involves O(1) operations to fetch frequency data and O(26) to calculate the odd frequencies and minimum swaps.
- **Total Complexity:** O(n + 26 * q), where `q` is the number of queries.

This ensures the solution is efficient and can handle the upper bounds of the input constraints.
