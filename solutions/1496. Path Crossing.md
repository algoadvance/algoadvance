title:  Path Crossing-out
permalink: /s1496
---

You are given a string `path`, where `path[i]` is the `iᵗʰ` direction that you will move. The direction can be:
- 'N' for north,
- 'S' for south,
- 'E' for east,
- 'W' for west.

Starting from the origin (0, 0), return `True` if the path crosses itself at any point, i.e., if any point in the path has been visited more than once, and `False` otherwise.

**Example:**

- Example 1:
    - Input: path = "NES"
    - Output: False
    - Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

- Example 2:
    - Input: path = "NESWW"
    - Output: True
    - Explanation: Notice that the path returns to the origin after the second 'W'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length of the string `path`?
    - Constraint: `1 <= path.length <= 10^4`
    
2. **Characters in String**:
    - Are the directions only 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W'?
    - Yes, the directions are guaranteed to be one of these four letters.
    
3. **Output**:
    - Should the function return a boolean value?
    - Yes, return `True` if the path crosses itself, otherwise `False`.

## Strategy

1. **Use a Set to Track Visited Locations**:
   - We will start from the origin `(0, 0)`.
   - Use a set to store coordinates we visit.
   - As we traverse the string `path`, we will move according to the direction characters and update our current position.
   - At each move, we check if the new position already exists in the set.
   - If it does, return `True`; otherwise, continue and add the new position to the set.
   - If we complete the path without revisiting any position, return `False`.

2. **Movement Mapping**:
   - Use a dictionary to map each direction to its respective coordinate changes:
     - 'N' -> (0, 1)
     - 'S' -> (0, -1)
     - 'E' -> (1, 0)
     - 'W' -> (-1, 0)

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `path`, since we are processing each character exactly once.

## Code

```python
def isPathCrossing(path: str) -> bool:
    # Initial position
    x, y = 0, 0
    
    # Set to keep track of visited positions
    visited = set()
    visited.add((x, y))
    
    # Mapping directions to (dx, dy)
    move = {
        'N': (0, 1),
        'S': (0, -1),
        'E': (1, 0),
        'W': (-1, 0)
    }
    
    # Process each step in the path
    for direction in path:
        dx, dy = move[direction]
        x += dx
        y += dy
        if (x, y) in visited:
            return True
        visited.add((x, y))
    
    return False

# Example usages
print(isPathCrossing("NES"))    # Output: False
print(isPathCrossing("NESWW"))  # Output: True
```

This code will effectively track the path and determine if there is any crossing by checking for repeated coordinates.
