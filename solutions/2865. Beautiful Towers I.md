title:  Beautiful Towers I-out
permalink: /s2865
---

You are given an array `positions` of `n` integers, where `positions[i]` represents the height of the i-th tower. A tower `i` is beautiful if no other tower has greater height at a distance exactly `i` position from it. You want to find out the number of beautiful towers.

**Example:**

```
Input: positions = [2,1,3,4,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the tower with the height of 4 (at position 4) is beautiful because no other tower at distance 4 has greater height.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array have negative or zero values?
2. Can there be duplicate values within the array?
3. Are the values in the array guaranteed to be integers?

## Strategy

1. Iterate through each tower in the given `positions` list.
2. For each tower `i`, check the towers that are exactly `i` distance away.
3. If the height of the current tower is higher than the height of all the towers at distance `i`, increment the count of beautiful towers.
4. Return the count of beautiful towers.

## Code

```python
def count_beautiful_towers(positions):
    # To store the count of beautiful towers
    count = 0
    n = len(positions)
    
    for i in range(n):
        is_beautiful = True
        height = positions[i]
        
        for d in range(1, n):
            # Check towers at distance `d` from `i`
            if i - d >= 0 and positions[i - d] > height:
                is_beautiful = False
            if i + d < n and positions[i + d] > height:
                is_beautiful = False
        
        if is_beautiful:
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Test the function
print(count_beautiful_towers([2, 1, 3, 4, 7]))  # Expected output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is `O(n^2)` since for each tower, we are potentially checking all other towers.
