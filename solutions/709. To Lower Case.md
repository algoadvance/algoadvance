Given a string `s`, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

### Example:

1. Input: `s = "Hello"`
   Output: `"hello"`

2. Input: `s = "here"`
   Output: `"here"`

3. Input: `s = "LOVELY"`
   Output: `"lovely"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we return if the string is already all lowercase?
   **A:** If the string is already in lowercase, we should return it as is.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the character set of the string? Is it always composed of alphabetic characters?
   **A:** The problem implies dealing with alphabetic characters, but in typical problems of this kind, other characters should be left unchanged.

3. **Q:** Is the input string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   **A:** The prompt does not specify, so we should handle possible edge cases, including an empty string.

## Strategy

Python provides an efficient method to convert a string to lowercase: `str.lower()`. This built-in method is optimal and will handle converting each uppercase letter to its corresponding lowercase equivalent, leaving other characters (such as digits and punctuation) unchanged.

The detailed steps are:
1. Utilize Python's built-in `lower()` method on the input string `s`.
2. Return the resultant lowercase string.

This method is efficient and straightforward.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```python
def toLowerCase(s: str) -> str:
    return s.lower()
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this implementation is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The `lower()` method processes each character exactly once, making it ideally efficient for this problem. 

## Usage

This solution is direct and leverages Python's optimized string methods to ensure both readability and performance.
