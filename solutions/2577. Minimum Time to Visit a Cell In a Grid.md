title:  Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid-out
permalink: /s2577
---
You are given a 2D grid of size `m x n` where each cell in the grid is either 0 (empty) or 1 (blocked). You begin at the top-left cell of the grid `(0, 0)` and you want to reach the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`. The challenge is that you can only move to orthogonally adjacent cells (i.e., cells that share an edge) and it is only possible to enter empty cells. The objective is to determine the minimum number of steps required to reach the bottom-right cell from the top-left cell. If it is not possible to reach the cell, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the top-left and bottom-right cells are always empty, i.e., both are `0`?
2. Should we consider diagonal moves, or only vertical and horizontal moves are allowed?
3. Is there any constraint on the size of the grid?
4. Are negative indices allowed?

With these questions, the problem can be clarified further. Assuming we're to consider only orthogonal movements and cells are non-negative:

## Strategy
This problem is a typical shortest path problem on an unweighted grid, which can be effectively solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Use a queue to facilitate exploring the grid in a breadth-first manner. Initialize the queue with the starting cell `(0, 0)` and mark it as visited.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
   - For each cell, explore its adjacent cells.
   - Add adjacent cells that are within grid bounds and are empty (i.e., not blocked and not visited) to the queue.
   - Track the number of steps taken.
3. **End Condition**: If the queue is empty and the bottom-right cell is not reached, return `-1`.
4. **Optimization**: Ensure each cell is visited only once to minimize redundant work.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def minTimeToVisitCell(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if grid[0][0] == 1 or grid[m-1][n-1] == 1:
        return -1

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # (row, col, steps)
    visited = set((0, 0))

    while queue:
        x, y, steps = queue.popleft()

        # If we've reached the bottom-right corner
        if x == m-1 and y == n-1:
            return steps

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny, steps+1))

    return -1  # If we exhaust the queue without finding the target

```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(m \cdot n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, we may visit all cells.
- The space complexity is also \(O(m \cdot n)\) due to the storage in the queue and the visited set.

Let me know if you need further assistance or adjustments with different constraints!
