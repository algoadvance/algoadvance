title:  Find All Duplicates in an Array-out
permalink: /s442
---
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **once** or **twice**, find all the integers that appear **twice**.

You should implement the solution with **O(n)** time complexity and use only **constant extra space**.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:**
   - Are there any other constraints on `nums` apart from its length and range of values?
   - Example: Should the elements always be positive integers?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be a list of duplicated numbers, and does their order matter?

Assuming no further constraints are given, letâ€™s proceed to the strategy.

### Strategy
To achieve the requirements of O(n) time complexity and constant extra space, we can use the fact that the integers are in the range `[1, n]`. This allows us to use the array itself for marking the visited elements.

Here is the approach in detail:
1. **Iterate through the array**: For each number, treat its absolute value as an index.
2. **Mark the visited numbers**: 
   - For each number `num` at index `i`, calculate the index `index = abs(num) - 1` and negate the value at `nums[index]`.
   - If `nums[index]` is already negative, it means the number `abs(num)` is a duplicate.
3. **Collect duplicates**: If `nums[index]` is negative, add `abs(num)` to the result list.
4. **Restore the array (optional)**: If restoring the mutated array is necessary, restore it to its original state by making all values positive again.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def findDuplicates(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    duplicates = []

    for num in nums:
        index = abs(num) - 1
        
        if nums[index] < 0:
            duplicates.append(abs(num))
        else:
            nums[index] = -nums[index]

    # Optional: Restore the original array
    # for i in range(len(nums)):
    #     nums[i] = abs(nums[i])

    return duplicates

# Example usage
print(findDuplicates([4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]))  # Output: [2, 3]
print(findDuplicates([1,1,2]))            # Output: [1]
print(findDuplicates([1]))                # Output: []
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through the array once to mark the visited elements.
  - We potentially iterate again to restore the original array.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only constant extra space is used for the result list and a few variables. The modifications to `nums` are done in place.

This approach efficiently finds all duplicates in the list while adhering to the constraints of O(n) time complexity and constant extra space.
