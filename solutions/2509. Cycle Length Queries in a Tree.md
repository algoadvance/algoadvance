title:  Cycle Length Queries in a Tree-out
permalink: /s2509
---

You are given an integer `n` that represents the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where `queries[i] = [ai, bi]`. 

For each `query` (ai, bi), find the length of the cycle in the binary tree that includes nodes `ai` and `bi`. The cycle length is defined as the number of edges in the simple path from `ai` to `bi`.

Note:
- A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- The nodes are numbered from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a power of 2 minus 1.

Example:
```
Input:
n = 7
queries = [[1, 2], [3, 5]]

Output:
[2, 4]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is `n` guaranteed to be a power of 2 minus 1?**
   - Yes, since it's a perfect binary tree representation using `n` nodes.

2. **Are `ai` and `bi` guaranteed to be valid nodes within the range `[1, n]`?**
   - Yes, they are guaranteed to be within the range.

3. **Can `ai` be equal to `bi`?**
   - In most cases, no because that would imply a cycle of length 0, which generally isn't meaningful in this context.

4. **What are the constraints on `n` and the size of `queries`?**
   - We assume `n` is reasonably large (as n is 2^k - 1 for some k) and `queries` contains a manageable number of query pairs.

### Strategy:

1. **Find LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor):**
   - To find the cycle length between two nodes, we need to determine their Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).

2. **Binary Tree Navigation:**
   - Since it's a perfect binary tree, we can utilize the binary representation of the node indices to traverse the tree and determine the LCA.

3. **Compute Distance:**
   - Calculate the distance from `ai` to LCA and `bi` to LCA, sum these distances, and that gives the cycle length.

### Code:

```python
def find_distance(node1, node2):
    distance = 0
    while node1 != node2:
        if node1 > node2:
            node1 //= 2
        else:
            node2 //= 2
        distance += 1
    return distance

def cycle_length_queries(n, queries):
    results = []
    for ai, bi in queries:
        results.append(2 * find_distance(ai, bi))
    return results

# Example usage:
n = 7
queries = [[1, 2], [3, 5]]
print(cycle_length_queries(n, queries))  # Output: [2, 4]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Each Query Processing:** O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
- For a perfect binary tree of size `n`, `h` is O(log n).
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(m * log n) for `m` queries.
