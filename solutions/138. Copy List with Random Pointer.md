title:  Copy List with Random Pointer-out
permalink: /s138
---

**Problem Summary:**

A linked list is given where each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list or to `null`. The task is to create a deep copy of this list.

Each node is defined as:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = x
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the values of the nodes guaranteed to be unique?
   **A**: No, node values are not necessarily unique, but the random pointers can point to any node or `null`.
   
2. **Q**: Do we need to handle any special edge cases like an empty list?
   **A**: Yes, we need to handle the case where the input list is empty.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves three main steps:
  
1. **Step 1: Copying the Nodes and Creating a Mapping**
   - Iterate through the original list and create a copy of each node.
   - Store the mapping of old nodes to new nodes using a hash map (dictionary).

2. **Step 2: Setting Next and Random Pointers**
   - Iterate through the original list again to update the next and random pointers of the copied nodes using the previously created mapping.
  
3. **Step 3: Extract and Return the Deep Copy**
   - Return the head of the new list.

## Implementation

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = x
        self.next = next
        self.random = random

def copyRandomList(head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
    if not head:
        return None
    
    # Creating a mapping from old nodes to new nodes
    old_to_new = {}

    # Step 1: Create a copy of each node and store it in the dictionary
    current = head
    while current:
        old_to_new[current] = Node(current.val)
        current = current.next

    # Step 2: Assign the next and random pointers
    current = head
    while current:
        if current.next:
            old_to_new[current].next = old_to_new[current.next]
        if current.random:
            old_to_new[current].random = old_to_new[current.random]
        current = current.next

    # Step 3: Return the head of the new list
    return old_to_new[head]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through the list a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We use a dictionary to store the mapping of old nodes to new nodes.

This completes our implementation and explanation. If there are additional questions or edge cases to consider, feel free to ask!
