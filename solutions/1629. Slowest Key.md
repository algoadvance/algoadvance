title:  Slowest Key-out
permalink: /s1629
---

A laptop keyboard is connected to a computer. The computer records which keys are pressed, at what times and for how long the keys are held down. This data is stored in two lists:
- `releaseTimes`: contains the times at which a key is released.
- `keysPressed`: contains the corresponding keys that are pressed.

We are interested in finding the key with the longest duration that was pressed. If there is a tie, we need to return the lexicographically larger key.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The keypress durations are as follows:
- 'c' -> 9 (from 0 to 9)
- 'b' -> 20 (from 9 to 29)
- 'c' -> 20 (from 29 to 49)
- 'd' -> 1 (from 49 to 50)
The longest duration is '20' and the lexicographically largest key is 'c'.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What if `releaseTimes` and `keysPressed` are not of the same length?**
   - Assume `releaseTimes` and `keysPressed` are always of the same length.

2. **What is the maximum length of `keysPressed`?**
   - The problem constraints usually handle a length up to 10^4, but it should be confirmed in the problem statement.

## Strategy

1. Parse through the `releaseTimes` and `keysPressed` simultaneously.
2. Calculate the duration of each key press by subtracting the previous release time from the current release time.
3. Track the maximum duration found and the corresponding key.
4. If a key press duration ties with the maximum found duration, select the lexicographically larger key.

## Code

```python
def slowestKey(releaseTimes, keysPressed):
    max_duration = releaseTimes[0]
    slowest_key = keysPressed[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(releaseTimes)):
        current_duration = releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i-1]
        if current_duration > max_duration or (current_duration == max_duration and keysPressed[i] > slowest_key):
            max_duration = current_duration
            slowest_key = keysPressed[i]
    
    return slowest_key

# Example usage:
releaseTimes = [9, 29, 49, 50]
keysPressed = "cbcd"
print(slowestKey(releaseTimes, keysPressed))  # Output: "c"
```

## Time Complexity

The strategy involves a single pass through the `releaseTimes` and `keysPressed` arrays. Given `n` as the length of the input lists:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` assuming the input list fits in memory since we're only tracking a few extra variables for the maximum duration and corresponding key.

This solution should efficiently handle up to the maximum constraints typically given in such problems.
