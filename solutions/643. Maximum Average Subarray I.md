title:  Maximum Average Subarray I-out
permalink: /s643
---

Given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements and an integer `k`, return the maximum average value of a subarray of length `k`. You need to compute the result as a floating-point number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Bounds on the size of `nums` and `k`:**
   - What is the upper limit for `n` (the length of `nums`) and `k`?
   - Is it guaranteed that `k <= n`?

2. **Element Range:**
   - What is the range of element values in the `nums` array? (e.g., are they all positive, can they be negative?)
  
3. **Return Type:**
   - Should the result be returned as a floating-point number with any specific precision?

### Strategy

We need an efficient way to find the maximum average subarray of length `k`. A brute-force solution would involve checking all possible subarrays of length `k` which would be very inefficient with time complexity of O(n*k). So, we will use a sliding window approach to achieve a time complexity of O(n).

1. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - First, compute the sum of the first `k` elements.
   - Then slide the window one element at a time from the beginning to the end of the array.
   - Update the sum by subtracting the element that is left out of the window and adding the new element that enters the window.
   - Keep track of the maximum sum encountered during this process.
   - Finally, return the maximum sum divided by `k` to get the maximum average.

### Code

```python
def findMaxAverage(nums, k):
    # Compute the sum of the first window of size `k`
    current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    max_sum = current_sum
    
    # Slide the window from the start to the end of the array
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        # Update the sum for the new window
        current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        # Update max_sum if we find a new maximum
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
    
    # The maximum average is the maximum sum divided by `k`
    return max_sum / k

# Example usage
nums = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]
k = 4
print(findMaxAverage(nums, k))  # Output should be 12.75
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the list once for the first sum computation, and then again sliding the window across the array, which both are linear operations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We are using only a few extra variables to keep track of the sums and the maximum, thus having constant space complexity.
