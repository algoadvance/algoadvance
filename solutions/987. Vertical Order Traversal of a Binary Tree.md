title:  Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s987
---

### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position `(row, col)`, its left and right children are at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` respectively. The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of lists of integers where, for each vertical column grouped by their col value (in order from left to right):

- If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right based on the node's values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What kind of values can nodes contain?**
   - Node values are integers.
   
2. **What is the range of the tree depth?**
   - Unspecified, but we should generally assume it can be large.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure Choice**:
   - Use a dictionary to group nodes based on their column index.
   - Each key in the dictionary will store a list of tuple representing `(row, value)`.

2. **Traversal Approach**:
   - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree as it naturally handles row-order traversal.
   - Use a tuple in the queue containing `(node, row, col)`.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - After traversing the tree, sort the dictionary keys (which represent columns).
   - For each column, sort the tuples based on row first and then value.
   - Append the sorted values to the resulting list.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def verticalTraversal(root: TreeNode):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    node_dict = defaultdict(list)
    queue = deque([(root, 0, 0)])  # (node, row, col)

    # BFS traversal
    while queue:
        node, row, col = queue.popleft()
        node_dict[col].append((row, node.val))

        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, row + 1, col - 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, row + 1, col + 1))
    
    # Sort the columns and then sort by row and value within each column
    result = []
    for col in sorted(node_dict.keys()):
        sorted_nodes = sorted(node_dict[col], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
        col_values = [val for row, val in sorted_nodes]
        result.append(col_values)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Building the Dictionary**:
   - Each node is processed once: O(N), where N is the number of nodes.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting columns: If there are C columns, sorting is O(C log C).
   - Sorting each column's values: Let M be the maximum number of nodes in a single column. Sorting each column is O(M log M).

Overall Time Complexity will be approximately **O(N log N)** in the average case, considering that values in columns need to be sorted. The extra terms are lower-order and thus within **O(N log N)** because C and M will be proportional to N in most practical scenarios.
