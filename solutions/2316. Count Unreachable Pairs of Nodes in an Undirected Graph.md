title:  Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph-out
permalink: /s2316
---

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph, and a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`.

Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the given graph connected?**
   - No, the graph can be disconnected, which means there might be several components.

2. **Can there be any duplicate edges or self-loops?**
   - According to typical graph problems, duplicate edges or self-loops are usually not included unless specified, so we assume no duplicates or self-loops.

3. **What is the range of `n` and the length of `edges`?**
   - The constraint would typically follow `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `0 <= edges.length <= min(2 * 10^5, n * (n - 1) / 2)`.

### Code

```python
def count_unreachable_pairs(n, edges):
    def dfs(node, visited, adj_list):
        stack = [node]
        component_size = 0
        while stack:
            current = stack.pop()
            if not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                component_size += 1
                for neighbor in adj_list[current]:
                    if not visited[neighbor]:
                        stack.append(neighbor)
        return component_size

    # Step 1: Build the adjacency list
    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj_list[a].append(b)
        adj_list[b].append(a)

    # Step 2: Identify connected components using DFS/BFS
    visited = [False] * n
    component_sizes = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            size = dfs(i, visited, adj_list)
            component_sizes.append(size)

    # Step 3: Calculate the number of unreachable pairs
    unreachable_pairs = 0
    total_nodes = sum(component_sizes)
    
    for size in component_sizes:
        total_nodes -= size
        unreachable_pairs += size * total_nodes
    
    return unreachable_pairs
```

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **Connected Components**: Utilize Depth First Search (DFS) to find the size of each connected component.
3. **Count Unreachable Pairs**:
   - For each connected component of size `c_i`, pairs formed are between nodes inside this component and all other nodes not reachable from it.
   - If one component has `c_i` nodes, the other has `total_nodes - c_i`, then the number of pairs is `c_i * (total_nodes - c_i)`.
   
### Time Complexity

- **Adjacency List Construction**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **DFS Traversal**: O(V + E), given that each node and edge is processed once.
- **Unreachable Pairs Calculation**: O(C), where C is the number of components.
So, the overall time complexity is O(V + E).

### Edge Cases

1. **Single Node**: If `n = 1`, the number of reachable pairs is 0.
2. **No Edges**: If `edges` is empty, all nodes are isolated, resulting in all pairs being unreachable.
