title:  Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix-out
permalink: /s378
---
Given an `n x n` matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, find the `k`th smallest element in the matrix.

**Example:**

```
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
]
k = 8

Output: 13
```

**Note:**
- You may assume `k` is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ n^2.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `n`?
   - Are all elements in the matrix distinct?

2. **Output:**
   - If there are multiple possible `k`th smallest elements (duplicates), should we return any specific one or the problem guarantees that there won't be such cases?

### Strategy
#### Heap Approach
1. **Min-Heap**:
   - Use a heap data structure to take advantage of its sorting properties.
   - Initially, insert the first element of each row into the heap keeping track of their positions.
   - Extract the minimum element from the heap `k` times.
   - Every time you extract the minimum element, if there is a next element in the same row, insert it into the heap.
2. **Binary Search (Optimized Approach)**:
   - Utilize binary search over the range of the matrix elements.
   - Determine the `mid` value in the given range and count how many elements in the matrix are less than or equal to `mid`.
   - Adjust the search range based on the count.

Here, we will implement the **Heap Approach** using Python's `heapq` library for brevity and ease of understanding.

### Code
```python
import heapq

def kthSmallest(matrix, k):
    n = len(matrix)
    min_heap = []
    
    # Initialize min heap with the first element from each row.
    for r in range(min(len(matrix), k)):  # Only need the first min(len(matrix), k)
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, (matrix[r][0], r, 0))
    
    # Extract min element from heap k times
    while k:
        element, r, c = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if c < n - 1:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (matrix[r][c+1], r, c+1))
        k -= 1
    
    return element

# Example usage:
matrix = [
   [ 1,  5,  9],
   [10, 11, 13],
   [12, 13, 15]
]
k = 8
print(kthSmallest(matrix, k))  # Output should be 13
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of Heap:** O(min(k, n)) because we only consider the first element of each row.
- **Extract min from Heap (k times):** Each heap operation (pop/push) is O(log(min(k, n))). For `k` operations, it's O(k * log(min(k, n))).
- Overall, the complexity is **O(k * log(min(k, n)))**.

### Space Complexity
- The heap can grow up to size **min(k, n)**, so the space complexity is **O(min(k, n))**.
