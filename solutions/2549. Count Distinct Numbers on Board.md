title:  Count Distinct Numbers on Board-out
permalink: /s2549
---

You are given an integer `n`, representing the size of a board with numbers ranging from 1 to `n`. The task is to count the number of distinct numbers on this board. 

Write a function `countDistinctNumbers(n: int) -> int` that returns the count of distinct numbers on the board.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the numbers on the board distinct inherently?** 
   - Yes, since the board contains numbers ranging from 1 to `n`.

2. **What is the expected input range for `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` will be a positive integer. For edge cases, we should consider boundary values.

3. **Are there any constraints on the execution time or space complexity?**
   - Given that we need to simply count the numbers from 1 to `n`, the complexity should be optimal. 

### Strategy

Since the numbers on the board range from `1` to `n`, and each number appears exactly once, the task is straightforward:

1. **Identify the Range**: The numbers are inherently distinct from `1` to `n`.
2. **Count the Numbers**: The number of distinct elements is equal to the count of numbers within that range, which is `n`.

### Code

Here is the Python function to achieve this:

```python
def countDistinctNumbers(n: int) -> int:
    return n
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The function performs a single operation, directly returning the input value.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - No additional space is required other than the input itself.

This solution is optimal as the number of distinct numbers in the given range from `1` to `n` is inherently equal to `n`.

### Example

```python
countDistinctNumbers(5)  # Output: 5
countDistinctNumbers(10) # Output: 10
countDistinctNumbers(1)  # Output: 1
```
