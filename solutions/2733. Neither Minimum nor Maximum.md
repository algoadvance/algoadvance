title:  Neither Minimum nor Maximum-out

You are given a list of integers. Implement a function that returns the first element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum in the list. If no such element exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the maximum size of the list?
   - Can the list contain duplicate values?
   - Can the list be empty or contain fewer than three elements?

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - If there are multiple valid elements, should we return the first instance or any one of them?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Lists with all elements being the same.
   - Lists with only two elements.

### Strategy
1. **Identify the Minimum and Maximum Elements**: 
   - Traverse the list to find the minimum and maximum values.

2. **Finding the Non-Min/Max Element**:
   - Traverse the list again and find the first element that is neither the minimum nor the maximum.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If the list has fewer than three elements, immediately return -1 because it is impossible to have an element that is neither min nor max.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we need to traverse the list to find the min and max, and then traverse again to find the required element.

### Code

```python
def neither_min_nor_max(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return -1
    
    min_val = min(nums)
    max_val = max(nums)
    
    for num in nums:
        if num != min_val and num != max_val:
            return num
    
    return -1
```

### Explanation
1. **Edge Case Handling**: If the list has fewer than three elements, return -1.
2. **Min and Max Calculation**: Use Python's built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values of the list.
3. **Finding the Result**: Loop through the list again to find and return the first element that is not equal to either the minimum or the maximum value.
4. **Return -1 if Not Found**: If no such element exists, return -1.

This solution ensures we efficiently find the required element with linear time complexity.
