title:  Expression Add Operators-out
permalink: /s282
---

Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, add binary operators (not unary) +, -, or * between the digits so they form a valid expression that evaluates to the target value.

Return all possible expressions that evaluate to the target value.

### Example
- Input: num = "123", target = 6
- Output: ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"]

- Input: num = "232", target = 8
- Output: ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]

- Input: num = "105", target = 5
- Output: ["1*0+5", "10-5"]

- Input: num = "00", target = 0
- Output: ["0+0", "0-0", "0*0"]

- Input: num = "3456237490", target = 9191
- Output: []

### Constraints
- 1 <= num.length <= 10
- num consists of only digits.
- -2^31 <= target <= 2^31 - 1

## Clarifying Questions
1. What kind of numbers does `num` consist of? Are there any leading zeros allowed in the number pieces?
   
   - `num` consists only of digits and leading zeros can occur in the pieces generated during the combination process.
  
2. Are the operations limited to just addition, subtraction, and multiplication?

   - Yes, only binary operations such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), and multiplication (`*`).

3. Do we need to consider any arithmetic precedence?

   - Yes, multiplication has higher precedence over addition and subtraction.

## Strategy

### Recursive Approach with Backtracking
1. Use a helper function that takes in the current index, the path of the expression so far, the current calculated value, and the last addition/subtraction/multiplication value.
2. For each recursive call, iterate over the possible next numbers and the respective operators to form new expressions.
3. Evaluate the new expression by updating the calculated value and the last value used for multiplication correctly.
4. Backtrack after evaluating to ensure all possible combinations are explored.

### High-Level Algorithm
1. Initialize the result list.
2. Define a recursive helper function.
    - Base case: if the current index has reached the length of `num` and the calculated value equals the target, add the current path to the result.
    - For each recursive call, try different operators and numbers.
3. Start the recursion from the initial state.
4. Return the result list.

### Code Implementation

```python
def addOperators(num: str, target: int):
    def helper(index, path, calc, tail, res):
        # Base case: we are at the end of the string
        if index == len(num):
            if calc == target:
                res.append(path)
            return
        
        for i in range(index, len(num)):
            # Avoid numbers with leading zeros
            if i != index and num[index] == '0':
                break
            
            # Current number to consider
            cur = int(num[index:i + 1])
            if index == 0:
                # First num, pick it without any operator
                helper(i + 1, path + str(cur), cur, cur, res)
            else:
                # Addition
                helper(i + 1, path + "+" + str(cur), calc + cur, cur, res)
                # Subtraction
                helper(i + 1, path + "-" + str(cur), calc - cur, -cur, res)
                # Multiplication
                helper(i + 1, path + "*" + str(cur), calc - tail + tail * cur, tail * cur, res)
    
    result = []
    helper(0, "", 0, 0, result)
    return result

# Test
num = "123"
target = 6
print(addOperators(num, target))  # Output: ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is hard to pin exactly because it heavily depends on the input string and the branching factor of the recursion. However, it is combinatorially high due to the exploration of all possible combinations of operators between the digits. 

In general:
- For every digit, there are roughly 3 choices (add, subtract, multiply), leading to an approximate complexity of O(3^n), where `n` is the length of the `num` string.
