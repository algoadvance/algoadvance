### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**:
   - What is the format of the input? Is it a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row in the grid?
   - Are we guaranteed that the input grid will contain only '1's (land) and '0's (water)?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should we handle an empty grid?
   - Is the grid guaranteed to be rectangular (all rows have the same number of columns)?

3. **Output Format**:
   - What should the function return? The number of islands as an integer?

### Strategy
The problem can be thought of as finding all connected components in a graph. Here, our graph vertices are the cells of the grid, and edges exist between horizontally and vertically adjacent land cells ('1's).

#### Steps:
1. **Traversal**:
   - We'll traverse each cell in the grid.
   - If we encounter a '1', we'll perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to mark all connected lands as visited.
   - We'll use a helper method to perform DFS/BFS starting from each '1' it encounters.

2. **Marking Visited Cells**:
   - During DFS/BFS, we can mark visited cells by setting them to '0' or use an additional `visited` boolean grid.

3. **Counting Islands**:
   - Every time we start a DFS/BFS from an unvisited '1', we increment our island count.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M x N) where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns. Each cell is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M x N) due to the recursive stack in DFS or the queue in BFS and also potentially the `visited` array, though we can optimize by marking cells directly in the input grid.

Here's the implementation in Python using the DFS approach:

### Code

```python
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0

    def dfs(grid, r, c):
        rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or grid[r][c] == '0':
            return
        # Mark this cell as '0' to indicate it's visited
        grid[r][c] = '0'
        # Perform DFS in all 4 directions
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c)
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c)
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1)
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1)

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    island_count = 0

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == '1':
                island_count += 1
                dfs(grid, r, c)

    return island_count
```

### Edge Cases Considered:
- An empty grid or a grid with no '1's at all.
- A grid with only one row or one column.
- Grids where islands are touching each other only diagonally, which shouldn't be counted as a single island.

Is there anything specific you'd like to adjust or any other part you'd like to focus on?
