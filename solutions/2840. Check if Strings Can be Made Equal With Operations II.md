title:  Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II-out
permalink: /s2840
---

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length consisting of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can choose any index `i` (1 <= i < s1.length) and swap the characters `s1[i]` and `s1[i-1]`, or you can swap the characters `s2[i]` and `s2[i-1]`. You need to determine if you can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal using any number of operations (possibly zero).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the string length:** What are the constraints on the length of the strings?
    - Typically, Leetcode problems have constraints specified in the problem statement. Let's assume the lengths can be up to \(10^5\).

2. **Character set:** Can the strings have any characters other than lowercase letters?
    - The problem specifies that the strings consist of lowercase letters only.

3. **Edge cases:** Are the strings always non-empty, and is their length always the same?
    - According to the problem, the strings are of equal length, and we assume they are non-empty.

### Strategy

To determine if we can make `s1` and `s2` equal using the allowed operations, observe the following:

- Swapping any two adjacent characters multiple times allows reordering within subsequences of identically positioned characters.
- Essentially, we need to ensure that both `s1` and `s2` can be permuted into the same sequence of characters.

**Approach:**
1. **Counting Characters:** If two strings have the same set of characters with the same frequencies, they can be made identical by internal reordering.
2. **Sorting:** Another straightforward way is to sort both strings and check if the sorted versions are equal.

### Time Complexity

- Counting character frequencies involves a single pass through each string, which is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings.
- Sorting both strings takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.

Since counting frequencies is typically faster, we will use this approach.

### Code

Let's implement the solution to check if we can make the strings `s1` and `s2` equal.

```python
def can_be_equal(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Using Counter to count character frequencies
    count1 = Counter(s1)
    count2 = Counter(s2)
    
    # Check if both counters are equal
    return count1 == count2

# Example usage:
s1 = "abc"
s2 = "bca"
print(can_be_equal(s1, s2))  # Output: True
```

### Explanation

1. **Import Counter:** We use the `Counter` collection to count the frequency of each character in `s1` and `s2`.
2. **Compare Counters:** We compare the two counters. If they are identical, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in collections for concise and readable code.
