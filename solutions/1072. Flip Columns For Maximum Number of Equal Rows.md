The problem "Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows" asks us to determine the maximum number of rows in a binary matrix that can be made identical by flipping some columns any number of times. 

**Problem Statement in Detail:**
Given a binary matrix, you are allowed to flip columns any number of times. A flip means changing `0` to `1` and `1` to `0` in the entire column. Your task is to maximize the number of rows that are exactly the same after performing any number of column flips.

### Example:
1. Input: `matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]`
   Output: 2

2. Input: `matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]`
   Output: 1

### Constraints:
- The number of rows and columns in the matrix is not limited but is manageable to handle with decent time complexity algorithms.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can rows be flipped, or only columns?
   - Only columns can be flipped.
2. Is there any constraint on the shape of the binary matrix?
   - The matrix can be any M x N size.
3. Does the matrix only contain binary values (0 and 1)?
   - Yes, the matrix contains only binary values: 0 and 1.

## Strategy
1. **Understanding Flips**: Flipping a column essentially inverts all bits in that column. For a row to be considered identical to another row after some flips, they should be transformable into each other by flipping columns.
2. **Observation**: Two rows are considered identical after some flips if one can be converted into the other by flipping some columns. This means one row should either be equal to another or be equal to the complement (inverse) of another.
3. **Canonical Form**: Each row can be turned into a canonical form, regardless of whether we flip columns or not. Rather than flipping every column and comparing the results, we use the pattern in the row.
4. **Using Dictionary**: We can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each row (or its complement) pattern.

Steps:
- Convert each row to its canonical form (either the row itself or its complement, whichever is the lexicographically smaller).
- Maintain a count of these canonical forms.
- The maximum count of any canonical form is our answer.

Here's how the solution can be implemented:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def maxEqualRowsAfterFlips(matrix):
    def canonical(row):
        # Generate canonical form for the row
        # The canonical form of a row is the smaller between the row itself and its complement.
        return tuple(min(row, [1 - x for x in row]))

    patterns = defaultdict(int)
    
    for row in matrix:
        patterns[canonical(row)] += 1
    
    return max(patterns.values())

# Example test cases
print(maxEqualRowsAfterFlips([[0,1],[1,0]]))  # Output: 2
print(maxEqualRowsAfterFlips([[0,1],[1,1]]))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Canonical Function**: Converting a row to its canonical form takes O(n) where n is the number of columns.
- **Dictionary Update**: Updating the count of canonical forms involves O(m), where m is the number of rows.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n), which is efficient for reasonable sizes of m and n.

By counting the most frequent canonical pattern, we find the maximum number of rows that can be made identical.
