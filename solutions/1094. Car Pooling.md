You are driving a vehicle that has `capacity` empty seats initially available for passengers. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west). Given a list of `trips`, where `trip[i] = [numPassengers, from, to]` indicates that the `i-th` trip has `numPassengers` passengers and they must be picked up at `from` and dropped off at `to`. Both `from` and `to` are locations in kilometers measured from your initial starting point.

Return `True` if and only if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips within the capacity constraints.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `numPassengers`, `from`, and `to` be negative?**
    - No, these values are always non-negative.

2. **Are the `from` and `to` distances guaranteed to be integers?**
    - Yes, they are specified to be integers.

3. **Is there a maximum limit for the number of trips or the distance?**
    - The constraints typically specify maximum limits. For example, the number of trips can be up to 1000, and the locations can be up to 1000 km apart. However, we should look at the specific problem constraints on LeetCode.

4. **Can the `from` and `to` be the same for any trip?**
    - Typically, `from` would be less than `to` as the vehicle is only moving east.

Let’s proceed with devising the strategy for solving this problem.

### Strategy

1. **Event Sorting:**
    - We will create events for each trip where an event is either picking up passengers or dropping them off.
    - For each trip `[numPassengers, from, to]`, create two events:
        - (from, +numPassengers) for picking up passengers
        - (to, -numPassengers) for dropping off passengers.

2. **Sweep Line Algorithm:**
    - Sort the events first by the location, and if two events have the same location, sort by the type of event (drop-off before pick-up).
    - Use a sweep line approach to process each event to track the number of passengers in the vehicle.
    - Maintain a running total of passengers and ensure it does not exceed the given capacity at any point.

3. **Time Complexity:**
    - The time complexity will be dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`, where n is the number of events (2 events per trip).

### Code

```python
def carPooling(trips, capacity):
    events = []
    
    for numPassengers, start, end in trips:
        events.append((start, numPassengers))
        events.append((end, -numPassengers))
        
    # Sort events by location, prioritize drop-off (-numPassengers) before pick-up (+numPassengers)
    events.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    current_passengers = 0
    
    for event in events:
        location, passenger_change = event
        current_passengers += passenger_change
        
        if current_passengers > capacity:
            return False
            
    return True

# Example usage:
trips = [[2, 1, 5], [3, 3, 7], [4, 2, 6]]
capacity = 4
print(carPooling(trips, capacity))  # Output: False (Explanation: At location 3, we would have 7 passengers)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of events (which is 2 times the number of trips).
- **Processing Events:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of events.
- Overall time complexity: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

This approach ensures that the vehicle’s passenger capacity is never exceeded at any given time, thereby determining if the trip plan is feasible.
