title:  House Robber II-out

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle, which means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, so it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
   - What are the constraints on the values within `nums`?
     - `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
   
2. **Output**:
   - We need to return a single integer representing the maximum amount of money that can be robbed.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - What if there's only one house?
     - We simply rob that house since there's no other house.
   - What if there are two houses?
     - We rob the house with the maximum money since robbing both would alert the police.

## Strategy

1. The problem is similar to the "House Robber I" problem, but with the added complexity of houses being in a circle. This means the first and last houses are adjacent.
2. To handle this circular nature, we can simplify the problem by breaking it into two linear "House Robber I" problems:
   - Rob houses from the first to the second-last.
   - Rob houses from the second to the last.
3. The maximum of the above two scenarios will be our result.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def rob(nums):
    def rob_linear(houses):
        n = len(houses)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return houses[0]
        if n == 2:
            return max(houses)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = houses[0]
        dp[1] = max(houses[0], houses[1])
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + houses[i])
        return dp[-1]

    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return nums[0]
    if n == 2:
        return max(nums)
    
    return max(rob_linear(nums[:-1]), rob_linear(nums[1:]))

# Example usage
print(rob([2, 3, 2]))    # Output: 3
print(rob([1, 2, 3, 1])) # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- Let's denote the length of the list as `n`.
- Our approach essentially runs the `House Robber I` dynamic programming solution twice, each on a sub-list of at most length `n-1`.
- Hence, the time complexity is `O(n)`, as we are performing a linear pass through the input twice.
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the use of the DP array in the `rob_linear` function.
