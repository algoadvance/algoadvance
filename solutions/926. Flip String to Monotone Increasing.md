title:  Flip String to Monotone Increasing-out
permalink: /s926
---
A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of 0's (possibly none), followed by some number of 1's (also possibly none). You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` (changing `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`) as many times as you wish.

Return the minimum number of flips needed to make `s` monotone increasing.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** 
    - What is the length range for the input string `s`? (Typically, constraints are given but let’s assume it can be from 1 to 100,000 characters for a broader perspective).

2. **Definition Clarification:**
    - What does flipping mean precisely? 
    - Flipping `s[i]` means changing a `0` to `1` or a `1` to `0`.

3. **Output:**
    - Should the function return an integer indicating the minimum number of flips required?
    - Yes, the function should return an integer.

### Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Use prefix sums to keep track of the number of `1`s encountered up to each position.

2. **Suffix Calculation:**
   - Use suffix sums to track the number of `0`s from each position to the end of the string.

3. **Calculate Flips for Each Possible Division Point:**
   - For each possible division point `i`, calculate the number of flips needed if everything before `i` has to be `0` and everything from `i` onwards has to be `1`.

4. **Optimize Flips Calculation:**
   - Iterate through possible division points and keep track of the minimum number of flips needed.

### Code Implementation
Here’s how we can implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def minFlipsMonoIncr(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    # Prefix sum to count the number of 1's up to each position
    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '1' else 0)
        
    # Suffix sum to count the number of 0's from each position to the end
    suffix_zeros = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suffix_zeros[i] = suffix_zeros[i + 1] + (1 if s[i] == '0' else 0)
    
    min_flips = float('inf')
    for i in range(n + 1):
        # If we make a split at i, all characters before i should be 0 and all characters from i onwards should be 1.
        flips = prefix_ones[i] + suffix_zeros[i]
        min_flips = min(min_flips, flips)
        
    return min_flips

# Example Usage
s = "00110"
print(minFlipsMonoIncr(s))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`:
- Constructing the `prefix_ones` array takes `O(n)`.
- Constructing the `suffix_zeros` array takes `O(n)`.
- Iterating through the string to calculate the minimum flips also takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is linear, i.e., `O(n)`.
