Given an integer `n`, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator of the fraction is less than or equal to `n`. Simplified fractions are fractions that are in their simplest form where the numerator and denominator are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of inputs:**
   - What is the range of `n`? (Typical coding problems will have constraints such as `1 <= n <= 100`)
   
2. **Output format:**
   - Should the fractions be returned as strings in the "numerator/denominator" format?

Assuming standard constraints and output requirements are as implied above.

## Strategy

1. **Loop through Denominators:** 
   - Loop through each potential denominator `d` from 2 to `n` (since we cannot have 1 as a denominator).

2. **Loop through Numerators:**
   - For each denominator `d`, loop through numerators `num` from 1 to `d-1`.
   
3. **Check for Simplified Fractions:**
   - Use the `math.gcd` function to check if `num` and `d` are coprime (i.e., gcd(num, d) == 1).

4. **Store and Return:**
   - If they are coprime, append the fraction in the form of a string "num/d" to the results list.

5. **Return the Results:**
   - Return the sorted list of fractions.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of nested loops depends on `n`. The outer loop runs `n-1` times (for each potential denominator). The inner loop runs `d-1` times (for each numerator up to `d-1`).
- Additionally, computing GCD takes `O(log(min(a, b)))` time.
- Overall Complexity: `O(n^2 * log(n))`.

## Code

```python
from math import gcd

def simplifiedFractions(n):
    results = []
    for denominator in range(2, n + 1):
        for numerator in range(1, denominator):
            if gcd(numerator, denominator) == 1:
                results.append(f"{numerator}/{denominator}")
    
    return results
```

## Example Usage

```python
print(simplifiedFractions(2))  # Output: ["1/2"]
print(simplifiedFractions(3))  # Output: ["1/2", "1/3", "2/3"]
print(simplifiedFractions(4))  # Output: ["1/2", "1/3", "2/3", "1/4", "3/4"]
```

This approach ensures we only include fractions in their simplest form and covers all potential fractions with denominators up to `n`.
