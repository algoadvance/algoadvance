title:  Concatenated Words-out

Given an array of strings `words` (without duplicates), return all the **concatenated words** in the given list of `words`.

A **concatenated word** is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

### Example
```python
Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats", "dog"; "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog", and "cat".
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of the list `words`?
   - What is the range of the length of each word in `words`?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be in any specific order, or does the order not matter?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Do we need to handle cases where no concatenated words are found?
   - What should be returned if the input list is empty?

## Strategy
1. **Word Set:**
   - Use a set to store all the words for quick lookups.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - For each word, use dynamic programming to check if it can be formed by other words.
   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` is `True` if the substring `word[:i]` can be formed by other words in the set.

3. **DP Initialization:**
   - `dp[0]` is `True` because an empty string is always formable.

4. **DP Transition:**
   - For each index `i`, check all possible splits `j` and update `dp[i]` based on whether `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `word[j:i]` is in the set.

5. **Check and Store:**
   - If a word can be formed by other words, store it in the result list.

6. **Time Complexity:**
   - The worst-case time complexity is `O(n * m^2)`, where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the maximum length of a word. This is because we need to check each word against all possible splits.

## Code
```python
def findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(words):
    word_set = set(words)
    concatenated_words = []

    def is_concatenated(word):
        if word in word_set:
            word_set.remove(word)
        
        n = len(word)
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i):
                if dp[j] and word[j:i] in word_set:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        if word in words:
            word_set.add(word)
        
        return dp[n]
    
    for word in words:
        if is_concatenated(word):
            concatenated_words.append(word)
    
    return concatenated_words

# Example usage
words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
print(findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(words))  # Output: ["catsdogcats", "dogcatsdog", "ratcatdogcat"]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization and Set Operations:** Inserting all words into a set takes `O(n)`.
- **DP Array Creation:** For each word (outer loop runs `n` times), we have an inner loop that can run up to `m^2` times in the worst case, giving `O(n * m^2)` for the DP transitions.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * m^2)`.
