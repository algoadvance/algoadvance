title:  Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K-out
permalink: /s2447
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a subarray is the largest positive integer that evenly divides all the elements of that subarray. Return the number of subarrays of `nums` where the GCD of the subarray is equal to `k`.

### Example
- Input: `nums = [9, 3, 1, 2, 6, 3]`, `k = 3`
- Output: `4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:** 
   - What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`?
   - Can `nums` contain negative numbers or zero?

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - How are we calculating the GCD in Python? (Assume we can use `math.gcd` function).

3. **Subarray Size:**
   - Are we interested in non-empty subarrays only? (Yes)

### Strategy
1. **Brute-Force Approach:** 
   - Iterate through all possible subarrays.
   - Compute the GCD of each subarray.
   - Count the subarrays where the GCD equals `k`.

2. **Optimized Brute-Force Approach:**
   - Start from each element and extend the subarray until the GCD is no longer `k`.

### Code
Let's implement the optimized brute-force approach using Python:

```python
import math

def subarrayGCD(nums, k):
    def find_gcd(x, y):
        while y != 0:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return abs(x)
    
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        curr_gcd = nums[i]
        for j in range(i, n):
            curr_gcd = find_gcd(curr_gcd, nums[j])
            if curr_gcd == k:
                count += 1
            elif curr_gcd < k:
                break
    
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [9, 3, 1, 2, 6, 3]
k = 3
print(subarrayGCD(nums, k))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **Brute-force approach:** O(n^3) in worst case (calculating GCD from scratch for every subarray).
- **Optimized approach:** O(n^2) since we are calculating GCD for every pair but carrying forward the GCD value which reduces repetitive calculations.

### Explanation:
- **Outer Loop:** Iterates through each starting index of the subarray.
- **Inner Loop:** Extends the subarray to include subsequent elements and calculates the GCD on the fly.
- **Break Condition:** If the GCD falls below `k`, we stop extending the current subarray since further elements cannot increase the GCD back to `k`.

Using this optimized brute-force approach ensures better performance while maintaining clarity and correctness in the GCD computation for subarrays.
