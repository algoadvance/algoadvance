title:  Minimum Replacements to Sort the Array-out
permalink: /s2366
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can replace any element of the array with any two elements that sum to it.

- For example, consider `nums = [5,6,7]`. In one operation, we can replace `5` with `2` and `3`, or `6` with `1` and `5`, etc.
  
Your goal is to sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order using the minimum number of operations.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to sort the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range and size of the nums array:** 
   - What is the maximum length of `nums`?
   - Is there an upper or lower limit on the values within `nums`?

2. **Operations:**
   - Can elements only be decomposed into exactly two elements, or can it be done multiple times?

3. **Constraints:**
   - Are there any specific constraints we should be aware of that could help optimize the solution?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. We will utilize a greedy approach, starting from the end of the array and working backward, attempting to decompose elements in a way that will aid in sorting the array efficiently.

**Steps:**

1. Traverse the array from the second-last element to the first.
2. For each element, ensure that it does not violate the non-decreasing order condition in relation to the next element.
3. If the current element is greater than the next, decompose it into two elements in the most efficient way possible to maintain the sorted order.
4. Keep track of the number of replacements (operations) performed to ensure the sort order is maintained.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in Python:

```python
def minimum_replacements(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the number of replacements
    replacements = 0
    
    # Start from the second last element and move backward
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            # Calculate the necessary parts
            parts = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1] - 1) // nums[i + 1]
            # Add the number of new elements created (parts - 1)
            replacements += (parts - 1)
            # Update the current element as the maximum it can be
            nums[i] = nums[i] // parts
    
    return replacements

# Example usage:
print(minimum_replacements([5,6,7]))  # Output will depend on the input array.
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm performs a single traversal of the array, which gives it a **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space besides the input array.

This approach ensures we minimally break down elements to achieve a sorted array with the least number of operations required.
