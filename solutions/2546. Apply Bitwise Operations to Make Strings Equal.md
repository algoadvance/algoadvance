title:  Apply Bitwise Operations to Make Strings Equal-out
permalink: /s2546
---

You are given two binary strings `s` and `target` of the same length. You are allowed to do the following operations on the string `s` any number of times:

1. Choose two different indices `i` and `j` (0 <= i, j < s.length).
2. Apply bitwise `AND` or `OR` on the characters `s[i]` and `s[j]`, then update `s[i]` to the result of the operation.

Return `true` if you can make the string `s` equal to the string `target`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What operations can be performed on `s`?**
   - The bitwise `AND` and `OR` operations.

2. **Can `s` and `target` have different lengths?**
   - No, they are always the same length.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - Return `true` if `s` can be made equal to `target` using the allowed operations; otherwise, return `false`.

4. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `target`?**
   - Standard constraints apply. The length of `s` and `target` can be reasonably large, up to 1000 characters or more.

### Code

```python
def makeStringsEqual(s: str, target: str) -> bool:
    if set(target) == set(["0"]):
        return set(s) == set(["0"])
    return "1" in s

# Example usage:
print(makeStringsEqual("110", "101"))  # True
print(makeStringsEqual("000", "111"))  # False
print(makeStringsEqual("1010", "1100"))  # True
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observation:**
   - You can change the characters in `s` by applying bitwise `AND` and `OR` on any pairs of indices.
   - Important note: if there is a '1' anywhere in `s`, it is always possible to generate '1' elsewhere since `1 OR 0 = 1` and `1 OR 1 = 1`.

2. **Necessary and Sufficient Condition:**
   - To turn all characters into '0', the entire `target` must already be '0', and starting `s` must also be all '0'.
   - To include '1' somewhere in `target`, it is sufficient to have at least one '1' in `s`; we can propagate this '1' to necessary positions using OR operations.

3. **Algorithm Outline:**
   - If `target` is all '0', verify that `s` is also all '0'.
   - Otherwise, as long as `s` contains at least one '1', we can transform `s` to match `target`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is required to scan both strings once to check if they meet the above conditions.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to input size.

This solution efficiently checks the conditions necessary for transforming `s` to `target` using the allowed operations.
