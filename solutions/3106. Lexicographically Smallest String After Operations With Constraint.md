title:  Lexicographically Smallest String After Operations With Constraint-out
permalink: /s3106
---

You are given a string `s` and you can perform two types of operations on the string:
1. **Add**: Choose an index `i` and move each character from position `i` to the end of the string to the end of the string.
2. **Rotate**: Move the first character of the string to its end.

More formally:
1. For **Add**: Move all characters starting from index `i` to end of the string `s` to the front of the string `s`.
2. For **Rotate**: Replace `s` with `s[1:] + s[0]`.

Your task is to return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by performing any number of these operations.

Constraints:
- The length of `s` will be between `1` and `100`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the operations be performed in any order and any number of times?
   - Yes, both operations can be performed in any order and as many times as needed.

2. Is there any specific constraint on the string's character set?
   - No, the string `s` will consist of lowercase letters only.

### Strategy:

To solve the problem, we need to explore all possible string transformations and return the lexicographically smallest string. This can be approached by considering both operations (Add and Rotate) to generate the new strings.

Steps to solve the problem:
1. **Perform Add Operation**: Generate all possible strings we can get by moving a suffix to the beginning.
2. **Perform Rotate Operation**: Generate all possible strings by rotating the string.

Given the constraints (maximum length 100), a brute-force search of all states can be managed. Using a priority queue (min-heap) with BFS will help ensure we always process the lexicographically smallest string first.

### Time Complexity:
- Performing each operation is `O(n)`.
- Since there are `n` possible configurations for Add and `n` for Rotate, the complexity could go to `O(n^2)`, but given the constraints, this should be manageable.

### Code:

```python
from collections import deque

def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(s: str) -> str:
    seen = set()
    queue = deque([s])
    smallest = s

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        # Try all possible rotate operations
        for i in range(len(current)):
            rotated = current[i:] + current[:i]
            if rotated not in seen:
                seen.add(rotated)
                queue.append(rotated)
                if rotated < smallest:
                    smallest = rotated
        
        # Try all possible add operations
        for i in range(1, len(current)):
            added = current[i:] + current[:i]
            if added not in seen:
                seen.add(added)
                queue.append(added)
                if added < smallest:
                    smallest = added

    return smallest

# Test
print(find_lexicographically_smallest_string("cba"))  # Expected output is "acb"
print(find_lexicographically_smallest_string("ba"))   # Expected output is "ab"
```

In this solution, we initialize a queue for BFS and track all seen configurations to avoid reprocessing the same string states. We then process each string by trying all possible "Add" and "Rotate" operations, updating the lexicographically smallest string along the way.

By systematically exploring all possible transformations, we can ensure that we find the smallest lexicographical string possible.
