title:  Range Product Queries of Powers-out
permalink: /s2438
---

You are given a positive integer `n` represented as `2` raised to the power of some positive integer, i.e., `n = 2^k` for some positive integer `k`. You want to answer several queries about this number.

Each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`, where `l` and `r` denote indices in the range `[0, k]`. Your task is to determine the product of the powers `2^l * 2^(l+1) * ... * 2^r`.

Given `n` as `2^k` and queries as a list of tuples, return a list of the results for each query, where each result is the product modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example

If `n = 2^3`:

- For query `(0, 2)`, the product is `2^0 * 2^1 * 2^2 = 1 * 2 * 4 = 8`.
- For query `(1, 3)`, the product is `2^1 * 2^2 * 2^3 = 2 * 4 * 8 = 64`.

Given queries `[(0, 2), (1, 3)]`, the output should be `[8, 64]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the upper bound of `k`?**
   The upper bound for `k` will help in understanding the potential size of our calculations.
2. **Are there constraints on the number of queries and their values?**
   This affects how efficiently the algorithm needs to be designed.

## Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can leverage the properties of exponents:

- The product of `2^l, 2^(l+1), ..., 2^r` can be written as `2^(l + (l+1) + ... + r)`.
- The sum `(l + (l+1) + ... + r)` is an arithmetic series which can be solved using the formula `sum = r*(r+1)/2 - l*(l-1)/2`.

Given this, our plan is to:

1. Iterate through each query `(l, r)`.
2. Use the arithmetic series sum formula to determine the exponent sum.
3. Use modular exponentiation to compute the high powers of two under modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```python
def rangeProductQueries(n, queries):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    def computePowerExponent(l, r):
        # Sum of series from l to r
        sum_exponents = (r * (r + 1) // 2) - (l * (l - 1) // 2)
        return sum_exponents
    
    def mod_exp(base, exp, mod):
        result = 1
        while exp > 0:
            if exp % 2 == 1:
                result = (result * base) % mod
            base = (base * base) % mod
            exp //= 2
        return result
    
    results = []
    for l, r in queries:
        exp_sum = computePowerExponent(l, r)
        result = mod_exp(2, exp_sum, MOD)
        results.append(result)
    
    return results

# Example usage
n = 2**3
queries = [(0, 2), (1, 3)]
print(rangeProductQueries(n, queries))  # Output should be [8, 64]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing:** There is no preprocessing step for this problem.
- **Query Processing:**
  - Computation of exponents using arithmetic sum formula: `O(1)`
  - Modular exponentiation for result computation: `O(log(E))` where `E` is the exponent.

For each query, the overall time complexity is `O(log(E))`. Given that `E` is the total sum of exponents which might become large, the logarithmic factor ensures that the approach is efficient.

For `q` queries, the overall complexity is `O(q * log(E))`, making it suitable for a large number of queries.
