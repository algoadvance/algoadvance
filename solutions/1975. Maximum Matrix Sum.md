title:  Maximum Matrix Sum-out
permalink: /s1975
---

You are given an n x n matrix `matrix` consisting of non-zero integers. You can perform any of the following operations any number of times:

1. Choose any two *adjacent* elements (elements that share a common edge) and multiply each of them by `-1`.

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix's elements after applying the above operation any number of times. Return the maximum possible sum of the matrix's elements.

Example:

```python
matrix = [
  [1, -1],
  [-1, 1]
]
```
Output: `4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the matrix elements non-zero integers?**
   - Yes, all elements are non-zero.

2. **Can the size of the matrix be any positive integer?**
   - Yes, `n` can be any positive integer.

3. **Do we have any constraints on the size of `n`?**
   - The matrix size, `n x n`, is typically within the limits of 1 <= `n` <= 10^3.

4. **Is there a guarantee that the sum of the matrix elements can always be maximized by flipping the elements?**
   - Yes, and we need to figure out the optimal number of flips needed to achieve that.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Negative Numbers**: We want to identify if the matrix has an even or odd number of negative numbers. This is because multiplying two negative numbers will turn them positive.

2. **Flipping Strategy**:
    - If the number of negative elements is even, we can flip them all to make them positive.
    - If the number of negative elements is odd, the sum can be maximized by making all but one of the negative elements positive. The one remaining negative element will be the smallest in absolute value to minimize the impact on the sum.

3. **Calculate the Sum**:
    - Compute the sum of the absolute values of all elements. This will give the maximum possible sum if we pretend all numbers were positive.
    - If the count of negative numbers is odd, subtract twice the smallest absolute value from the sum calculated above (since one element will remain negative).

## Code

```python
def maxMatrixSum(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    total_sum = 0
    num_negatives = 0
    min_abs_value = float('inf')

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            value = matrix[i][j]
            total_sum += abs(value)
            if value < 0:
                num_negatives += 1
            min_abs_value = min(min_abs_value, abs(value))

    # If the number of negative elements is even, we can flip them all
    # If itâ€™s odd, one element will remain negative
    if num_negatives % 2 == 0:
        return total_sum
    else:
        return total_sum - 2 * min_abs_value

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, -1],
    [-1, 1]
]
print(maxMatrixSum(matrix))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n^2) because we need to iterate through each element in the `n x n` matrix exactly once to compute the total sum, count negative numbers, and find the minimum absolute value. The solution operates efficiently within the typical constraints for `n`.
