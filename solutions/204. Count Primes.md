title:  Count Primes-out
permalink: /s204
---
Given an integer `n`, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range:** What is the expected range of the input `n`?
   - Generally, `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^6` based on typical constraints.

2. **Edge Case Checks:**
   - What should be the result if `n <= 2`?
     - Since there are no primes less than 2, it should return 0 for `n <= 2`.

3. **Performance:**
   - Is there a strict performance requirement?
     - Yes, solutions that iterate and check each number individually will be too slow for large `n`.

## Strategy
To count prime numbers less than `n`, an efficient algorithm is needed: the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm:
1. Create a boolean array `is_prime` of size `n` and initialize all entries to `True`. This array indicates whether each number is a prime.
2. Set `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` to `False` since 0 and 1 are not primes.
3. For each integer `p` starting from 2, if `p` is a prime, mark all multiples of `p` as `False` (not prime).
4. Continue the process until `p^2 >= n`.
5. The count of `True` values in `is_prime` array will give the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Code

```python
def countPrimes(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 2:
        return 0

    # Initialize a list to track prime numbers
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers

    # Apply Sieve of Eratosthenes
    p = 2
    while p * p < n:
        if is_prime[p]:
            # Mark all multiples of p as False
            for multiple in range(p * p, n, p):
                is_prime[multiple] = False
        p += 1

    # Count all prime numbers
    return sum(is_prime)

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(countPrimes(n))  # Output is 4 (primes: 2, 3, 5, 7)
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is \(O(n \log \log n)\). This results from the fact that each number is marked as not prime a proportional number of times due to its multiples.
- The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the storage required for the `is_prime` array.

This algorithm efficiently counts the number of primes less than a given number `n` in an optimal manner for large inputs.
