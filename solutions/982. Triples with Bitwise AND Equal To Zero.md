Given an array of integers, find the number of triples `(i, j, k)` such that `(arr[i] & arr[j] & arr[k]) == 0` where `&` represents the bitwise AND operator.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What are the constraints on the size of the array, i.e., the maximum length of the array and range of array elements?
   - **Answer:** The typical constraints for such array problems are:
     - The length of the array (`n`) can be up to `10^3`.
     - The array elements (`arr[i]`) are within the range `[0, 2^16-1]` (i.e., they are 16-bit integers).
   
2. **Output:** Are there any specific requirements related to the output format?
   - **Answer:** The output should be a single integer representing the count of such triples.

## Strategy

Given the constraints, a brute-force approach attempting to check all possible triples might be too slow since it would have a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\).

### Optimized Strategy

To optimize the solution:
1. **Advanced Counting:** Utilize a dictionary to store and manage frequencies of pairwise results and consequently reduce the overall redundant calculations.
2. **Pairs AND Results:** Compute the possible results of `arr[i] & arr[j]` for all pairs in the array and store the frequencies of these results.
3. **Triples Check:** For each element in the array, check how many pairsâ€™ AND results, when AND-ed with this element, yield `0`.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a dictionary `pairwise_and_counts` to record the count of each unique `(arr[i] & arr[j])` result.
2. Calculate the pairwise `arr[i] & arr[j]` for all pairs `(i, j)` and update `pairwise_and_counts`.
3. Iterate over the array again, and for each element `arr[k]`, sum up the counts of `pairwise_and` results that, when AND-ed with `arr[k]`, equal `0`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach should be analyzed:
- Initial pairwise computation and storing: \(O(n^2)\)
- Iterating to check the condition for every third element: \(O(n \times (\text{pairwise_check complexity}))\)

Thus, the overall time complexity should be approximately \(O(n^2 + n^2) = O(n^2)\), which is feasible for `n` up to `1000`.

## Python Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def countTriplets(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    pairwise_and_counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Step 1: Calculate pairwise AND results and their counts
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            pairwise_and_result = arr[i] & arr[j]
            pairwise_and_counts[pairwise_and_result] += 1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of triples with AND result 0
    triples_count = 0
    for k in range(n):
        for pairwise_and_result, count in pairwise_and_counts.items():
            if (pairwise_and_result & arr[k]) == 0:
                triples_count += count
    
    return triples_count

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 1, 3]  # Example input
print(countTriplets(arr))  # Expected output: 12 given an appropriate problem example
```

This code efficiently counts the number of triples `(i, j, k)` such that `(arr[i] & arr[j] & arr[k]) == 0` using a dictionary to store intermediate results of pairwise AND computations.
