title:  Maximum Good People Based on Statements-out
permalink: /s2151
---
You are given an array of `n` statements, where the `i-th` element of `statements` is an array of integers denoting the ith person's statements about each of the `n` people (including themselves). `statements[i][j]` can be:
- 0: ith person claims jth person is not good.
- 1: ith person claims jth person is good.
- 2: ith person does not make any statements about jth person.

Return the maximum number of people who can be good based on the statements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the statements always consistent?**
   - No, the statements may not be consistent. This is why we need to find the maximum number of good people that can align with any subset of the statements.
   
2. **Can there be conflicting statements?**
   - Yes, one person might claim another is good while they claim they are not. This is why we need to evaluate the maximum number of good people possible given the constraints.

3. **Does the order of the people matter in the output?**
   - No, we just need the maximum count of good people.

4. **Is it possible for all to be bad or none to be good?**
   - Depending on the statements, yes, it's possible that no one can be consistently deemed as good, resulting in a 0 count.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. We'll utilize bit masking to represent all possible combinations of good and bad people.
2. For a combination to be valid, all statements made by people marked good must be consistent:
   - If person `i` is considered good and they say `j` is good, then `j` must also be good in that combination.
   - If person `i` is considered good and they say `j` is bad, then `j` must also be bad.
3. We check all valid combinations and track the one with the most number of good people.

### Code
Here's the Python solution implementing the above strategy:

```python
from typing import List

def maximumGood(statements: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(statements)
    
    def is_valid(mask):
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):  # person i is good
                for j in range(n):
                    if statements[i][j] == 1 and not (mask & (1 << j)):  # should be good but is not
                        return False
                    if statements[i][j] == 0 and (mask & (1 << j)):  # should be bad but is not
                        return False
        return True

    max_good_count = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        if is_valid(mask):
            max_good_count = max(max_good_count, bin(mask).count('1'))
    
    return max_good_count

# Example usage:
statements = [
    [2,1,2],
    [1,2,2],
    [2,0,2]
]
print(maximumGood(statements))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- There are `2^n` possible subsets of people being good or bad.
- For each subset, we need to verify the statements which take `O(n^2)` time.
- Hence, the total time complexity is `O(n^2 * 2^n)`.

This is a feasible solution considering the constraints of typical interview problems where `n` is usually small (like `n <= 15`).
