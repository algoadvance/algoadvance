title:  Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome-out
permalink: /s2193
---
Given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters, you need to transform it into a palindrome with the minimum number of character moves. In one move, you can swap any two adjacent characters in the string. Return the minimum number of moves needed to make the string a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length of the string `s`?
   - Is the string guaranteed to consist only of lowercase letters?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - What should be returned? The number of moves, correct?

If these assumptions hold:
- Length of the string is between 1 and 1000.
- The string consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, the goal is to iteratively make swaps such that the characters at the mirrored positions from the center of the string are the same, hence forming a palindrome:

1. Use two pointers, `left` starting from the beginning and `right` starting from the end of the string.
2. For each pair of characters `(s[left], s[right])`:
    - If they are the same, move both pointers inward.
    - If they are different, we need to find a swap sequence that brings the required character in place:
        - Search from the right end towards `left` to find the character that matches `s[left]`. Perform adjacent swaps to bring this character to `right` or vice-versa.
        - Each adjacent swap involves incrementing a move counter.
3. Repeat the process until the entire string is a palindrome.

### Code

Here's the Python code for this approach:

```python
def min_moves_to_make_palindrome(s: str) -> int:
    s = list(s)
    moves = 0
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if s[left] == s[right]:
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        else:
            l = left
            r = right
            while s[l] != s[r]:
                r -= 1
            if l == r:  # single character case
                s[l], s[l+1] = s[l+1], s[l]
                moves += 1
            else:
                for i in range(r, right):
                    s[i], s[i+1] = s[i+1], s[i]
                    moves += 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
    
    return moves

# Example usage
print(min_moves_to_make_palindrome("aabb"))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
The overall time complexity can be analyzed as follows:
- Each character in the string will be processed at most once by the left and right pointers.
- In the worst case, for each character, we may need to scan through half of the string to find its matching character, which makes the time complexity approximately `O(N^2)` where `N` is the length of the string.

Thus, the solution has a time complexity of `O(N^2)`, which should be efficient enough for `N` up to 1000.
