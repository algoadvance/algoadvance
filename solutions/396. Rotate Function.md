title:  Rotate Function-out
permalink: /s396
---

Given an array `nums` of length `n`, we define a rotation function `F` on `nums` as follows:

`F(k) = 0 * nums[k] + 1 * nums[k+1] + 2 * nums[k+2] + ... + (n-1) * nums[k+n-1]`

where `k` is an index in the array. `k+n-1` is calculated modulo `n` to ensure that it wraps around the array.

Return the maximum value of `F(k)` for `k` in the range 0 to `n-1`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 6]
Output: 26
Explanation:
F(0) = 0*4 + 1*3 + 2*2 + 3*6 = 26
F(1) = 0*6 + 1*4 + 2*3 + 3*2 = 25
F(2) = 0*2 + 1*6 + 2*4 + 3*3 = 24
F(3) = 0*3 + 1*2 + 2*6 + 3*4 = 23
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the input `nums` is empty?**
   - Typically, for an empty array, the function should return 0 or it could be undefined.

2. **Are the elements of the array `nums` always integers?**
   - Yes, `nums` is an array of integers.

3. **Is there any range constraint on the elements of `nums`?**
   - Usually, there are constraints, but assume typical integer constraints (-10^7 to 10^7).

## Strategy
1. **Initial Calculation:**
   - Compute the sum of the array `S`.
   - Compute the initial value `F(0)`.

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - Use the relationship between `F(k)` and `F(k-1)` to compute the values in O(1) time.
   - The relationship can be derived from the definition of `F(k)`:
     ```
     F(k) = F(k-1) + S - n * nums[n-k]
     ```
   - This allows us to update the value of `F` efficiently for each step.

3. **Max Value Search:**
   - Iterate over the computed `F` values to find the maximum.

## Code

Here is a Python implementation of the optimized solution:

```python
def maxRotateFunction(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    n = len(nums)
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # Initial F(0) computation
    F_0 = sum(i * nums[i] for i in range(n))
    
    max_value = F_0
    current_value = F_0
    
    # Compute F(k) for k from 1 to n-1
    for k in range(1, n):
        current_value = current_value + total_sum - n * nums[-k]
        max_value = max(max_value, current_value)
    
    return max_value

# Example usage:
nums = [4, 3, 2, 6]
print(maxRotateFunction(nums))  # Output: 26
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (O(n)):** Calculating the sum of the array and the initial function `F(0)`.
- **Iteration (O(n)):** Updating the function value for all rotations using the recurrence relation.

The total time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**. The memory complexity is **O(1)**, aside from the input storage, as we only use a fixed amount of additional space.
