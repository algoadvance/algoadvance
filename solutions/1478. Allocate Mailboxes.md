title:  Allocate Mailboxes-out
permalink: /s1478
---

We are given an array `houses` representing the positions of houses on a straight line and an integer `k` representing the number of mailboxes to be allocated. We want to allocate the mailboxes in such a way that the total distance between the houses and the mailboxes is minimized. The distance between a house and a mailbox is the absolute value of their difference in positions.

The task is to determine the minimum total distance between the houses and the allocated mailboxes.

Example:
```
Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes at positions 1, 8, and 20.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `houses` array?
   - What is the range of values for the positions in the `houses` array?
   - What are the possible values for `k`?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be a single integer representing the minimum total distance?
   
3. **Constraints on Input:**
   - Can the `houses` array contain duplicate positions?
   - Should the mailboxes be placed exactly at one of the positions in the `houses` array?
   
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if there is only one house?

### Code

```python
def minDistance(houses, k):
    houses.sort()
    
    # Precompute the distances for median-based placements
    def min_distance_for_range(i, j):
        m = (i + j) // 2
        return sum(abs(houses[p] - houses[m]) for p in range(i, j + 1))
    
    # Use a memoization table to store computed values
    import functools
    @functools.lru_cache(None)
    def dp(start, k):
        if k == 0 and start == len(houses):
            return 0
        if k == 0 or start == len(houses):
            return float('inf')
        
        min_dist = float('inf')
        
        # Try placing the current mailbox at range [start, end]
        for end in range(start, len(houses)):
            cost = min_distance_for_range(start, end)
            min_dist = min(min_dist, cost + dp(end + 1, k - 1))
        
        return min_dist
    
    return dp(0, k)
```

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:**
   - Initially, sort the `houses` array. Sorting helps in easily calculating the median for a range which minimizes the sum of absolute differences.

2. **Median-Based Placements:**
   - Calculate the costs for placing mailboxes in different ranges using a helper function. The cost for a range `[i, j]` with a mailbox placed optimally at the median house.

3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use dynamic programming with memoization to save intermediate results.
   - `dp(start, k)` represents the minimum total distance for placing `k` mailboxes starting from the index `start`.
   - For each possible end position for a mailbox, compute the cost for that segment and recursively compute the cost for the remaining segments.

4. **Recursive Helper:**
   - A recursive helper function with memoization to avoid recomputation and reduce time complexity.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `houses` array takes `O(n log n)`.
- Filling the memoization table involves considering each starting point and end point, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^2 * k)`.
  
Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^2 * k)` assuming that memoization is effectively reducing recomputation.

This structured approach ensures we are minimizing the penalty of summing distances primarily by leveraging the properties of medians and dynamic programming to handle overlapping subproblems.
