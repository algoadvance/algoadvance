title:  Array of Doubled Pairs-out
permalink: /s954
---

Given an array of integers `arr` of even length, return `true` if and only if it is possible to reorder it such that `arr[2 * i + 1] = 2 * arr[2 * i]` for every `0 <= i < len(arr) / 2`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

2. **Does the array always have an even length?**
   - Yes, the array's length is always even.

3. **Are zeroes allowed in the array, and how should they be handled?**
   - Yes, zeroes are allowed. For zeroes, there should be an even number of them to pair correctly.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. **Sort the array by absolute values** to handle negative numbers correctly. This helps in finding pairs where one is double the other.
2. **Use a Counter** from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each number.
3. **Iterate through each unique number** in the sorted list of absolute values:
   - If a number is available in the counter, check if its double is also available.
   - If the double is not available or not enough, return `false`.
   - If available, decrement the count of both numbers accordingly.
4. **Check for pairs correctly**, especially handling zeroes: we need pairs of zeroes.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def canReorderDoubled(arr):
    arr.sort(key=abs)
    count = Counter(arr)
    
    for x in arr:
        if count[x] == 0:
            continue
        if count[2 * x] == 0:
            return False
        count[x] -= 1
        count[2 * x] -= 1
    
    return True

# Example usage:
arr = [4, -2, 2, -4]
print(canReorderDoubled(arr))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Iterating and counting operations**: \(O(n)\) since we process each element at most twice.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **\(O(n \log n)\)** due to the sorting step.
