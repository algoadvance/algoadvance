title:  Find the Winner of an Array Game-out
permalink: /s1535
---

Given an integer array `arr` of distinct integers and an integer `k`, a game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e., `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`, the larger integer wins, and the winner remains at position `0` and the loser moves to the end of the array.

The game ends when an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.

Return the integer which will win the game.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   **A:** Yes, constraints typically given are `2 <= arr.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`, with all `arr[i]` being distinct.

2. **Q:** Can the array initially have a length of 2?
   **A:** Yes, it can.

3. **Q:** If an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds during an intermediate state of the array, is the game considered over?
   **A:** Yes, the game ends as soon as an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.

## Strategy

1. Start by comparing the first two elements.
2. Track the winner and count the consecutive wins.
3. If the winner wins `k` consecutive rounds, return the winner.
4. Move the loser to the end of the array.
5. Repeat the process, keeping track of the current number of consecutive wins.
6. If a new winner emerges, reset the consecutive wins counter for the new winner.

### Pseudocode
1. Initialize `max_so_far` with the value of the first element.
2. Initialize `consecutive_wins` to 0.
3. Loop through the rest of the array, comparing the current element with `max_so_far`.
   - If `max_so_far` wins, increment `consecutive_wins`.
   - If `max_so_far` loses, update `max_so_far` and reset `consecutive_wins`.
4. Return `max_so_far` if `consecutive_wins` reaches `k`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the array, because in the worst case, we may need to look at all elements in the array.

## Code Implementation

```python
def get_winner(arr, k):
    # Edge case: if k == 1, return the maximum of the first two elements
    if k == 1:
        return max(arr[0], arr[1])
      
    max_so_far = arr[0]
    consecutive_wins = 0

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if max_so_far > arr[i]:
            consecutive_wins += 1
        else:
            max_so_far = arr[i]
            consecutive_wins = 1
            
        if consecutive_wins == k:
            return max_so_far
    
    return max_so_far

# Test
print(get_winner([2,1,3,5,4,6,7], 2))  # Output: 5
print(get_winner([3,2,1], 10))         # Output: 3
print(get_winner([1,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2], 7))  # Output: 9
```

In this code:
- We initialize `max_so_far` with the first element.
- We iterate through the array starting from the second element.
- We update the number of consecutive wins or reset it based on comparisons.
- The game terminates early if a winner is found with `k` consecutive wins, otherwise, the loop ensures `max_so_far` is the largest by the time it exits.
