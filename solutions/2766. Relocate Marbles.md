title:  Relocate Marbles-out
permalink: /s2766
---

You are given two arrays `A` and `B` each of length `N`, representing the positions of marbles. Your task is to relocate every marble from position `A[i]` to `B[i]` using the minimum number of moves. 

In one move, you can choose any marble and move it from its current position to any other position.

Return an array containing the final positions of the marbles sorted in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple marbles at the same position in `A` or `B`?**
   - Yes, the same position may contain more than one marble in the initial and target arrays.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the lengths of `A` and `B` are the same?**
   - Yes, both `A` and `B` have the same length `N`.

3. **Can the marbles be moved to any position other than those specified in `B`?**
   - No, each marble must move to the corresponding position in `B`.

4. **Do we need to minimize the number of moves specifically, or is any valid relocation acceptable?**
   - Since each marble is relocated independently and directly from `A[i]` to `B[i]`, the minimal number of moves is inherently 1 move per marble. Sorting the final positions will then complete the requirement.

### Strategy

1. Given the arrays `A` and `B`, directly relocate each marble at `A[i]` to `B[i]`.
2. Capture all the positions in `B` because each marble moves from `A[i]` to `B[i]` in exactly one move.
3. Sort the positions in `B` to get the final positions in increasing order.
4. Return the sorted list.

### Time Complexity

The primary operation here is the sorting of the array `B`, which takes `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the length of the arrays `A` and `B`.

### Python Code

```python
def relocateMarbles(A, B):
    # Directly take all positions in B (target positions)
    final_positions = B.copy()
    # Sort the final positions
    final_positions.sort()
    return final_positions

# Example usage:
A = [1, 2, 3]
B = [3, 2, 1]
print(relocateMarbles(A, B))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Explanation

1. **Relocation Step**: We take each marble at `A[i]` and relocate it directly to `B[i]`. This is straightforward as per the problem statement.
2. **Sorting Step**: After relocation, we sort the array `B` to get the final marble positions in increasing order.
3. **Return**: The sorted list of final marble positions is returned as the result.

This completes the problem as per the requirements specified.
