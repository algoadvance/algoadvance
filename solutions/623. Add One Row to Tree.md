title:  Add One Row to Tree-out

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Details:**
   - What is the structure of the tree? (Assuming it's a binary tree)
   - What are the given values for the new row depth `d` and the integer value `v` for the nodes to be added?
  
2. **Constraints:**
   - How large can the tree be? (The number of nodes)
   - What should be done if `d` is 1?

## Code:

Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def addOneRow(root: TreeNode, v: int, d: int) -> TreeNode:
    if d == 1:
        new_root = TreeNode(v)
        new_root.left = root
        return new_root
    
    def dfs(node, depth):
        if not node:
            return
        
        if depth == d - 1:
            old_left = node.left
            old_right = node.right
            node.left = TreeNode(v)
            node.right = TreeNode(v)
            node.left.left = old_left
            node.right.right = old_right
        else:
            dfs(node.left, depth + 1)
            dfs(node.right, depth + 1)
    
    dfs(root, 1)
    return root
```

## Strategy:

1. **Handle the Special Case for Depth 1:** 
   - If the depth `d` is 1, we create a new root node with value `v`, and the old tree becomes the left subtree of this new node.
   
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for General Case:**
   - Use DFS to traverse the tree.
   - Traverse the tree to the level just above the target level `d`.
   - At each node at depth `d-1`, add new nodes with value `v` as the left and right children.
   - Connect the original left and right subtrees to the new nodes accordingly.

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree, corresponding to the recursive call stack.
