title:  Beautiful Array-out
permalink: /s932

Given an integer `n`, return any beautiful array `arr` that is an array of integers from `1` to `n` such that for every `i < j < k`, `arr[i] * arr[k] != 2 * arr[j]`. The algorithm should work within O(n log n) time complexity.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can you explain what a "beautiful array" specifically means?
   - A "beautiful array" is defined such that for any triplet of indices `i < j < k`, the product of the values at the first and third indices is not equal to twice the value at the middle index.

2. Can the array have duplicate values?
   - No, the array should contain each integer from `1` to `n` exactly once.

3. Should the function handle edge cases like when `n = 1`?
   - Yes, the function should handle all possible edge cases, including the smallest input.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, you can make use of the divide and conquer approach to ensure that the condition `arr[i] * arr[k] != 2 * arr[j]` is maintained.

Here's a high-level strategy:
1. Divide the array `1...n` into odd and even parts recursively.
2. Combine the parts to form a beautiful array.
3. By keeping dividing into odd and even elements, we ensure that no element in the combined parts can form an undesirable arithmetic progression.

### Steps:
1. **Base Case:** If `n == 1`, return `[1]`.
2. **Recursive Case:** Divide the problem into subproblems for odd and even indexed numbers.
3. Combine the results from subproblems ensuring the beautiful property.

## Code
```python
def beautifulArray(n):
    def construct(arr):
        if len(arr) <= 2:
            return arr
        odd = construct([x for x in arr if x % 2 == 1])
        even = construct([x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0])
        return odd + even

    return construct(list(range(1, n + 1)))

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(beautifulArray(n))  # Example output: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Recurrence Relation:** Each recursive step splits the array into two approximately equal parts, and combining them is linear.
- **Time Complexity:** \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) \).
  - Using the Master Theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences: Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( d = 1 \). This fits into case 2 (\( T(n) = O(n \log n) \)) of the Master Theorem.

Thus, the time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
