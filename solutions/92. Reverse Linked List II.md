title:  Reverse Linked List II-out
permalink: /s92
---

You are given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where `1 <= left <= right <= n` (n is the length of the list). Reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

### Example:

**Input:** 
- head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- left = 2
- right = 4

**Output:** 
- [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the left and right labels are the same?**
   - The list should remain unchanged as there's no range to reverse.

2. **What is the constraint on the values within the linked list?**
   - The values can be any integer within the standard signed 32-bit range.

3. **Are duplicate values allowed in the linked list?**
   - Yes, duplicate values are allowed.

4. **Is the given list guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. Traverse the linked list to reach the node at position `left`.
2. Reverse the sublist from position `left` to `right`.
3. Reconnect the reversed sublist with the rest of the list.
4. Return the modified list.

### Steps:

1. Use a dummy node to simplify position handling especially for corner cases.
2. Traverse the list to just before the `left` position.
3. Perform the sublist reversal from `left` to `right` positions.
4. Reconnect the reversed sublist back to the original list.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseBetween(head: ListNode, left: int, right: int) -> ListNode:
    if not head:
        return None

    # Position just before the start of the to-be-reversed section
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev = dummy

    # Move prev to the node just before the `left` position
    for _ in range(left - 1):
        prev = prev.next

    # Reverse from left to right
    current = prev.next
    reverse = None

    for _ in range(right - left + 1):
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = reverse
        reverse = current
        current = next_node

    # Connect reversed part with the previous part
    prev.next.next = current
    prev.next = reverse

    return dummy.next
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once to reach the `left` position and perform the reversal in a segment which takes linear time.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.

This ensures an optimal and efficient approach for reversing a sublist within a singly linked list.
