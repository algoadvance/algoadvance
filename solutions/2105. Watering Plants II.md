title:  Watering Plants II-out
permalink: /s2105

You are given two watering cans, each with a different capacity and a row of plants that need watering. Your task is to find the minimum steps required to water all the plants.

The problem's details are as follows:

- You have an array `plants` where `plants[i]` is the amount of water needed by the ith plant.
- You have two watering cans with capacities `capacityA` and `capacityB`.
- You start at the first plant, and after you water a plant, you can move to the next plant. At any time, you can refill your can from an infinite water source.
- You need to determine the minimum refill steps required so that all the plants are watered. A refill step is counted whenever you have to refill either of the cans.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the plants be watered in any order, or do we have to water them sequentially starting from the first plant?
2. Are both watering cans used simultaneously, or can we choose to use either one?
3. If both watering cans can be used, what are the rules for switching between them?

Assuming:
1. Plants need to be watered sequentially from the first to the last.
2. We can use either watering can on each plant.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two pointers for tracking the current capacity of can A and can B.
2. Begin at the start of the plants array with both cans initially at their full capacities.
3. Iterate over the plants, at each step:
   - Check which watering can (A or B) is currently closest to the plant.
   - Use the can that will require the least number of refills.
   - If a can does not have enough water to water the current plant, refill it and increment the step count.
   - Water the plant and reduce the current water level in the can used.
4. Continue until all plants are watered.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
def wateringPlantsII(plants, capacityA, capacityB):
    currentA = capacityA  # Current water in can A
    currentB = capacityB  # Current water in can B

    steps = 0
    n = len(plants)
    
    left = 0  # Starting from the first plant
    right = n - 1  # Starting from the last plant

    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            # Only one plant left to water
            if currentA >= plants[left] or currentB >= plants[left]:
                # Either of the cans can water the plant
                break
            else:
                # Refill any one can
                steps += 1
                break

        if currentA >= plants[left]:
            currentA -= plants[left]
        else:
            # Refill can A
            currentA = capacityA - plants[left]
            steps += 1

        if currentB >= plants[right]:
            currentB -= plants[right]
        else:
            # Refill can B
            currentB = capacityB - plants[right]
            steps += 1
            
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return steps

# Example Usage:
plants = [2, 4, 5, 1, 2]
capacityA = 5
capacityB = 5
print(wateringPlantsII(plants, capacityA, capacityB))  # Output: The minimum number of refills required
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where n is the number of plants. We iterate through the list of plants only once. Thus, it efficiently handles the problem within linear time.

This solution assumes that you water from the start and end simultaneously to minimize the steps, which is a common technique for such two-pointer problems.
