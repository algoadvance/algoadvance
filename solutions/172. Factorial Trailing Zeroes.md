title:  Factorial Trailing Zeroes-out
permalink: /s172
---
Given an integer `n`, return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the value range of `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` can be any non-negative integer within a reasonable limit, let's assume constraints of `0 <= n <= 10^4`.

2. **What is a trailing zero?**
   - A trailing zero is a zero at the end of a number, i.e., an integer like `100` has two trailing zeroes.

### Strategy
To determine the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n` (denoted as `n!`), we need to consider the factors that contribute to trailing zeroes. Trailing zeroes are produced by the factor `10`, which is the product of `2` and `5`. In a factorial, the number of `2`s will always be more than or equal to the number of `5`s, hence the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times `5` is a factor in the numbers from `1` to `n`.

To count the number of trailing zeroes, we:
1. Count the multiples of `5`.
2. Count the multiples of `25` (this accounts for numbers like `25`, `50`, etc., which contribute an extra factor of `5`).
3. Count the multiples of `125`, `625`, and so on.

In general, we keep dividing `n` by `5`, `25`, `125`, etc., summing up the counts until `n` divided by the increasing powers of `5` is `0`.

### Code
```python
def trailingZeroes(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    
    return count
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialize `count` to `0`:** This variable will accumulate the number of trailing zeroes.
2. **Initialize `power_of_5` to `5`:** This is the base factor we start dividing `n` by.
3. **While `n` is greater than or equal to `power_of_5`:**
   - Add the integer division result of `n // power_of_5` to `count`.
   - Multiply `power_of_5` by `5` to consider the next power of `5`.
4. **Return `count`:** This gives the total number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(log_5(n))` because we repeatedly divide `n` by increasing powers of `5`. This is efficient and suitable for the given constraints.

This concludes the solution for counting trailing zeroes in the factorial of an integer `n`.
