title:  Shifting Letters-out
permalink: /s848
---

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer array `shifts` of the same length.

Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a').

- For example, shifting `'a'` by 1 gives `'b'`, and shifting `'z'` by 1 gives `'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i + 1` letters of `s`, `x` times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `s` are applied.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: 
We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters by 9, we have "rpl".
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `shifts.length == s.length`
- `0 <= shifts[i] <= 10^9`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the operation of shifts on the string mutate the string?**
   - Yes, continuously mutate the string according to the shifts specified in the list.
   
2. **How to interpret shifting?**
   - Shifting is taken as moving the character forward in the alphabet. For instance, shifting 'a' by 1 will result in 'b', and 'z' by 1 will result in 'a' due to wrap-around.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Shift Cumulative Effect:**
   - We observe that applying the shifts as specified will be computationally expensive if done directly. Instead, accumulate them in reverse order to determine the net shift effect cumulatively.

2. **Implement Efficient Shifting using Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Determine the effective shifts for the position by processing the `shifts` array in reverse.
   - Utilize modular arithmetic to map the shifts efficiently within the bounds of a-z.

### Code

```python
def shiftingLetters(s: str, shifts: List[int]) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    
    # Initialize cumulative shifts
    cumulative_shift = 0
    
    # Initialize result list of characters
    result = list(s)
    
    # Traverse shifts in reverse to accumulate the shifts
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cumulative_shift += shifts[i]
        cumulative_shift %= 26
        
        # Shift the i-th character
        new_char = chr((ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + cumulative_shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
        
        result[i] = new_char
    
    # Join the list into the final string
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n):** We are traversing the string and shifts array a constant number of times.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` to construct the result string.

This solution should handle the given constraints efficiently.
