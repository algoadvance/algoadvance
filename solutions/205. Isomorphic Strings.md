Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Set:** Are the strings limited to any specific character set (e.g., only lowercase English letters)?
   - Typically, `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters, but we can assume they can be any printable ASCII characters unless specified otherwise.

2. **String Length:** Is there any constraint on the length of the strings `s` and `t`?
   - The lengths are typically within a reasonable range to be handled by common algorithms (up to tens of thousands).

3. **Empty Strings:** Can `s` and `t` be empty? How should such cases be handled?
   - Yes, empty strings are valid inputs, and two empty strings are isomorphic by definition.

### Code

```python
def isIsomorphic(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    mapping_s_to_t = {}
    mapping_t_to_s = {}

    for char_s, char_t in zip(s, t):
        if char_s in mapping_s_to_t:
            if mapping_s_to_t[char_s] != char_t:
                return False
        else:
            mapping_s_to_t[char_s] = char_t

        if char_t in mapping_t_to_s:
            if mapping_t_to_s[char_t] != char_s:
                return False
        else:
            mapping_t_to_s[char_t] = char_s

    return True
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:** Begin by checking if the lengths of the two strings are different. If they are, return `False` immediately since they can't be isomorphic.

2. **Mapping Characters:** Use two dictionaries to keep track of the character mappings:
   - `mapping_s_to_t`: Maps a character from `s` to `t`.
   - `mapping_t_to_s`: Maps a character from `t` to `s`.

3. **Character-by-Character Comparison:**
    - Iterate over the pairs of characters from `s` and `t` simultaneously.
    - For each pair `(char_s, char_t)`, check if there is a mapping already established in either direction.
    - If `char_s` is already mapped to another character, check if it maps to the current `char_t`. If not, return `False`.
    - If `char_t` is already mapped to another character, check if it maps to the current `char_s`. If not, return `False`.
    - If there are no conflicts, establish the mapping in both dictionaries.

4. **Return:** If all checks are passed, return `True` as the strings are isomorphic.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings. This is because we iterate through the strings once and perform constant-time operations (dictionary lookups and inserts) for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case, for the space used by the two dictionaries.
