title:  Cut Off Trees for Golf Event-out
permalink: /s675
---

You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D array, where the values represent:

- `0` : An obstacle that you cannot pass through.
- `1` : A space you are allowed to walk through.
- `>1` : A tree that you need to cut off with the value indicating the height of the tree.

You are initially positioned at the top-left corner (0, 0) and you must cut off all the trees in ascending order of their heights. Once you cut off a tree, the value at that cell becomes `1` (as if the tree is removed and that space becomes walkable).

You need to return the minimum steps required to cut all the trees. If you cannot reach the tree or if it's impossible to cut all the trees, you should return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Guaranteed Valid Input?**
   - Is it guaranteed that the input matrix is non-empty and that there is at least one tree to cut?
   
2. **Forest Boundaries?**
   - Are the dimensions of the forest matrix within a manageable range for typical operations like BFS?

3. **Movement Constraints?**
   - We're only allowed to move up, down, left, or right?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach is appropriate to find the shortest path between trees due to its ability to explore nodes level by level.

#### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Sort Trees:** Extract all tree positions and their heights, then sort them based on height.
2. **BFS Function:** Implement a BFS function that, given a starting point, finds the minimum distance to a target point.
3. **Traverse and Cut:** Start from (0,0) and use the BFS function iteratively to move from one tree to the next in increasing order of tree height. Accumulate the distance traveled.
4. **Handle Unreachable Cases:** If BFS returns -1 for any tree, then it's impossible to cut all trees, and we should return -1.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def cutOffTree(forest):
    if not forest or not forest[0]:
        return -1

    # Get all trees' positions and heights
    trees = sorted((height, i, j)
                   for i, row in enumerate(forest)
                   for j, height in enumerate(row)
                   if height > 1)

    def bfs(sr, sc, tr, tc):
        if sr == tr and sc == tc:
            return 0
        rows, cols = len(forest), len(forest[0])
        visited = set((sr, sc))
        queue = deque([(sr, sc, 0)])

        while queue:
            r, c, d = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)):
                rr, cc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= rr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and (rr, cc) not in visited and forest[rr][cc] != 0:
                    if rr == tr and cc == tc:
                        return d + 1
                    visited.add((rr, cc))
                    queue.append((rr, cc, d + 1))
        return -1

    sr = sc = 0
    total_steps = 0

    for height, tr, tc in trees:
        steps = bfs(sr, sc, tr, tc)
        if steps == -1:
            return -1
        total_steps += steps
        sr, sc = tr, tc  # Move to the tree's position

    return total_steps

# Example usage
forest = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [0, 0, 4],
    [7, 6, 5]
]
print(cutOffTree(forest))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Trees:** \(O(T \log T)\) where \(T\) is the number of trees.
2. **BFS Traversals:** Each BFS can traverse the entire grid in the worst case, so each BFS costs \(O(R \times C)\) time where \(R\) and \(C\) are row and column counts respectively. 
   - Since BFS is called once for each tree, the overall time complexity is \(O(T \times R \times C)\).

Therefore, the total time complexity is **\(O(T \log T + T \times R \times C)\)**.
