title:  Number of Operations to Make Network Connected-out
permalink: /s1319
---

You are given `n` computers numbered from `0` to `n-1` and an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a connection between computers `a_i` and `b_i`. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the computers connected. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

An operation consists of removing any existing connection and adding a new connection.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple connections between the same pair of computers?**
   - No, assume each pair of computers can be directly connected by at most one connection.

2. **Can `connections` include dangling connections that do not connect any computer?**
   - No, assume all given connections are valid.

3. **What happens if `n` is 1?**
   - If `n` is 1, it’s already connected, so no operations are needed.

## Code

```python
def makeConnected(n, connections):
    if len(connections) < n - 1:
        return -1  # Not enough connections to connect all computers
    
    parent = list(range(n))
    rank = [0] * n

    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]

    def union(x, y):
        rootX = find(x)
        rootY = find(y)

        if rootX != rootY:
            if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
                parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
                parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                parent[rootY] = rootX
                rank[rootX] += 1
    
    for x, y in connections:
        union(x, y)
    
    # Count the number of unique roots
    root_set = set(find(x) for x in range(n))
    
    # Number of operations needed is the number of extra roots minus 1
    return len(root_set) - 1

# Test case
n = 6
connections = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
print(makeConnected(n, connections))  # Output: 1
```

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check:** If the number of connections is less than `n - 1`, return `-1` because it's impossible to connect all computers with fewer than `n - 1` connections.

2. **Union-Find Data Structure:** Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to keep track of the connected components.
   - **Find:** A function to find the root of a node with path compression.
   - **Union:** A function to union two sets with union by rank for efficiency.

3. **Union Operations:** Perform union operations for each connection in the input.

4. **Counting Unique Components:** After processing all connections, count the number of unique components by finding the root of each node. The number of operations required will be the number of extra components minus 1.

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** Both union and find operations are `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the Inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant for practical purposes.
- **Total Time Complexity:** Considering the loop over `connections` and the loop over all nodes to count unique roots, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of computers and `m` is the number of connections.
