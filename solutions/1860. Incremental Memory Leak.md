title:  Incremental Memory Leak-out
permalink: /s1860
---

You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the available memory in two memory banks. A memory leak occurs every decreasing time step. At the `i-th` step (starting with `i = 1`), `i` bytes of memory will be allocated to the bank with the larger available memory (or to `memory1` if they have equal available memory). The process stops when we can't allocate `i` bytes of memory due to insufficient available memory in both memory banks.

Return a list of three integers, where:
- The first integer is the number of steps taken before the memory leak stops.
- The second integer is the available memory in bank `memory1` after it stops.
- The third integer is the available memory in bank `memory2` after it stops.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `memory1` and `memory2` be negative or zero?**
   - No, they are always non-negative integers.

2. **What are the constraints for `memory1` and `memory2`?**
   - Both `memory1` and `memory2` fit within the range of `0` to `10^9`.

### Strategy

1. Start with `i = 1`.
2. At each step, allocate `i` bytes to the memory bank with more available memory. If both memory banks have the same available memory, allocate to `memory1`.
3. Reduce the available memory of the selected bank by `i` bytes.
4. Increment `i` by 1 and repeat the process.
5. Stop when neither bank can allocate `i` bytes of memory.
6. Return the step count and remaining memory of both banks.

### Code

```python
def mem_leak(memory1, memory2):
    i = 1
    while True:
        if memory1 >= memory2:
            if memory1 >= i:
                memory1 -= i
            else:
                break
        else:
            if memory2 >= i:
                memory2 -= i
            else:
                break
        i += 1
    return [i, memory1, memory2]

# Example Usage:
print(mem_leak(2, 2))  # Example where memory1 = 2, memory2 = 2
print(mem_leak(8, 11)) # Example where memory1 = 8, memory2 = 11
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(√N), where N is the smaller of the two initial memory values (`memory1` and `memory2`). This is because in each step `i` is incremented by 1, and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k*(k+1)/2`. Thus, approximately `i^2/2 <= min(memory1, memory2)` leads to `i` being roughly `√(2*min(memory1, memory2))`.

The space complexity is O(1) since only a constant amount of extra space is used.
