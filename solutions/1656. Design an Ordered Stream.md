title:  Design an Ordered Stream-out
permalink: /s1656
---

You are given a stream of `n` tuples representing `(id, value)`. Each id is unique and in the range from 1 to `n`, and the stream is not presented in any particular order. Implement the `OrderedStream` class:

- `OrderedStream(int n)` Initializes the object with `n` integers.
  
- `List<String> insert(int id, String value)` Inserts the pair `(id, value)` into the stream, then returns the largest possible list of **ordered** values that can be returned from the stream, starting from the current position.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the id in the range always from 1 to n?**
   Yes, the id is always in the range from 1 to n.

2. **Should the return list always start from the current position and continue in sequence until a missing id is found?**
   Yes, the returned list should start from the current position and continue until a gap (missing id) is encountered.

3. **What should happen if an id that is already inserted is received again?**
   You can assume that ids are always inserted only once and they are unique.

### Strategy

To implement this, we will:
1. Use a list to store the values corresponding to each id.
2. Keep track of the smallest `current` position that we have not returned yet.
3. When inserting, update the list at the appropriate index.
4. Return the longest contiguous sublist starting from the current position.

### Code

```python
class OrderedStream:

    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.stream = [None] * n  # Initialize a list of None with size n
        self.ptr = 0  # Start with the first position

    def insert(self, id: int, value: str) -> List[str]:
        self.stream[id - 1] = value  # Place the value at its correct position
        result = []
        
        # Check from the current position to see what can be returned
        while self.ptr < len(self.stream) and self.stream[self.ptr] is not None:
            result.append(self.stream[self.ptr])
            self.ptr += 1
            
        return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n) since we are creating a list of size n.
- **Insertion**: O(m) where m is the number of contiguous elements starting from `ptr` that are not `None`.

Given that each insert operation could potentially examine up to all `n` elements in the worst case (when all are filled in sequence), each insertion could be O(n) in the worst case. Therefore, we aim to make the insert operation O(m) where m refers to the number of contiguous elements from `ptr`. 

In typical scenarios, the average time complexity for inserting and returning the ordered elements will likely be lower due to the contiguous chunks.
