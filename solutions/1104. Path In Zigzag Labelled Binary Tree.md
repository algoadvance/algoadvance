title:  Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1104
---

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0. For each node at depth `d`, the labels of the nodes at depth `d` are in increasing order from left to right.

However, in a Zigzag labelled binary tree, the labels alternate between left to right and right to left. For example, the odd numbered depth levels (from the root) are labelled from left to right while the even numbered depth levels are labelled from right to left.

Given the label of a node in this tree, return the path from the root of the tree to the given node, as a list of the labels along the path.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Label**: What is the valid range of the input label?
   - Assume the label can range between 1 to \( 2^{31} - 1 \).
   
2. **Path to Return**: Should the output be in the order from the root to the given label?
   - Yes, the output list should start from the root and end with the given label.
   
3. **Input Validity**: Can we assume the input label will always be a valid label in the Zigzag labelled binary tree?
   - Yes, assume the input label is always valid.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Depth (`d`) of the Node**: We need to identify the depth `d` of the given label in the binary tree.
2. **Path Construction Reverse**: Trace from the node to the root, but considering the zigzag pattern for appropriate parent lookup:
   - Compute the parent label in zigzag by reversing the label numbering at each level.
3. **Reverse Path**: Since we trace from the node to the root, we need to reverse this path to return the correct ordered path from root to the node.

### Code

Here's the Python code to achieve the solution:

```python
def pathInZigZagTree(label: int):
    path = []
    node = label
    
    # Determine the depth of the given label
    depth = 0
    while (1 << depth) <= node:
        depth += 1
        
    while depth > 0:
        path.append(node)
        max_label = (1 << depth) - 1
        min_label = (1 << (depth - 1))
        node = (max_label + min_label - node) // 2
        depth -= 1
    
    return path[::-1]

# Example usage
label = 14
print(pathInZigZagTree(label))  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 14]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(\log N) \) where `N` is the given label. This is because we are calculating the depth first which takes \( \log N \) time and then tracing the path back to the root which also takes \( \log N \) steps. 

- Calculating the depth: \( O(\log N) \)
- Tracing the path: \( O(\log N) \)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(\log N) \).
