title:  Find Palindrome With Fixed Length-out
permalink: /s2217
---

You are given an integer array `queries` and a positive integer `intLength`. For each `query`, you need to find the `query-th` smallest palindrome of length `intLength` (indexed from 1) and return it in an array. 

If no such palindrome exists, your function should return `-1` for that query.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Length Constraints:** What is the range of values for `intLength` and the length of the `queries` array?
2. **Value Constraints:** What is the range of numbers within `queries`?
3. **Palindrome Nature**: Are we considering only numeric palindromes, and do digit constraints (e.g., leading zeros) apply?

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Palindrome Generation:** We need a systematic way to generate palindromes of a given length.
2. **Odd vs. Even Length:** Consider different methods for generating palindromes based on whether `intLength` is odd or even.
3. **Index Mapping:** Translate the `query`-th smallest palindrome directly without generating all palindromes up to that point.

### Steps:
1. **Middle Construction:** Construct the middle part of the palindrome (for even length it’s half, for odd length it’s half + 1).
2. **Mirroring:** Mirror this middle to form the complete palindrome.
3. **Indexing:** For each query, determine the correct middle based on query and then form the palindrome.

## Code

Here's a Python function that implements the above plan:

```python
def find_palindromes(queries, intLength):
    results = []
    
    # Number of digits for the half part (including middle digit for odd lengths)
    half_size = (intLength + 1) // 2
    start_num = 10**(half_size - 1)
    end_num = 10**half_size
    
    for q in queries:
        base = start_num + q - 1
        if base >= end_num:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            base_str = str(base)
            if intLength % 2 == 0:
                palindrome = base_str + base_str[::-1]
            else:
                palindrome = base_str + base_str[-2::-1]
            results.append(int(palindrome))
            
    return results

# Example usage
queries = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 90]
intLength = 3
print(find_palindromes(queries, intLength))  # Outputs: [101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 999]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Base Construction:** Generating the base portion is O(1) per query.
- **Palindrome Formation:** Forming the string and its reverse is directly proportional to the length of the string, which is O(intLength/2).
- **Overall Time Complexity:** Each query is processed in O(intLength), and there are n queries. Hence, the time complexity is O(n * intLength), where n is the size of the `queries` array.

This solution effectively manages both space and time complexity, as it directly computes each required palindrome without generating all palindromes explicitly.
