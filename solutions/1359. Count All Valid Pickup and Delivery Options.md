1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options

Given `n` orders, each order consists of a pickup and a delivery service. The task is to count all valid sequences of these services so that each pickup is always before the delivery. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one valid sequence (P1, D1), which delivers the order after the pickup has been completed.
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: n = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The valid sequences are:
- (P1, P2, D1, D2)
- (P1, P2, D2, D1)
- (P1, D1, P2, D2)
- (P2, P1, D1, D2)
- (P2, P1, D2, D1)
- (P2, D2, P1, D1)
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - A: Yes, `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Q: Do we need to handle edge cases like invalid inputs?**
   - A: No, as per the problem statement, `n` will always be valid.

3. **Q: For large inputs, should the solution be optimized to handle values of `n` up to 500?**
   - A: Yes, efficient computation is crucial since `n` can be relatively large.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - We need to find the count of valid sequences for a given `n`.
    - Use a Dynamic Programming (DP) array `dp[]` where `dp[i]` denotes the number of valid sequences for `i` pairs of pickups and deliveries.
    - Base case: `dp[0] = 1` because there's one way to do nothing.
    - Recurrence relation: 
      - Consider adding a new pair (pickup `P_i` and delivery `D_i`) to sequences valid for `i-1` pairs.
      - We can place `P_i` into the sequence at any of the `2 * (i-1) + 1` positions and `D_i` after `P_i`.
      - The number of ways to insert them is `(2 * i - 1) * i`.

    - The overall relationship:
      - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (2 * i - 1) * i % MOD`

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Initialize `dp` array and set the base value.
    - Iterate from 1 to `n` to fill in the DP table using the derived formula.
    - Return the final result `dp[n]`.

3. **Time Complexity**:
    - The time complexity is \(O(n)\) since we are iterating from 1 to `n` and performing constant work per step.

### Code

```python
def countOrders(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * (2 * i - 1) * i % MOD
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
print(countOrders(1))  # Output: 1
print(countOrders(2))  # Output: 6
print(countOrders(3))  # Output: 90
```

### Summary
- By using dynamic programming and the derived recurrence relation, the problem is efficiently solved.
- The key insight is to understand how to add a new pickup/delivery pair to already valid sequences.
