title:  Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter-out
permalink: /s2135
---

You are given two 0-indexed arrays of strings `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string in `startWords` and `targetWords` consists of lowercase English letters only.

For each string in `targetWords`, you want to determine if it can be obtained by adding exactly one letter to any string in `startWords`, then rearranging the resulting string. 

Return the number of target strings that can be obtained in this manner.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: startWords = ["ant","act","tack"], targetWords = ["tack","act","acti"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- One of the strings in targetWords, "tack", can be obtained by adding one letter to "ant" (which becomes "tact") and then rearranging the resulting string to "tack".
- Another string in targetWords, "acti", can be obtained by adding one letter to "act" (which becomes "acty") and then rearranging the resulting string to "acti".
```
 
### Constraints:

- 1 <= startWords.length, targetWords.length <= 5000
- 1 <= startWords[i].length, targetWords[j].length <= 26
- Each string of `startWords` and `targetWords` consists of lowercase English letters only.
- No string in `startWords` contains duplicate letters.
- No string in `targetWords` contains duplicate letters.

## Strategy

1. **Prepare the Sets:** Convert each word in `startWords` to a sorted tuple of characters and store these in a set for quick lookup. This preparation step helps in efficiently comparing the target words later.

2. **Check the Target Words:** For each word in `targetWords`, examine if it can be formed by adding exactly one letter to any word from the `startWords` set.
    - Remove each character from the word and check if the remaining characters (when sorted) exist in the `startWords` set.

3. **Count the Match:** Keep a count of such target words that can be formed by the method described.

## Time Complexity

- Converting `startWords` into a set has a time complexity of \(O(N \cdot M \log M)\), where \(N\) is the number of words and \(M\) is the maximum length of a word, due to sorting.
- Checking each `targetWords` will also take \(O(N \cdot (M \log M + M^2))\) since we sort each word and then perform \(M\) checks for substring existence.
- Hence, the overall complexity is approximately \(O(NM^2 \log M)\).

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def countWords(startWords: List[String], targetWords: List[String]) -> int:
    start_word_set = set()
    
    # Convert each start word to a tuple of sorted characters and add to the set
    for word in startWords:
        sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(word))
        start_word_set.add(sorted_tuple)
    
    # Initialize result counter
    result = 0
    
    # Check each target word
    for target in targetWords:
        sorted_target = tuple(sorted(target))
        can_form = False
        
        # Try to remove each character from sorted_target
        for i in range(len(sorted_target)):
            possible_start_word = sorted_target[:i] + sorted_target[i+1:]
            if possible_start_word in start_word_set:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if can_form:
            result += 1
    
    return result
```

This code efficiently counts how many words from `targetWords` can be formed by adding exactly one letter to any word in `startWords` and rearranging the resulting word.
