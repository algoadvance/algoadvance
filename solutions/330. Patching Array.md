title:  Patching Array-out
permalink: /s330

Given a sorted integer array `nums` and an integer `n`, add/patch elements to the array such that any number in the range `1` to `n` inclusive can be formed by the sum of some elements in the array. Return the minimum number of patches required.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Validation**: Do we assume that the input array `nums` is always sorted in non-decreasing order?
    - Yes, the array is always sorted.
2. **Output**: Do we return just the count of patches, or do we also need to return the patched array?
    - Only the count of patches needed.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Setup and Variables**:
   - Use a variable `miss` to keep track of the smallest value that cannot be formed with the current elements.
   - Use a variable `i` to iterate through the given array `nums`.
   - Use a variable `patches` to count the number of patches added.

2. **Algorithm**:
    - Initialize `miss` to 1 because we want to form all numbers from 1 to `n`, starting from the smallest number.
    - Loop while `miss` is less than or equal to `n` (since we need to cover the range 1 to `n`):
        - If the current number in `nums` (pointed by `i`) is less than or equal to `miss`, add this number to the range covered by updating `miss`. Increment `i` to move to the next number in the array.
        - If the current number in `nums` is greater than `miss` (meaning there is a gap between the numbers we can form), patch `miss` to the array and double `miss` (this way we cover the range from `miss` to `2*miss-1`).
        - Increment the `patches` counter whenever a patch is added.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Empty array or arrays with elements greater than `n` should be considered.
    - Arrays where all elements are less than `1` and greater than `n`.

### Code:
```python
def minPatches(nums, n):
    patches = 0  # count of patches added
    miss = 1     # smallest number that cannot be formed yet
    i = 0        # current index in nums
    
    while miss <= n:
        if i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= miss:
            # If the current array element can be used to extend the range of sums
            miss += nums[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, we need to add `miss` to the array to cover this gap
            miss += miss
            patches += 1
    
    return patches

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3]
n = 6
print(minPatches(nums, n))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m + k)` where `m` is the length of the array `nums` and `k` is the number of patches added. In the worst case, the loop runs approximately `O(log n)` times because each time we add a patch, `miss` is doubled, reducing the number of iterations logarithmically with respect to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
