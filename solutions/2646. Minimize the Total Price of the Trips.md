title:  Minimize the Total Price of the Trips-out
permalink: /s2646
---

You are given a tree containing `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` wherein `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` represents an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. Each node also contains a price value defined in a `price` array of length `n`, where `price[i]` represents the price associated with node `i`.

Additionally, you are given an array of trips, where each trip is represented as a pair `[fromi, toi]`. Multiple trips can start or end at the same node.

You need to minimize the total price of all the trips by potentially halving the price of each node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Understanding Input Constraints:**
   - Are all the nodes guaranteed to have at least one connection (except for leaves)?
   - What are the possible ranges for `n` and the length of the `trips` array?
   - Can the prices have a minimum or maximum value constraint?

2. **Understanding Tree Structure:**
   - Is the tree guaranteed to be connected?
   - Will there be any cycles or will it strictly follow a tree structure?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Construct an adjacency list to represent the tree from the `edges` array.

2. **Trip Path Calculation:**
   - For each trip, calculate the path from the start to the end node using a DFS or BFS traversal to find all the nodes visited in the trip.

3. **Frequency Count:**
   - Keep a count of how many times each node appears in all trips.
   
4. **Minimization Strategy:**
   - Identify nodes that can be halved to maximize the reduction in the total trip price. Use a balancing approach where the most frequently visited node having high price gets considered for halving.

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the graph: **O(n)**
- Finding paths for each trip: **O(n * m)** where `m` is the number of trips.
- Counting and halving logic: **O(n)**

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
import heapq

def minimize_total_price(n, edges, price, trips):
    # Step 1: Construct the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    # Helper function to find path using BFS
    def bfs_path(start, end):
        queue = deque([(start, [start])])
        visited = {start}
        while queue:
            node, path = queue.popleft()
            if node == end:
                return path
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the frequency of each node in all trips
    frequency = [0] * n
    for start, end in trips:
        path = bfs_path(start, end)
        for node in path:
            frequency[node] += 1
    
    # Step 3: Determine which nodes to halve to minimize total trips price
    # Using min-heap based on frequency and price
    heap = []
    for i in range(n):
        if frequency[i] > 0:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-frequency[i] * price[i], i))
    
    total_price = sum(frequency[i] * price[i] for i in range(n))
    
    while heap:
        impacted_price, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        impacted_price = -impacted_price
        reduced_price = impacted_price // 2
        total_price -= reduced_price
        # Break if enough nodes have been halved
        if total_price <= sum(frequency[i] * price[i] for i in range(n)) // 2:
            break
    
    return total_price

# Example usage:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4]]
price = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
trips = [[0, 2], [2, 4]]
print(minimize_total_price(n, edges, price, trips))  # Example output
```

### Analysis

In this approach:
- The BFS traversal ensures we find the path for all trips correctly.
- Using a min-heap efficiently manages the node prioritization for price halving.
- The algorithm effectively manages large inputs by using appropriate data structures like dictionaries and heaps.

The overall time complexity should be manageable within the problem constraints, given our assumptions about typical sizes and properties of the input data.
