title:  Take K of Each Character From Left and Right-out
permalink: /s2516
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of various characters, and an integer `k`. Your task is to choose exactly `k` occurrences of three different characters from the leftmost and rightmost `k` characters in the string. You need to return the length of the smallest substring that contains at least `k` occurrences of each of the three characters. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters does the string contain?**
   - The string can contain any printable characters.

2. **Can the characters be non-alphabetic or case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, any printable characters can be present, and they are case-sensitive.

3. **What should the function return if there are fewer than `k` occurrences of the characters in the string?**
   - The function should return `-1`.

4. **What should the function return if the stringâ€™s length is less than `3*k`?**
   - The function should return `-1` as it is not possible to have `k` occurrences of three different characters from both ends.

### Strategy

1. **Check Feasibility**: 
   - First, check if the string has at least `3 * k` length.
   - Check if there are at least `k` occurrences of each of the three characters.

2. **Two Pointers Approach**:
   - Use a sliding window approach with two pointers to find the smallest substring meeting the requirements.
   - Initialize two pointers at the start of the string. Expand the right-pointer to include characters until it satisfies the condition.
   - Contract the left-pointer to find the smallest valid window.

3. **Frequency Counters**:
   - Use dictionaries to keep track of the frequency of the required characters within the current window.

### Code

```python
def takeCharacters(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Check minimum length and initialize pointers
    n = len(s)
    if n < 3 * k:
        return -1
    
    # Initialize counters
    counter = defaultdict(int)
    required_chars = set(s[:k] + s[-k:])
    
    # Check if we have enough characters in the required window
    for char in required_chars:
        if s.count(char) < k:
            return -1
    
    # Sliding window
    left = 0
    right = 0
    formed_char_count = 0  # Number of unique characters that meet the k requirement
    while right < n:
        char_add = s[right]
        counter[char_add] += 1
        if counter[char_add] == k:
            formed_char_count += 1
        
        while formed_char_count == len(required_chars):  # Satisfy condition
            char_remove = s[left]
            counter[char_remove] -= 1
            if counter[char_remove] < k:
                formed_char_count -= 1
            left += 1
        
        right += 1
    
    return (right - left) if formed_char_count == len(required_chars) else -1

# Example usage:
# print(takeCharacters("aabaaac", 2))  # Example input
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of string `s`. We process each character of the string at most twice (once with the right pointer and once with the left pointer in the sliding window).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we only store the frequency of characters in a fixed window of at most 256 characters (assuming ASCII).

This solution leverages a sliding window approach to efficiently find the smallest substring containing `k` occurrences of each specified character.
