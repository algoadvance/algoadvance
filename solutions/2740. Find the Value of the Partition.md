title:  Find the Value of the Partition-out
permalink: /s2740
---

Given an integer array `nums`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:

- Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
- `left` and `right` are non-empty.
- `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the length of `left` after such a partitioning.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input array guaranteed to have at least two elements?** 
   - Yes, because each subarray must be non-empty.

2. **Are there any specific constraints on the values of the elements in the array?**
   - The problem does not specify any constraints, so we assume standard integer values within the array.

3. **What should be returned if the conditions can't be met?**
   - According to the problem, the partitioning conditions can always be met with the provided constraints.

## Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the following multi-step approach:

1. Traverse the array `nums` to determine the maximum up to each index `i` (`left_max[i]`).
2. Traverse the array `nums` to determine the minimum from each index `i` onward (`right_min[i]`).
3. After generating these two arrays (`left_max` and `right_min`), identify the smallest index `i` where `left_max[i] <= right_min[i+1]`.

**Steps in Detail:**

1. **Generate `left_max` array**: For each position `i` in `nums`, `left_max[i]` should store the maximum value from the start of the array up to the position `i`.
   
2. **Generate `right_min` array**: For each position `i` in `nums`, `right_min[i]` should store the minimum value from the position `i` to the end of the array.

3. **Find the correct partition**: Iterate through the arrays and find the first position `i` such that `left_max[i] <= right_min[i+1]`. The length of the left partition will be `i + 1`.

## Time Complexity
- Constructing `left_max` and `right_min` arrays: O(n)
- Iterating through the arrays to find the correct partition index: O(n)
- Overall time complexity: O(n)

## Code Implementation

```python
def partitionDisjoint(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    left_max = [0] * n
    right_min = [0] * n
    
    # Fill left_max array
    left_max[0] = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], nums[i])
    
    # Fill right_min array
    right_min[n-1] = nums[n-1]
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        right_min[i] = min(right_min[i+1], nums[i])
    
    # Find the disjoint point
    for i in range(n-1):
        if left_max[i] <= right_min[i+1]:
            return i + 1
    
    return -1 # This should never be hit based on problem constraints

# Example usage:
nums = [5, 0, 3, 8, 6]
print(partitionDisjoint(nums))  # Output should be 3
```

The function `partitionDisjoint` properly computes the length of the left partition according to the specified conditions. The solution follows an efficient O(n) approach to ensure it handles even larger inputs efficiently.
