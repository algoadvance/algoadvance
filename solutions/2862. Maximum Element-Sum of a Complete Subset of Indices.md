title:  Maximum Element-Sum of a Complete Subset of Indices-out
permalink: /s2862
---

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. The goal is to find the maximum sum of elements from the array such that the indices of these elements form a complete subset of indices-out. A subset of indices is called "complete" if it forms a set of continuous indices starting from some `i` to `j` such that `0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(nums)`.

Given `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the complete subsets of indices are `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, etc., `[0, 1]`, `[1, 2]`, `[0, 1, 2]`, and so on.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Size and Constraints?**
   - How large is the input array `nums`?
   - Are there any specific constraints on the values within `nums`?

2. **Output Format?**
   - Should the result only be the maximum sum, or do we need to return the subset indices as well?

3. **Edge Cases?**
   - How are cases handled when the array is empty?
   - When all elements have the same value?

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can take advantage of prefix sums which will help us efficiently calculate sums of contiguous subarrays.

### Pseudo-code:
1. Calculate the prefix sum array.
2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum sum.
3. Iterate over all possible subarray lengths and all possible starting indices to compute sums using the prefix sum array.
4. Return the maximum sum found.

### Code

Let's begin by implementing the solution in Python:

```python
def maximum_element_sum(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize prefix sums array
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + nums[i]
    
    # Find the maximum sum of a complete subset of indices
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            current_sum = prefix_sums[j + 1] - prefix_sums[i]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(maximum_element_sum(nums))  # Output should be 21, as the complete array itself is the largest sum
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.
- **Subarray Sum Calculation:** O(n^2), considering we are iterating over all possible subarray lengths and starting indices.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)** which is feasible for reasonably sized arrays.

This approach considers all contiguous subarrays in `nums` and finds the maximum sum among them efficiently using the prefix sums.
