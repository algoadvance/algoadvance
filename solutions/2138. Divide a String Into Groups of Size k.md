title:  Divide a String Into Groups of Size k-out
permalink: /s2138

### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to divide the string into groups of size `k`. If the length of `s` is not a multiple of `k`, the final group should be filled with lowercase `'x'` characters to make its length equal to `k`.

Return the list of groups formed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Can `k` be greater than the length of `s`?
   - Are there any constraints on the characters in `s` (e.g. can it contain spaces, punctuation, numbers)?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the result be a list of strings?
   - If `s` is empty, should the result be an empty list?

Without further constraints, I'll assume that:
- The input string `s` can be any non-empty string containing any characters.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- The result should be a list of strings.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list to store the resulting groups.
2. Traverse the string `s` in increments of `k`.
3. For each group:
   - If the group has less than `k` characters, append `'x'` characters until the group's length is `k`.
4. Append the final group to the result list.
5. Return the result list.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def divideString(s: str, k: int, fill: str = 'x') -> list:
    result = []
    n = len(s)

    # Traverse the string in steps of k
    for i in range(0, n, k):
        group = s[i:i + k]
        # If the group is shorter than k, fill it with 'x'
        if len(group) < k:
            group += fill * (k - len(group))
        result.append(group)

    return result

# Example usage:
# s = "abcdefghi"
# k = 3
# Expected output: ["abc", "def", "ghi"]
print(divideString("abcdefghi", 3))

# s = "abcdefghij"
# k = 3
# Expected output: ["abc", "def", "ghi", "jxx"]
print(divideString("abcdefghij", 3))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. We traverse the string in chunks of size `k` and perform O(1) operations for handling the last group.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the result list that contains the groups.

### Conclusion

This solution ensures that the string is divided into groups of size `k`, with the last group padded if necessary. The approach is efficient and handles edge cases effectively.
