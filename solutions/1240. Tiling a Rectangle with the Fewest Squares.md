title:  Tiling a Rectangle with the Fewest Squares-out
permalink: /s1240
---

You are given two integers `n` and `m` that represent the dimensions of a rectangle. You need to tile the entire rectangle with the fewest number of square tiles. Write a function that calculates the minimum number of squares needed to cover an `n x m` rectangle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `n` and `m` guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, both `n` and `m` are guaranteed to be positive integers.

2. **Is there any constraint on the size of `n` and `m`?**
   - Constraints are not provided, so we should be prepared for the possibility that `n` and `m` can be large.

3. **Do the tiles have to be square-shaped?**
   - Yes, the tiles must be square-shaped.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming and recursion:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We'll maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of square tiles needed to cover an `i x j` rectangle.

2. **Base Cases**: 
   - If `i == j`, then it's already a square and requires exactly 1 tile.

3. **Recursive Cases**:
   - We can split the rectangle vertically or horizontally into smaller rectangles and solve each smaller rectangle recursively.
   - Try placing the largest possible square at a given position and compute the remaining smaller rectangles.

4. **Recursion and Memoization**: We'll use a helper function that leverages memoization to reduce redundant calculations.

### Code

Here is the Python code to implement the above strategy:

```python
def tilingRectangle(n, m):
    def dfs(n, m, memo):
        if n == m:
            # Base case: we need exactly 1 square tile if it's already a square
            return 1
        if n == 0 or m == 0:
            # Base case: no rectangle to cover
            return 0
        if (n, m) in memo:
            return memo[(n, m)]
        
        result = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            result = min(result,
                         dfs(n - i, m, memo) + dfs(i, m - i, memo) + 1,
                         dfs(n, m - i, memo) + dfs(n - i, i, memo) + 1)
        memo[(n, m)] = result
        return result

    memo = {}
    return dfs(n, m, memo)

# Example Usage
n = 11
m = 13
print(tilingRectangle(n, m))  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation

- **Recursive Function**: `dfs(n, m, memo)`
  - If `n == m`, it returns 1 as we need only one square tile.
  - If `n == 0` or `m == 0`, it returns 0 as no space needs to be tiled.
  - Checks for memoized results to avoid redundant calculations.
  - Recursively splits the rectangle by trying all possible square tiles from `1x1` to `min(n, m)xmin(n, m)`.
  - The result is the minimum of trying to place a square tile vertically or horizontally and adding the results of the smaller rectangles.

- **Memoization**: Used to store already computed results for specific `n x m` rectangles to reduce computation time.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is `O(n^2 * m^2)` because the function calculates results for all possible sub-rectangles and stores them.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n * m)` due to the memoization table that stores results for all sub-problems.

**Note**: This algorithm, while correct for small inputs, may not be efficient enough for large `n` and `m`. Further optimization might be required for very large inputs, potentially looking into more sophisticated techniques or heuristic-based approaches.
