title:  Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements-out
permalink: /s2016
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n`. The **maximum difference** between two elements of `nums` such that the larger element comes after the smaller element in the array is defined as the maximum value of `nums[j] - nums[i]` where `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] < nums[j]`. If no such `i` and `j` exists, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [7,1,5,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum difference occurs with i = 1 and j = 2, nums[j] - nums[i] = 5 - 1 = 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array contain negative integers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain negative integers.
   
2. **Q:** What is the minimum size of the array?
   **A:** The minimum size of the array is `2` as we need at least two elements to calculate the difference.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a variable `min_element` to store the minimum element encountered so far.
2. Initialize a variable `max_diff` to store the maximum difference encountered so far.
3. Iterate over the array starting from the first element:
   - At each step, update the `max_diff` with the difference between the current element and `min_element` if this difference is greater than the already recorded `max_diff`.
   - Update `min_element` to be the minimum of itself and the current element.
4. Return `max_diff` if it is positive, otherwise return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def maximum_difference(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return -1
    
    min_element = nums[0]
    max_diff = -1
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > min_element:
            max_diff = max(max_diff, nums[i] - min_element)
        min_element = min(min_element, nums[i])
    
    return max_diff

# Example usage:
nums = [7, 1, 5, 4]
print(maximum_difference(nums))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – We traverse the list of numbers just once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) – We use constant extra space.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum difference by maintaining the minimum element encountered so far and updating the maximum difference in a single pass through the array.
