title:  Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations-out
permalink: /s1722
---
Given two integer arrays `source` and `target`, each array of length `n`, and an array `allowedSwaps` where `allowedSwaps[i]` = [ai, bi] indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at index `ai` and index `bi` of `source`, return the minimum Hamming distance between `source` and `target` after performing any number of swap operations.

The Hamming distance between two arrays of the same length is the number of positions where the elements are different.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can an index appear in multiple pairs in `allowedSwaps`?**
   Yes, an index can appear in multiple pairs, meaning we have the flexibility to swap multiple pairs.

2. **Are there any constraints on the lengths of the arrays or the number of allowed swaps?**
   The length of both `source` and `target` is `n` where `1 <= n <= 10^5`. The number of allowed swaps is also within reasonable bounds.

3. **Is the Hamming distance calculation required before and/or after any swaps?**
   We only need to calculate and return the minimum possible Hamming distance after any number of allowable swaps.

### Strategy
The idea is to leverage the allowed swaps to group indices into connected components using Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure. Each connected component represents indices that can be freely rearranged among each other.

1. **Union-Find Data Structure Setup:**
   - Use Union-Find to group indices based on `allowedSwaps`.
   - This helps in identifying which indices are interchangeable.

2. **Group Elements by Components:**
   - For each connected component, collect the elements in `source` and `target` that fall in this component.
   - Count the frequency of each element in both `source` and `target` within each component.

3. **Compute Minimum Hamming Distance:**
   - For each component, compute the number of mismatches by comparing the frequency of elements from `source` and `target`.
   - Sum up the mismatches for all components to get the total Hamming distance.

This approach ensures that we only need to make swaps within each connected component, minimizing the Hamming distance.

### Time Complexity
- **Union-Find operations** are nearly constant time.
- **Total Complexity: O(n log* n) due to Union-Find and linear pass for each element.**

### Code

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, node):
        if self.parent[node] != node:
            self.parent[node] = self.find(self.parent[node])
        return self.parent[node]

    def union(self, node1, node2):
        root1 = self.find(node1)
        root2 = self.find(node2)
        
        if root1 != root2:
            if self.rank[root1] > self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
            elif self.rank[root1] < self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root1] = root2
            else:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
                self.rank[root1] += 1


def minimum_hamming_distance(source, target, allowedSwaps):
    n = len(source)
    uf = UnionFind(n)

    # Process the allowed swaps to form the connected components
    for swap in allowedSwaps:
        uf.union(swap[0], swap[1])

    component_dict = {}
    for i in range(n):
        root = uf.find(i)
        if root not in component_dict:
            component_dict[root] = ([], [])
        component_dict[root][0].append(source[i])
        component_dict[root][1].append(target[i])

    # Calculate the minimum Hamming Distance
    min_hamming_distance = 0
    for source_group, target_group in component_dict.values():
        source_count = {}
        target_count = {}

        # Count frequencies of elements in the source group
        for num in source_group:
            if num in source_count:
                source_count[num] += 1
            else:
                source_count[num] = 1

        # Count frequencies of elements in the target group
        for num in target_group:
            if num in target_count:
                target_count[num] += 1
            else:
                target_count[num] = 1

        # Calculate mismatches
        for key in source_count:
            if key in target_count:
                min_hamming_distance += max(0, source_count[key] - target_count[key])
            else:
                min_hamming_distance += source_count[key]

    return min_hamming_distance
```

This code effectively manages the constraints and efficiently reduces the Hamming distance by leveraging allowable swaps within connected components.
