title:  Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments-out
permalink: /s2825
---

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. You need to determine if you can make `t` a subsequence of `s` by cyclically incrementing characters in `s`. When you increment a character cyclically, you move to the next character in the alphabetical order, and after 'z', it goes back to 'a'.

For example, if `s = "abc"` and `t = "cd"`, you can transform 'a' to 'c' and 'b' to 'd', making `t` a subsequence of `s`.

Return `True` if `t` can be made to be a subsequence of `s` by cyclic increments, and `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the lengths of `s` and `t` be different?
   - Yes, `t` is typically shorter than or equal to the length of `s` since `t` needs to be a subsequence of `s`.

2. What characters are allowed in `s` and `t`?
   - Only lowercase English letters, i.e., 'a' to 'z'.

3. Should we consider case sensitivity?
   - No, since only lowercase letters are involved.

4. Are empty strings valid inputs?
   - Yes, but `t` cannot be a non-empty subsequence of an empty `s`.

### Strategy

1. Use two pointers to iterate through `s` and `t`.
2. For every character in `s`, check if it can be cyclically incremented to match the current character in `t`.
3. Move the pointer in `t` when a match is found.
4. If the end of `t` is reached, it means `t` can be formed as a subsequence with the given operations.

### Code

```python
def can_make_subsequence(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Initialize two pointers for s and t respectively
    i, j = 0, 0
    n, m = len(s), len(t)
    
    while i < n and j < m:
        # Calculate the distance to cyclically match the characters
        if s[i] == t[j] or (ord(t[j]) - ord(s[i]) + 26) % 26 <= 1:
            j += 1
        i += 1
    
    # If we've matched all characters of t, return True
    return j == m

# Test the function with some examples
print(can_make_subsequence("abc", "cd")) # True
print(can_make_subsequence("abcd", "yz")) # False
print(can_make_subsequence("xyzzz", "azz")) # True
print(can_make_subsequence("abc", "abz")) # False
```

### Time Complexity

1. The code iterates through each character in `s` at most once, while checking against characters in `t`.
2. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
3. Space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a few extra variables for pointers and indices.
