title:  K-th Smallest Prime Fraction-out
permalink: /s786
---

You are given a sorted list of numbers `arr` and two integers `A` and `B`. `arr` represents the list of prime numbers. You need to find the `A/B`th smallest prime fraction. A prime fraction in this context is a fraction `arr[i]/arr[j]` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`.

* Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 5], A = 3, B = 7
* Output: [2, 5]

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**:
   - Is the input list always sorted in ascending order?
     - Yes, it is.
   - Could there be duplicate primes in the list?
     - No, the list contains unique prime numbers only.

2. **Fraction Precision**:
   - Do we need to consider floating-point precision for fractions?
     - No, since the result should be returned in the form of indices of the two primes forming the fraction.

3. **Range Constraints**:
   - Is `A/B` a guaranteed valid fraction with respect to the list length?
     - Yes, you can assume that `A` and `B` are such that a valid fraction exists.

### Strategy

1. **Generating Fractions**:
   - Use a min-heap to generate and store prime fractions.
   - Start with the smallest possible fractions by pairing the first element `arr[i]` with every other element `arr[j]`, initializing the heap.

2. **Heap Management**:
   - For each fraction `arr[i]/arr[j]` in the min-heap, keep track of the indices.
   - Extract the smallest element from the heap `K-1` times.

3. **Binary Search Optimization**:
   - Alternatively, use binary search to find the k-th smallest fraction. Maintain a count of fractions less than a middle value to guide the search.

### Implementation

```python
import heapq

def kthSmallestPrimeFraction(arr, k):
    # Create a min-heap
    heap = []
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Initial population of heap with smallest fractions (first element paired with each other)
    for j in range(1, n):
        heapq.heappush(heap, (arr[0] / arr[j], 0, j))
    
    # Extract k-1 elements from the heap
    for _ in range(k - 1):
        fraction, i, j = heapq.heappop(heap)
        # If i can be incremented (staying within bounds), push the next fraction
        if i + 1 < j:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (arr[i + 1] / arr[j], i + 1, j))
    
    # The k-th smallest fraction
    fraction, i, j = heapq.heappop(heap)
    
    return [arr[i], arr[j]]

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5]
A = 3
B = 7
print(kthSmallestPrimeFraction(arr, A * B))  # Output: [2, 5]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Heap Approach**:
   - Heap initialization: O(n) since we push `n-1` elements initially.
   - Heap operations (push and pop): Each operation takes O(log n), and we do this `k-1` times.
   - Overall time complexity: O(n + k log n)

This approach ensures that the solution is optimized for the problem constraints and efficiently finds the k-th smallest prime fraction.
