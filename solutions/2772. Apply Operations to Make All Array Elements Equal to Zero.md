title:  Apply Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to Zero-out
permalink: /s2772
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. 
You have an operation called "flip", which consists of the following steps:

1. Pick any subset of indices `S` in `nums` such that `S` contains exactly `k` elements.
2. Flip the sign of all elements in `nums` that have their indices in `S`.

Return **true** if it's possible to make all the elements in the array equal to zero, or **false** otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the array is already all zeros?**
   - We should return `true`.
2. **What are the constraints on `k` and the length of `nums`?**
   - This will help us determine the feasibility of the solution approach. Let's assume typical constraints for small to medium problem sizes.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - If `k` is 1, it is trivial because we can flip individual elements to reach 0.
   - If `k` is greater than the size of `nums`, it is impossible to select any subset.

2. **Parity Check**:
   - If there is an odd number of elements in `nums` with non-zero values, and `k` is even, or vice-versa, it may affect the feasibility because flipping signs in groups might not reduce all elements to zero.

3. **Simulate the Process**:
   - We need to ensure that after a series of flipping operations by picking subarrays of size `k`, all elements become zero.

## Code

Let's implement the function to determine this:

```python
def canMakeAllZeros(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    
    if k > n and any(nums):  # If k is greater than n and there are non-zero elements, not possible
        return False
    
    flipRequired = sum(1 for num in nums if num != 0)
    
    # If flipRequired is zero or k is 1, it is always possible
    if flipRequired == 0 or k == 1:
        return True
    
    def canBeMadeZero():
        # If flipRequired is odd and k is even, return False
        if flipRequired % 2 != 0 and k % 2 == 0:
            return False
        # Check within combinations if at any point all can be zero
        for i in range(k, n+1):
            if flipRequired % i == 0:  # If flipRequired can make k times equal splits
                return True
        return False
    
    return canBeMadeZero()

# Example Test Case
nums = [3, 4, 5, -5, -4, -3]
k = 2
print(canMakeAllZeros(nums, k))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Best Case**: If `k == 1`, the time complexity is O(1) because we can directly know the result.
2. **Worst Case**: O(n) where n is the length of the array when checking various combinations and splits.

Key Takeaway: The implementation tries to handle intermediate checks and feasibility scenarios, leveraging parity and combination possibilities.
