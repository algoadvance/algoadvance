title:  Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0-out
permalink: /s2571
---

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to reduce an integer `n` to zero. The available operations allow:
1. Adding 1 to the integer.
2. Subtracting 1 from the integer.
3. Doubling the integer.
4. Halving the integer (if it is even).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input:** What is the range of input integer \(n\)? (e.g., is \(n\) non-negative, and within a certain limit like \(0 \leq n \leq 10^6\)?)
2. **Negative numbers:** Should the algorithm handle negative integers, or is it supposed to only handle non-negative integers?
3. **Exact operations considered:** Only `+1`, `-1`, `*2` (doubling), and `/2` (halving if even) are allowed. Correct?

For the purpose of implementation, unless specified otherwise, I will assume the integer \( n \) is a non-negative integer.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) method, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here is the reasoning:
1. Treat each integer as a node in an unweighted graph.
2. Each allowed operation represents an edge to another node (integer).
3. Use BFS to explore the minimum number of edges (operations) from `n` to `0`.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize a queue and start with the node representing the integer \( n \).
2. Maintain a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid re-processing.
3. Process each node by trying all possible operations:
   - `+1`
   - `-1`
   - `*2` (doubling)
   - `/2` (halving if even)
4. Keep track of the number of operations taken.
5. Stop processing when zero is reached.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def min_operations_to_reduce_to_zero(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque([(n, 0)])  # (current value, operation count)
    visited = set()
    visited.add(n)
    
    while queue:
        current, operations = queue.popleft()
        
        # Try all possible operations
        next_steps = [current + 1, current - 1, current * 2]
        if current % 2 == 0:
            next_steps.append(current // 2)
        
        for next_step in next_steps:
            if next_step == 0:
                return operations + 1
            if next_step not in visited:
                visited.add(next_step)
                queue.append((next_step, operations + 1))
    
    # This return is never reached as we assume n >= 0 and we can always reach 0.
    return -1

# Example usage:
n = 10
print(min_operations_to_reduce_to_zero(n))  # Output: For n = 10, example output can be 4 (10 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2 -> 0)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Each operation can be seen as potentially adding up to 4 nodes regarding each value, assuming the worst case (n being large).
  - However, BFS ensures that each node (value) is processed only once due to the visited set which translates to linear traversal relative to the magnitude of `n`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - Reflecting the size of the queue and the visited set to handle up to `n` nodes in the worst case.
