title:  Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K-out
permalink: /s2310
---

Given two integers `num` and `k`, return the sum of all integers `x` in the range `[1, num]` such that the last digit of `x` is `k`. If there are no such integers, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Inclusivity**: Does the range `[1, num]` include both 1 and `num`?
    - *Yes, it includes both 1 and `num`.* 

2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `num` and `k`?
    - `1 <= num <= 10000`
    - `0 <= k <= 9`

3. **Expected Output for Edge Cases**: What if `k` is not a valid last digit in the given range?
    - If `k` is not a last digit of any number in the range `[1, num]`, return `0`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Loop Through the Range**: Iterate through each number in the range `[1, num]`.
2. **Check Last Digit**: For each number, check if its last digit is `k`.
3. **Sum the Valid Numbers**: If the last digit of the number is `k`, add it to a running total sum.
4. **Return Result**: After checking all numbers in the range, return the accumulated sum.

### Code

Here is the Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def sum_of_numbers_with_units_digit_k(num: int, k: int) -> int:
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        if i % 10 == k:  # Check if the units digit is k
            total_sum += i
    return total_sum
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number `num`. This is because we iterate through each number in the range `[1, num]` to check the last digit and potentially add it to the sum.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a few variables to hold the sum and iterate through the range.

### Example

Let's run through an example with this function:

```python
# Example
print(sum_of_numbers_with_units_digit_k(20, 2))  # Output: 22 (2 + 12)
```

The function will sum the numbers `2` and `12` within the given range, as both have a units digit of `2`. The result is `14`.
