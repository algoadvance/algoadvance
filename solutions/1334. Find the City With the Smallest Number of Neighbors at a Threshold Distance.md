title:  Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance-out
permalink: /s1334
---

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of cities and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `from_i` and `to_i`. You are also given an integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of neighbors at a distance `threshold` or less from the city. If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - `n` can be up to 100.
   
2. **Can the weights of the edges be negative?**
   - No, all weights are positive (as it represents a distance).

3. **Is the city's own distance considered a neighbor?**
   - No, a city is not considered its own neighbor.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is efficient for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of cities in a graph. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialize Distance Matrix:** Start by initializing a distance matrix `dist` where each `dist[i][j]` represents the distance between city `i` and city `j`. If there is no direct edge between `i` and `j`, the distance should be set to infinity, except for `dist[i][i]` which should be 0.

2. **Populate Initial Distances:** Populate the distance matrix using the given edges.

3. **Apply Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** Update the distance matrix by considering each city as an intermediate point. This will give the shortest distance between any two cities.

4. **Count Neighbors:** For each city, count the number of neighbors within the given distance threshold.

5. **Select the City:** Find the city with the smallest number of neighbors. In case of a tie, select the city with the greatest number.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation to solve the problem:

```python
def findTheCity(n, edges, distanceThreshold):
    # Step 1: Initialize the distance matrix
    dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dist[i][i] = 0
    
    # Step 2: Populate the distance matrix with the given edges
    for edge in edges:
        fr, to, weight = edge
        dist[fr][to] = weight
        dist[to][fr] = weight
    
    # Step 3: Apply Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
    
    # Step 4: Count the number of neighbors within the distance threshold for each city
    min_neighbors = float('inf')
    result_city = 0
    for i in range(n):
        count = sum(1 for j in range(n) if i != j and dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold)
        # If the count of neighbors is smaller, or same and city index is larger, update result_city
        if count < min_neighbors or (count == min_neighbors and i > result_city):
            min_neighbors = count
            result_city = i
    
    return result_city
```

### Time Complexity

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\) which is efficient given the constraints (`n` up to 100). Initializing and populating the distance matrix have a complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and \(O(m)\) respectively, where \(m\) is the number of edges.

- **Initialization of the distance matrix:** \(O(n^2)\)
- **Populating initial distances:** \(O(m)\)
- **Floyd-Warshall algorithm:** \(O(n^3)\)
- **Counting neighbors and finding the city:** \(O(n^2)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^3)\).
