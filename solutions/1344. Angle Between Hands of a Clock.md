title:  Angle Between Hands of a Clock-out
permalink: /s1344

Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand on a clock.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input range**:
    - `hour`: Is it guaranteed to be between 1 and 12?
    - `minutes`: Is it guaranteed to be between 0 and 59?
    
    Yes, the `hour` is between `1` and `12`, and `minutes` is between `0` and `59`.

2. **Output**:
    - Should the output be a float representing the angle in degrees?
    
    Yes, the function should return a float representing the angle in degrees.

3. **Behavior on edge cases**:
    - If the hands overlap, should the angle be `0` degrees?
    
    Yes, if the hands overlap (e.g., exactly 12:00), the angle should be `0` degrees.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the positions of the hour and minute hands**:
    - The minute hand moves 6 degrees per minute (`360 degrees / 60 minutes`).
    - The hour hand moves 30 degrees per hour (`360 degrees / 12 hours`) plus 0.5 degrees per minute (`30 degrees / 60 minutes`).

2. **Compute the absolute difference**:
    - Compute the absolute difference between the two angles.
    - Since a clock is circular, the maximum possible angle is `360 degrees`, and the angle between the hands can be at most `180 degrees` (the smaller angle).

3. **Return the smaller angle**:
    - If the computed angle is greater than `180 degrees`, return `360 degrees - angle` to get the smaller angle.

### Code

```python
def angleClock(hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:
    # Calculating the minute hand's position in degrees
    minute_angle = minutes * 6  # 360 degrees / 60 minutes
    
    # Calculating the hour hand's position in degrees
    hour_angle = (hour % 12) * 30 + (minutes / 60) * 30  # 360 degrees / 12 hours + 0.5 degree per minute
    
    # Calculating the absolute difference between the two angles
    angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)
    
    # The smaller angle between the two possible angles
    return min(angle, 360 - angle)

# Example usage:
# print(angleClock(3, 30))  # Expected output: 75.0
# print(angleClock(12, 45))  # Expected output: 112.5
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the calculations involve a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons, regardless of the input values.
