title:  Sum of Digits in Base K-out
permalink: /s1837
---

Given an integer `n` (in decimal base) and an integer `k` (the base to convert `n` to), return the sum of the digits of `n` after converting `n` from decimal to base `k`.

### Example:
1. **Input:** `n = 34`, `k = 6`
   **Output:** `9`
   
   **Explanation:** `34` in base `6` is `54`, which sums to `5 + 4 = 9`.

2. **Input:** `n = 10`, `k = 10`
   **Output:** `1`
   
   **Explanation:** `10` in base `10` is `10`, which sums to `1 + 0 = 1`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100000`
- `2 <= k <= 10`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the output be a single integer representing the sum of the digits?
2. Are there any special cases we should account for, such as `n` being a power of `k`?

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to perform the following steps:
1. Convert `n` from decimal to the given base `k`.
2. Extract each digit of the converted number.
3. Sum the extracted digits.
4. Return the sum.

### Steps to Convert from Decimal to Base `k`:
1. Continuously divide the number `n` by `k` and record the remainders.
2. The remainders will represent the digits of the number in base `k` from least significant to most significant.
3. Finally, sum these remainders (digits) to get the required result.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for converting a number to a different base is `O(log_k n)` due to repeated division. Summing the digits will also take `O(log_k n)`. Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(log_k n)`.

## Code

```python
def sum_base_k(n, k):
    # Initialize sum of digits to 0
    sum_digits = 0
    
    # Convert to base k and sum the digits
    while n > 0:
        remainder = n % k
        sum_digits += remainder
        n //= k
    
    return sum_digits

# Test the function with the given examples
print(sum_base_k(34, 6))  # Should print 9
print(sum_base_k(10, 10)) # Should print 1
```

This code defines a function `sum_base_k` that converts `n` from decimal to base `k` and then sums its digits. It uses a loop to repeatedly divide the number by `k`, collecting remainders, summing them, and then reducing the number until it is zero.
