title:  Recover the Original Array-out
permalink: /s2122
---

You are given an array of integers resulted from the concatenation of two integer arrays `original` and `shuffle`. One of these arrays was sorted in non-decreasing order, and the other one was shuffled (possibly into non-ordered state). You need to recover and return the `original` array that was sorted.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can we assume that the input array is not empty?
   - Are there any guarantees about the length of the `original` array, such as its length always being even?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Can we assume that the expected output array should only include the sorted part of the concatenated input array, or the entire `original` array?

### Example
Let's consider an example: 
- Input: `[1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2]` 
- Output: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]`

Based on this example, it seems the returned array consists of the sorted array that can be mapped back into the original array.

### Strategy

1. **Sort and Frequency Counting**:
   - Use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the array.
   - Sort the array of elements.
2. **Determine the Original Elements**:
   - Iterate through the sorted array and use a second iterator to find elements that can form pairs with the current elements based on their counts in the frequency counter.
   - If a minimum frequency constraint (>=2 for pairs) is met, add pairs to the result list.
3. **Repeat for Each Frequency Pair**:
   - Deduct the used elements from the frequency counter and continue until all elements are matched into the `original` list.

### Code

Below is the Python code that recovers the `original` array:

```python
from collections import Counter

def recoverArray(nums):
    # Step 1: Count frequencies of elements and sort nums
    freq = Counter(nums)
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    
    for k in range(1, len(sorted_nums)):
        possible_k = sorted_nums[k] - sorted_nums[0]
        if possible_k <= 0 or possible_k % 2 != 0:
            continue  # since k must be positive integer and even
        
        k //= 2
        freq_temp = freq.copy()
        original = []
        valid = True
        
        for num in sorted_nums:
            if freq_temp[num] == 0:
                continue
            
            if freq_temp[num + 2 * k] == 0:
                valid = False
                break
            
            original.append(num + k)  # part of original array is calculated from num + k
            freq_temp[num] -= 1
            freq_temp[num + 2 * k] -= 1
        
        if valid: 
            return original

    return []

# Example
print(recoverArray([1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Frequency Counting** and **Iterating** through the array takes \(O(n)\).
- **Total Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.

By following this approach, we effectively find the original sorted array in the most efficient way possible given the constraints.
