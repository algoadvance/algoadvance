You are given an `n x n` graph represented by an adjacency matrix, where `graph[u]` is a list of nodes `v` such that there is an edge between node `u` and node `v`. Return `true` if the graph is bipartite. A graph is bipartite if we can split its set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the graph connected?**: No, the graph can be disconnected.
2. **Can the input size be very large?**: Yes, the input size can be large, but it will typically fit within the constraints of LeetCode problems.
3. **Can the graph have self-loops or multiple edges between the same nodes?**: No, the graph is an undirected simple graph.

### Strategy
To determine if a graph is bipartite, we can use a two-coloring technique. We will try to color the graph using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. This can be done using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). 

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a color array to keep track of the coloring of each node. Initialize all values to -1 indicating that no node is colored initially.

2. **BFS or DFS Traversal**:
   - For each node, if it hasnâ€™t been colored yet, color it with one color (say 0) and use BFS or DFS to attempt to color all its neighbors with the opposite color (say 1).
   - If we find a neighboring node that has already been colored with the same color, then the graph is not bipartite.

3. **Handle Unconnected Nodes**:
   - The graph might be disconnected, so we must ensure we check all components of the graph.

### Code
Here's the implementation using BFS:

```python
from collections import deque

def isBipartite(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    color = [-1] * n  # Color array to store colors of nodes, -1 means uncolored

    for start in range(n):
        if color[start] == -1:  # Uncolored node, start a BFS/DFS from here
            queue = deque([start])
            color[start] = 0  # Start coloring with 0
            
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if color[neighbor] == -1:
                        # Color with the opposite color
                        color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]
                        queue.append(neighbor)
                    elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:
                        # If neighbor has the same color, graph is not bipartite
                        return False
                        
    return True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. Each node and each edge is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V)`, for storing the color array and the queue.

This ensures we handle both connected and disconnected components by initiating a BFS search from every uncolored node.
