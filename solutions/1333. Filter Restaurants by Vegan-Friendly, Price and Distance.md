title:  Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance-out
permalink: /s1333
---

You are given a list of restaurants, where each restaurant is represented with a tuple consisting of its id, rating, vegan-friendly status, price, and distance. Your task is to filter and sort these restaurants based on several criteria:
- The restaurant should be vegan-friendly or not.
- The restaurant's price should be within a given maximum price.
- The restaurant's distance should be within a given maximum distance.

The filtered restaurants should then be sorted primarily by rating (in descending order) and secondarily by id (in descending order).

Your function should return the list of restaurant ids that meet the criteria.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the list of restaurants be empty?
2. What is the expected type and structure of the input and output?
3. Are the ids of the restaurants unique?

### Assumptions
1. The list of restaurants can possibly be empty.
2. Input will be in the form of a list of tuples and some filter constraints, and the output will be a list of integers.
3. Restaurant ids are unique.

### Strategy
1. **Input Parsing**: Read the input list of restaurants and filter criteria.
2. **Filtering**:
   - Filter out restaurants that are not vegan-friendly if the filter criterion requires.
   - Filter out restaurants that exceed the maximum price.
   - Filter out restaurants that exceed the maximum distance.
3. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the remaining restaurants first by rating (descending) and then by id (descending).
4. **Extracting IDs**: Collect the ids of the sorted and filtered restaurants.
5. **Return**: Return the list of restaurant ids.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for filtering is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of restaurants. Sorting the filtered list will take \(O(m \log m)\), where \(m\) is the size of the filtered list. Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\).

### Python Code

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def filterRestaurants(restaurants: List[Tuple[int, int, int, int, int]], veganFriendly: int, maxPrice: int, maxDistance: int) -> List[int]:
    filtered_restaurants = []
    
    for r in restaurants:
        id, rating, vegan, price, distance = r
        if (veganFriendly == 0 or vegan == 1) and price <= maxPrice and distance <= maxDistance:
            filtered_restaurants.append(r)
    
    # Sort first by rating (descending) and then by id (descending)
    filtered_restaurants.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]), reverse=True)
    
    # Return the list of restaurant ids
    return [r[0] for r in filtered_restaurants]

# Example usage
restaurants = [
    (1, 4, 1, 40, 10),
    (2, 8, 0, 50, 5),
    (3, 8, 1, 30, 4),
    (4, 10, 0, 10, 3),
    (5, 11, 1, 15, 1)
]

veganFriendly = 1
maxPrice = 50
maxDistance = 10

print(filterRestaurants(restaurants, veganFriendly, maxPrice, maxDistance))
# Expected output: [3, 1, 5]
```

This code filters the list of restaurants based on the provided conditions and sorts them as required before returning the list of restaurant ids.
