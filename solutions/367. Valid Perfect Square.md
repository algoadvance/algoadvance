title:  Valid Perfect Square-out
permalink: /s367
---
Given a positive integer `num`, write a function which returns True if `num` is a perfect square else False.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 16
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 14
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should the function handle inputs less than 1?
   **A:** No, based on the constraints, `num` will always be 1 or greater.
   
2. **Q:** Can we use libraries like `math.sqrt` for this problem?
   **A:** You should avoid using the `sqrt` function directly to showcase algorithmic thinking.

3. **Q:** How should the function behave if `num` is 1?
   **A:** Since 1 is a perfect square (1 * 1 = 1), the function should return `True` for an input of 1.

### Strategy
We can determine if a number is a perfect square by leveraging a binary search algorithm. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Binary Search Initialization:** Initialize two pointers, `left` starting at 1 and `right` starting at `num`.
2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
   - Compute the square of `mid`.
   - If `mid * mid` equals `num`, return `True`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than `num`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `num`, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
3. **Termination:** If the loop ends without finding a perfect square, return `False`.

### Code
```python
def isPerfectSquare(num: int) -> bool:
    if num == 1:
        return True
    
    left, right = 1, num
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid_squared = mid * mid
        
        if mid_squared == num:
            return True
        elif mid_squared < num:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return False
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Complexity:** The binary search approach works in O(log num) time complexity because we halve the search space with each step.

This optimized solution ensures that we can efficiently determine if the given number is a perfect square or not.
