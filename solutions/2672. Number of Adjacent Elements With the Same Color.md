title:  Number of Adjacent Elements With the Same Color-out

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You must update the array in the following way:

* For every index `i` in the range `[0, nums.length - 1]`, change `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + k`.

After the update, count and return the number of adjacent pairs of elements that are equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`?**
   - `nums` can contain any integer values, and `k` is also an integer.

2. **What should be returned if there are no adjacent pairs that are equal?**
   - Return `0`.

3. **Can `nums` be an empty array?**
   - No. The problem states `0 <= nums.length`, so we will not consider the empty array case.

4. **Will `nums` have at least one element?**
   - Yes, but we should be prepared to handle single-element arrays.

### Strategy

1. First, update each element in `nums` by adding `k` to it.
2. Traverse the updated `nums` array and count the number of adjacent pairs that are equal.
3. Return the count.

### Code

```python
def count_adjacent_pairs(nums, k):
    # Update the nums array by adding k to each element
    updated_nums = [num + k for num in nums]
    
    # Initialize the count of adjacent pairs
    count = 0
    
    # Traverse the updated_nums to count adjacent pairs that are equal
    for i in range(len(updated_nums) - 1):
        if updated_nums[i] == updated_nums[i + 1]:
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
k = 1
print(count_adjacent_pairs(nums, k))  # Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Updating the Array**: This takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Counting Adjacent Pairs**: This also takes `O(n)` time since we need to check each pair.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
