title:  Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging-out
permalink: /s1846
---

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of positive integers `arr`. Perform the following operations any number of times to maximize the largest element in the array:
1. Decrease the value of any element of the array to any value greater than 0 (including leaving it unchanged).
2. Rearrange the array elements in any order.

Return the maximum possible value of the largest element in the array that can be achieved.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Do all elements need to be greater than 0 after performing decreases?**
   - Yes, all elements must be greater than 0.
  
2. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array `arr`?**
   - Usually, LeetCode problems have constraints. For example, `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`.

3. **Can we assume the input array `arr` is not empty?**
   - Yes, based on the typical constraints, the array will have at least one element.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, consider these points:
1. **Sort the Array**: Begin by sorting the array. Sorting helps us deal with the elements in ascending order, making it easier to ensure the condition `arr[i+1] - arr[i] <= 1` after potential decreases.
2. **Adjust Elements**: After sorting, iterate through the sorted array and ensure that each element is at most 1 greater than the previous element. This guarantees maximum possible value for the largest element.
   - Set the first element to 1.
   - For each subsequent element, ensure its value is at most 1 more than the previous element.
   
### Code
Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(arr):
    arr.sort()
    arr[0] = 1  # The first element should be 1

    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        arr[i] = min(arr[i], arr[i - 1] + 1)

    return arr[-1]

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]
print(maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(arr))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Iteration through the array**: `O(n)`
- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, thus it is `O(n log n)`.

### Summary
1. Sort the array.
2. Adjust each element to be at most 1 more than the previous element starting from 1.
3. The last element in this adjusted array will be the maximum possible value.
4. The time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
