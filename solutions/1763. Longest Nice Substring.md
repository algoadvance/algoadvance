title:  Longest Nice Substring-out
permalink: /s1763
---

You are given a string `s`. A substring of `s` is called nice if it contains both lowercase and uppercase characters for every letter that appears in the substring. For example, "Bb" is a nice substring, but "BbA" is not because there's no lowercase "a". Return the longest nice substring of `s`. If there are multiple longest nice substrings, return any of them. If there are none, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are all input strings guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, the input string `s` is guaranteed to be non-empty.
  
2. What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
   - The maximum length of the input string `s` is 100.

3. In case of ties (multiple substrings of the same maximum length), can we return any of them?
   - Yes, if there are multiple substrings of the same maximum length, returning any one of them is acceptable.

### Strategy

To find the longest nice substring:
1. We can use a recursive approach to break the problem into smaller parts:
   - If the string `s` is nice, then return `s`.
   - If not, find a character that breaks the "nice" condition and split the string at that character.
   - Recursively apply the same process to each substring resulting from the split.
   - Return the longest nice substring found from these substrings.

2. For each string segment:
   - Check if it satisfies the "nice" condition (every character must appear in both uppercase and lowercase).
   - Recursively evaluate substrings when the condition is not met.

### Code

```python
def longestNiceSubstring(s: str) -> str:
    def is_nice(sub: str) -> bool:
        char_set = set(sub)
        for ch in char_set:
            if ch.swapcase() not in char_set:
                return False
        return True
    
    def helper(sub: str) -> str:
        if is_nice(sub):
            return sub
        max_len_nice_sub = ""
        for i in range(len(sub)):
            if not is_nice(sub[:i+1]):
                continue
            left_result = helper(sub[:i])
            right_result = helper(sub[i+1:])
            if len(left_result) > len(max_len_nice_sub):
                max_len_nice_sub = left_result
            if len(right_result) > len(max_len_nice_sub):
                max_len_nice_sub = right_result
        return max_len_nice_sub
    
    longest_nice_substring = helper(s)
    return longest_nice_substring

# Example usage:
s = "YazaAay"
print(longestNiceSubstring(s))  # Output could be "aAa" or "Aa"
```

### Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity:

- The function `is_nice` has a time complexity of O(N) in the worst-case scenario, where N is the length of the string.
- The worst-case scenario of the recursive `helper` function involves splitting the string in all possible ways, leading to a recursive depth and breadth both approximately equal to the length of `s`, meaning it leads to an exponential time complexity.

Overall, the time complexity can be approximated as O(N * 2^N) in the worst case, making this a relatively high computational approach. However, given the constraint of string length up to 100, this method can be practical.
