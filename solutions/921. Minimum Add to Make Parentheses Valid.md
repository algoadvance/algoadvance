title:  Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid-out
permalink: /s921
---
Given a string `s` of `(` and `)` parentheses, write a function to check how many minimum additions are required to make the parentheses string valid.

A parentheses string is considered valid if:
1. Every opening parenthesis `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`.
2. Opening parentheses must be closed in the correct order.

The function should return an integer representing the minimum number of parentheses `(` or `)` that must be added to make the string valid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is the string `s` non-empty?
    - Can the string contain characters other than `(` and `)`?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - The result should be a single integer representing the minimum number of additions needed.

3. **Examples**:
    - For the input `"())"`, the output should be `1`.
    - For the input `"((("`, the output should be `3`.

### Code
Here's the initial implementation of the solution:

```python
def minAddToMakeValid(s: str) -> int:
    # Variable to keep track of the balance of parentheses
    balance = 0
    # Variable to keep the count of additions needed
    additions = 0
    
    # Traverse through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            # If it's an opening parenthesis, increase the balance
            balance += 1
        else:
            # If it's a closing parenthesis, decrease the balance
            balance -= 1
            
        # If balance goes negative, we have an unmatched closing parenthesis
        if balance == -1:
            additions += 1
            balance = 0
    
    # Add the remaining unbalanced opening parentheses to results
    return additions + balance
```

### Strategy
1. **Balancing Parentheses**:
    - Utilize a `balance` counter that adjusts with the type of parenthesis: increment for `(` and decrement for `)`.
    - Track `additions` required for balancing with extra `)` and reset the `balance` when necessary.

2. **Handling Remaining Balances**:
    - After traversing the string, any positive balance indicates unmatched `(`, which also needs to be added to the `additions`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We traverse each character of the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we use only a couple of extra variables (`balance` and `additions`) regardless of the input size. 

This solution is efficient and should work well within typical input constraints.
