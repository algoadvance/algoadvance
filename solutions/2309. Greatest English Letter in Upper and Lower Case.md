title:  Greatest English Letter in Upper and Lower Case-out
permalink: /s2309
---

Given a string `s` of English letters, return the greatest English letter which occurs as both a lowercase and uppercase letter in `s`. The returned letter should be in uppercase. If no such letter exists, return an empty string.

### Example 1:
- Input: `s = "lEeTcOdE"`
- Output: `"E"`

### Example 2:
- Input: `s = "arRAzFif"`
- Output: `"R"`

### Example 3:
- Input: `s = "AbCdEfGhIjK"`
- Output: `""`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the length of the string?**  
   The length of the string `s` can vary but will be constrained by typical LeetCode input limits (usually up to \(10^5\)).

2. **Is the string case-sensitive initially?**  
   Yes, the string contains both uppercase and lowercase English letters and is case-sensitive initially.

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple valid letters?**  
   The greatest letter (lexicographically) occurring in both cases should be returned in uppercase.

4. **Are there any constraints on the contents of the string?**  
   The string `s` consists only of English letters.

## Strategy:

1. **Utilize Sets for Lookup:**
   - Store the characters seen in the string using a set for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
   
2. **Iterate and Compare:**
   - Iterate through the alphabet from 'Z' to 'A'.
   - Check if both the uppercase and lowercase versions of each letter are in the set.
   - Return the first such letter found.

3. **Return Default:**
   - If no matching letter is found throughout the iteration, return an empty string.

This approach ensures we check for the lexicographically greatest letter due to the reverse iteration through the alphabet.

## Code:

```python
def greatestLetter(s: str) -> str:
    seen = set(s)
    
    for char in range(ord('Z'), ord('A') - 1, -1):
        upper = chr(char)
        lower = chr(char + 32)  # ASCII difference between uppercase and lowercase
        if upper in seen and lower in seen:
            return upper
            
    return ""

# Test cases
print(greatestLetter("lEeTcOdE"))  # Output: "E"
print(greatestLetter("arRAzFif"))  # Output: "R"
print(greatestLetter("AbCdEfGhIjK"))  # Output: ""
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + 26), which simplifies to O(n), where n is the length of the string. This results from the initial O(n) time to populate the set and the constant time O(26) to iterate from 'Z' to 'A'.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to storing the characters of the string in the set.

This solution ensures efficient performance even for large input sizes.
