title:  Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND-out
permalink: /s1835
---
Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the XOR sum of all pairs bitwise AND is the XOR of `(a & b)` for every `a` in `arr1` and every `b` in `arr2`.

Let's break this down:
- For each element `a` in `arr1` and each element `b` in `arr2`, compute the bitwise AND (`&`) and then find the XOR of all these results.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the arrays contain negative numbers?
   - It is typically safe to assume only non-negative integers based on bitwise operations in the context of problems like these.
   
2. What will be the size range of the input arrays?
   - Ensure the method can handle input arrays up to the problem's constraints effectively.

3. Do we need to consider edge cases such as empty arrays?
   - How should the function behave if one or both arrays are empty?

### Strategy
1. **Understanding Pairwise Operations:**
   - For any two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, to compute the XOR of all pairwise AND results directly might seem daunting because of the potential size of arrays.
   
2. **Properties of XOR and AND:**
   - Note that bitwise XOR is commutative and associative.
   - `(a & b) âŠ• (c & d)` provides leading to potential optimizations by breaking down the problem.

3. **Optimization:**
   - One direct observation is analyzing the behavior of XOR when applied repeatedly. XOR sum of all pairs can be optimized by leveraging frequency of bits set in the array elements. However, direct application needs efficient caching and pre-computation mechanisms.

### Code
```python
def getXORSum(arr1, arr2):
    xor1 = 0
    xor2 = 0
    
    # XOR all elements in arr1
    for num in arr1:
        xor1 ^= num

    # XOR all elements in arr2
    for num in arr2:
        xor2 ^= num

    # Bitwise AND of the two results
    return xor1 & xor2
```

### Explanation
1. **Compute XOR for Each Array:**
   - Compute the XOR of all elements in `arr1` resulting in `xor1`.
   - Compute the XOR of all elements in `arr2` resulting in `xor2`.

2. **Final Result:**
   - The XOR sum of all pairs bitwise AND is given by the XOR of `xor1` and `xor2`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of `arr1` and `arr2` respectively. This is because we pass over each element exactly once to compute the XOR.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using only a fixed amount of additional space.

By leveraging these XOR properties and summarizing the operations into linear passes, we achieve a significantly more efficient solution.
