There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are ratings distinct?**
   - No, multiple children might have the same rating.

2. **Can the rating array be empty?**
   - No, the problem states there are `n` children which implies `ratings` will have at least one element.

3. **What is the range of values in `ratings`?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but ratings can generally be assumed to be non-negative integers.

4. **Any constraints on the size of the `ratings` array?**
   - Typically, for LeetCode problems, `1 <= len(ratings) <= 2 * 10^4`.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Assignment**: Start by assigning one candy to each child because each child must get at least one candy.
   
2. **Left to Right Pass**: Traverse from left to right. Whenever a child has a higher rating than the previous child, increment the candy count for the current child by 1 more than the previous child.

3. **Right to Left Pass**: Traverse from right to left. Whenever a child has a higher rating than the next child, ensure the current child has more candies than the next child by setting the current child's candy count to be the maximum of its current candies and one more than the next childâ€™s candies.

4. **Sum Up**: Sum all values to get the minimum number of candies required.

## Code

```python
def candy(ratings):
    n = len(ratings)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    candies = [1] * n
    
    # Left to Right pass
    for i in range(1, n):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]:
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1
            
    # Right to Left pass
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]:
            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
            
    return sum(candies)

# Example usage:
ratings = [1, 0, 2]
print(candy(ratings))  # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We have two linear passes over the `ratings` array (one from left to right and one from right to left).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use extra space for the `candies` array which stores the number of candies each child gets.

By following these steps, we ensure that the candy distribution satisfies both conditions and is done using minimal candies.
