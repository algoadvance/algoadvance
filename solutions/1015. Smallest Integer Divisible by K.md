title:  Smallest Integer Divisible by K-out
permalink: /s1015
---

Given a positive integer `K`, you need to find the smallest positive integer `N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit `1`. If there is no such `N`, return `-1`.

For example:
- Input: `K = 3`
- Output: `3`

- Input: `K = 2`
- Output: `-1`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum value of K?**
    - The problem constraints do not explicitly state the maximum value of `K`, but it's reasonable to assume that `K` can be a large number within the limits of standard integer sizes in programming (i.e., up to 10^5 or 10^9).
    
2. **What should be the return type?**
    - The return type should be an integer: the smallest `N` divisible by `K` or `-1` if no such `N` exists.
    
3. **Can K be 1?**
    - Yes, if `K = 1`, the smallest `N` is `1`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, observe the properties of numbers consisting entirely of the digit `1`. For example, the numbers are `1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ...`. These can be represented as:
- \(1\)
- \(11 / 10^1 + 1\)
- \(111 / 10^2 + 11 / 10^1 + 1\)
- ...
  
To find such a number `N` which is divisible by `K`, the algorithm needs to:
1. Start with the number `1`.
2. Check if it is divisible by `K`.
3. If not, keep generating the next number by appending `1` and checking for divisibility until we either find such an `N` or determine it is not possible (it cycles endlessly without finding a solution).

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing this strategy:

```python
def smallestRepunitDivByK(K: int) -> int:
    if K % 2 == 0 or K % 5 == 0:
        return -1
    
    repunit = 1
    length = 1
    remainder_set = set()
    
    while True:
        remainder = repunit % K
        if remainder == 0:
            return length
        if remainder in remainder_set:
            return -1
        
        remainder_set.add(remainder)
        repunit = (repunit * 10 + 1) % K
        length += 1

# Example test cases
print(smallestRepunitDivByK(3))  # Output: 3
print(smallestRepunitDivByK(2))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is determined by the number of iterations needed.
- In the worst case, the algorithm performs a maximum of `K` iterations because there are only `K` possible remainders when dividing by `K`.
- Hence, the time complexity is `O(K)`, where `K` is the divisor.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity mainly results from storing the remainders seen so far.
- In the worst case, it also stores up to `K` unique remainders, so the space complexity is `O(K)`.

This solution systematically builds the smallest possible number fitting the criteria and efficiently checks for repetitions to determine impossibilities.
