title:  Check If It Is a Good Array-out
permalink: /s1250

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. A good array is an array where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements is 1. Return `True` if the given array is a good array, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before providing a solution, it’s important to clarify a few things to ensure we’re on the right track:
1. **Array Size**: Is there a constraint on the size of the array? Typically, this could affect the efficiency of the solution.
2. **Element Size**: What are the constraints on the values of the elements in the array (e.g., maximum and minimum values)?
3. **Empty Array**: How should the function handle an empty array?

Let’s assume:
- The array will always contain positive integers.
- The size of the array can be from 1 to \(10^5\).
- The elements will be positive integers less than \(10^9\).

### Strategy
1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - To check if the array is a good array, we need to find the GCD of the entire array. 
   - If the GCD of the entire array is 1, then it’s a good array; otherwise, it's not.
  
2. **Iterative GCD Calculation**:
   - We can utilize the Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD of two numbers.
   - For an array of numbers, we can iteratively compute the GCD of the current number with the GCD of the numbers seen so far.
  
3. **Efficiency**:
   - The Euclidean algorithm for GCD runs in \(O(\log \min(a, b))\).
   - Since we need to compute the GCD iteratively for the whole array, the overall time complexity will be \(O(n \log M)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(M\) is the maximum element in the array.

### Code
Let’s write the code to solve the problem using the strategy described.

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def isGoodArray(nums):
    # Use reduce to iteratively find the GCD of the entire array
    overall_gcd = reduce(gcd, nums)
    return overall_gcd == 1
```

### Time Complexity
- The **time complexity** of this approach is \(O(n \log M)\).
  - \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
  - \(M\) is the maximum value in the array.
  
This complexity comes from computing the GCD iteratively for each element with the accumulated GCD so far.

### Explanation
- **reduce(gcd, nums)**: This function call will reduce the list `nums` by applying the `gcd` function cumulatively to the items of `nums`, from left to right, so as to reduce the array to a single GCD value.
- If the GCD of the entire array is 1, then we return `True` indicating it's a good array, otherwise `False`.

This solution should correctly determine whether the given array is a "good array" as defined in the problem statement.
