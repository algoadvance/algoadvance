title:  Maximize the Topmost Element After K Moves-out
permalink: /s2202
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` representing a stack, and an integer `k`. You are allowed to pop the topmost element of the stack up to `k` times. If the stack is empty in a move operation, you cannot pop an element. After you have made at most `k` moves, you should return the maximum value of the topmost element of the stack. 

If the stack becomes empty and you still have moves left, you cannot pop an element, and continuing to use moves will not change the result.

Return the maximum possible value of the topmost element of the stack after performing the move operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What should be returned if the stack is initially empty?
   **A**: Since the stack is non-empty based on the problem statement, we don't need to handle this case.
   
2. **Q**: What should be returned if the stack is empty in the middle of moves?
   **A**: You should manage the remaining moves without changing the result since you cannot pop anymore and just need to return the current max top.

3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the value of k?
   **A**: While not explicitly mentioned, you can assume typical competitive programming constraints (e.g., array length can be up to \(10^5\)).

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Constraints**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, after `len(nums)` pops the stack will be empty unless you exercise the remaining moves without effect. We disregard such scenarios directly.
   
2. **Observation**:
   - For `k == 0`, the topmost element is `nums[0]`.
   - For `k == 1`, pop 1 element, leaving `nums[1]` as the new topmost.
   - For `k > 1`, you can pop `k` elements or fewer:
     - In that case, you'll need to consider elements in `nums[0:k-1]` (since you can pop up to `k-1` elements and see the next element through them).

3. **Iterative Solution**:
   - Let `potential_max` capture the max value in `nums[0:k-1]`.
   - If `k` is less than the size of `nums`, also consider `nums[k]` since after `k-1` pops you can push `nums[k]` to the top.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` exceeds the length of the stack, you can examine `min(len(nums)-1, k-1)` based elements and all are potentially popped if they leave the stack empty.
   - If `len(nums)` is greater than `k`, consider up to `num[k]`.

### Code

```python
def maximize_top(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Edge case: If k is 0, return the top element since no moves are allowed.
    if k == 0:
        return nums[0]
    
    # If k is 1, return the element after 1 pop. Only possible if we have 2 or more elements.
    if k == 1:
        return nums[1] if n > 1 else -1
    
    # For large k which empties the entire stack or more
    if k >= n:
        return max(nums[:k-1]) if k > n else max(nums[:k])
        
    # General case
    potential_max = max(nums[:k-1])
    # Consider the kth element if k < length
    if k < n:
        potential_max = max(potential_max, nums[k])
        
    return potential_max
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best and Average Case**: \(O(\min(k, n))\)
- **Worst Case**: \(O(n)\) where `n` is the length of `nums`.

We ensure that all elements that can influence the outcome are considered, and efficiently calculate the maximum top element after `k` moves.
