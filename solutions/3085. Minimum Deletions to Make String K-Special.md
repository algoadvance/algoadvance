title:  Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special-out
permalink: /s3085
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to delete the minimum number of characters from `s` such that the resulting string is k-special. A string is defined as k-special if no character appears more than `k` times consecutively in it.

For example, for `s = "aaabbbaaa"` and `k = 2`, the minimum number of deletions required to make `s` k-special is 4. One possible valid resulting string is "aabbaaa".

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the input string `s`?
   - What are the valid values for `k`?

2. **Character Set:**
   - Does the string `s` consist only of lowercase English letters?

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Is there a specific requirement on how the modified string should be returned, or is returning the minimum number of deletions sufficient?

4. **Edge Cases:** 
   - How should the solution handle cases where `k >= len(s)`?
   - How should the solution handle an empty string?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a cursor to iterate through the string.
   - Use a counter to keep track of consecutive character counts.
   
2. **Iterate through the string:**
   - Count each character's consecutive appearances.
   - If a character's consecutive count exceeds `k`, increase the deletion counter.
   
3. **Track Deletions:**
   - When the consecutive count of a character exceeds `k`, calculate the excess and add it to the deletion count.
   
4. **Return Result:**
   - Return the total number of deletions calculated.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the string `s`, as we only make a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since no additional space proportional to input size is used beyond a few counters.

## Code

```python
def min_deletions_to_make_k_special(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    if k == 0:  # If k is 0, we need to delete all characters if they appear more than 0 times.
        return len(s)
    
    deletions = 0
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    
    while i < n:
        current_char = s[i]
        count = 1
        
        # Count consecutive occurrences of the current character
        while i + 1 < n and s[i + 1] == current_char:
            count += 1
            i += 1
        
        # If count exceeds k, calculate required deletions
        if count > k:
            deletions += count - k
            
        # Move to the next sequence of characters
        i += 1
    
    return deletions

# Example usage
s = "aaabbbaaa"
k = 2
print(min_deletions_to_make_k_special(s, k))  # Output: 4
```

This code ensures that we count the consecutive characters and delete sufficient characters to ensure no character repeats more than `k` times consecutively, thus making the string k-special with the minimum deletions required.
