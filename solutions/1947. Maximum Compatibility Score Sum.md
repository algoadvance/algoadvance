title:  Maximum Compatibility Score Sum-out
permalink: /s1947
---

You are given two matrices `students` and `mentors`, both of size `m x n`. Each entry in these matrices will be either `0` or `1`. A compatibility score is calculated between a student and a mentor by comparing their responses, where the score is the number of same answers. Your task is to assign each student to a mentor such that the sum of all compatibility scores is maximized.

Return this maximum sum.

### Example:
Input:
```python
students = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,1]]
mentors = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
```

Output:
```python
8
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I assume that the number of students equals the number of mentors?**
   Yes, the problem constraints imply that the number of students is equal to the number of mentors.

2. **What is the range of m and n?**
   - `1 <= m, n <= 8`. This means backtracking or brute-force approaches might still be feasible.

3. **Can students or mentors have the same responses?**
   Yes, students or mentors can have the same responses, which does not affect the problem statement.

### Strategy

1. **Compatibility Score Calculation**:
   - For each pair of student and mentor, calculate the compatibility score by counting the number of positions where their answers match.

2. **Assignment**:
   - Since `m` and `n` are small (â‰¤ 8), we can afford to use backtracking or permutations to try all possible assignments of students to mentors and select the one with the highest compatibility score sum.

3. **Brute-Force with Permutations**:
   - Consider all permutations of mentors and calculate the compatibility score for each permutation.
   - Select the permutation with the highest total compatibility score.

### Code
Here's the implementation:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def maxCompatibilitySum(students, mentors):
    def compatibility(student, mentor):
        # Calculate the compatibility score for a student-mentor pair
        return sum(s == m for s, m in zip(student, mentor))
    
    m = len(students)
    n = len(students[0])
    
    max_score = 0
    # Generate all possible permutations of mentor assignments
    for perm in permutations(range(m)):
        current_score = sum(compatibility(students[i], mentors[perm[i]]) for i in range(m))
        max_score = max(max_score, current_score)
    
    return max_score

# Example usage
students = [[1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1]]
mentors = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]
print(maxCompatibilitySum(students, mentors)) # Output should be 8
```

### Time Complexity
- **Compatibility Score Calculation**: O(n), where n is the number of answers (length of sublists).
- **Permutation Generation and Evaluation**: O(m! * m * n), where m is the number of students and mentors. With `m` being at most 8, this results in at most `8! * 8 * n` operations, which is feasible.

The solution should be efficient given the constraints, leveraging the fact that both `m` and `n` have relatively small upper bounds.
