title:  Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets II-out
permalink: /s2909
---

Given a 2D grid of integers representing a mountainous terrain, we need to find the minimum sum of all elements in any triplet that forms a triangle in the grid. Each element in a triangle is a peak (local maximum) and is higher than its direct neighbors.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size constraint for the grid?**
   - Usually provided in the problem or within typical constraints such as \(1 \leq m, n \leq 1000\).
   
2. **What constitutes a "triangle" in this grid?**
   - Typically, a triangle may consist of three cells either forming a line or an L-shape but should adhere to problem specifications.
   
3. **Do we consider boundary cells for forming triangles?**
   - Could be excluded/ included based on the problem constraints.

4. **Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one valid triangle in the grid?**
   - Usually, yes but should validate if possible as edge cases.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Potential Triangles:**
   - Traverse the grid to detect peak cells. A peak is a cell that is greater than its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   
2. **Form Triplets:**
   - For each peak, form possible triplets with other peaks. The context might give additional specifics on allowable triplet shapes.

3. **Calculate Possible Sums:**
   - Compute the sum of elements for each valid triplet and track the minimum sum.

### Code

```python
def is_peak(grid, i, j, m, n):
    # Check if the given cell is a local peak
    deltas = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Up, Down, Left, Right
    current_value = grid[i][j]
    for di, dj in deltas:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and grid[ni][nj] >= current_value:
            return False
    return True

def minimum_sum_of_mountain_triplets(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return -1  # Edge case when grid is empty
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    peaks = []
    
    # Find all peak cells in the grid
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if is_peak(grid, i, j, m, n):
                peaks.append((i, j))
    
    if len(peaks) < 3:
        return -1  # Not enough peaks to form a triplet
    
    # Look for smallest sums
    min_sum = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate over all combinations of peaks to find valid triangles
    from itertools import combinations
    for combination in combinations(peaks, 3):
        # Extract peak values
        sum_triplet = sum(grid[i][j] for i, j in combination)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum_triplet)
    
    return min_sum if min_sum != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
grid = [
    [5, 3, 4, 1],
    [1, 6, 1, 7],
    [3, 2, 4, 5],
    [5, 4, 5, 8]
]
print(minimum_sum_of_mountain_triplets(grid))  # Example function call
```

### Time Complexity

- **Peak Detection:**
  - `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

- **Forming Triplets and Calculating Minimum:**
  - Evaluating combinations of peaks is `O(C(k, 3))` where `k` is the number of peaks.

- **Overall:**
  - Dominated by the combination calculation, making it potentially `O(m * n + k^3)`.

- **Auxiliary Space:**
  - `O(k)` for storing peaks in the list.
