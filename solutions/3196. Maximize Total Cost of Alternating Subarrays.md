title:  Maximize Total Cost of Alternating Subarrays-out

Given an array `nums` of even length, you need to select pairs of elements from the array such that the first element of each pair comes from the first half of the array and the second element from the second half of the array. Each element of the array must be used exactly once. The goal is to maximize the sum of the absolute differences of the pairs.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. How large can the array `nums` be?
   - This is important to understand the constraints and optimize our solution accordingly.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the values within the array (e.g., negative numbers, specific ranges)?
   - Understanding this can help decide if any special considerations are needed for handling edge cases.

3. What is the expected output?
   - The expected output is a single integer representing the maximum possible sum of the absolute differences of the pairs.

### Strategy:

To maximize the sum of absolute differences, we should consider pairing the largest value in the first half of the array with the smallest value in the second half of the array, and so on. This approach ensures that each pair has the maximum possible difference.

1. Split the array into two halves: `first_half` and `second_half`.
2. Sort `first_half` in ascending order and `second_half` in descending order.
3. Pair each element from `first_half` with the corresponding element from `second_half`.
4. Calculate the sum of the absolute differences of these pairs.

### Code:

```python
def maximize_total_cost(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    mid = n // 2
    first_half = nums[:mid]
    second_half = nums[mid:]
    
    # Sort first_half in ascending order and second_half in descending order
    first_half.sort()
    second_half.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_cost = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        total_cost += abs(first_half[i] - second_half[i])
    
    return total_cost

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6]
print(maximize_total_cost(nums))
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Splitting the array**: O(n)
2. **Sorting both halves**: O((n/2) log (n/2)) + O((n/2) log (n/2)) which simplifies to O(n log n)
3. **Calculating the total cost**: O(n/2)

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is **O(n log n)**.

By implementing this strategy, we ensure that we maximize the total cost by prioritizing the largest possible differences in each pair, leading to an optimal solution.
