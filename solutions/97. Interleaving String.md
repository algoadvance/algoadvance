title:  Interleaving String-out

---

Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, determine whether `s3` is formed by an interleaving of `s1` and `s2`.

An interleaving of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:
- `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
- `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
- `|n - m| <= 1`
- The interleaving is the concatenation of the substrings in such a way that maintains the order of the substrings from each string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` allowed to contain any type of characters (e.g., letters, digits, symbols)?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can `s1` or `s2` be empty?**
   - Yes, either can be empty.
3. **Is `s3` always guaranteed to be longer than or equal to the length of `s1` and `s2` combined?**
   - No, we need to check the length as part of our validation.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be `True` if `s3[:i+j]` can be formed by interleaving `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`. 

### Steps:
1. Initialize a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` denotes if `s3[:i+j]` can be formed by interleaving `s1[:i]` and `s2[:j]`.
2. Our base case will be `dp[0][0]` which is `True` since two empty strings interleave to form an empty string.
3. Populate the table by checking the conditions:
   - If `s1[i-1]` matches `s3[i+j-1]`, we will check the previous state from `s1`.
   - If `s2[j-1]` matches `s3[i+j-1]`, we will check the previous state from `s2`.
4. Return `dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]`.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def isInterleave(s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:
    # If the length of s3 isn't equal to the length of s1 plus s2, return False
    if len(s3) != len(s1) + len(s2):
        return False
    
    # Initialize the DP table
    dp = [[False] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in range(len(s1) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Fill the first row
    for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[j - 1]
    
    # Fill the first column
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i - 1]
    
    # Fill the rest of the DP table
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] and s1[i - 1] == s3[i + j - 1]) or \
                       (dp[i][j - 1] and s2[j - 1] == s3[i + j - 1])
    
    return dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]

# Example usage
s1 = "aabcc"
s2 = "dbbca"
s3 = "aadbbcbcac"
print(isInterleave(s1, s2, s3))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution has a time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `s1` and \(m\) is the length of `s2`. This is because we are filling a 2D table of size `n x m`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also \(O(n \times m)\) due to the storage required for the 2D table.
