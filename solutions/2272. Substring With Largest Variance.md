title:  Substring With Largest Variance-out
permalink: /s2272
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A substring `s'` of `s` is called a variance substring if the number of occurrences of the maximum frequency character and the number of occurrences of the minimum frequency character are exactly one character apart.

Return the length of the substring with the largest variance. If none exists, return 0.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "aababbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "bab" has 2 'b's and 1 'a', so its variance is 3. This is the largest we can have for this string.
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What exactly is meant by "variance"?**
   - Variance here seems to imply the difference between the counts of the most frequent and least frequent characters in the substring.

2. **Are overlaps allowed when calculating different substrings?**
   - Yes, we're concerned with the length of any such variance substring, so overlaps are allowed.

3. **Should the entire solution fit in the memory?**
   - Yes, considering the input constraints, the solution should be efficient both in time and space.

4. **Can we assume that the input string contains only valid lower case characters?**
   - Yes, as per the constraints.

With these clarifications, letâ€™s dive into the strategy to solve this problem.

## Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Technique:** One approach is to iterate through all possible substrings and calculate their variance, but this would be very inefficient (`O(n^2)` time complexity).
2. **Character Pair Analysis:** A more efficient approach involves considering pairs of characters. For each pair of characters, use the Kadane's algorithm to find the substring with the largest variance.
   - Essentially, for each unique character pair `(a, b)`, treat the problem as a maximum subarray problem where you count `a` as +1 and `b` as -1 (or vice versa), then compute the maximum contiguous sum which gives the variance for that pair in the string.

## Solution

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def largestVariance(s: str) -> int:
    from itertools import combinations
    from collections import Counter

    def max_subarray_variance(array):
        max_ending_here = max_so_far = float('-inf')
        min_ending_here = min_var = 0  # min_ending_here is to track minimum sum
        seen_a = seen_b = False

        for number in array:
            if number == 1:
                seen_a = True
            if number == -1:
                seen_b = True

            max_ending_here = max(max_ending_here + number, number)
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
            
            # To ensure that we have at least one of each character in the substring
            if seen_a and seen_b:
                min_var = min(min_var, min_ending_here)
                min_ending_here += number
                min_var = min(min_var, min_ending_here)
        
        return max_so_far - min_var if seen_a and seen_b else 0

    char_set = set(s)
    max_variance = 0

    for a, b in combinations(char_set, 2):
        variance_ab = max_subarray_variance([1 if ch == a else -1 if ch == b else 0 for ch in s])
        variance_ba = max_subarray_variance([1 if ch == b else -1 if ch == a else 0 for ch in s])

        max_variance = max(max_variance, variance_ab, variance_ba)

    return max_variance
```

## Time Complexity
- **Character Pair Analysis** finds variances for all `(a, b)` pairs. Given `s` has up to 26 distinct characters, there are at most \( C(26, 2) = 325 \) pairs to consider.
- **Kadane's Algorithm:** Runs in `O(n)` for each pair, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Overall Complexity:** \( O(325 \times n) = O(n) \), where `n` is the length of the string. Given the constraints, this is efficient and feasible for `n` up to `10^4`.

This approach ensures we find the longest substring with the largest variance efficiently.
