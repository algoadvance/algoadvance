title:  Number of Ways to Split Array-out
permalink: /s2270
---

We are given an array `nums` of length `n`. We need to determine the number of ways we can split the array into two contiguous non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the elements in the first subarray is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the second subarray.

Formally, we need to find the number of `i` such that:  
`sum(nums[0:i]) >= sum(nums[i:n])`, where `1 <= i < n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the array and the values of its elements?**
   - This will help in understanding if there are any performance considerations we need to keep in mind.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that the array will contain only integers, and can these integers be negative?**
   - Knowing this will help in determining if there are edge cases regarding negative values that we need to handle.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:
1. **Compute the total sum of the array (`total_sum`).**
2. **Use a prefix sum (`prefix_sum`) to keep track of the sum of elements from the start to the current index.**
3. **Calculate the suffix sum (`suffix_sum`) as the difference between `total_sum` and `prefix_sum`.**
4. **Count the number of indices `i` where `prefix_sum` is greater than or equal to `suffix_sum`.**

### Code

```python
def waysToSplitArray(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        prefix_sum += nums[i]
        suffix_sum = total_sum - prefix_sum
        
        if prefix_sum >= suffix_sum:
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [10, 4, -8, 7]
print(waysToSplitArray(nums))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We make a single pass through the array to compute the total sum.
  - We then make another pass through the array using a for loop to compute prefix sums and check the condition.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a few extra variables for sums and the count, but the space used is independent of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the number of ways to split the array as required by the problem statement.
