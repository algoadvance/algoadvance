**2866. Beautiful Towers II**

You are given an array `heights` representing the heights of consecutive towers. Your task is to maximize the total aesthetic score of the towers by performing at most one operation.

In one operation, you can choose any tower and increase its height by 1 unit.

The aesthetic score of a sequence of towers is defined as the sum of products of the heights of consecutive towers. That is, for an array `heights`, the aesthetic score is:
\[ \text{aesthetic\_score} = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} heights[i] \times heights[i+1] \]

Find the maximum aesthetic score that can be achieved by performing at most one operation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the tower height be increased more than once in the same operation?**
   - No, each tower can be incremented by exactly 1 unit at most once.

2. **What is the size range of the `heights` array?**
   - The length of the array, \( n \), can vary but we'll assume it fits within typical constraints for a coding interview problem.

3. **What are the values range of the `heights` array elements?**
   - The elements of the array are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Compute the initial aesthetic score of the towers.**
   - Loop through the array and calculate the sum of the products of consecutive tower heights.

2. **Simulate the operation of increasing each tower height by 1.**
   - For each tower, calculate the aesthetic score if its height were increased by 1. This requires:
       - Recomputing the impact of increasing the height of the tower on the combinations involving adjacent towers.
       - Consider both left and right neighbors of the tower, if they exist.
   
3. **Keep track of the maximum aesthetic score found.**
   - Compare the modified scores with the initial score and update the maximum score accordingly.

### Code

```python
def maximize_aesthetic_score(heights):
    n = len(heights)
    
    # Base case where we calculate the initial aesthetic score
    initial_score = sum(heights[i] * heights[i+1] for i in range(n-1))
    
    max_score = initial_score
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0: # Impact on heights[i-1] * heights[i]
            impact_left = heights[i-1] * heights[i] + heights[i-1] * (heights[i] + 1)
        else:
            impact_left = 0
        
        if i < n-1: # Impact on heights[i] * heights[i+1]
            impact_right = heights[i] * heights[i+1] + (heights[i] + 1) * heights[i+1]
        else:
            impact_right = 0
        
        total_impact = impact_left + impact_right
        
        # Recalculate the score after the operation
        new_score = initial_score - heights[i] * (
            (heights[i-1] if i > 0 else 0) + (heights[i+1] if i < n-1 else 0)
        ) + (heights[i] + 1) * (
            (heights[i-1] if i > 0 else 0) + (heights[i+1] if i < n-1 else 0)
        )
        
        # Update the max_score
        max_score = max(max_score, new_score)
        
    return max_score

# Example Usage
heights = [2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 2]
print(maximize_aesthetic_score(heights))  # This will output the maximum aesthetic score achievable
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Score Calculation:** \(O(n)\)
- **Score Recalculation:** \(O(n) \times O(1) = O(n)\)
- **Total Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

This solution efficiently computes the maximum aesthetic score that can be achieved by performing at most one increase operation in linear time.
