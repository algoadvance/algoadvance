title:  Count Number of Possible Root Nodes-out
permalink: /s2581
---

You are given a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and `n-1` edges.

You're tasked with determining the number of valid nodes that can be chosen as the root node. A node is valid if and only if, based on the given conditions, it can reach all other nodes either directly or indirectly through other nodes.

Write a function, `countRootNodes`, that takes in two parameters:
1. `n`: an integer representing the number of nodes.
2. `edges`: a list of tuples, where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge between node `u` and node `v`.

Return the number of possible root nodes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `n` and `edges`?
2. **Edge Cases**: What are some edge cases we should consider (e.g., minimum and maximum length of nodes and edges)?
3. **Graph Properties**: Should we assume the graph is always a tree (connected and acyclic graph)?
4. **Output**: What should the function return if there are multiple possible root nodes?

Assumptions:
- The problem assumes that the given graph is always a connected tree.
- The nodes are labeled from `1` to `n`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's consider the following plan:
1. **Tree Properties**: We know that in a tree with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, there is exactly one connected component, meaning every node can be reached from any other node, making every node a potential root.
2. **Valid Roots**: Based on the problem statement, any node in the tree can serve as a root since it can always reach all other nodes.
3. **Count Nodes**: Simply return the total number of nodes since each node is a valid root.

### Code

Here is how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def countRootNodes(n, edges):
    # Since any node can be a root in a tree,
    # return the total count of nodes
    return n

# Example Usage
n = 4
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
print(countRootNodes(n, edges))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** since we are simply returning the number of nodes without any additional computation. The input size and the edges are not contributing to the complexity in any substantial way other than the function parameters.
