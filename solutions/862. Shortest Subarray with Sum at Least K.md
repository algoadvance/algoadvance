title:  Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K-out
permalink: /s862
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of `nums` with a sum of at least `k`. If there is no such subarray, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the integers in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, the integers in the array can be negative, positive, or zero.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The length of the array, `nums`, is between `1` and `50000`.

3. **What should we return if no such subarray exists?**
   - Return `-1`.

4. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, according to the constraints, the array will always have at least one element.

### Strategy

Given that the array can be quite large, a brute-force approach checking all possible subarrays would be too slow. Instead, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Prefix Sums**: Calculate the prefix sums of the array. This will help in quickly determining the sum of any subarray.

2. **Deque for Monotonic Storage**: Maintain a deque (double-ended queue) to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This way, for any new prefix sum, we can efficiently find if there exists a previous prefix sum such that the difference between the new prefix sum and this previous one is at least `k`.

3. **Sliding Window with Deque**:
   - As we iterate through the prefix sums, we'll ensure that the elements in the deque are in increasing order of their values.
   - We'll also ensure that we maintain the smallest possible subarray by removing elements from the front of the deque if they no longer ensure the shortest length.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_subarray(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    # Initialize the prefix sum array with 0
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate the prefix sums
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
    
    # Initialize the deque and the result variable
    dq = deque()
    result = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through the prefix sums
    for i in range(n + 1):
        # While there's an index in the deque and the current prefix sum
        # minus the oldest prefix sum is at least k
        while dq and prefix_sums[i] - prefix_sums[dq[0]] >= k:
            result = min(result, i - dq.popleft())
        
        # Maintain elements in the deque in increasing order of prefix sums
        while dq and prefix_sums[i] <= prefix_sums[dq[-1]]:
            dq.pop()
        
        # Add the current index to the deque
        dq.append(i)
    
    return result if result != float('inf') else -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Calculating the prefix sums takes \(O(n)\) time.
  - Each index is pushed and popped from the deque at most once, so the operations involving the deque also take \(O(n)\) time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We store the prefix sums array, which takes \(O(n)\) space.
  - The deque also takes \(O(n)\) space in the worst case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum of at least `k` and handles the large input sizes within the constraints.
