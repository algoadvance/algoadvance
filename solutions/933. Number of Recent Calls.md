title:  Number of Recent Calls-out
permalink: /s933
---
You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:
- `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with an empty request list.
- `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that have happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the current request). Specifically, return the number of `ping` calls that have been made from `t - 3000` to `t` (inclusive).

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

Explanation
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999, 1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900, 100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1, 3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2, 3002], return 3
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of calls to `ping` will be at most `10^4`.
- Each call to `ping` will have a strictly larger value of `t` than before.
- `1 <= t <= 10^9`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we use any data structures to optimize the solution, such as queues or deques?
2. Is there a guaranteed order in which `t` values are provided?

## Code
```python
from collections import deque

class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.requests = deque()

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.requests.append(t)
        while self.requests[0] < t - 3000:
            self.requests.popleft()
        return len(self.requests)


# Example Usage
# recentCounter = RecentCounter()
# print(recentCounter.ping(1))     # Output: 1
# print(recentCounter.ping(100))   # Output: 2
# print(recentCounter.ping(3001))  # Output: 3
# print(recentCounter.ping(3002))  # Output: 3
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: We use a queue (deque) to store the timestamps of the requests.
2. **Adding Requests**: Each new request is appended to the deque.
3. **Removing Outdated Requests**: For each `ping`, we check the deque and remove requests that are older than `t - 3000`.
4. **Return Count**: The length of the deque after the above operations gives the number of requests in the past 3000 milliseconds, including the current request.

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** O(1) 
- **Each ping Call:** 
  - Adding a request to the deque: O(1)
  - Removing outdated requests from the deque: O(1) amortized over multiple calls 

Hence, the time complexity for each `ping` call is O(1). The total time complexity, considering multiple pings, remains O(n), where `n` is the number of requests, thanks to efficient deque operations.
