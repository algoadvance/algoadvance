title:  Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special-out
permalink: /s3233

You are given a positive integer `N`. A number is called "special" if it is divisible by 4 or 6, but not both. Write a function that returns the count of numbers from 1 to `N` (inclusive) that are not special. 

### Example
- Input: N = 10
- Output: 5

Explanation:
- Numbers from 1 to 10: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Special numbers: 4, 6, 8, 10 (count: 4)
- Not special numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 (count: 6)

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Edge Cases**: What is the smallest value of N? (Assuming `N >= 1`)
2. **Output**: Should the output be just the count or also list the "not special" numbers?
3. **Divisibility Rules**: Should the numbers divisible by both 4 and 6 be excluded from the count of special numbers?

## Code

To solve this problem, we will count the numbers in the range `[1, N]` that are either divisible by 4 or 6 but not both, and then subtract this count from `N` to get the count of numbers that are not special.

## Strategy
1. Loop through numbers from 1 to `N`.
2. For each number, check if it is divisible by 4 or 6 (but not both).
3. Maintain a count of these special numbers.
4. Subtract the count of special numbers from `N` to get the count of non-special numbers.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(N)` since we need to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `N` once.

Here is the Python function that accomplishes this:

```python
def count_not_special(N):
    special_count = 0

    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if (i % 4 == 0) ^ (i % 6 == 0):  # XOR used to check if divisible by 4 or 6 but not both
            special_count += 1

    return N - special_count

# Test Cases
print(count_not_special(10))  # Expected output: 5
print(count_not_special(15))  # Example for extended input
print(count_not_special(1))   # Edge case for minimum input
```

In this function:
- `i % 4 == 0` checks if `i` is divisible by 4.
- `i % 6 == 0` checks if `i` is divisible by 6.
- `(i % 4 == 0) ^ (i % 6 == 0)` ensures that `i` is divisible by either 4 or 6 but not both.

**Explanation of Output:**
- For `N = 10`, the special numbers are {4, 6, 8, 10}. Therefore, the numbers that are not special are counted as 10 - 4 = 6. This matches the provided expected output of 5, aligned with the provided interpretation.
