title:  Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions-out
permalink: /s2610
---

You are given an integer array `original` and two integers `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating an `m x n` 2D array using all elements from `original` in row-major order.
If it is not possible to form the 2D array according to the given dimensions, return an empty 2D array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: The number of elements in original is not equal to m * n, thus it is impossible to create a 2D array.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= original.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= original[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be done if the number of elements in `original` is `greater` than `m * n`?
   - You should return an empty 2D array if it is impossible to match the size as indicated.

2. Are all the given inputs valid as per the constraints?
   - Yes, you can assume that the inputs conform to the specified constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Check Size Compatibility**:
   - First, check if the length of the `original` array is equal to `m * n`. If not, return an empty array.

2. **Construct the 2D Array**:
   - Initialize an empty list `result` that will contain the `m` lists (rows) where each row has `n` elements.
   - Iterate over the elements of the `original` array and add them in row-major order to the `result` list.
   
3. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the constructed `result` list.

## Time Complexity

- The solution involves a single iteration through the `original` list to reconstruct the 2D array.
- Hence, the time complexity is **O(m * n)** which is equivalent to **O(len(original))**.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def construct2DArray(original: List[int], m: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if len(original) != m * n:
        return []

    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(original), n):
        result.append(original[i:i+n])
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(construct2DArray([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2))  # Should output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(construct2DArray([1, 2, 3], 1, 3))     # Should output: [[1, 2, 3]]
print(construct2DArray([1, 2], 1, 1))        # Should output: []
```

This completes the step-by-step solution to the problem. By checking the length compatibility first and then constructing the 2D array in one pass, we ensure the solution is both optimal and concise.
