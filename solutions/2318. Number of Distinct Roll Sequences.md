title:  Number of Distinct Roll Sequences-out
permalink: /s2318
---

Given an integer `n`, return the number of distinct dice roll sequences of length `n` such that all rolls follow these rules:
1. Roll sequences must not include consecutive rolls of the same value.
2. Rolls can follow any value of their respective faces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
3. Return the number of distinct sequences, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of `n`?
   - Typical constraints would be between 1 and a reasonably high number like 10^5. This needs to be clarified, but we can assume a higher upper limit for efficiency concerns.

2. **Modulo Operation**: It is mentioned that the result should be `modulo 10^9 + 7`.
   - This is common in problems involving large number calculations to prevent integer overflow.

3. **Example Cases**: Can some example input/output pairs be provided for clarity?

## Strategy

The problem can be tackled using dynamic programming as there are overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties. The key is to store the number of valid sequences for different lengths and different last dice rolls efficiently to avoid recomputation.

### Steps:

1. **State Representation**:
   - We can use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` will represent the number of valid sequences of length `i` ending with face `j`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `dp[1][j]` to 1 for all `j` in [1, 6], as there's only one way to have a single roll ending in any face.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each length `i` from 2 to `n` and each face `j` from 1 to 6:
     - Sum up the values of `dp[i-1][k]` for all `k â‰  j` since the same value cannot be consecutive.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Sum up the values `dp[n][j]` for all `j` to get the total number of sequences of length `n`.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Apply modulo `10^9 + 7` at every step to keep the values within the manageable range.

### Implementation

```python
def distinctSequences(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Edge case for n == 1
    if n == 1:
        return 6
    
    dp = [[0] * 7 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize base case: length 1, there are 6 sequences ending in each face
    for j in range(1, 7):
        dp[1][j] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, 7):
            dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(1, 7) if k != j) % MOD
    
    return sum(dp[n][j] for j in range(1, 7)) % MOD

# Example usage
n = 4
print(distinctSequences(n))  # Expected output: the number of distinct sequences of length 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(6) (constant time for initial setup)
- **DP Table Filling**: We fill the table in a nested loop:
  - Loop over lengths from 2 to `n`: O(n)
  - Loop over each face: O(6)
  - Summation inside the inner loop: O(5)
  
Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n * 6 * 5)` which simplifies to `O(30n)`. Since 30 is a constant, it simplifies to `O(n)`.

This is efficient enough given typical constraints.
