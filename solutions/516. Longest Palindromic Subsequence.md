title:  Longest Palindromic Subsequence-out
permalink: /s516
---

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP).

1. **Define the Subproblem**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i...j]`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - When `i == j`, we only have one character, which is a palindrome of length 1. So, `dp[i][j] = 1`.

3. **State Transition**:
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2` because the outer characters `s[i]` and `s[j]` contribute to the palindromic subsequence.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])` because we either exclude `s[i]` or `s[j]`.

4. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - We need to initialize the DP table for single character substrings (where `i == j`).
   - We then fill the table in a bottom-up manner by considering substrings of increasing lengths.

5. **Result**:
   - The length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string `s` will be found at `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def longestPalindromeSubseq(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    # Create a 2D DP array with all elements initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Base case: Single letter sequences
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Example usage
s = "bbbab"
print(longestPalindromeSubseq(s))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we have two nested loops filling up the DP table, and each of the entries takes constant time to compute.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) due to the DP table.

This approach efficiently computes the length of the longest palindromic subsequence using dynamic programming.
