title:  Apply Operations to Make Two Strings Equal-out
permalink: /s2896
---

### Problem Statement
We need to implement a function that takes two binary strings `s` and `t`, and determines whether it is possible to make the two strings equal by performing the following operations:
1. Choose two adjacent characters in `s` and swap them.
2. Choose two adjacent characters in `t` and swap them.

These operations can be applied any number of times on `s` and `t`.

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure a clear understanding of the problem, here are a few questions:
1. Can the input strings be empty?
2. Do the strings have the same length?
3. Are the strings guaranteed to contain only '0's and '1's?

### Strategy
1. **Check if Both Strings are anagrams**: If we can rearrange `s` to make it equal to `t`, then both strings must have the same characters in the same quantity.
2. **Pattern Matching**: After confirming that the two strings are anagrams, we need to ensure that the relative positions of '0's and '1's can be matched in both strings. This can be checked by comparing the positions of characters when both strings are 'compressed' to only consider relative order of '0' and '1'.

### Code

Here's the Python function to solve this:

```python
def can_be_equal(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter
    # Step 1: Check if both strings have the same character counts.
    if Counter(s) != Counter(t):
        return False

    # Step 2: Check relative occurence positions of '0' and '1'
    def get_pattern(string):
        return [c for c in string]

    s_pattern = get_pattern(s)
    t_pattern = get_pattern(t)
    
    return s_pattern == t_pattern
```

### Explanation
1. **Anagram Check**: We use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of '0's and '1's in both strings. If they differ, the strings cannot be made equal, and we return `False`.
2. **Pattern Matching**: We capture the relative positions of '0's and '1's in both strings. If these patterns match, then it indicates that both strings can be rearranged to match each other.

### Time Complexity
- **Anagram Check**: Creating `Counter` objects takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Pattern Extraction**: This involves iterating over each character of the string, which again takes `O(n)` time.

Overall, the solution works in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`.

Would you like to proceed with this approach, or do you have any other specific requirements?
