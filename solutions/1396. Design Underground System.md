title:  Design Underground System-out

You are asked to design a system that manages the process of checking in and checking out passengers traveling through an underground subway system. You will implement an `UndergroundSystem` class with the following methods:

- `checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)`: A customer with ID `id`, checks in at the station `stationName` at time `t`.
- `checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)`: A customer with ID `id`, checks out from the station `stationName` at time `t`.
- `getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation) -> float`: Returns the average time it takes to travel from `startStation` to `endStation`.

You may assume all times are given in ascending order. All events happen in chronological order.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can we assume all station names will be properly formatted strings?** 
   Yes, the inputs will be well-formatted strings.
2. **Are there any constraints on the number of passengers or the range of time?** 
   Assume reasonable constraints for the problem (like a maximum of 10^5 events).
3. **Can the same passenger check in and out multiple times, and can this influence the average travel time calculation?**
   Yes, the same passenger ID can check in and out multiple times, and each trip should be counted in the average.

## Strategy:
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Track passengers when they check in.
2. Track trip times for specific routes when passengers check out.
3. Calculate average trip times for specified routes.

Data Structures:
1. **Check-ins**: Use a dictionary to map the customer ID to their check-in information (station and time).
2. **Trips**: Use a dictionary to map (startStation, endStation) tuple to a list of total travel times.

## Code:
```python
class UndergroundSystem:

    def __init__(self):
        # Map of customerID to (stationName, checkInTime)
        self.checkIns = {}
        
        # Map of (startStation, endStation) to totalTime and tripCount
        self.trips = {}

    def checkIn(self, id: int, stationName: str, t: int) -> None:
        self.checkIns[id] = (stationName, t)

    def checkOut(self, id: int, stationName: str, t: int) -> None:
        startStation, startTime = self.checkIns.pop(id)
        tripTime = t - startTime
        
        if (startStation, stationName) not in self.trips:
            self.trips[(startStation, stationName)] = [0, 0]  # [totalTime, tripCount]
        
        self.trips[(startStation, stationName)][0] += tripTime
        self.trips[(startStation, stationName)][1] += 1

    def getAverageTime(self, startStation: str, endStation: str) -> float:
        totalTime, tripCount = self.trips[(startStation, endStation)]
        return totalTime / tripCount
```

## Time Complexity:
1. **`checkIn`**: O(1) - Simple dictionary assignment.
2. **`checkOut`**: O(1) - Dictionary operations (lookup, remove, update).
3. **`getAverageTime`**: O(1) - Direct dictionary lookup and calculation.

This design ensures efficient operations adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
