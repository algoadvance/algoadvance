title:  Palindrome Partitioning IV-out
permalink: /s1745
---
You are given a string `s` and you need to determine if it can be split into three non-empty palindromic substrings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the three substrings be contiguous segments of the original string?
   - Yes, the three substrings should form a partition of the original string.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the input string `s`?
   - The string length \( n \) will be at least 3 and at most 2000.

### Strategy
1. **Palindrome Check Helper Function**: First, write a helper function to check if a given substring is a palindrome.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a dynamic programming (DP) table to precompute whether any substring \( s[i:j+1] \) is a palindrome.
3. **Splitting & Checking**: Iterate through possible split points and use the precomputed DP table to check if the segments are palindromes.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Palindrome Check Helper**:
   - A function to check if a substring is a palindrome.
2. **DP Table**:
   - Create a 2D DP table `dp` with dimensions \( n \times n \) where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
   - Initialize the table by checking substrings of length 1 and 2.
   - Use dynamic programming to populate the table for substrings of longer lengths.
3. **Check Partitions**: 
   - Iterate over all possible positions for the first and second cuts to create three substrings and use the DP table to check if each substring is a palindrome.

### Code
```python
def checkPartitioning(s: str) -> bool:
    n = len(s)
    # Step 1: Create DP table to check palindromes
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize DP table for single character and two character palindromes
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
            dp[i][i + 1] = True
    
    # Fill DP table for substrings of length >= 3
    for length in range(3, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = True
                
    # Step 2: Check if there exists a partition into three palindromic substrings
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if dp[0][i - 1] and dp[i][j - 1] and dp[j][n - 1]:
                return True
    return False
```

### Time Complexity
- **DP Table Construction**:
  - Filling the DP table requires \( O(n^2) \) time because we consider each substring and update the DP table accordingly.
- **Partition Checking**:
  - Checking all possible partitions involves nested loops for indices \( i \) and \( j \), which takes \( O(n^2) \) time.
  
Overall, the solution has a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \), which is efficient given the constraints.
