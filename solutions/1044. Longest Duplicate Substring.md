title:  Longest Duplicate Substring-out
permalink: /s1044
---
The problem "1044. Longest Duplicate Substring" asks us to find the longest substring that appears more than once in a given string `s`. If there is no such substring, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Limitations**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
     - The string `s` can have a maximum length of \(10^5\).
   
2. **Character Set**:
   - Can the input string contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?
     - The input string consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Output**:
   - What should be returned if there is no duplicate substring?
     - An empty string should be returned.
   
## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to use advanced techniques because a naive approach would be too slow given the constraints. A combination of **binary search**, **Rabin-Karp string hashing**, and a set to keep track of hashed substrings can be used.

### Steps:
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to determine the possible length of the longest duplicate substring. The length of the duplicate substring can range from `0` to `n-1`.
   
2. **Rabin-Karp Hashing**:
   - For a given length `L`, determine if there's any duplicate substring of that length using a rolling hash.
   
3. **Set for Hash Storage**:
   - Maintain a set that stores all the hashes of the substrings of the current length as we slide through the string. If a hash collision occurs, it implies a duplicate substring (provided there's no hash collision error).

### Pseudo Code:
1. Initialize variables and set up binary search range.
2. Define a helper function that computes and checks for duplicate substrings of a given length using Rabin-Karp.
3. Use binary search to find the maximum length of the duplicate substring.
4. Extract the starting index of the substring when a duplicate is found and return the substring. If no duplicate is found, return an empty string.

## Code

```python
def longestDupSubstring(s: str) -> str:
    def search(length):
        """Search for duplicate substring of a given length using Rabin-Karp hashing."""
        MOD = 2**63 - 1  # Large prime for modulo operation to avoid overflow
        BASE = 256       # Base value for the characters (a bit more than 26 to avoid collisions)
        
        current_hash = 0
        # Compute the hash for the first 'length' characters
        for i in range(length):
            current_hash = (current_hash * BASE + ord(s[i])) % MOD
        
        hashes = {current_hash}
        # Pre-compute BASE^length % MOD
        BASE_LEN = pow(BASE, length, MOD)
        
        for start in range(1, len(s) - length + 1):
            # Calculate hash of the next substring by rolling hash
            current_hash = (current_hash * BASE - ord(s[start - 1]) * BASE_LEN + ord(s[start + length - 1])) % MOD
            
            if current_hash in hashes:
                return start
            hashes.add(current_hash)
        
        return -1

    low, high = 1, len(s)
    longest_start = 0
    longest_length = 0

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        start = search(mid)
        if start != -1:
            low = mid + 1
            longest_start = start
            longest_length = mid
        else:
            high = mid

    return s[longest_start:longest_start + longest_length]

# Example usage:
s = "banana"
print(longestDupSubstring(s))  # Output: "ana"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search** contributes a factor of \(O(\log n)\).
- **Rabin-Karp Hashing**:
  - Hashing a substring of length `L` has a time complexity of \(O(L)\).
  - Verifying all substrings of length `L` requires \(O((n - L) L)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the input size constraints.
