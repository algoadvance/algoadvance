title:  Modify the Matrix-out

Given a 2D integer matrix `matrix`, return a new 2D matrix such that for each cell `(i, j)` in the new matrix:

- The matrix value is `1` if the sum of its surrounding 8 cells in the original matrix is odd.
- The matrix value is `0` if the sum of its surrounding 8 cells is even.

Note:
- Cells outside the bounds of the matrix are considered to have a value of `0`.
- The surrounding 8 cells of a cell `(i, j)` are the cells `(i-1, j-1)`, `(i-1, j)`, `(i-1, j+1)`, `(i, j-1)`, `(i, j+1)`, `(i+1, j-1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What should be the size of the new matrix?**
   - The new matrix should have the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. **Should the original matrix be modified?**
   - No, the original matrix should remain unchanged.
3. **How should the edges and corners be handled since they have fewer than 8 neighbors?**
   - Assume cells out of the boundary are zero.

## Strategy:
1. **Initialize a new matrix** with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. **Iterate through each cell** in the original matrix.
3. **Compute the sum** of the 8 surrounding cells.
    - Use boundary checks to ensure cells out of bounds are treated as 0.
4. **Set the value** of the corresponding cell in the new matrix based on whether the sum is odd or even.
5. **Return the modified matrix**.

## Time Complexity:
- The solution involves iterating through all cells of the matrix and checking the eight neighbors for each cell.
- For an `M x N` matrix, the time complexity would be `O(M * N)`.

Let's proceed with the code implementation.

## Code:

```python
def modify_matrix(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return []
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    new_matrix = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            sum_neighbors = 0
            
            # Calculate the sum of 8 surrounding cells
            for x in (-1, 0, 1):
                for y in (-1, 0, 1):
                    if x == 0 and y == 0:
                        continue
                    ni, nj = i + x, j + y
                    if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols:
                        sum_neighbors += matrix[ni][nj]
            
            # Set the value in new_matrix
            new_matrix[i][j] = 1 if sum_neighbors % 2 != 0 else 0
    
    return new_matrix

# Example Usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

print(modify_matrix(matrix))
```

This code should handle the input matrix as specified and produce an output matrix where each cell is determined by the sum of its neighboring cells.
