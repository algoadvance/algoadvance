title:  The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair-out
permalink: /s1942
---
There is a party and there are `n` guests that will arrive. The 0-indexed array `times` has the arrival and departure times of the guests, where `times[i] = [arrival_i, departure_i]`. All chairs are initially unoccupied. 

You need to find and return the smallest unoccupied chair for the friend that arrives `targetFriend`-th.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the format of the input? 
   - The input consists of an integer `targetFriend` and a list of pairs `times` where each pair includes two integers representing the arrival and departure times.
   
2. Will there always be at least one chair available when a guest arrives?
   - Yes, since each guest will eventually leave, there will always be at least one unoccupied chair available when a new guest arrives.

3. Are the `times` elements in any specific order?
   - No, the `times` elements are not necessarily sorted by arrival or departure times.

## Strategy
1. First, pair each arrival time with its associated guest index.
2. Sort `times` based on arrival times.
3. Use a heap (priority queue) to track both available and currently occupied chairs:
   - `available_chairs`: always pops the smallest index chair.
   - `occupied_chairs`: keeps track of chairs with their departure times and their currently assigned chair index.
4. For each guest as they arrive:
   - Release any chairs from the `occupied_chairs` heap where the departure time has passed.
   - Assign the smallest available chair to the currently arriving guest.
   - If the current guest is the `targetFriend`, return the chair index.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the times array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Each heap operation (push and pop) takes \(O(\log n)\).
- Overall, the approach should have a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting and heap operations.

Here is the complete Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import heapq

def smallestChair(times, targetFriend):
    # Capture the original index position of each friend
    indexed_times = [(times[i][0], times[i][1], i) for i in range(len(times))]
    # Sort by arrival time
    indexed_times.sort()
    
    # Priority queue for free chairs (use min-heap)
    available_chairs = []
    # Priority queue to keep track of occupied chairs (by departure time)
    occupied_chairs = []
    
    for i in range(len(times)):
        # Free chairs by popping from the occupied_chairs until we reach the arrival time
        while occupied_chairs and occupied_chairs[0][0] <= indexed_times[i][0]:
            _, chair_index = heapq.heappop(occupied_chairs)
            heapq.heappush(available_chairs, chair_index)
        
        # Assign the current smallest available chair
        if available_chairs:
            chair = heapq.heappop(available_chairs)
        else:
            # If no chairs are available in the available_chairs, use a new chair
            chair = i
        
        # Record the departure time and assigned chair in occupied_chairs
        heapq.heappush(occupied_chairs, (indexed_times[i][1], chair))
        
        # Check if current guest is the target friend
        if indexed_times[i][2] == targetFriend:
            return chair
    
    # Should never be reached
    return -1
```

This code systematically handles guest arrivals and departures, using heaps to manage chair assignments efficiently. Make sure to test it with various inputs to ensure correctness.
