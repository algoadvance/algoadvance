title:  Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill-out
permalink: /s2491
---
You are given an integer array "skill" of even length `n` where `n/2` players can be formed into `n/2` teams of 2 players each. The skill of a team is defined as the sum of the skills of its players. Return the minimum possible difference in team skill if you divide all players into teams optimally.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the elements in the skill array?**
   - The range of skill values should be clarified if not provided. Assume reasonable constraints typical of competitive programming if not specified.

2. **Should the teams aim to be balanced?**
   - Yes, teams should be formed such that their skill levels are as close as possible.

3. **Can we assume that the length of the skill array is even?**
   - The problem states the array is of even length.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Skill Array:**
   - To achieve the minimum possible difference in team skills, we can leverage sorting to facilitate pairing.

2. **Two-pointer Technique:**
   - Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (representing the smallest skill) and one from the end (representing the largest skill). Pair these players together.

3. **Calculate Differences:**
   - Form teams and calculate the sum of each team, then compute the maximum and minimum team skills to find the difference.

### Code
Here is a Python implementation of the outlined strategy:

```python
def minSkillDifference(skill):
    skill.sort()
    n = len(skill)
    team_skill_sums = []
    
    # Form teams with two pointers
    for i in range(n // 2):
        team_skill_sums.append(skill[i] + skill[n - 1 - i])
    
    # Minimum and maximum sum of team skills
    min_team_skill = min(team_skill_sums)
    max_team_skill = max(team_skill_sums)
    
    return max_team_skill - min_team_skill

# Example usage:
skill = [3, 5, 2, 8, 7, 10]
print(minSkillDifference(skill))  # Output should represent smallest max-min difference
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` because we are sorting the skill array.
- **Two-pointer team formation:** `O(n)` for traversing the array and forming the teams.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(n log n)` since the sorting step is the most time-consuming operation.

### Summary
To divide players into teams minimizing the difference in team skills:
1. Sort the skills.
2. Pair smallest with largest using two pointers.
3. Compute the difference between the highest and lowest team skills.
This ensures an optimal solution with minimal computational complexity.
