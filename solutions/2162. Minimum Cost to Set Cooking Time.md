title:  Minimum Cost to Set Cooking Time-out
permalink: /s2162
---
You are given a `target` time in minutes and a list `stoves` containing the cooking time required in minutes for various dishes cooked on different stoves. Your goal is to determine the minimum cost required to set all stoves to deliver the `target` cooking time. The cost to change the cooking time on a stove is defined as the absolute difference between the current time and the target time.

### Example:
```
target = 5
stoves = [7, 3, 9]
```
**Output:**
```
8
```
Explanation:
- Adjusting the first stove from 7 to 5 costs 2.
- Adjusting the second stove from 3 to 5 costs 2.
- Adjusting the third stove from 9 to 5 costs 4.
- Total cost is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are negative cooking times considered for the stoves?**
    - No, stoves will always have non-negative cooking times.
2. **Can the target time be zero?**
    - Yes, the target time can be zero.
3. **Is the list of cooking times for stoves always non-empty?**
    - Yes, there will be at least one element in the stoves list.

## Strategy
For each stove's cooking time, calculate the absolute difference between the current cooking time and the target cooking time. Sum these differences to determine the total cost.

1. Initialize `total_cost` to 0.
2. Iterate through each cooking time in `stoves`.
3. For each cooking time, compute the cost to change it to the target time (absolute difference).
4. Add the computed cost to `total_cost`.
5. Return `total_cost`.

## Code
```python
def min_cost_to_target_time(target, stoves):
    total_cost = 0
    for time in stoves:
        total_cost += abs(time - target)
    return total_cost

# Example usage:
target = 5
stoves = [7, 3, 9]
print(min_cost_to_target_time(target, stoves))  # Output: 8
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `stoves` list. This is because we iterate through the list once, calculating the absolute difference for each element.
