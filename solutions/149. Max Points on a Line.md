title:  Max Points on a Line-out
permalink: /s149
---

Given `n` points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the 2D plane.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the points guaranteed to be distinct?**
   - No, points are not guaranteed to be distinct; there can be duplicate points.

2. **What is the range of coordinates for the points?**
   - Each coordinate value is an integer and can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

3. **What should be the output if there are no points or only one point?**
   - If there are no points, the output should be 0. If there is only one point, the output should be 1.

### Strategy

To find the maximum number of points on a single line, we need to determine the number of collinear points for every pair of points. Two points can define a line, and with the slope of this line, we can check how many other points lie on the same line. 

1. **Calculate Slope:** For every pair of points, compute the slope. Given two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\), the slope \(m\) is given by:

   \[
   m = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
   \]

   To avoid floating point precision issues, we store the slope in its reduced fraction form (after dividing by the greatest common divisor).

2. **HashMap to Count Slopes:** Use a hashmap to store the count of points for each slope.

3. **Parallel Verticals:** Handle vertical lines separately since their slope would be undefined (or infinite).

4. **Duplicate Points:** Handle duplicate points by counting them separately and adjusting the final counts accordingly.

5. **Iterate through points:** For each point, compute lines passing through it and every other point. Update the maximum as we compute slopes.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

def maxPoints(points):
    def get_slope(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dy = y2 - y1
        dx = x2 - x1
        
        if dx == 0:
            return 'inf'  # Handle the infinite slope caused by vertical lines.
        
        g = gcd(dy, dx)
        dy //= g
        dx //= g
        
        return (dy, dx)
    
    if not points:
        return 0
    if len(points) == 1:
        return 1
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(points)):
        slopes = defaultdict(int)
        duplicate = 1
        current_max = 0
        
        for j in range(i + 1, len(points)):
            if points[i] == points[j]:
                duplicate += 1
            else:
                slope = get_slope(points[i][0], points[i][1], points[j][0], points[j][1])
                slopes[slope] += 1
                current_max = max(current_max, slopes[slope])
        
        result = max(result, current_max + duplicate)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of points. This arises because we iterate through each point pair to compute slopes.

- **Space Complexity:** This depends on the number of unique slopes we can encounter, which can be up to \(O(n)\) in the hashmap for each point.

In summary, this approach efficiently handles the problem of finding the maximum number of collinear points by leveraging hashmap-based slope counting and appropriate handling of special cases like vertical lines and duplicate points.
