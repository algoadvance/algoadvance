title:  Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time-out
permalink: /s2849
---

You are given the starting coordinates (sx, sy) of a cell and the destination coordinates (dx, dy) on an infinite 2D grid. Each move, you can move one step in one of the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, or west. You need to determine if it's possible to reach the destination cell (dx, dy) starting from the starting cell (sx, sy) exactly within `t` moves.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sx = 2, sy = 4, dx = 7, dy = 7, t = 10
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sx = 2, sy = 4, dx = 7, dy = 7, t = 12
Output: true
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the coordinates (sx, sy) and (dx, dy) integer values?**
   - Yes, they are always integers.

2. **Do the moves only include exactly one step in the per cardinal direction?**
   - Yes, each move is exactly one step.

3. **Is `t` always a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, `t` is a non-negative integer.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Manhattan Distance:**
   - The minimum number of steps required to reach from `(sx, sy)` to `(dx, dy)` is given by the Manhattan distance `|dx - sx| + |dy - sy|`.

2. **Check if it's Possible to Reach in Exactly `t` Moves:**
   - Calculate the Manhattan distance `md = |dx - sx| + |dy - sy|`.
   - If `t` is less than `md`, it's impossible to reach the destination in `t` moves.
   - If `t` is equal to `md`, it is possible.
   - If `t` is greater than `md`, check if the difference `(t - md)` is an even number. If it is even, we can use extra moves to just move back and forth without changing the final position.

## Code

```python
def isReachable(sx: int, sy: int, dx: int, dy: int, t: int) -> bool:
    manhattan_distance = abs(dx - sx) + abs(dy - sy)

    if t < manhattan_distance:
        return False
    return (t - manhattan_distance) % 2 == 0

# Example Usage
print(isReachable(2, 4, 7, 7, 10))  # Output: false
print(isReachable(2, 4, 7, 7, 12))  # Output: true
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the function is `O(1)` because all operations (absolute value calculations, addition, subtraction, and modulo operation) are performed in constant time.
