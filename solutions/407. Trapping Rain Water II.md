title:  Trapping Rain Water II-out
permalink: /s407
---

Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, compute the volume of water it is able to trap after raining.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume that the input matrix will always be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the dimensions `m` and `n` are guaranteed to be greater than 0.

2. **Is there a maximum limit on the values within the matrix?**
   - The height values can be any non-negative integers.

3. **Can water be trapped at the boundary cells?**
   - No, water cannot be trapped at the boundary since it will just flow out.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a strategy similar to the "Trapping Rain Water" problem but extend it to 2D. The idea is to use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently find the next cell with the minimum height to determine whether water can be trapped at that position.

Detailed steps:
1. Push all the boundary cells into a priority queue and mark them as visited.
2. For each cell extracted from the priority queue:
   - Check its neighboring cells.
   - If a neighboring cell is not visited, calculate the potential water that can be trapped and update the total water volume.
   - Push the neighboring cell into the priority queue with the maximum height (either its own height or the height of the extracted cell).

## Code

Let's implement the above strategy in Python:

```python
import heapq

def trapRainWater(heightMap):
    if not heightMap or not heightMap[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(heightMap), len(heightMap[0])
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
    heap = []
    
    # Push all boundary cells into the min-heap
    for i in range(m):
        for j in [0, n-1]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (heightMap[i][j], i, j))
            visited[i][j] = True
    for j in range(n):
        for i in [0, m-1]:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (heightMap[i][j], i, j))
            visited[i][j] = True
    
    water_trapped = 0
    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    
    while heap:
        height, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                water_trapped += max(0, height - heightMap[nx][ny])
                heapq.heappush(heap, (max(height, heightMap[nx][ny]), nx, ny))
                visited[nx][ny] = True
    
    return water_trapped
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n * log(m * n))` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is due to the fact that each cell is pushed and popped from the priority queue once, and each operation on the priority queue takes `O(log(m * n))` time.

The space complexity is `O(m * n)` since we keep a visited array and the priority queue can hold up to `m * n` elements.
