title:  Make Array Strictly Increasing-out
permalink: /s1187
---

Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing. In one operation, you can choose two indices where `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length` and set `arr1[i] = arr2[j]`.

If there is no possible way to make `arr1` strictly increasing, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in `arr1` and `arr2` distinct?**
   - The problem doesn't state the distinctness, so we must assume that they can have repeated values.

2. **Is there any constraint on the length of `arr1` and `arr2`?**
   - Typical constraints on array lengths might be up to 2x10^4 (as per the competitive programming standards), but it's always good to confirm this from the problem statement.

3. **What if arr1 is already strictly increasing?**
   - If `arr1` is already strictly increasing, then we would require zero operations, which is the minimum.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, dynamic programming can be particularly useful. Here's the plan:

1. **Sort `arr2`:** This helps in efficiently finding elements from `arr2`.
2. **Use a DP table:** Use a DP dictionary where the key is the index of `arr1`, and the value is another dictionary that keeps track of the minimum operations needed to make `arr1` strictly increasing up to that point considering different possible last elements in the sequence.

#### Steps:

1. Create a sorted version of `arr2`.
2. Initialize a DP dictionary with a base case â€” `{ -1: 0 }`, meaning zero operations required before the start of the array.
3. Iterate through `arr1`, for each position:
   - For each possible value at that position from the current `dp`, try to keep `arr1` as it is or replace it with some value from `arr2`.
   - Update the next state for `dp` by ensuring the sequence remains strictly increasing and keeping counting the operations.
4. After processing all elements of `arr1`, retrieve the minimum operations from the last state of `dp`.

### Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList
import bisect

def makeArrayIncreasing(arr1, arr2):
    arr2.sort()
    dp = {-1: 0}

    for i in range(len(arr1)):
        new_dp = {}
        for key in dp:
            # Keep current element if it's larger than the last one
            if arr1[i] > key:
                new_dp[arr1[i]] = min(new_dp.get(arr1[i], float('inf')), dp[key])
            
            # Binary search on sorted arr2 to find a valid replacement
            idx = bisect.bisect_right(arr2, key)
            if idx < len(arr2):
                new_dp[arr2[idx]] = min(new_dp.get(arr2[idx], float('inf')), dp[key] + 1)
        
        dp = new_dp

    if dp:
        return min(dp.values())
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1,5,3,6,7]
arr2 = [1,3,2,4]
print(makeArrayIncreasing(arr1, arr2)) # Output should be 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting `arr2`:** O(n log n)
- **DP Processing:** Each element in `arr1` needs to consider replacing with each element in `arr2` using a binary search.
  - Binary search insertion and lookups are O(log m) where m is the length of `arr2`.
  - Processing each element of `arr1` involves checking current keys of the DP table and considering replacements which adds up to O(n * (log m + k * log m)) where k is the number of valid positions. In the worst case, we might end up with O(n * m log m).

The overall complexity would be around O(n m log m), which is efficient for input sizes typically found in competitive programming.
