title:  Apply Operations to an Array-out
permalink: /s2460
---

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` of size `n` consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply the following operations until the array cannot be changed further:
1. If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]` for some `i` (0 <= i < n - 1), then set `nums[i] = 2 * nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1] = 0`.
2. After the above operation has been applied to the entire array, shift all `0`s to the end of the array.

Return the resulting array after applying the above operations.

### Example
Input: `nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]`
Output: `[1,4,2,0,0,0]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   - Typically, array problems on LeetCode have constraints provided, e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`. Let's assume it is reasonable for typical in-memory processing.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums`?**
   - The problem states non-negative integers. Usually, this implies integers like 0, 1, 2, etc.

3. **What should we return if the input array has length 1?**
   - Given no operation can be performed, we should return the array as-is for length 1.

### Strategy

1. **Identify and Apply Operations:**
   - Traverse the list and whenever we find two consecutive identical elements (`nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`), we update `nums[i]` to `2 * nums[i]` and set `nums[i + 1]` to 0.

2. **Shift Zeros:**
   - After performing the above operations, create a new list by pulling in all non-zero elements first and then appending zeros to the end until the length matches the original array length.

### Code Implementation

```python
def applyOperations(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Apply the specified operations
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if nums[i] == nums[i + 1] and nums[i] != 0:
            nums[i] = 2 * nums[i]
            nums[i + 1] = 0
    
    # Shift all zeroes to the end
    result = [num for num in nums if num != 0]
    result += [0] * (n - len(result))
    
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0]
print(applyOperations(nums))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Applying Operations:**
   - We traverse the list once to check and apply the merging operation. This takes O(n) time.

2. **Shifting Zeros:**
   - We create a new list by iterating through the original list to pick non-zero elements and then append zeros. This also takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array.

We have designed the solution to be efficient and straightforward, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time.
