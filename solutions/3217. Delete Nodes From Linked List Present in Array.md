title:  Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array-out
permalink: /s3217
---

Given the head of a linked list and an array `arr` that contains values, delete all nodes from the linked list that contain any value specified in the array `arr`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done if the linked list is empty?**
   - If the linked list is empty (i.e., the head is `None`), then the list remains empty after the operation.

2. **What should be done if the array `arr` is empty?**
   - If the array `arr` is empty, then no nodes should be deleted, and the list should remain unchanged.

3. **Can the values in the array `arr` contain duplicates?**
   - The problem can be addressed either way; usually, we assume `arr` might contain duplicates, and we should remove all such occurrences from the linked list.

4. **What should be done if all nodes in the linked list should be deleted?**
   - If all node values in the linked list are present in `arr`, the resulting linked list should be empty, represented by `None`.

### Strategy

1. **Convert `arr` to a set for O(1) time complexity lookups.**
2. **Traverse the Linked List**:
   - Use a dummy node to handle edge cases, such as deleting the head node.
   - Traverse the linked list and for each node, check if its value is in the set created from `arr`.
   - If the value is in the set, adjust the pointers to skip the current node.
   - If the value is not in the set, move to the next node.

### Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteNodes(head, arr):
    # Convert the array to a set for O(1) lookups
    to_delete = set(arr)
    
    # Dummy node to handle cases where head needs to be deleted
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    current = dummy
    
    while current.next:
        if current.next.val in to_delete:
            # Skip the node with a value in `to_delete`
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            # Move to the next node
            current = current.next
    
    return dummy.next

# Helper functions to test the solution (e.g., convert list to linked list, print linked list)
def list_to_linkedlist(elements):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy
    for element in elements:
        current.next = ListNode(element)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

def linkedlist_to_list(head):
    result = []
    current = head
    while current:
        result.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return result

# Example usage
head = list_to_linkedlist([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr = [2, 4]
head = deleteNodes(head, arr)  # Should remove nodes with values 2 and 4
print(linkedlist_to_list(head))  # Expected output: [1, 3, 5]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where `m` is the number of elements in the array `arr`. The space is used to store the set created from `arr`.

This solution efficiently deletes nodes from the linked list based on the values specified in the given array.
