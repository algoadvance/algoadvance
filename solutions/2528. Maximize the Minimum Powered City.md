title:  Maximize the Minimum Powered City-out
permalink: /s2528

Given a list of `n` cities represented by an array `stations` where `stations[i]` represents the number of power stations present in the `i-th` city, and an integer value `k` representing the maximum number of additional power stations you can build, your task is to maximize the minimum power of any city.

Formally, the power of a city is defined as the sum of stations in that city and its neighboring cities. You need to return the maximum possible minimum power that can be achieved by optimally placing the `k` additional power stations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we consider edge cities' neighbors as the wrap-around (circular) or not?
2. Are there any constraints on the values within the `stations` array (e.g., minimum or maximum)?
3. Is neighboring defined as adjacent cities directly, or does it include more than one neighboring distance?

## Code

```python
def max_min_power(stations, k):
    def can_allocate(min_power):
        required_stations = 0
        current_power = [0] * len(stations)
        
        for i in range(len(stations)):
            if stations[i] < min_power:
                required_stations += min_power - stations[i]
                
                if i + k < len(stations):
                    current_power[i + k] -= (min_power - stations[i])
        
        return required_stations <= k

    left, right = min(stations), sum(stations) + k
    best_min_power = left
    
    while left <= right:
        mid_power = (left + right) // 2
        
        if can_allocate(mid_power):
            best_min_power = mid_power
            left = mid_power + 1
        else:
            right = mid_power - 1
    
    return best_min_power

# Example Usage
stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 3
print(max_min_power(stations, k))  # Replace with the relevant test cases
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define the `can_allocate` function to check if it's possible to achieve at least the given `min_power` across all cities after adding at most `k` stations.
   - Track the total number of stations required to achieve at least `min_power` for each city, adjusting for neighboring cities' contributions.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to maximize the minimum power:
     - Set `left` as the minimum in the `stations` array.
     - Set `right` as the maximum sum possible (sum of all stations + `k`).
     - Calculate `mid_power` as the midpoint of `left` and `right`.
     - Use the `can_allocate` function to determine if `mid_power` is achievable.

3. **Adjust Bounds**:
   - If `can_allocate(mid_power)` returns `True`, it means we can potentially increase the minimum power, so move `left` pointer rightward.
   - If `can_allocate(mid_power)` returns `False`, it means we need to lower the minimum power, so move `right` pointer leftward.

4. **Outcome**:
   - The highest possible value of `mid_power` for which `can_allocate` is `True` is our desired maximum possible minimum power.

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**:
  - Runs in \(O(\log(S + k))\), where \(S\) is the total number of power stations initially present.
  
- **can_allocate Function**:
  - Runs in \(O(n)\) for each binary search iteration, where \(n\) is the number of cities.
  
Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log(S + k))\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum minimum power that can be achieved with the addition of up to `k` power stations.
