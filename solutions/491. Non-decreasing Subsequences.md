title:  Non-decreasing Subsequences-out
permalink: /s491
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the different possible non-decreasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?
   - Typically, elements range from -100 to 100, with `nums` having a length between 1 and 15 for practicality in problems like this.
2. **Duplicates**: Are there any specific instructions on handling duplicates within the input array?
   - Duplicates in the array can exist, and they need to be handled such that subsequences considering the same indices aren't counted multiple times.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to find all possible non-decreasing subsequences. The key point here is ensuring that subsequences with at least two elements are returned and handling duplicates properly.

1. **Backtracking**: Use a recursive function to generate all possible subsequences.
2. **Validation**: Ensure each subsequence is non-decreasing.
3. **Avoid Duplicates**: Use a set to store subsequences and avoid duplicates.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def findSubsequences(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    def backtrack(start: int, path: List[int]):
        if len(path) > 1:
            subsequences.add(tuple(path))
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            if not path or nums[i] >= path[-1]:
                backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])
    
    subsequences = set()
    backtrack(0, [])
    return [list(seq) for seq in subsequences]

# Example usage:
nums = [4, 6, 7, 7]
print(findSubsequences(nums))
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Backtracking Function**:
   - The function `backtrack` takes two parameters: the starting index `start` and the current path of numbers `path`.
   - If the length of the `path` is greater than 1, we add it to the `subsequences` set to ensure it meets the requirement of being a non-decreasing subsequence with at least two elements.
   - For each element starting from `start` to the end of `nums`, we check if it can be appended to the `path` to maintain the non-decreasing order.
   - We recursively call `backtrack` with the next starting index and the new path including the current element.

2. **Using a Set**:
   - Using a set, `subsequences`, guarantees that we get unique subsequences since tuples of the same sequence aren't inserted multiple times into the set.

3. **Result Conversion**: 
   - Finally, we convert the set of tuples back to a list of lists, which is the required format for the output.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity can be analyzed based on the following:
- The number of subsequences generated is O(2^n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- Each subsequence can take up to O(n) time to add to the set and to convert back to a list at the end.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n * 2^n). This is feasible for the given problem constraints where `n` (length of `nums`) is between 1 and 15.
