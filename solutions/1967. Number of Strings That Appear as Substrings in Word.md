title:  Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word-out
permalink: /s1967
---
You are given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`. You want to return the number of `patterns[i]` that appear as a substring in `word`.

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
patterns = ["a", "abc", "bc", "d"]
word = "abc"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
3
```
**Explanation:**
- "a" appears in "abc"
- "abc" appears in "abc"
- "bc" appears in "abc"
- "d" does not appear in "abc"

### Constraints
- `1 <= patterns.length <= 100`
- `1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= word.length <= 100`
- `patterns[i]` and `word` contain only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
Given the constraints, a simple and straightforward approach should work fine:
1. Initialize a counter.
2. Loop through each string in `patterns`.
3. Check if the current pattern appears as a substring in `word` using the `in` keyword.
4. If it does, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter value.

## Time Complexity
- Checking if a substring is present in a string in Python has an average time complexity of O(m+n) where `m` is the length of the pattern and `n` is the length of the word.
- Since we are doing this for each pattern in the array of length `p`, the overall time complexity would be O(p * (m+n)), but since both `m` and `n` as well as `p` are restricted to fairly small values (no more than 100), this approach is efficient.

## Code
Here's how you can implement the solution:

```python
def numOfStrings(patterns, word):
    count = 0
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern in word:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
patterns = ["a", "abc", "bc", "d"]
word = "abc"
print(numOfStrings(patterns, word)) # Output: 3
```

## Explanation
1. We initialize `count` to 0.
2. We iterate over each `pattern` in the `patterns` list.
3. For each `pattern`, we check if it is a substring of `word` using the `in` operation.
4. If the `pattern` is found in `word`, we increment the `count`.
5. Finally, we return the count.

This code efficiently counts the number of patterns that are substrings of the given word.
