Leetcode Problem 895: **Maximum Frequency Stack**

Design a stack-like data structure that pushes and pops elements in order of their frequency. The most frequently pushed element is popped first. If there is a tie for the most frequently pushed element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed first.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:

- `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
- `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack. If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed first.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input range constrained in any way?** 
   - Typically, inputs in such problems are constrained within the limits of integer values, but it's good to confirm.

2. **Are there performance constraints on time complexity for push and pop operations?**
   - The objective is to have efficient push and pop operations, ideally in constant amortized time.

3. **Can elements that are pushed have negative values?**
   - The answer is yes, elements can be negative as there are no constraints mentioned.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will maintain:
- A frequency map (`freq`) to count occurrences of each element.
- A map (`freqStacks`) where the key is the frequency, and the value is a stack containing all elements that have that frequency.
- A variable (`maxFreq`) to keep track of the current maximum frequency of any element in the stack.

Steps for the `push` operation:
1. Update the frequency of the pushed element in the `freq` map.
2. Push the element onto the stack associated with the updated frequency in `freqStacks`.
3. Update `maxFreq` if the new frequency is greater than the current `maxFreq`.

Steps for the `pop` operation:
1. Pop the element from the stack associated with the `maxFreq` in `freqStacks`.
2. Decrease the frequency of the popped element in the `freq` map.
3. If the stack for the `maxFreq` becomes empty, decrement `maxFreq`.

### Code

Here's how we can implement the `FreqStack`:

```python
class FreqStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.freq = {}  # Map to store frequency of elements
        self.freqStacks = {}  # Map of stacks for each frequency
        self.maxFreq = 0  # Current maximum frequency

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        # Increment the frequency count for val
        if val in self.freq:
            self.freq[val] += 1
        else:
            self.freq[val] = 1
        freq = self.freq[val]

        # Update the max frequency if necessary
        if freq > self.maxFreq:
            self.maxFreq = freq

        # Push val onto the stack corresponding to its frequency
        if freq not in self.freqStacks:
            self.freqStacks[freq] = []
        self.freqStacks[freq].append(val)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        # Pop the element from the stack with the highest frequency
        val = self.freqStacks[self.maxFreq].pop()
        
        # Decrease the frequency count for val
        self.freq[val] -= 1
        
        # If the frequency stack is empty, decrease the max frequency
        if not self.freqStacks[self.maxFreq]:
            self.maxFreq -= 1

        return val
```

### Time Complexity

- The `push` operation has a time complexity of O(1), since inserting into a hash map and appending to a list are O(1) operations.
- The `pop` operation also has a time complexity of O(1), since removing the last element from a list and updating the hash map are O(1) operations.

Thus, both operations are designed to run in constant time, ensuring efficient performance.
