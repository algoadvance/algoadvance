title:  Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II-out
permalink: /s3013
---
You are given an array called `nums` of length `n` and an integer `m`. Your task is to divide the array into exactly `m` subarrays in a way that minimizes the maximum sum of the subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous part of the original array.

Your objective is to determine the minimal possible value of the maximum of these subarray sums.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a combination of binary search and dynamic programming:

1. **Binary Search for the Maximum Sum:** We will search for the minimal possible value of the maximum subarray sum using binary search. The range for the binary search will be from the maximum single element in `nums` to the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming to Validate the Partitioning:** For each mid value derived from the binary search, we will check if it's possible to partition the array into `m` subarrays such that no subarray has a sum greater than `mid`. If it is possible, we move the upper bound of the binary search down; otherwise, we move the lower bound up.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the possible sizes for `nums` and values for `m`?
   - Are the elements in `nums` guaranteed to be non-negative?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be a single integer representing the minimal possible value of the maximum subarray sum?
   
3. **Special Cases:**
   - How should the algorithm handle cases where `m` is 1 (only one subarray)?
   - How should the function behave if `m` equals the length of `nums` (each element is its own subarray)?

### Code
Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def can_split(nums, m, max_sum):
    count = 1
    current_sum = 0
    for num in nums:
        if current_sum + num <= max_sum:
            current_sum += num
        else:
            count += 1
            current_sum = num
            if count > m:
                return False
    return True

def min_max_sum(nums, m):
    left, right = max(nums), sum(nums)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_split(nums, m, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Example usage:
nums = [7, 2, 5, 10, 8]
m = 2
print(min_max_sum(nums, m))  # Output: 18
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - We initialize `left` to the maximum value in `nums` because a single element forms the smallest divisible subarray.
   - We initialize `right` to the sum of all elements in `nums`, which is the largest subarray sum if we don't split the array at all.

2. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - We perform binary search between `left` and `right`.
   - For each `mid` value, we check if we can partition `nums` into `m` subarrays with each subarray sum <= `mid` using the `can_split` function.

3. **Partition Validation:**
   - The `can_split` function iterates through `nums`, keeping track of the current subarray sum and the number of subarrays. If adding another element to the current subarray exceeds `mid`, we start a new subarray.
   - If the number of subarrays exceeds `m`, it means `mid` is too small, and we adjust our binary search accordingly.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(n log(S))`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array, and `S` is the range between the max element and the sum of all elements in `nums`. This is because:
- Each check (`can_split`) runs in `O(n)`.
- We perform binary search over a range determined by the sum of elements, thus `log(S)` steps.

This solution ensures we efficiently find the minimal possible value for the maximum subarray sum.
