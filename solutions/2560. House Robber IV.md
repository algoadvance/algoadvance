Let's say you are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a line. 

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money stashed at each house and an integer `K` representing the maximum number of houses you are allowed to skip consecutively, return the maximum amount of money you can rob.

### Example:

- Example 1:
    - Input: `nums = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5], K = 2`
    - Output: `9`
    - Explanation: You can rob house 1 and house 3, skipping no more than one house consecutively.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `K` be zero?**
   - Yes, `K` can be zero, which means you can't skip any houses.
   
2. **Can `nums` contain negative values?**
   - No, each element represents money stashed in a house, which is never negative.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   - The constraints will help determine the viability of certain optimization techniques, so it's important to know.
   
4. **Can we skip more than `K` houses consecutively?**
   - No, `K` is the maximum number of houses you can skip consecutively.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum money robbed up to the i-th house without skipping more than `K` houses consecutively.
    
2. **State Definition:** 
    - Define `dp[i]` as the maximum amount of money you can rob up to the i-th house.

3. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize `dp[0]` to `nums[0]` since robbing the first house is the only option.

4. **Transition:**
    - For each house from `1` to `n-1`:
        - `dp[i] = max(dp[j] + nums[i] for all j from max(0, i-K) to i-1)`
        - This ensures that we consider robbing the current house, adding it to the maximum amount robbed up to the previous houses, respecting the constraint of skipping no more than `K` houses.

5. **Result:**
    - The maximum money rob amount would be found at the end of the list, `dp[-1]`.

## Code

```python
def rob(nums, K):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, n):
        max_prev_rob = 0
        for j in range(max(0, i - K), i):
            max_prev_rob = max(max_prev_rob, dp[j])
        dp[i] = max_prev_rob + nums[i]

    return max(dp)

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5]
K = 2
print(rob(nums, K))  # Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n*K)` where `n` is the number of houses and `K` is the max consecutive houses you can skip. For each house, we look back at most `K` houses.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` due to the `dp` array storing the maximum amount robbed up to each house.

This solution uses dynamic programming with nested loops. While there is a nested loop, the inner loop only runs up to `K`, making the algorithm feasible for small values of `K`.
