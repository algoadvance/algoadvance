title:  Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()-out
permalink: /s470
---
Given a function `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range of [1, 7], write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range of [1, 10].

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there any limitation on how many times `rand7()` can be called?**
   - No specific limitations; however, a more efficient solution is preferred.
   
2. **Is `rand7()` guaranteed to be perfectly uniform?**
   - Yes, `rand7()` produces each integer in the range [1, 7] with equal probability.

3. **Where should I implement `rand7()`?**
   - For the sake of this problem, let's assume `rand7()` is already implemented and available for use.

## Strategy
To generate a uniform random number within [1, 10] using `rand7()`, we can use the following strategy:

1. Generate a larger range of equally likely numbers using multiple calls to `rand7()`. Think of it as generating a two-digit number in base 7.
2. Map this larger uniform range to a subset that fits within [1, 10]. If the result does not fit perfectly within [1, 10], reject it and try again.

### Detailed Steps
1. Use two independent calls of `rand7()` to generate a number in the range [1, 49] (i.e., `rand7() - 1` gives us 0 to 6 which can be used simulating digits in base 7).
2. Convert these two independent calls into one combined random number in the range [1, 49].
3. If the generated number falls within [1, 40], map it directly to [1, 10]; otherwise, discard it and retry.

This approach ensures uniformity because each of the numbers from 1 to 49 has an equal chance, and we uniformly map a subset of this range to our desired [1, 10].

### Code Implementation

```python
import random

def rand7():
    return random.randint(1, 7)

def rand10():
    while True:
        num1 = rand7() - 1  # range 0 to 6
        num2 = rand7() - 1  # range 0 to 6
        combined = num1 * 7 + num2  # range 0 to 48
        
        # Only use the result if it's within 0 to 39
        if combined < 40:
            return (combined % 10) + 1  # range 1 to 10

# Testing rand10 function
from collections import Counter

results = [rand10() for _ in range(10000)]
counter = Counter(results)
print("Distribution of results in 10000 trials:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{i}: {counter[i]}")
```

## Time Complexity
The expected time complexity is O(1), though the actual time may vary since we keep retrying until we get a number within the acceptable range. The probability of needing retries is slight, so this remains efficient in practice.

1. **Each `rand7()` call is O(1)**.
2. **The expected number of retries is constant** since we accept numbers in the range [1, 40] and reject from [41, 49], which implies our solution only needs a few attempts in probability terms.

Overall, the solution provides a uniform random distribution in the range [1, 10] efficiently with an expected constant time complexity.
