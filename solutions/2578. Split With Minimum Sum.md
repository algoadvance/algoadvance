title:  Split With Minimum Sum-out
permalink: /s2578
---

Given a positive integer `num`, split it into two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that:
- The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` in any order forms the number `num`.

The task is to find the combination of `num1` and `num2` such that their sum is minimized.

### Example:
- Input: `num = 4325`
- Output: `59`
- Explanation: One of the ways to split `4325` is into `num1 = 42` and `num2 = 35`, resulting in `42 + 35 = 77`. But the better split is `num1 = 25` and `num2 = 34`, resulting in `25 + 34 = 59`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `num1` and `num2` have leading zeros?**
   - No, since they're non-negative integers and should be meaningful representations.

2. **Can `num1` or `num2` be zero?**
   - Yes, one or both can be zero as long as their concatenation forms the original number.

3. **Should the order of the digits in `num` be maintained in the split?**
   - No, the order of the digits can be rearranged as needed to minimize the sum.

### Strategy
1. **Break Down Digits**:
   - Extract the individual digits of the number.
   
2. **Sort the Digits**:
   - Sort the digits in ascending order.
   
3. **Form Two Numbers**:
   - Distribute the digits as evenly as possible between `num1` and `num2` to minimize their sum.
   - Construct `num1` and `num2` such that `num1` takes the smallest remaining digit first, followed by `num2`, and so forth. This tends to balance the magnitude of both numbers, minimizing their sum.

### Code

```python
def split_with_minimum_sum(num: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Extract and sort the digits
    digits = sorted([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the two numbers
    num1, num2 = 0, 0
    
    # Step 3: Distribute the digits
    for i, digit in enumerate(digits):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            num1 = num1 * 10 + digit
        else:
            num2 = num2 * 10 + digit
    
    # Step 4: Return the sum of num1 and num2
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
print(split_with_minimum_sum(4325))  # Output: 59
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting the digits**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of digits in the number.
- **Forming the numbers**: \(O(n)\).
- Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This ensures the solution is efficient even for larger values of `num`.
