title:  Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One-out
permalink: /s1404
---

Given a binary representation of a number `s` as a string, return the number of steps to reduce it to "1" under the following operations:
1. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the number is odd, add 1 to it.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:** 
    - Is the input always valid (i.e., is the binary string never empty and always representing a positive integer)?
    - Is the binary number guaranteed to be non-negative and valid (no leading zeros except for the string "0")?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the result be an integer representing the number of steps?

For this problem, we will assume that the input string `s` is always a valid binary representation of a positive integer, and we need to return an integer representing the number of steps.

### Strategy:
1. **Initialization:** 
    - Convert the binary string to an integer.
2. **Processing:**
    - Iterate with a while loop until the number reduces to 1.
    - For each iteration:
        a. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
        b. If the number is odd, add 1 to it.
    - Count each operation as a step.
3. **Termination:**
    - Return the count of steps once the number reduces to 1.

### Code:
```python
def numSteps(s: str) -> int:
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    num = int(s, 2)
    steps = 0

    # Loop until the number reduces to 1
    while num != 1:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            # Number is even, so divide by 2
            num //= 2
        else:
            # Number is odd, so add 1
            num += 1
        
        # Increment the steps count
        steps += 1
    
    return steps
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Conversion (Binary to Integer):** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the binary string.
- **Operations:** Each bit operation such as dividing by 2 or incrementing is \( O(1) \). While the loop theoretically runs in logarithmic steps relative to the number (in binary this is related to the number of bits), a reduction cycle including the increment step is minimal.
- **Overall:** The time complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the binary string conversion and the simplicity of the loop operations.

### Example:
```python
print(numSteps("1101"))  # Output: 6
```

The steps for "1101" (which is 13) are:
1. 13 (odd) -> 14
2. 14 (even) -> 7
3. 7 (odd) -> 8
4. 8 (even) -> 4
5. 4 (even) -> 2
6. 2 (even) -> 1

This completes the loop with a total of 6 steps.
