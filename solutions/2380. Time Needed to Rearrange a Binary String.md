title:  Time Needed to Rearrange a Binary String-out
permalink: /s2380
---

You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string:

1. Choose two consecutive characters of `s` and swap them.
2. Choose two consecutive characters of `s` that are "10" and swap them to "01".

Determine the minimum number of seconds required to obtain a string without any "10" substrings. Each second, you can perform a series of operations simultaneously.

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "0110101"`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: 
   - First swap "10" at positions 4 and 5 to get "0110011"
   - Second swap "10" at positions 3 and 4 to get "010011"
   - Third swap "10" at positions 2 and 3 to get "001011"
   - Now the string does not contain any "10" substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are multiple swaps allowed in a single second if they do not overlap?
2. Is the input always a valid binary string?
3. What is the length constraint of the string `s`?

### Code

Let's devise a strategy to solve the problem. 

### Strategy
- Initially, identify all the "10" patterns in the string.
- For each second, we need to see how many "10" patterns are there, then swap them to "01".
- Continue this process until there are no more "10" patterns in the string.
- Keep track of the number of seconds taken.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity will be O(n^2) in the worst case, as traversing the string once is O(n), and we might need to do this up to O(n) times if `n` is the number of characters in the string.

Here's the code:

```python
def seconds_to_remove_occurrences(s: str) -> int:
    seconds = 0
    # Loop until no "10" pattern exists
    while '10' in s:
        # Replace all non-overlapping "10" with "01"
        s = s.replace('10', '01')
        seconds += 1
    return seconds

# Example usage:
s = "0110101"
print(seconds_to_remove_occurrences(s))  # Output should be 3
```

### Explanation:

1. We initialize a counter `seconds` to record the number of seconds taken.
2. In each iteration (each second), we check if "10" exists in the string `s`.
3. If it exists, we replace all instances of "10" with "01". This replacement simulates the swaps occurring within one second.
4. We keep track of each second until there are no more "10" patterns in the string.
5. Finally, return the count of `seconds`.

This solution ensures that we are grouping all non-overlapping "10" swaps together, which minimizes the time needed to rearrange the binary string.
