Problem Number: 3158

**Find the XOR of Numbers Which Appear Twice**

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears twice except for one, find that single number which appears twice.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size:** What is the size of the array `nums`?
   - Assume the size of the array is within a manageable range for in-memory computation.
2. **Values in Array:** Are the numbers in the array guaranteed to be integers and within a known range?
   - Assume they are integers and within a reasonable range for XOR operations.
3. **Uniqueness:** Is there exactly one number that appears twice, and all other numbers appear once?
   - Yes, this is assumed as per the problem statement.

## Strategy

### Approach:

To solve this problem, we can use the properties of the XOR operation:

1. **Properties of XOR:**
   - `a ^ a = 0` for any integer `a`
   - `a ^ 0 = a` for any integer `a`
   - XOR is both commutative and associative.

### Plan:

1. Initialize a variable `xor_result` to `0`.
2. Iterate through each number in the `nums` array.
3. Take the XOR of each number with `xor_result`.
4. At the end of the iteration, `xor_result` will contain the number which appears twice, as all other numbers will cancel themselves out.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array since we only need to traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

## Code

```python
def find_duplicate_xor(nums):
    xor_result = 0
    for num in nums:
        xor_result ^= num
    return xor_result

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]  # Expected output: 2
print(find_duplicate_xor(nums))
```
## Explanation:

1. **Initialization:** We start with `xor_result` set to `0`.
2. **Iteration:** For each element in `nums`, we use the XOR operation and update `xor_result`.
3. **Result:** After completing the iteration, `xor_result` will hold the number that appears twice.

This method leverages the properties of the XOR operation to efficiently find the duplicate number in a single pass through the array.
