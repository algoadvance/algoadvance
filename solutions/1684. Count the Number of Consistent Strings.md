title:  Count the Number of Consistent Strings-out
permalink: /s1684
---

Given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`, return the number of consistent strings in the array. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `allowed` contain non-alphabetic characters?
   - According to the problem constraints and common sense, `allowed` contains distinct alphabetic characters.

2. Are the characters in `words` case-sensitive?
   - Yes, they are case-sensitive, and thus 'A' and 'a' would be treated as different characters.

3. Is there a limit to the length of `allowed` or the array `words`?
   - Generally, problems have reasonable constraints within typical coding interview standards (e.g., length of `allowed` <= 100, number of `words` <= 1000, total characters in `words` <= 10000).

### Strategy

1. Convert the `allowed` string into a set of characters for O(1) average-time complexity membership checks.
2. Iterate through each word in the `words` list and check if all characters in the word are present in the `allowed_set`.
3. Maintain a count of the consistent strings and return the final count.

### Code

```python
def countConsistentStrings(allowed, words):
    allowed_set = set(allowed)
    count = 0

    for word in words:
        if all(char in allowed_set for char in word):
            count += 1

    return count
```

### Explanation

1. **Convert `allowed` to Set**: We convert the string `allowed` into a set `allowed_set` to leverage the average O(1) lookup time for determining if a character is in `allowed`.

2. **Iterate Over Each Word**:
   - For each word in the `words` array, we use a generator expression within `all()` to check if every character in the word is present in `allowed_set`.
   - If the word passes the check, it is considered consistent, and we increment our `count` by 1.

3. **Return Count**: Finally, we return the count of consistent strings.

### Time Complexity

- **Converting `allowed` to a set**: O(L), where L is the length of `allowed`.
- **Checking each word**: Let W be the total number of words and N be the maximum length of a word.
  - Checking if all characters of a word are in the set takes O(N) in the worst case.
  - Therefore, the overall time for checking all words is O(W * N).

In summary, the total time complexity is O(L + W * N). Here, `L` is typically much smaller than `W * N`, so the dominating term is `W * N`.
