title:  Sum of Digits of String After Convert-out
permalink: /s1945
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, and an integer `k`. First, you need to convert each character of `s` into its position in the alphabet (i.e., convert 'a' to 1, 'b' to 2, ..., 'z' to 26). Then, transform the resulting number by summing its digits repeatedly, for a total of `k` times. Return the resulting integer after performing the transformations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Example Clarification**: 
   - For example, if `s = "leetcode"` and `k = 2`, the steps would be:
     - Convert characters to positions: `l=12, e=5, e=5, t=20, c=3, o=15, d=4, e=5`.
     - Concatenate these numbers: `12552031545`.
     - Sum the digits of this number once: `1+2+5+5+2+0+3+1+5+4+5 = 33`.
     - Sum the digits again: `3+3 = 6`.
     - Result is `6`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `s` is an empty string? (Although not explicit, we'll assume `s` is non-empty based on typical constraints.)
   - What is the minimum and maximum length of `s` and value of `k`?

### Code

Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def getLucky(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Convert the string to a number formed by the position in the alphabet
    num_str = ''.join(str(ord(char) - ord('a') + 1) for char in s)
    
    # Function to sum digits of a number in string form
    def sum_of_digits(n: str) -> int:
        return sum(int(char) for char in n)
    
    # Start with the massive number string
    curr_str = num_str
    
    # Perform the sum of digits process k times
    for _ in range(k):
        curr_str = str(sum_of_digits(curr_str))
        
    return int(curr_str)

# Example usage
s = "leetcode"
k = 2
print(getLucky(s, k)) # Output: 6
```

### Strategy

1. **Convert Characters to Positions**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
   - Convert each character to its corresponding position (e.g., 'a' to 1, 'b' to 2, etc.).
   - Concatenate these positions to form a large number in string format.

2. **Perform Digit Sum Transformations**:
   - Define a helper function that takes a string of digits and computes the sum of its digits.
   - Apply this helper function `k` times to the initial large number string.
   - After `k` transformations, convert the final string back to an integer and return it.

### Time Complexity

1. **Character to Position Conversion**: 
   - This step runs in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

2. **Sum of Digits**:
   - Each transformation in sum of digits iterates over the digits of the number formed. The length of number formed is approximately in order of magnitude O(n) where `n` is the original string length.
   - Performing this operation `k` times introduces an additional factor.

Thus, the total time complexity is about O(kn), where `n` is the length of the input string and `k` is the number of repetitions.

This ensures efficiency even for reasonable input sizes.
