title:  Sum of Mutated Array Closest to Target-out
permalink: /s1300
---
Given an integer array `arr` and a target value `target`, you must mutate the integer array by replacing each of the integers with a non-negative integer `value` such that the sum of the mutated array comes closest to `target`. The mutated array should be of the same length as the original array. Return the non-negative integer `value` used to replace the array elements to get the closest sum.

### Example:
```python
arr = [4,9,3]
target = 10
```
Output: `3`

### Explanation:
- If we replace each number in the array with 3, the array becomes [3, 3, 3], and the sum is 9, which is the closest possible sum to 10.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the original array have negative numbers?
   **A:** No, it is mentioned that the integers to be replaced are non-negative integers.
   
2. **Q:** If two values result in sums that are equally close to the target, which one should be returned?
   **A:** Return the smaller one.

3. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the array?
   **A:** The problem constraints need to be checked for this detail.

## Strategy
1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Each element of `arr` will be replaced with a non-negative integer `value`.
   - The goal is to find the `value` so that the sum of the mutated array is as close to `target` as possible.

2. **Approach:**
   - Since all elements are being replaced with the same value, we can derive a direct relationship.
   - Use binary search to determine the optimal `value`. This approach is efficient compared to a linear search approach.

3. **Steps:**
   - Compute the sum of the array when all elements are replaced by `value`.
   - Start with the range for `value` from 0 to the maximum element in the array.
   - Use binary search to minimize the absolute difference between the sum and the target.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n log(max(arr)))`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and `max(arr)` is the maximum value in the array.

## Code
```python
def findBestValue(arr, target):
    def calc_sum(value):
        return sum(min(x, value) for x in arr)
    
    left, right = 0, max(arr)
    best_value, closest_diff = 0, float('inf')
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        current_sum = calc_sum(mid)
        current_diff = abs(current_sum - target)
        
        if current_diff < closest_diff:
            best_value, closest_diff = mid, current_diff
        elif current_diff == closest_diff:
            best_value = min(best_value, mid)
        
        if current_sum < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            
    return best_value

# Example usage:
arr = [4, 9, 3]
target = 10
print(findBestValue(arr, target))  # Output: 3
```

This code uses the binary search technique to find the optimal replacement value that brings the sum of the mutated array closest to the target. The `calc_sum` function computes the sum of the array with each element's value capped by a specific `value`. The main loop performs the binary search and keeps track of the closest sum to the target.
