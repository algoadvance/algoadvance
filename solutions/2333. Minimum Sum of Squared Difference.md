title:  Minimum Sum of Squared Difference-out
permalink: /s2333
---

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and an integer `k`.

The *sum of squared difference* of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the sum of `(nums1[i] - nums2[i])^2` for all `0 <= i < n`.

You are allowed to reduce exactly `k` elements from `nums1` or `nums2` by 1. You are also allowed to reduce any element more than once. The goal is to minimize the sum of squared differences after performing at most `k` decrements.

Return *the minimum sum of squared differences* that is possible after at most `k` decrements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can elements in `nums1` and `nums2` be negative?
2. Are the values of the integers in `nums1` and `nums2` bounded?
3. Can `k` be 0, meaning no decrements are allowed?

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Initial Differences:** First, compute the initial differences |nums1[i] - nums2[i]| for all `i`.

2. **Use a Max-Heap:** Utilize a max-heap to always target the largest difference first. This helps in effectively reducing the largest contributions to the sum of squared differences.

3. **Decrementing Strategy:** Repeatedly (up to `k` times) decrement the largest difference available in the max-heap until there are no more decrements left or the difference becomes zero.

4. **Recompute Sum of Squared Differences:** After performing up to `k` decrements, compute the final sum of squared differences.

5. **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when all differences are already zero.

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the initial list of differences and heapifying it takes \(O(n)\).
- Each decrement operation on the max-heap is \(O(\log n)\), performed up to \(k\) times.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + k \log n)\).

### Code Implementation

```python
import heapq

def min_sum_of_squared_difference(nums1, nums2, k):
    n = len(nums1)
    differences = []
    
    # Calculate initial differences and convert to a max-heap
    for i in range(n):
        differences.append(abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]))
    
    # Create a max-heap (invert values to use Python's min-heap as max-heap)
    differences = [-diff for diff in differences]
    heapq.heapify(differences)
    
    # Apply up to k decrements
    for _ in range(k):
        if differences[0] == 0:
            break
        max_diff = -heapq.heappop(differences)
        heapq.heappush(differences, -(max_diff - 1))
    
    # Calculate the sum of squared differences
    sum_squared_diff = sum((-diff) ** 2 for diff in differences)
    
    return sum_squared_diff

# Example usage:
# nums1 = [1, 2, 3]
# nums2 = [4, 3, 2]
# k = 1
# print(min_sum_of_squared_difference(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output will vary based on `k` and values in nums1 & nums2
```

This approach reduces the largest differences first, ensuring that we achieve the minimum sum of squared differences effectively.
