### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - What is the range of the input Roman numerals? Typically, Roman numeral values range from 1 to 3999.
2. **Input Format**: 
    - Can we assume the input is always a valid Roman numeral string containing characters like 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M'?

Assuming the input is within these constraints, we can proceed to the next steps.

### Strategy
1. **Mapping Roman Numerals to Integers**:
    - Create a dictionary to map single Roman numeral characters to their respective integer values.
  
2. **Iterate through the String**:
    - Traverse the string and for each character, check its value.
    - Normally add its value to the result. However, there is a special case:
        - If a smaller or equal value numeral comes before a larger numeral (like IV for 4), you need to subtract the smaller value.

3. **Handling Subtractions**:
    - Compare each numeral with the next one. If the current numeral is smaller than the next numeral, subtract its value from the result; otherwise, add it.

### Code

```python
def romanToInt(s: str) -> int:
    # Mapping of Roman numerals to their integer values.
    roman_to_int = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    }
    
    total = 0
    prev_value = 0
    
    # Process each character in the Roman numeral string from right to left
    for char in reversed(s):
        current_value = roman_to_int[char]

        # If the current value is at least the previous value, add it
        if current_value >= prev_value:
            total += current_value
        else:
            # If the current value is less than the previous value, subtract it
            total -= current_value
        
        # Update the previous value
        prev_value = current_value
    
    return total

# Example usage:
print(romanToInt("III"))    # Output: 3
print(romanToInt("IV"))     # Output: 4
print(romanToInt("IX"))     # Output: 9
print(romanToInt("LVIII"))  # Output: 58
print(romanToInt("MCMXCIV"))# Output: 1994
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string. Each character is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as the dictionary for the Roman numeral mappings is of a constant size, and we're using a fixed number of additional variables.

Is there any specific part of the problem you would like to delve into further, or any clarification needed on the strategy or code?
