title:  Destroy Sequential Targets-out
permalink: /s2453
---

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `space`. You want to destroy every number in this array one by one to form a new array called `targets`. You want to maximize the minimum number you can destroy sequentially.

Destroying a number in the array always removes one element from the current set of possible targets. However, the destruction rule specifies that given any number, its destruction will disqualify every number obtainable by adding or subtracting `space` from it repeatedly.

You are to determine the highest possible minimum number that can be destroyed sequentially under the given condition.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 8, 4], space = 2
Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is meant by "destroy sequentially" and "highest possible minimum number"?**
   - "Destroy sequentially" means we need to remove numbers from the list following some identified pattern.
   - "Highest possible minimum number" means we need to identify a sequence such that the minimum number in that sequence is as high as possible.

2. **Could you clarify what happens when a number is destroyed?**
   - Destroying a number means it's removed from the set of integers directly, along with any other numbers in the sequence defined by repeatedly adding or subtracting `space`.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Modulo Space Concept**:
    - Generate groups based on modulo `space`. Numbers belonging to the same modulo when divided by `space` create a disqualification chain.

2. **Use Counting to Determine Feasibility**:
    - For each modulo group, count the numbers and determine the maximum possible minimum number by checking the group with the highest count.

3. **Consider Sequential Strategy**:
    - Once grouped, choose the number with the highest frequency within its mod group, as it signifies the most numbers can be eliminated in a sequence maintaining high examples in each destruction round.

### Code

Here's the complete Python code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def destroy_sequential_targets(nums, space):
    mod_map = defaultdict(list)

    # Group numbers based on their modulo with space
    for num in nums:
        mod_map[num % space].append(num)
        
    max_min, max_freq = 0, 0
    
    # Determine the maximum possible minimum
    for mod_set in mod_map.values():
        mod_set.sort()  # Sort to get minimum sequence easily
        count = Counter(mod_set)
        nums_in_mod_group = len(mod_set)
        local_min = mod_set[0]
        
        if nums_in_mod_group > max_freq or (nums_in_mod_group == max_freq and local_min > max_min):
            max_freq = nums_in_mod_group
            max_min = local_min

    return max_min

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 6, 1, 8, 4]
space = 2
print(destroy_sequential_targets(nums, space))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Grouping Phase**: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Processing Each Group**: O(m log m) for sorting, repeated for each unique modulo value `k`, so effectively O(k*m log m), where k is the max unique modulo.
- **Total Complexity**: Given the constraints, the complexity approximates to O(n log n) because the length of unique modulo is significantly less than n.

This strategy ensures correctness and efficiently determines the highest feasible minimum number by leveraging grouping and frequency analysis.
