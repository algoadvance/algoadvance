title:  The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n-out
permalink: /s1415
---

A **happy string** is a string that:
- Consists only of the letters ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- Doesn't contain any two consecutive characters that are the same.

Given two integers `n` and `k`, your task is to:
- Return the k-th lexicographical string of all happy strings of length `n`.
- If there are less than `k` happy strings of length `n`, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10
   - 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100

2. **Output:**
   - A string of length `n` consisting only of 'a', 'b', 'c' which is the k-th lexicographical happy string or an empty string if `k` exceeds the total count of happy strings of length `n`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive backtracking approach to generate all happy strings of a given length `n` and then pick the k-th one. However, because we are interested in the lexicographical order, we can employ a more efficient method:

1. Iterate from the start forming happy strings by choosing the smallest possible character ('a', 'b', 'c') that can be appended without breaking the happy string condition.
2. Use a counter to keep track of how many happy strings we have generated so far.
3. Stop when we reach the k-th happy string and return it.

### Steps:

1. **Generate Happy Strings:**
   - Create a recursive function `generate_happy_string` that takes current_string, remaining_length, and a results list (which holds generated happy strings).

2. **Backtracking Mechanism:**
   - At each step, try appending 'a', 'b', and 'c' to current_string making sure the newly formed string still adheres to the happy string property.

3. **K-th String Selection:**
   - Once enough happy strings are generated, pick the k-th one.

4. **Edge Case:**
   - If `k` exceeds the number of happy strings, return an empty string.

## Code

```python
def getHappyStrings(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    happy_strings = []
    
    def generate_happy_string(current_string, remaining_length):
        # Base case: if the length is reached, append to result
        nonlocal happy_strings
        if remaining_length == 0:
            happy_strings.append(current_string)
            return
        
        # Backtracking step: try adding 'a', 'b' and 'c'
        for char in 'abc':
            if not current_string or current_string[-1] != char:
                generate_happy_string(current_string + char, remaining_length - 1)
    
    generate_happy_string('', n)
    
    # Check if k-th happy string exists
    if k <= len(happy_strings):
        return happy_strings[k - 1]
    else:
        return ""

# Example usage:
n = 3
k = 9
print(getHappyStrings(n, k))  # Outputs the 9-th lexicographically happy string of length 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Backtracking Complexity:** The time complexity is O(3^n) since every character has 3 possible choices and we generate all possible strings of length n.
- **Overall Complexity:** The overall time complexity will be O(3^n) due to recursive calls and string operations.

However, this method is suitable given the constraints (with n up to 10, hence 3^10 = 59049 possible strings which is feasible).
