title:  Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II-out
permalink: /s3017
---

You are given a list of houses and need to count the number of houses that are located at a certain distance from a specified house.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Format:**
    - What format are the houses provided in? Are they coordinates, addresses, or something else?
    - What is the structure of the input? Is it a list of tuples representing coordinates?
    - What form does the distance come in? Is it Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or another form?

2. **Distance Metric:**
    - How is the distance calculated between houses?
    
3. **Output:**
    - Should the function return just the count of houses, or should it return the houses as well?

For the sake of the problem, let's assume:
- The houses are provided as a list of tuples representing their coordinates in a 2D plane.
- The distance is the Euclidean distance.
- We will return the count of houses that are exactly at the specified Euclidean distance from the given house.

### Code:

```python
import math

def count_houses_at_distance(houses, target_house, target_distance):
    def euclidean_distance(point1, point2):
        return math.sqrt((point1[0] - point2[0]) ** 2 + (point1[1] - point2[1]) ** 2)
    
    count = 0
    for house in houses:
        if euclidean_distance(house, target_house) == target_distance:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Strategy:

1. **Distance Computation:** 
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance between each house and the target house using the formula
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}
     \]
     where \((x1, y1)\) are the coordinates of the target house and \((x2, y2)\) are the coordinates of the other houses.
     
2. **Counting:**
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of houses at the specified distance.
   - Iterate through the list of houses:
     - Compute the Euclidean distance for each house.
     - If the distance matches the target distance, increment the counter.
   
3. **Return the result.**

### Time Complexity:

- **Distance Calculation:** For each house, we compute the Euclidean distance which takes \(O(1)\) time.
- **Iterating through the list:** We iterate through each house which takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of houses in the list.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Example:

```python
houses = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)]
target_house = (0, 0)
target_distance = math.sqrt(2)

print(count_houses_at_distance(houses, target_house, target_distance))  # Output: 1
```

This outlines a clear approach to solving the problem effectively while also considering both the algorithm's implementation and its efficiency.
