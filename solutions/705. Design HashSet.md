Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries. Implement the `MyHashSet` class:

- `void add(key):` Inserts the value `key` into the HashSet.
- `bool contains(key):` Returns whether the value `key` exists in the HashSet or not.
- `void remove(key):` Removes the value `key` in the HashSet. If `key` does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Values**: What are the possible ranges of input values for key? 
   - Typically, keys could be within a certain range, e.g., 0 to 1,000,000.
2. **Operations Frequency**: Are there any constraints on the number of operations to be performed?
   - Typically, assumptions are based on performance needs to handle in average O(1) time for each operation using hashing.
3. **Concurrency**: Should we design this to handle concurrent operations?
   - Generally, not required unless specified.

Given these constraints, we will use a simplistic yet effective approach to designing the HashSet.

### Strategy
We can simulate the behavior of a hash set using a list of lists (also known as buckets). The approach involves:
1. Each element hashing to a particular bucket.
2. Each bucket maintaining a list of keys inserted.

Key steps and design:
1. **Hashing Function**: We will implement a simple modulo operation for hashing.
2. **Buckets Array**: We create an array of a fixed size, each element is an empty list for chaining.
3. **Operations**:
   - **Add**: Compute hash, navigate to bucket, check if element exists, otherwise append.
   - **Contains**: Compute hash, navigate to bucket, check for the element.
   - **Remove**: Compute hash, navigate to bucket, remove the element if found.

### Time Complexity
- **Add**: Average O(1), Worst case O(n) in case of hash collisions (n is the number of keys)
- **Contains**: Average O(1), Worst case O(n)
- **Remove**: Average O(1), Worst case O(n)

### Code
```python
class MyHashSet:
    
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        self.bucket_count = 1000
        self.buckets = [[] for _ in range(self.bucket_count)]

    def _hash(self, key: int) -> int:
        """
        Hashing function to compute bucket index.
        """
        return key % self.bucket_count

    def add(self, key: int) -> None:
        """
        Add a key into the HashSet.
        """
        bucket_index = self._hash(key)
        if key not in self.buckets[bucket_index]:
            self.buckets[bucket_index].append(key)

    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:
        """
        Remove a key from the HashSet.
        """
        bucket_index = self._hash(key)
        if key in self.buckets[bucket_index]:
            self.buckets[bucket_index].remove(key)

    def contains(self, key: int) -> bool:
        """
        Returns true if this set contains the specified element
        """
        bucket_index = self._hash(key)
        return key in self.buckets[bucket_index]
```

### Example Execution
```python
# Initialize a new HashSet
hashSet = MyHashSet()

# Add elements
hashSet.add(1)
hashSet.add(2)

# Check for elements
print(hashSet.contains(1))  # Returns True
print(hashSet.contains(3))  # Returns False

# Remove an element
hashSet.remove(2)

# Check again
print(hashSet.contains(2))  # Returns False
```

### Summary
This solution provides a simple and effective way of implementing a HashSet using a fixed bucket array and basic list operations, focusing on constant time complexity for average-case scenarios.
