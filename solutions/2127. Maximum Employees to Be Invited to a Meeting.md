You are given an n x n integer matrix, `heights`, where `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the terrain at position `(i, j)`. You are initially on the top-left position `(0, 0)`, and you want to reach the bottom-right position `(n-1, n-1)`.

A move from position `(x1, y1)` to position `(x2, y2)` is possible if and only if:
1. The new coordinates are within bounds and
2. The absolute difference in terrain heights between the two positions is less than or equal to a given threshold.

Determine the minimum threshold required so that it is possible to go from the top-left position to the bottom-right position. 

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation and Binary Search**: The problem can be represented as a pathfinding problem on a graph where each cell is a node and an edge exists between nodes if the height difference between them is within a certain threshold.
2. **Binary Search**: To determine the minimum threshold, we can perform a binary search on the possible height differences.
3. **Pathfinding using BFS/DFS**: For each midpoint in the binary search, we validate if a path exists using a pathfinding algorithm like BFS or DFS.

## Code

```python
def minimumEffortPath(heights):
    import heapq
    
    def canReach(threshold):
        n = len(heights)
        m = len(heights[0])
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        heap = [(0, 0, 0)] # (difference, x, y) - Start with the top-left corner
        
        while heap:
            diff, x, y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if x == n-1 and y == m-1:
                return True # succeeded in reaching the bottom-right corner
            
            if visited[x][y]:
                continue
            
            visited[x][y] = True
            
            # Explore the neighbors
            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny]:
                    current_diff = abs(heights[nx][ny] - heights[x][y])
                    if current_diff <= threshold:
                        heapq.heappush(heap, (max(diff, current_diff), nx, ny))
        
        return False # could not reach the bottom-right corner
    
    # Binary search over the potential thresholds from 0 to max_diff
    low, high = 0, max(max(heights[i][j] for j in range(len(heights[0]))) for i in range(len(heights))) - min(min(heights[i][j] for j in range(len(heights[0]))) for i in range(len(heights)))
    
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if canReach(mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low

# Example use case
print(minimumEffortPath([[1, 2, 2], [3, 8, 2], [5, 3, 5]])) # Output will be 2
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search**: Logarithmic in the range of possible differences.
2. **Pathfinding (BFS)**: Linear in the total number of cells * E, where each cell has approximately 4 edges in a grid.

Given the complexity of each individual BFS being O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices (n^2), and `E` is the number of edges (up to 4n^2), we get an overall complexity of O((V + E) * log(max_height_diff)) = O((n^2) * log(max_height_diff)).
