title:  Remove Element-out
permalink: /s27
---

The problem is to remove all instances of a specific value in a given array in-place and return the new length of the array. The order of elements can be changed, and the elements beyond the new length do not matter.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2, 2, _, _]
```
Note: The underscore (_) represents irrelevant values beyond the desired new length.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the array contains the value to be removed?**
   - Not necessarily. The array can have zero or more instances of the value.

2. **What should be the return type?**
   - An integer representing the new length of the array.

3. **Can we use extra space?**
   - The problem specifies that the removal should be done in-place, so we should not use extra space.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a variable `i` as the index where the next non-`val` element should be placed.
2. Iterate over each element in the array using a for-loop.
   - If the current element is not equal to `val`, place it at the index `i` and increment `i`.
3. The final value of `i` will be the new length of the array.
4. Modify the array in-place to reflect this change (although the problem does not strictly require this, it ensures correctness).

## Code

Here's the Python implementation based on the strategy:

```python
def removeElement(nums, val):
    i = 0
    for j in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != val:
            nums[i] = nums[j]
            i += 1
    return i

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 2, 3]
val = 3
new_length = removeElement(nums, val)
print("New length:", new_length)  # Output: 2
print("Modified array:", nums[:new_length])  # Output: [2, 2]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. This is because we iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are doing the operation in-place with a constant amount of extra space.
