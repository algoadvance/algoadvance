title:  Paint House III-out
permalink: /s1473
---

Given a row of `m` houses (0-indexed), each house can be painted with one of the `n` colors. Some houses are initially painted, and others are not. A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

The goal is to paint all the houses such that there are exactly `target` neighborhoods. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is given in an `m x n` matrix `cost`.

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses, or -1 if it is not possible.

**Example:**
```
Input:
houses = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
cost = [[1,10], [10,1], [10,1], [1,10], [5,1]]
m = 5
n = 2
target = 3

Output:
9

Explanation:
Paint houses into this order: [1,2,2,1,1]. Cost = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 9.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are we allowed to paint a house that's already painted?
   - Let's assume we cannot repaint already painted houses.
2. What are the possible values for colors?
   - Colors are integers ranging from 1 to `n`.

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. **State Representation**:
   - `dp[i][j][k]`: Minimum cost to paint the first `i+1` houses where the `i-th` house is painted with color `j+1` and there are exactly `k+1` neighborhoods up to the `i-th` house.
   
2. **Transition**:
   - If the house `i` is already painted (`houses[i] != 0`):
     - We can only proceed with this specific color.
     - If color changes, increase the neighborhood count.
   - If the house `i` is not painted (`houses[i] == 0`):
     - Try painting it with each color.
     - Compute costs and update neighborhoods accordingly.

3. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][j][0]` is initialized based on the cost of painting the first house with color `j+1` if it's not already painted.

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - The answer will be the minimum value of `dp[m-1][j][target-1]` for all `j`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def minCost(houses, cost, m, n, target):
    MAX_COST = float('inf')
    dp = [[ [MAX_COST] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n) ] for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Handling the first house
    if houses[0] == 0:
        for color in range(n):
            dp[0][color][0] = cost[0][color]
    else:
        dp[0][houses[0] - 1][0] = 0
    
    # Fill the dp array
    for i in range(1, m):
        for k in range(target):
            for color in range(n):
                if houses[i] != 0 and houses[i] - 1 != color:
                    continue
                current_cost = 0 if houses[i] != 0 else cost[i][color]
                
                for prev_color in range(n):
                    if color == prev_color:
                        dp[i][color][k] = min(dp[i][color][k], dp[i-1][prev_color][k] + current_cost)
                    else:
                        dp[i][color][k+1] = min(dp[i][color][k+1], dp[i-1][prev_color][k] + current_cost)
    
    answer = min(dp[m-1][c][target-1] for c in range(n))
    return -1 if answer == MAX_COST else answer

# Example Usage
houses = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
cost = [[1, 10], [10, 1], [10, 1], [1, 10], [5, 1]]
m = 5
n = 2
target = 3
print(minCost(houses, cost, m, n, target))
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(m * n * n * target) since we are iterating over all houses `m`, all colors `n`, and all possible previous colors `n` for each of the `target` neighborhoods.
- Space Complexity is also O(m * n * target) for the DP array.
