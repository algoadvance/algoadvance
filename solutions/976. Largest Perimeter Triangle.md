title:  Largest Perimeter Triangle-out
permalink: /s976
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Are there any constraints on the length of the input array `nums`?
   - Typically `nums.length` would range from 3 to 10^4.

2. **Element Constraints**: Are the values in `nums` guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, `nums` consists of positive integers.

3. **Edge Cases**: Should the function handle small input sizes (less than 3)?
   - If the input array length is less than 3, we can directly return `0` since it's impossible to form a triangle.

### Strategy

To form a valid triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `a <= b <= c`), the triangle inequality theorem states that `a + b > c`. The goal is to find the largest possible perimeter under this constraint.

1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the array in descending order to maximize the perimeter. Consider the first three elements and check if they can form a triangle.
  
2. **Greedy Approach**: Iterate over the sorted list, always checking the first three elements that haven't been ruled out. If they satisfy the triangle condition, their sum is the maximum possible perimeter.

3. **Early Termination**: Once a valid triangle is found, return its perimeter immediately since sorting in descending order ensures maximum perimeter is considered first.

### Code

```python
def largestPerimeter(nums):
    # Sort the numbers in descending order
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Check each triplet of consecutive elements
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i] < nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]:
            # Found a valid triangle, return its perimeter
            return nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]
    
    # No valid triangle found
    return 0
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Iteration**: O(n) for scanning through the list after sorting.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step. The subsequent scan is linear and thus does not affect the leading term.
