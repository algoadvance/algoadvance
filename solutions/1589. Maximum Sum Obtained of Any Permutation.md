Given an array of integers `nums` (0-indexed) and an array of integer queries where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]`, each query represents an operation where you add 1 to each element in the subarray `nums[left_i...right_i]` (for `0 <= left_i <= right_i < len(nums)`). Find the maximum possible sum of the array `nums` that can be obtained after performing all the operations mentioned in the queries in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
    - \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^5 \)
    - \( 0 \leq \mathrm{nums[i]} \leq 10^5 \)
    - \( 1 \leq \mathrm{queries.length} \leq 10^5 \)
    - \( 0 \leq \mathrm{left_i} \leq \mathrm{right_i} < \text{nums.length} \)
    
2. **Output:**
    - Return a single integer representing the maximum possible sum of the array `nums`.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
    - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `nums` after applying all the queries.
    - Each query increments a subarray, so the frequency of increments across different segments of the array will differ.

2. **Approach:**
    - Use a difference array technique to efficiently handle range update queries.
    - Calculate the net increment effect on each index using the difference array.
    - Sort the indices of `nums` by the net increment effect in descending order.
    - Sort `nums` itself in ascending order.
    - Pair the highest increments with the largest values in `nums` to maximize the sum.

3. **Steps:**
    - Create a difference array to manage range updates.
    - Convert the difference array to the actual frequency of increments for each index.
    - Sort the frequency array in descending order.
    - Sort `nums` in ascending order.
    - Compute the resulting maximum sum by pairing highest frequencies with largest numbers in `nums`.

4. **Time Complexity:**
    - Building and processing the difference array: `O(n + q)` where `q` is the number of queries.
    - Sorting the frequency and `nums` arrays: `O(n log n)`.

### Code

```python
def maxSumRangeQuery(nums, queries):
    n = len(nums)

    # Step 1: Create a difference array
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)

    for left, right in queries:
        freq[left] += 1
        if right + 1 < n:
            freq[right + 1] -= 1

    # Step 2: Convert the difference array to the actual frequency array
    for i in range(1, n):
        freq[i] += freq[i - 1]

    # We don't need the extra last element of freq now
    freq = freq[:n]

    # Step 3: Sort the frequency array and nums array
    freq.sort(reverse=True)
    nums.sort()

    # Step 4: Compute the maximum sum
    max_sum = 0
    for f, num in zip(freq, nums):
        max_sum += f * num

    return max_sum

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
queries = [[1, 3], [0, 1]]
print(maxSumRangeQuery(nums, queries))  # Output should be 19 given optimal updates
```

### Explanation

1. **Difference Array:**
    - We use a difference array to mark the beginning and end of the range influenced by each query.
    - `freq[left] += 1` increments the start of the range.
    - `freq[right + 1] -= 1` decrements just after the end of the range to counter the increment beyond the end.

2. **Frequency Array:**
    - We convert the difference array to the frequency array, which tells us how many times each index in `nums` will be incremented.

3. **Sorting:**
    - Sorting the frequency array in descending order ensures that the indices with the highest increments come first.
    - Sorting `nums` in ascending order allows pairing the largest values with the highest frequencies.

4. **Result Computation:**
    - We compute the sum by multiplying the highest frequencies with the largest numbers in `nums`.

This approach guarantees the maximum possible sum given the constraints.
