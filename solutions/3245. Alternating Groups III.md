title:  Alternating Groups III-out
permalink: /s3245
---

You are given an array of integers and a positive integer `k`. You need to rearrange the elements in the array into alternating groups of size `k` such that for two consecutive groups of size `k`, one group is in ascending order and the next group is in descending order, alternating in this manner. If the length of the array is not a multiple of `k`, the last few elements should form a group of size less than `k` but should still follow the alternating pattern.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], k = 3
Output: [1,2,3,6,5,4,7,8,9,12,11,10]

Input: nums = [5,6,2,3,7,4,1,8], k = 2
Output: [2,3,6,5,1,4,7,8]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there any limitation on the size of the input array?
2. **Duplicates**: Can the array contain duplicate numbers?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle edge cases such as an array smaller than `k`, or `k` being greater than the array size?

### Strategy

1. **Group Formation**: Divide the array into groups of size `k`.
2. **Sorting**: Maintain a flag to alternate between ascending and descending order for each group.
3. **List Construction**: Construct the result by appending the sorted groups according to the alternating pattern.

### Code

```python
def alternating_groups(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    result = []
    ascending = True  # Flag to determine the sorting order

    for i in range(0, n, k):
        group = nums[i:i + k]  # Extract group of size k or less

        if ascending:
            result.extend(sorted(group))  # Sort in ascending order
        else:
            result.extend(sorted(group, reverse=True))  # Sort in descending order

        ascending = not ascending  # Alternate the flag

    return result

# Example usage
print(alternating_groups([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 3))
print(alternating_groups([5, 6, 2, 3, 7, 4, 1, 8], 2))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log k)\):

- **Splitting the Array**: This step runs in \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array.
- **Sorting Each Group**: Each group of size \(k\) is sorted. Since there are \(\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil\) groups, and each sorting operation on average takes \(O(k \log k)\), the total time complexity for sorting is \(O(\frac{n}{k} \cdot k \log k) = O(n \log k)\).

This approach efficiently rearranges the array while maintaining the alternating group order as required.
