title:  Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations-out
permalink: /s1210
---
You are playing a snake game on a grid. The game is played on an \( n \times n \) grid with integers ranging from 1 to n.

The snake starts as a length 2 segment at the top-left corner of the grid, specifically at cells (1,1) and (1,2). The initial position of the snake is horizontal, with the head at (1,2) and the tail at (1,1).

The goal is to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid, specifically with the tail at cell (n-1,n-1) and the head at cell (n,n). You are allowed to make the following moves:

1. Move Right: Move the snake one cell to the right.
2. Move Down: Move the snake one cell downwards.
3. Rotate the snake clockwise 90 degrees if the space allows for this placement.

Write a function to determine the minimum number of moves required for the snake to reach the target position. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Strategy
We can model the problem using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore the minimum moves needed to reach the goal. Each state in the queue will represent the position and orientation of the snake, and we will explore all possible subsequent moves from each state.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the snake move independently of the walls and other obstacles on the grid?
   - No, the snake must stay within the boundaries of the grid.
2. Are there any obstacles or is the grid clear?
   - The problem doesn't mention any obstacles except the boundaries of the grid.
3. Can the snake extend beyond the grid's boundary?
   - No, the snake must remain within the grid.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

def minimum_moves(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    if grid[n-2][n-1] == 1 or grid[n-1][n-1] == 1:
        return -1
    
    def is_valid(x, y, orientation):
        if orientation == 'H':
            return 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y+1 < n and grid[x][y] == 0 and grid[x][y+1] == 0
        else:
            return 0 <= x+1 < n and 0 <= y < n and grid[x][y] == 0 and grid[x+1][y] == 0
    
    queue = deque([((0, 0), 'H', 0)])
    visited = set([((0, 0), 'H')])
    
    while queue:
        (x, y), orientation, steps = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (n-2, n-1) and orientation == 'H':
            return steps
        
        if orientation == 'H':
            if is_valid(x, y + 1, 'H') and ((x, y + 1), 'H') not in visited:
                visited.add(((x, y + 1), 'H'))
                queue.append(((x, y + 1), 'H', steps + 1))
            if is_valid(x + 1, y, 'H') and ((x + 1, y), 'H') not in visited:
                visited.add(((x + 1, y), 'H'))
                queue.append(((x + 1, y), 'H', steps + 1))
            if is_valid(x + 1, y, 'V') and ((x, y), 'V') not in visited:
                visited.add(((x, y), 'V'))
                queue.append(((x, y), 'V', steps + 1))
        else:
            if is_valid(x + 1, y, 'V') and ((x + 1, y), 'V') not in visited:
                visited.add(((x + 1, y), 'V'))
                queue.append(((x + 1, y), 'V', steps + 1))
            if is_valid(x, y + 1, 'V') and ((x, y + 1), 'V') not in visited:
                visited.add(((x, y + 1), 'V'))
                queue.append(((x, y + 1), 'V', steps + 1))
            if is_valid(x, y + 1, 'H') and ((x, y + 1), 'H') not in visited:
                visited.add(((x, y + 1), 'H'))
                queue.append(((x, y + 1), 'H', steps + 1))
    
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\) due to the BFS traversal across the grid. We explore each state once and there are at most \(n^2\) states, given the constraints of the grid size and possible positions of the snake.
