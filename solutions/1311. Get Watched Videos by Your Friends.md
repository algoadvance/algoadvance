title:  Get Watched Videos by Your Friends-out
permalink: /s1311
---
You have a list of friends, and each friend has a list of watched videos. Given your ID in the friends list, you can see the videos watched by your friends up to a certain level of friendship. Return a list of video titles ordered by the frequency of occurrence in the watched videos list of your friends who are at the specified level in ascending order. If two videos have the same frequency, they should be sorted in lexicographical order.

### Example:
```python
watchedVideos = [["A", "B"], ["C"], ["B", "C"], ["D"]]
friends = [[1,2], [0,3], [0,3], [1,2]] 
id = 0
level = 1
```
Output: `["B", "C"]`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any constraints or limits on the size of the input lists?
2. Can it be guaranteed that all friends are reachable at some level?
3. What should be the output if there are no friends at the specified level?

---

### Strategy:
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We will use BFS to compute the friends at the given level `level`. This is to explore the friends at level distance from the given `id`.
2. **Frequency Count**: Once we have the list of friends at the target level, we will compile all the watched videos by these friends and count their frequencies.
3. **Sorting**: Finally, we will sort the videos first by frequency and then lexicographically and return the sorted list.

### Code:
Below is the Python implementation of the strategy.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
import heapq

def watchedVideosByFriends(watchedVideos, friends, id, level):
    # Step 1: BFS to find friends at the specified level
    queue = deque([(id, 0)])
    visited = set([id])
    
    while queue:
        current_id, current_level = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_level == level:
            # All friends at exactly this level
            friends_at_level = [node for node, lvl in queue if lvl == level]
            friends_at_level.append(current_id)  # include the current id because it's level is target too
            break
        
        for friend_id in friends[current_id]:
            if friend_id not in visited:
                visited.add(friend_id)
                queue.append((friend_id, current_level + 1))
    else:
        # If we did not break, it means the level was too high, return empty list
        return []

    # Step 2: Count the frequency of videos watched by the friends at the required level
    video_count = defaultdict(int)
    for friend_id in friends_at_level:
        for video in watchedVideos[friend_id]:
            video_count[video] += 1

    # Step 3: Sort videos by frequency then lexicographically
    sorted_videos = sorted(video_count.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))

    return [video for video, count in sorted_videos]

# Example Usage:
watchedVideos = [["A", "B"], ["C"], ["B", "C"], ["D"]]
friends = [[1,2], [0,3], [0,3], [1,2]] 
id = 0
level = 1
print(watchedVideosByFriends(watchedVideos, friends, id, level))  # Output: ["B", "C"]
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **BFS for finding level friends:**
   - **Worst-case time complexity:** `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (friends) and `E` is the number of edges (friend connections).
2. **Frequency counting:**
   - **Time complexity:** `O(V) * M`, where `M` is the average number of videos per friend.
3. **Sorting:**
   - **Time complexity:** `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the number of unique videos.

**Overall Complexity:** `O(V + E + M*V + N log N)`.

This approach efficiently covers the problem requirements by leveraging BFS for level discovery and basic sorting techniques for result compilation.
