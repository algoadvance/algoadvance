title:  Count Nodes With the Highest Score-out
permalink: /s2049
---

You are given a binary tree root and it consists of `n` nodes. The nodes of the binary tree are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each node has a unique value in this range.

Given a node with value `i`, the following defines its score:

- The left subtree of the node,
- The right subtree of the node, and
- The remaining forest which is formed by removing the subtree rooted at this node (i.e., any connected component that does not contain the node `i`).

The score of a node `i` is the product of the sizes of the above three components.

Your task is to return the number of nodes which have the highest score.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output if there are multiple nodes with the same highest score?**
   - Output the count of such nodes.

2. **What is the structure of the input?**
   - Input is given as `List[int]` where `n` is the number of nodes and the list describes the parent for each node. The root node has a parent of `-1`.

3. **Can we assume the input will always be a valid binary tree?**
   - Yes, the input will be a valid binary tree.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Construction**: Build the tree using the provided parent list.
  
2. **Subtree Sizes Calculation**: Use DFS to calculate sizes of the left and right subtrees for each node.

3. **Score Calculation for Each Node**: For each node `i`, calculate the size of:
   - Left subtree
   - Right subtree
   - The rest of the tree (excluding the subtree rooted at `i`)

4. **Maximize the Score**: Compute the product of these sizes (i.e., `left_size * right_size * remaining_nodes_size`). Track the maximum score and count nodes that achieve this score.

### Code

```python
def countHighestScoreNodes(parents):
    from collections import defaultdict

    n = len(parents)
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Build the adjacency list representation of the tree
    for i, p in enumerate(parents):
        if p != -1:
            tree[p].append(i)
    
    # To store the sizes of subtrees rooted at each node
    subtree_sizes = [0] * n
    
    def calculate_subtree_sizes(node):
        size = 1  # count the node itself
        for child in tree[node]:
            size += calculate_subtree_sizes(child)
        subtree_sizes[node] = size
        return size
    
    # Calculate all subtree sizes starting from the root (node 0)
    calculate_subtree_sizes(0)
    
    max_score = 0
    score_count = 0

    # Now to calculate the score for each node
    for node in range(n):
        score = 1
        remaining_nodes = n - subtree_sizes[node]
        
        if node in tree:
            for child in tree[node]:
                score *= subtree_sizes[child]
        
        if remaining_nodes > 0:
            score *= remaining_nodes
        
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            score_count = 1
        elif score == max_score:
            score_count += 1
    
    return score_count

# Example usage:
# parents = [-1,2,0,2,0]
# Output: 3
#print(countHighestScoreNodes(parents)) 
```

### Time Complexity

- **Tree Construction**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Calculation of Subtree Sizes**: `O(n)`.
- **Score Calculation and Maximization**: `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`. This is efficient given that we have to process each node individually.

The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage needed for the tree representation and the subtree sizes.
