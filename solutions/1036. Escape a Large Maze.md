title:  Escape a Large Maze-out

---

You are given two lists of integer coordinates, `blocked` and `source`, and `target` as integer coordinates and are asked to determine if it is possible to move from the source to the target on a 1e6 x 1e6 grid.

- `blocked` contains the list of blocked points on the grid.
- `source` is the starting point on the grid.
- `target` is the endpoint on the grid.

Determine whether the source can reach the target!

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of movements are allowed?**
   Movements can be made in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

2. **Can we assume the coordinates are all within the range [0, 1e6 - 1]?**
   Yes, you can assume all coordinates are within this range.

3. **How large can the `blocked` list be?**
   The list can contain up to 200 points.

4. **If the source and/or target are blocked, what should be the output?**
   If the source or target is in the `blocked` list, return `False`.

5. **What is the output format?**
   Return `True` if the source can reach the target, otherwise return `False`.

## Strategy

Looking at the problem, I'll utilize a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore the path from `source` to `target`. Given the constraints and the large grid size, the BFS has to take into account the `blocked` cells to avoid infinite loops.

### Pseudocode Strategy

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the `source` or `target` is blocked, return `False`.

2. **Block Set:**
    - Convert the `blocked` list to a set for O(1) access time.

3. **BFS Initialization:**
   - Use a `queue` to keep track of the current positions to explore.
   - Use a `visited` set to track explored positions.

4. **BFS Execution:**
   - Use four possible moves (up, down, left, right).
   - For each move, if the new position is not in `blocked` and not in `visited` and within grid bounds, add it to the `queue` and `visited`.
   - If the `target` is reached, return `True`.

5. **Escape Check:**
   - If we exhaust all possible moves and do not reach the `target`, return `False`.

### Time Complexity

- **BFS Exploration:** The BFS explores each node once so, the worst-case scenario, it involves visiting all nodes in a specific region until hitting a maximum step limit (given by the blocked size).
- **Complexity Bound:** In practical terms, we deal with `blocked` size (<=200) and avoid extreme performance costs by bounding the BFS to a feasible max step region determined by blocked size.

## Code

Let's proceed with the implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def isEscapePossible(blocked, source, target):
    BLOCKED_SIZE_LIMIT = 200  # From constraints
    MAX_STEPS = BLOCKED_SIZE_LIMIT * (BLOCKED_SIZE_LIMIT - 1) // 2  # Max cells forming a "block"
    
    blocked_set = set(map(tuple, blocked))
    
    if tuple(source) in blocked_set or tuple(target) in blocked_set:
        return False
    
    def bfs(from_node, to_node):
        queue = deque([from_node])
        visited = set([tuple(from_node)])
        steps = 0
        
        while queue and steps <= MAX_STEPS:
            x, y = queue.popleft()
            if [x, y] == to_node:
                return True
            
            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < 1e6 and 0 <= ny < 1e6 and (nx, ny) not in visited and (nx, ny) not in blocked_set:
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
                    visited.add((nx, ny))
            
            steps += 1
        
        return steps > MAX_STEPS  # Infeasible to continue blocking in all directions
    
    return bfs(source, target) and bfs(target, source)

# Example usage
blocked = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
source = [0,0]
target = [999999,999999]

print(isEscapePossible(blocked, source, target))  # Expected: True
```

### Explanation:

The implementation uses BFS for exploring paths from both `source` to `target` and `target` to `source` to ensure it isn't trapped in a small, blocked region. The code leverages sets for fast membership testing and ensures movements adhere to grid boundaries and `blocked` cells. The early exit is enhanced by a step's bound `MAX_STEPS` derived from the maximum fenced enclosure by blocked cells.
