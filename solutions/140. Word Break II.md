Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]

Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: []
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are all words in `wordDict` unique?
   - **A:** Yes, each word in `wordDict` is unique.
2. **Q:** What should be the return type if no segmentation is possible?
   - **A:** Return an empty list.
3. **Q:** Are the letters in `s` and the words in `wordDict` all lowercase?
   - **A:** Yes, they are all lowercase.

### Strategy

The main strategy is to use backtracking to explore all possible ways to split the string `s` into words found in `wordDict`. We'll employ memoization to avoid recomputing results for the same substring.

Steps to solve the problem:

1. **Backtracking with Memoization:**
   - We will create a helper function that attempts to segment `s` starting from a given index.
   - Use a dictionary `memo` to store the results of subproblems (i.e., results for substrings).

2. **Base Case and Recursive Case:**
   - Base Case: If the starting index reaches the end of `s`, return a list with an empty string indicating a valid segmentation path.
   - Recursive Case: For each word in `wordDict`, check if the substring starting at the current index begins with this word. If it does, recursively solve for the rest of the string starting from the end of the current word.

3. **Constructing Sentences:**
   - Combine each returned segmentation with the current word to form complete sentences.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def wordBreak(s, wordDict):
    # Convert wordDict to a set for O(1) lookups
    wordSet = set(wordDict)
    # Memoization dictionary
    memo = {}

    def backtrack(start):
        # If we have already computed the result for this start index, return it
        if start in memo:
            return memo[start]
        
        # Result list for current starting index
        results = []
        
        # Base case: if start is beyond last index, return a list with an empty string
        if start == len(s):
            return [""]
        
        # Try every word in the dictionary
        for word in wordSet:
            if s.startswith(word, start):
                # Get all possible sentences for the remaining string
                subSentences = backtrack(start + len(word))
                # Combine current word with each sub-sentence
                for sub in subSentences:
                    results.append(word + ("" if sub == "" else " " + sub))
        
        # Memorize the result for the current starting index
        memo[start] = results
        return results

    # Initiate backtracking from index 0
    return backtrack(0)

# Example usage:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
print(wordBreak(s, wordDict))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is quite complex to analyze accurately due to the recursive nature and the potential exponential number of ways to split the string. However, the use of memoization significantly reduces redundant computations. The worst-case time complexity can potentially be `O(N * 2^N)` where `N` is the length of the string `s`, but in practice, it tends to perform better due to pruning from memoization.

### Additional Notes

- The space complexity is also high due to recursion stack and storage required for memoization which can be `O(N^2)` in the worst case.
- Ensure large inputs are handled efficiently with memoization to avoid excessive computation times.
