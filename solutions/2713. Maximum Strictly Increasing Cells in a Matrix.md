title:  Maximum Strictly Increasing Cells in a Matrix-out
permalink: /s2713
---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` with distinct values. You are allowed to perform the following operation as many times as you want:

- Choose any cell `(i, j)` in `grid` and delete it.

A cell `(i, j)` is *strictly increasing* if the value of the cell is greater than every value of any cell that can potentially appear in a 2-row sequence containing cells at positions `(i, j)` and `(i, j-1)`. You need to determine the maximum number of strictly increasing cells in `grid`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the matrix always distinct?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, the values are distinct.
   
2. **Can we assume that the matrix is not empty?**
   - Yes, we'll assume the matrix has at least one cell.

3. **What is meant by "2-row sequence"? Does it just mean adjacent positions?**
   - A "2-row sequence" means you need to consider both row and column neighbors. That includes cells directly above, below, left, or right of the current cell.
   
### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) table to store the maximum length of strictly increasing cells ending at each cell `(i, j)`.
   - Traverse all cells of the matrix, updating this DP table.
   - Calculate the longest strictly increasing path in the matrix by evaluating the cells' values.
   
2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a `dp` table with the same dimension as `grid`, filled with 1 as each cell is the start of an increasing sequence.
   - Traverse the matrix, and for each cell `(i, j)`:
     - Explore its neighbors `(i-1, j)`, `(i+1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, `(i, j+1)`.
     - Update the DP table by considering if the current cell can extend the strictly increasing sequence from its neighbors.
   - Return the maximum value from the `dp` table as the result.

3. **Traversal Strategy**:
   - Sort the cells based on their values for properly managing strictly increasing conditions.
   - Traverse the grid in the sorted order of cell values to ensure that at any point, while processing a cell `(i, j)`, all possible cells that can come before it in an increasing sequence have already been processed.

### Code Implementation

```python
def maxIncreasingCells(grid):
    from heapq import heappop, heappush
    import collections
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]
    cells = []
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            heappush(cells, (grid[i][j], i, j))
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    while cells:
        value, x, y = heappop(cells)
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] < grid[x][y]:
                dp[x][y] = max(dp[x][y], dp[nx][ny] + 1)
    
    return max(max(row) for row in dp)

# Example usage:
grid = [
   [1, 2, 3],
   [6, 5, 4]
]
print(maxIncreasingCells(grid))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the cells based on value takes \(O(m \cdot n \log(m \cdot n))\).
- Processing each cell and its neighbors will take \(O(m \cdot n)\).

**Overall complexity**: \(O(m \cdot n \log(m \cdot n))\).

### Summary

- We leveraged dynamic programming to keep track of the longest increasing sequence ending at each cell.
- A sorted approach ensured that we processed cells in the right order to accurately compute sequence lengths.
- The overall complexity is efficient for reasonable matrix sizes.
