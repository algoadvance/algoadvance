title:  Partition Array According to Given Pivot-out
permalink: /s2161
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. Rearrange the array `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:
- Every element less than `pivot` appears before every element greater than `pivot`.
- Every element equal to `pivot` appears in the middle.
- The relative order of the elements less than `pivot` and the relative order of the elements greater than `pivot` is preserved.

Return the array after rearranging it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of `nums`?
   - **A**: No specific constraints were mentioned, but typical competitive programming constraints apply.

2. **Q**: Are all elements in `nums` guaranteed to be integers?
   - **A**: Yes, all elements in `nums` are integers.

3. **Q**: May `pivot` be an element not present in `nums`?
   - **A**: Yes, `pivot` may or may not be present in `nums`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use three lists to segregate elements based on their relationship with `pivot`:
1. A list for elements less than `pivot`.
2. A list for elements equal to `pivot`.
3. A list for elements greater than `pivot`.

Once the three lists are populated, we concatenate them to get the desired result.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def pivotArray(nums, pivot):
    less_than = []
    equal_to = []
    greater_than = []

    # Segregate elements into three lists
    for num in nums:
        if num < pivot:
            less_than.append(num)
        elif num == pivot:
            equal_to.append(num)
        else:
            greater_than.append(num)

    # Concatenate the lists to get the final array
    return less_than + equal_to + greater_than

# Example usage:
nums = [9,12,5,10,14,3,10]
pivot = 10
print(pivotArray(nums, pivot))  # Output will be [9, 5, 3, 10, 10, 12, 14]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we traverse the array once to build the three lists, and then concatenate them in linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we store the elements in three separate lists. Thus, the space complexity is linear with respect to the input size.
