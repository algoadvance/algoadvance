**2079. Watering Plants**
You are given an integer array `plants` of length `n`, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `i-th` plant needs. You are initially standing at the river, with an empty watering can that can carry `capacity` units of water. You must follow these rules:

- Water the plants in the order they appear in the array.
- After watering a plant, if the watering can is empty, return to the river to refill it.
- You cannot refill the watering can at any other point except the river.

Given these conditions, return the minimum number of steps you need to take to water all the plants. In this scenario, "steps" means moving from one plant to the next or returning from a plant to the river (which is at the start).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the values of `plants` and `capacity`?
   - What is the maximum length of the array `plants`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Can any plant need more water than the capacity of the watering can?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start at the river with a full can.
   - Keep track of steps taken and the water remaining in the can.

2. **Iterate through the plants:**
   - For each plant, if you can water it with the water remaining in the can, do so and update the steps taken.
   - If you need to refill, add the steps required to return to the river, refill, return to the plant, and then water the plant.

3. **Counting Steps:**
   - Increment steps for each move: moving to the next plant and refilling when necessary.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the required water for any plant exceeds the watering can's capacity, ensure the solution doesn't allow for invalid actions.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm will be **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of plants. We go through the list of plants once, making constant time operations for each plant.

Here's the code implementation:

```python
def wateringPlants(plants, capacity):
    steps = 0
    current_water = capacity
    
    for i in range(len(plants)):
        if plants[i] <= current_water:
            steps += 1  # Step to the next plant
            current_water -= plants[i]
        else:
            steps += (i * 2) + 1  # Steps to go back and forth and then to the next plant
            current_water = capacity - plants[i]
            
    return steps
```

Analyze and design the code to ensure it matches the described strategy.

### Example:

```python
# Example Test Case
plants = [2, 4, 5, 1, 2]
capacity = 6

# Expected Output: 17
print(wateringPlants(plants, capacity))
```

By implementing the given solution, we ensure the conditions are met and the problem is solved within the optimal time constraints.
