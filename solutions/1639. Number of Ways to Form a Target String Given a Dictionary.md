title:  Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary-out
permalink: /s1639
---

You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `target`. Your task is to count the number of ways you can form the target string using exactly one character from each string in `words`. Each character in `words` can only be used once to form the target string, and the order remains important. Since the answer could be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all strings in `words` the same length?**
   - Yes, it can be assumed for typical problem constraints.

2. **What should we do if we can't form the target string using any combination of characters from `words`?**
   - The result will be 0 if the target string can't be formed.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the target string is not longer than the strings in `words`?**
   - Yes, for feasibility in typical problem constraints.

4. **What kind of values should we expect in `words` and `target`?**
   - Both `words` and `target` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Code

```python
def numWays(words, target):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    m, n = len(target), len(words[0])
    
    # Initialize a 2D list to count occurrences of each character at each position
    char_count = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill the char_count array
    for word in words:
        for i, char in enumerate(word):
            char_count[i][ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
            
    # dp[i][j]: number of ways to form target[:i] using the first j characters of each word 
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case: 1 way to form an empty target
    
    for i in range(m + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            if dp[i][j] != 0:
                # If we don't use the j-th column to form the current i-th target character
                # Move to the next column with the same target prefix
                dp[i][j + 1] = (dp[i][j + 1] + dp[i][j]) % MOD 
                
                if i < m:
                    # If we use the j-th column to match the i-th character of the target
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = (dp[i + 1][j + 1] + dp[i][j] * char_count[j][ord(target[i]) - ord('a')]) % MOD
    
    # Sum up all the ways to form the entire target string
    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage:
words = ["acca", "bbbb", "caca"]
target = "aba"
print(numWays(words, target))  # Output should be 6
```

### Strategy

1. **Character Count Array:** 
   - Create a 2D array `char_count` where `char_count[j][c]` records the count of character `c` at position `j` in the list of words.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` indicates the number of ways to form the first `i` characters of the `target` using the first `j` columns of the words list.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0]` to 1 because there's one way to form an empty string.

3. **Transition:**
   - If `dp[i][j]` is nonzero, update:
     - `dp[i][j+1]`: The number of ways to form `i` characters without using the `j`-th column.
     - `dp[i+1][j+1]`: The number of ways to form `i+1` characters if the `j`-th column matches the `i`-th character of the target.

4. **Result:**
   - The result is found in `dp[m][n]` which accumulates all possible ways to form the entire `target`.

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing (Character Count):** O(n * len(words))
- **DP Array Update:** O(m * n)
- **Overall Complexity:** O(m * n + n * len(words))
- Where `m` is the length of `target` and `n` is the length of strings in `words`.
