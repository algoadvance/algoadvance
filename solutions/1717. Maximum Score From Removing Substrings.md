title:  Maximum Score From Removing Substrings-out
permalink: /s1717
---
Given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`, you can perform two types of operations on the string:
1. Remove the substring "ab" for a score of `x`.
2. Remove the substring "ba" for a score of `y`.

Your task is to return the maximum score you can get by removing these substrings any number of times in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the string provided non-empty?
     - Yes, `1 <= len(s) <= 10^5`.
   - Are `x` and `y` non-negative integers?
     - Yes, `0 <= x, y <= 10^4`.

2. **Expected Output**: 
   - The maximum score, which is an integer.

### Strategy
To maximize the score, the order of removal matters due to the differing scores of "ab" and "ba". 
1. If `x > y`, prioritize removing all "ab" substrings first, followed by "ba" substrings.
2. If `y > x`, prioritize removing all "ba" substrings first, followed by "ab" substrings.
3. If `x == y`, the order does not matter; handle with either prioritization.

Detailed steps:
- Use a stack to simulate the removal process:
  1. Iterate through the string and use the stack to keep track of potential substrings.
  2. Whenever a desired substring is found, pop appropriate characters from the stack and increment the score.
  3. Repeat the process for the second priority substring after handling the first priority.

### Time Complexity
- Each character in the string is processed a limited number of times (once for each pass), leading to an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.

### Code
```python
def maximumGain(s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:
    def remove_pattern(input_str, first, second, score):
        stack = []
        total_score = 0
        for char in input_str:
            if stack and stack[-1] == first and char == second:
                stack.pop()
                total_score += score
            else:
                stack.append(char)
        return ''.join(stack), total_score
    
    if x > y:
        s, score1 = remove_pattern(s, 'a', 'b', x)
        _, score2 = remove_pattern(s, 'b', 'a', y)
    else:
        s, score1 = remove_pattern(s, 'b', 'a', y)
        _, score2 = remove_pattern(s, 'a', 'b', x)

    return score1 + score2

# Example usage:
s = "cdbcbbaaabab"
x = 4
y = 5
print(maximumGain(s, x, y))  # Output should be the maximum score after removing substrings
```

This code performs the task efficiently, prioritizing the removal of substrings based on given scores. This ensures the highest possible score by always dealing with the higher priority substring first.
