title:  Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number-out
permalink: /s2220
---

You are given two integers `start` and `goal`. You want to convert `start` to `goal` using the minimum number of bit flips.

A **bit flip** is where you change a 0 to a 1 or a 1 to a 0.

Return the minimum number of bit flips to convert `start` to `goal`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: start = 10, goal = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 10 is 1010 and the binary representation of 7 is 0111. We need to flip all the bits at positions 0, 1, and 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: start = 3, goal = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is 011 and the binary representation of 4 is 100. We need to flip all the bits at positions 0, 1, and 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `start` and `goal`?
   - **A:** Typically, integers in such problems are within the range of 32-bit signed integers, so we can assume that \( -2^{31} \leq \text{start}, \text{goal} \leq 2^{31} - 1 \).

2. **Q:** Can the values of `start` and `goal` be negative?
   - **A:** Yes, they can be negative within the given constraints. However, we will typically deal with their unsigned binary representations.

## Strategy

To determine the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`, we can use the following approach:

1. **XOR Operation:** Perform the XOR operation between `start` and `goal`. The XOR operation results in a bit being set to `1` if the bits differ, and `0` if they are the same.
   
2. **Count Set Bits:** Count the number of `1`s in the result of the XOR operation. This count will give the minimum number of bit flips needed to convert `start` to `goal`.

### Steps

1. Compute `xor_result = start ^ goal`.
2. Count the number of `1` bits in `xor_result`.
3. Return the count as the result.

## Code

```python
def minBitFlips(start: int, goal: int) -> int:
    xor_result = start ^ goal
    return bin(xor_result).count('1')

# Example usage
start = 10
goal = 7
print(minBitFlips(start, goal))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the maximum value between `start` and `goal`. This is because in the worst case, we check all the bits of `xor_result`, which is proportional to the number of bits required to represent `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we use a constant amount of extra space for variables and do not use any additional data structures.

Feel free to run the example cases to see if the solution works as described. If there are any more specific constraints or edge cases to consider, please let me know!
