title:  Adding Spaces to a String-out
permalink: /s2109
---

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a list of integers `spaces`, where each integer in `spaces` represents an index in the string `s`. All the indices are sorted in **increasing order**.

Add spaces to `s` according to the positions specified in `spaces`.

For example, consider `s = "EnjoyYourCoffee"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`. Adding spaces at indices 5 and 9 would result in `"Enjoy Your Coffee"`.

Return the modified string after the spaces have been added.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Minimum and Maximum Length of `s`:** What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `spaces`?
2. **Overlapping or Out-of-Bounds Indices:** Are we guaranteed that the indices in `spaces` are within the bounds of the string `s` and do not overlap?
3. **Nature of `spaces`:** Is the list `spaces` guaranteed to be sorted in increasing order?
4. **Edge Cases:** What are the edge cases that need to be considered, such as an empty string or no spaces to be added?

### Strategy

Given the constraints and structure of the problem:
1. We will create a list to store the characters of the resulting string.
2. We will iterate through the string `s`, and for each character index, check if it is in the `spaces` list.
3. If the current index is in `spaces`, we add a space before appending the character to the result list.
4. Finally, we will join the list into a single string and return it.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + k), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `k` is the length of the `spaces` list. We iterate over the string once and check the current index against the `spaces` list using a set for O(1) average time complexity on lookups.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + k) to store the resulting string and the set of indices respectively.

### Code

```python
def add_spaces(s: str, spaces: list) -> str:
    # Convert spaces list to a set for quicker lookup
    space_set = set(spaces)
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i in space_set:
            result.append(' ')
        result.append(s[i])
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:
s = "EnjoyYourCoffee"
spaces = [5, 9]
print(add_spaces(s, spaces))  # Output: "Enjoy Your Coffee"
```

This code efficiently adds spaces to the string `s` at the given indices provided in `spaces`, ensuring optimal performance with respect to both time and space complexity.
