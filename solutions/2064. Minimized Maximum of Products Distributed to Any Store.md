title:  Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store-out
permalink: /s2064
---

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of stores, and an integer array `quantities` where `quantities[i]` is the number of products of the i-th type. You need to distribute all products to the stores and minimize the maximum number of products given to any store. Return the minimized maximum number of products distributed to any store.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we distributing all products in `quantities` to exactly `n` stores?**
   - Yes, all products must be distributed to the `n` stores.

2. **Is it guaranteed that there is a feasible solution for any given `n` and `quantities`?**
   - Yes, there is always a way to distribute the products to the stores.

3. **What are the constraints?**
   - `1 <= n, quantities[i] <= 10^5`
   - The length of `quantities` (i.e., number of product types) is between 1 and 10^5.

## Strategy

To minimize the maximum number of products assigned to any store, a binary search strategy can be effective:

1. **Binary Search on the Maximum Number of Products per Store**: 
   - Define the search space for the binary search: the minimum possible number of products per store is `1`, and the maximum is the maximum value in the `quantities` array.
   
2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For a given mid-point in binary search, determine if it is possible to distribute products such that no store gets more than `mid` products.
   - If it is possible, move the search space to the left (try smaller values to minimize further).
   - If it is not possible, move the search space to the right (increase the number of allowable products per store).

3. **Helper Function**:
   - Implement a helper function to check if distributing products with the constraint of `max_products_per_store` is possible given `n` stores.

### Implementation

```python
def minimizedMaximum(n: int, quantities: list[int]) -> int:
    def canDistributeWithMaxProducts(max_products_per_store: int) -> bool:
        stores_needed = 0
        for quantity in quantities:
            stores_needed += (quantity + max_products_per_store - 1) // max_products_per_store
            if stores_needed > n:
                return False
        return True

    left, right = 1, max(quantities)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canDistributeWithMaxProducts(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
            
    return left
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search operates over a range from `1` to `max(quantities)`, which is `O(log(max(quantities)))`.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - Each feasibility check iterates over all product types in `quantities`, leading to `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the `quantities` array.
   
Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(m * log(max(quantities)))` which is efficient given the constraints.

This approach leverages the efficiency of binary search to minimize the maximum number of products that any store receives under the distribution constraints.
