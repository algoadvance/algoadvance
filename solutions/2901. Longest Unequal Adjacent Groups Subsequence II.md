### 1. Problem Statement:
You are given a string `s` consisting of lower case English letters. Your task is to return the length of the longest subsequence where no two adjacent characters are the same.

### 2. Clarifying Questions:
To ensure we fully understand the problem, here are a few clarifying questions:

- Is the subsequence meant to be contiguous in the original string, or can it be non-contiguous?
- Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
- Should the solution focus on efficiency due to the potential length of `s`?

### 3. Strategy:
Given the nature of the problem, the main goal is to find the length of the longest subsequence where no two adjacent characters are the same. 

- A subsequence can be formed by deleting some or no characters of the string without changing the order of the remaining characters.
- We need to ensure that while adding characters to the subsequence, no two consecutive characters are the same.

The strategy can be as follows:
- Iterate through the string.
- Maintain a resultant subsequence where no two adjacent characters are the same.
- Whenever adding a new character, ensure it’s not the same as the last added character.

### 4. Code:
Here’s a Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
def longest_unequal_adjacent_subsequence(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the length of the longest subsequence
    longest_length = 1
    
    # Traverse the string and build the longest subsequence
    for i in range(1, s.length):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            longest_length += 1
    
    return longest_length

# Example Usage
s = "aabacccba"
print(longest_unequal_adjacent_subsequence(s))  # Output should be 5
```

### 5. Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We only traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This code ensures that we extract the longest subsequence where no two adjacent characters are the same in an optimal manner.
