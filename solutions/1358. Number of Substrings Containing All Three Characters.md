title:  Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters-out
permalink: /s1358
---
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters a, b, and c, return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - Is the input string `s` guaranteed to contain only the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'?
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?

2. **Output Details**: 
   - Should the count include overlapping substrings?
   - Is there a required time complexity for the solution?

Let's assume typical constraints unless otherwise specified:
- The length of string `s` is â‰¤ 100,000.
- The string only consists of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- Substrings may overlap.

### Strategy
We can use the sliding window (two-pointer) technique to solve this problem efficiently. Here is the general idea:
1. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both at the start of the string.
2. We expand the `right` pointer to include more characters in the current window until it contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.
3. Once a valid window is found, every substring starting from `left` to any position from `right` to the end of the string will be valid.
4. We then move the `left` pointer to try and find new substrings.

By doing this, we ensure that we count all valid substrings efficiently.

### Code

```python
def numberOfSubstrings(s: str) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    count = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    substr_count = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        count[s[right]] += 1
        
        while all(count[char] > 0 for char in 'abc'):
            # All characters a, b, and c are in the current window
            # Hence, all substrings from `left` to end are valid
            substr_count += len(s) - right
            # Slide the window
            count[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
    
    return substr_count
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: A `defaultdict` to count characters and maintain the window's character counts.
- **Iteration with `right` pointer**: Loop through the string with the `right` pointer expanding the window.
- **Check Valid Window**: Use an inner while loop to check if the current window has all characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- **Counting Substrings**: Once a valid window is found, count all substrings that start from `left` and end from `right` to the end.
- **Shrink Window**: Move the `left` pointer to find new potential windows.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the string. This is because each character is processed at most twice, once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer as the window slides.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since the `count` dictionary size is fixed (only 'a', 'b', and 'c').

This efficient approach ensures that we maximize performance while maintaining clarity and correctness.
