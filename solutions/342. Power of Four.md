Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of four if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 4^x`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints on the input value `n`?
   - **Assumption**: The input `n` is a 32-bit signed integer.

2. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle the edge cases such as `n = 0` or `n = 1`?
   - **Assumption**: `n = 0` should return `false`, and `n = 1` should return `true` since `4^0 = 1`.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Check**: If `n` is less than or equal to zero, it cannot be a power of four. Return `false`.

2. **Pattern Matching**: Using logarithms. A number `n` is a power of four if `log4(n)` is an integer. We can use the change of base formula:
   - `log4(n) = log(n) / log(4)`
   - If the result is an integer, then `n` is a power of four.

3. **Bit Manipulation**: This approach uses bit manipulation properties specific to powers of four:
   - Power of four numbers in binary form are `1` followed by an even number of `0`s. This property makes the bitwise AND operation useful.
   - The number must be a power of two (i.e., `n & (n - 1) == 0`).
   - The number mod `3` should be `1` (since `4^x % 3 = 1`).

Here, we'll go with the bit manipulation approach as it is more efficient in terms of time complexity.

### Code
```python
def isPowerOfFour(n: int) -> bool:
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0 and (n % 3 == 1)
```

### Explanation
1. **Check negativity and zero**: If `n` is non-positive (`n <= 0`), return `false`.
2. **Power of Two Check**: `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` checks if `n` is a power of two.
3. **Power of Four Check**: `(n % 3 == 1)` ensures `n` is specifically a power of four by checking its modulo `3`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(1)** because all the operations involved (bitwise AND, comparison, and modulo) are constant time operations.
