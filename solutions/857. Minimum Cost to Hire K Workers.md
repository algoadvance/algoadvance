title:  Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers-out
permalink: /s857
---

You are given `n` workers. Each worker has a `quality` and a minimum `wage` expectation. We want to hire exactly `k` workers to form a paid group. Each worker in the paid group should be paid in the ratio of their `quality` compared to other workers in the paid group. 

More formally, suppose we hire `k` workers and their quality is `quality[i], quality[i+1], ..., quality[i+k-1]`, and their minimum wage expectation is `wage[i], wage[i+1], ..., wage[i+k-1]`. Then, the ratio of their pay must be the same, i.e., `wage[i] / quality[i] = wage[j] / quality[j]` for any two workers in the paid group.

Salary of each worker in the paid group will then be `wage[j] * (total wage of the group / total quality of the group)` for each selected worker `j`.

Return the minimum cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

### Constraints:

- `n == quality.length == wage.length`
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume each worker has a unique quality-wage pair?
   - Yes, there are no workers with exactly the same quality and wage combination.
2. If two workers have the same wage/quality ratio, should we prefer one over the other?
   - The problem definition implies that we can choose any combination as long as the group size is `k` and the wage rule is maintained.

## Strategy

1. **Normalize by Wage-Quality Ratio**: Compute the wage-to-quality ratio for each worker.
2. **Sort by Ratio**: Sort the workers by their wage-to-quality ratio.
3. **Minimize Cost**: Iterate through the sorted list, maintaining a heap of the `k` smallest quality workers. At each step, compute the total cost if we use the current worker's ratio as the base ratio.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def mincostToHireWorkers(quality, wage, K):
    workers = sorted((w / q, q) for q, w in zip(quality, wage))
    heap = []  # max-heap to keep track of the k smallest qualities
    total_quality = 0
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for ratio, q in workers:
        heapq.heappush(heap, -q)
        total_quality += q
        
        if len(heap) > K:
            total_quality += heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        if len(heap) == K:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_quality * ratio)
    
    return min_cost

# Example Usage
quality = [10, 20, 5]
wage = [70, 50, 30]
K = 2
print(mincostToHireWorkers(quality, wage, K))  # Output: 105.0
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the `workers` list by their ratio: `O(n log n)`
- Iterating through the sorted list and maintaining a heap: `O(n log k)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` because `n log n` will dominate `n log k` for large values of `n`.

The space complexity is `O(n)` due to storing the list of workers and the heap.
