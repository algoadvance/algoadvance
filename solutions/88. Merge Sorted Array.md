title:  Merge Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s88

## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.  

Merge `nums2` into `nums1` such that the merged array is also sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What do you mean by merging `nums2` into `nums1`? 
   - Typically, `nums1` will have enough space allocated at the end to hold all elements of `nums2`.
   
2. Are the inputs guaranteed to be sorted?
   - Yes, both `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. Can we assume that `nums1` has enough space to hold the combined elements of both arrays?
   - Yes, `nums1` has a size of `m + n` where the last `n` elements are empty (0) and can be used to merge `nums2`.

## Strategy

To merge `nums2` into `nums1`, we can take a backwards approach. Because both arrays are sorted, we start comparing elements from the end of both arrays and place the larger element at the end of `nums1`. This ensures we don’t overwrite any elements in `nums1` that we haven’t processed yet:

1. Initialize three pointers:
   - `p1` pointing to the last element of the first `m` elements in `nums1`
   - `p2` pointing to the last element in `nums2`
   - `p` pointing to the last position of `nums1`

2. Iterate in reverse order:
   - Compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`
   - Place the larger value at `nums1[p]`
   - Move pointer `p` backward
   - Move the corresponding pointer (`p1` or `p2`) backward

3. If any elements are left in `nums2` (i.e., `p2` >= 0), copy them into `nums1`.

## Code

Here is the Python implementation of the strategy described:

```python
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    # Start from the last positions of nums1 and nums2 respectively
    p1 = m - 1
    p2 = n - 1
    p = m + n - 1

    # Merge in reverse order
    while p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0:
        if nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]:
            nums1[p] = nums1[p1]
            p1 -= 1
        else:
            nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
            p2 -= 1
        p -= 1

    # If there are remaining elements in nums2, copy them
    # This caters for cases where all elements in nums1 are already in correct position
    while p2 >= 0:
        nums1[p] = nums2[p2]
        p -= 1
        p2 -= 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n) because we iterate through each element of `nums1` and `nums2` exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we do not use any additional space proportional to the input size. We are modifying `nums1` in place.

This method solves the problem efficiently and adheres to the constraints provided.
