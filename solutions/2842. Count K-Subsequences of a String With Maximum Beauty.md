title:  Count K-Subsequences of a String With Maximum Beauty-out
permalink: /s2842
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to determine the number of distinct k-subsequences of `s` with maximum beauty. 

A k-subsequence is defined as a subsequence of length `k`, and the beauty of a subsequence is defined as the sum of the distinct characters' frequencies in `s`.

Return the number of distinct k-subsequences of `s` with the maximum beauty.

### Example
1. Input: `s = "abcd", k = 2`
   Output: `6`

2. Input: `s = "aabb", k = 2`
   Output: `5`

3. Input: `s = "abcabcab", k = 3`
   Output: `22`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Do we need to consider case sensitivity in the string?
2. Can the input string contain any character, including non-alphabetic ones?
3. Are there any constraints on the string length and the value of `k`?

Assuming general constraints like:
- The length of the string `s` is between 1 and 1000.
- `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to the length of `s`.

## Strategy

1. **Character Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of each character in the string. This will help in determining the maximum beauty.
2. **Sort Frequencies**: Sort the characters based on their frequencies in descending order. The more frequent characters would lead to higher beauty.
3. **Select Top `k` Characters**: Select the top `k` frequent characters to form the most beautiful k-subsequence.
4. **Combination Calculation**: Calculate the number of distinct subsequences that can be formed using these `k` characters.

### Steps
1. Compute the frequency of each character.
2. Sort the characters by frequency in descending order.
3. If the number of distinct characters is less than `k`, directly return 0.
4. Use combinations or another method to count the distinct k-subsequences formed by the top frequent characters.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def count_k_subsequences_with_max_beauty(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Calculate frequency of each character
    freq = Counter(s)
    
    # Step 2: Sort characters by frequency in descending order
    sorted_chars = sorted(freq, key=freq.get, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 3: Check if possible to form k-subsequences
    if len(sorted_chars) < k:
        return 0
    
    # Step 4: Create a list of the most frequent characters (top k elements)
    top_k_chars = sorted_chars[:k]
    
    # Count all distinct k-length subsequences with these top k characters
    subseq_set = set()
    
    for comb in combinations(top_k_chars, k):
        subseq = ''.join(comb)
        subseq_set.add(subseq)
        
    return len(subseq_set)

# Example usage
s1 = "abcd"
k1 = 2
print(count_k_subsequences_with_max_beauty(s1, k1))  # Output: 6

s2 = "aabb"
k2 = 2
print(count_k_subsequences_with_max_beauty(s2, k2))  # Output: 5

s3 = "abcabcab"
k3 = 3
print(count_k_subsequences_with_max_beauty(s3, k3))  # Output: 22
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Calculation**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
2. **Sorting**: O(d log d) where `d` is the number of distinct characters.
3. **Combinations Generation**: The time complexity depends on `k` and the number of combinations, but for generating in the worst case, it can be O(C(d,k)).

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution can vary, but is dominated by the combination generation part, typically O(C(d, k)) where `d` is the number of distinct characters.

### Note
The solution currently handles the problem of finding and counting distinct k-subsequences by using combinations directly, which may need adjustments based on more rigorous constraints or requirements specified in the problem statement.
