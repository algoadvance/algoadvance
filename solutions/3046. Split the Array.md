title:  Split the Array-out
permalink: /s3046
---
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you are tasked with splitting it into one or more non-overlapping subarrays. Each subarray should contain the maximum possible elements but must adhere to the following conditions:
- Each subarray is a consecutive sequence from `nums`.
- The sum of any subarray must be an odd number.

Return the minimum number of subarrays required to achieve this goal.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Size and Values:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` array?
   - Is there a range for the values within `nums`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the input `nums` is empty?
   - How to handle cases where all elements are even? Should we split each element individually?

3. **Properties of Odd Sum:**
   - What is the definition of an odd sum in the context of this problem?

### Code:
No Python code has been provided yet. Let's proceed to the strategy.

### Strategy:
1. **Understanding "Odd Sum":**
   - A sequence has an odd sum if the sum of its elements is an odd number.
   - This means if we are to split the array into subarrays, each subarray must have an odd-summation.

2. **Breaking it Down:**
   - To ensure a subarray has an odd sum, the sum of its elements must be odd.
   - We know that adding any even number does not change the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum. Hence, an odd sum is obtained if there is an odd number of odd integers.

3. **Approach:**
   - Traverse the array while maintaining the cumulative sum.
   - Whenever the cumulative sum becomes odd, consider this as a valid subarray.
   - If the sum is even and cannot be made odd by extending, start a new subarray to satisfy the condition.

4. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum number of subarrays.
   - Traverse the array and keep a running sum.
   - When the running sum is odd, consider it as a subarray and reset the running sum. Increment the count of subarrays.
   - If the running sum stays even, continue to the next element.
   - Finalize the subarray count and return it.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n) since we traverse the array once.

### Implementation:

```python
def min_subarray_to_make_sum_odd(nums):
    subarray_count = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum % 2 != 0:  # Check if current sum is odd
            subarray_count += 1    # A subarray with an odd sum is found
            current_sum = 0        # Reset current sum for the next subarray
            
    # If there's any leftover sum that's not zero, it means there's one more subarray
    if current_sum != 0:
        subarray_count += 1

    return subarray_count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(min_subarray_to_make_sum_odd(nums))  # Output: expected number of subarrays
```

In this implementation:
- We loop through each element of the array `nums`.
- We maintain the cumulative sum of elements seen so far.
- If this sum becomes odd, we treat this as the end of a valid subarray and reset the sum.
- The overall complexity remains linear, O(n), as desired.

This solution adheres to the problem requirements and efficiently determines the minimum number of subarrays with an odd sum.
