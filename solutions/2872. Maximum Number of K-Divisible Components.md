title:  Maximum Number of K-Divisible Components-out
permalink: /s2872
---

### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (an undirected graph without cycles) that consists of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` edges. Each node has a value represented by an array `nums` where `nums[i]` is the value of the i-th node.

Given an integer `k`, determine the maximum number of components that you can get such that the sum of the values in each component is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the ranges for `n` and `k`?
   - Are the values in `nums` always non-negative?

2. **Output Details**:
   - Should the output be an integer representing the maximum number of components?
   
3. **Tree Structure**:
   - Is it ensured that the input always forms a valid tree?
   
### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. Here is a detailed strategy:

1. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Traverse the tree using DFS to explore the nodes and edges.
   
2. **Tree Partitioning**:
   - During the traversal, calculate the sum of subtree values for each node.
   - If the sum of a subtree rooted at a node is divisible by `k`, it represents a valid component and we can start a new component.

3. **Component Counting**:
   - Keep track of the current component sum during traversal.
   - Each time we find a divisible sum, increment the component count and reset the current sum.

4. **Edge Consideration**:
   - Since it's a tree, every cut results in exactly two subtrees. If one subtree's sum is divisible by `k`, we consider that part as a separate component.

### Code

Here is the Python code that implements the above strategy:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxKDivisibleComponents(self, n, edges, nums, k):
        tree = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            tree[u].append(v)
            tree[v].append(u)

        def dfs(node, parent):
            subtree_sum = nums[node]
            count = 0
            for neighbor in tree[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                sub_count, sub_sum = dfs(neighbor, node)
                count += sub_count
                subtree_sum += sub_sum

            if subtree_sum % k == 0:
                count += 1
                return count, 0
            
            return count, subtree_sum

        component_count, _ = dfs(0, -1)
        # Subtract 1 because the whole tree is initially counted as a component
        return component_count - 1

# Example usage:
# solver = Solution()
# n = 5
# edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
# nums = [2, 3, 6, 9, 5]
# k = 5
# print(solver.maxKDivisibleComponents(n, edges, nums, k))  # Output will depend on this sample
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. This is because we are performing a DFS traversal of the tree which visits each node and each edge exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily for the recursion stack in the DFS call and the tree representation using adjacency lists.

This should provide a good foundation for solving the given problem. Feel free to ask further questions if you have any!
