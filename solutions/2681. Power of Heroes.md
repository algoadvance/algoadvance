title:  Power of Heroes-out
permalink: /s2681
---

Given an array `nums` of integers representing the power levels of n heroes, you are tasked with calculating the total amount of power that the hero squad can generate. The power generated by a squad is defined as the sum of the powers of all chosen heroes times the minimum hero’s power in that squad. Specifically, you need to consider all possible non-empty subsets of heroes and find the maximum power sum generated by any subset.

Return the total amount of maximum power generated modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Subset:** Do we need to consider all non-empty subsets of `nums`?
   - Yes, we need to consider all non-empty subsets of `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:** What should be done if the array is empty?
   - This won’t happen given the constraint that we will always have at least one hero.

3. **Constraints:** What are the limit constraints on `n` (length of `nums`) and the value of the elements in `nums`?
   - Usually, these constraints will be mentioned or can be assumed to be sufficiently large typical of coding problems.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Subsets Calculation:** 
    - For each non-empty subset of `nums`, calculate the power sum as `sum(subset) * min(subset)`.
    - Find the maximum possible power sum among all subsets.

2. **Efficient Calculation Approach:**
   - Calculating all possible subsets can be computationally expensive. Instead, consider a combinatorial approach or properties of sums and minimums.
   
### Code

Here's a general implementation approach in Python:

```python
def max_power_of_heroes(nums):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Sort the array
    nums.sort()
    
    # Initialize precomputed powers of 2
    power = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        power[i] = (power[i-1] * 2) % MOD
    
    result = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # `nums[i]` can be the smallest of any 2^i subsets and the largest of 2^(n-i-1) subsets
        add_val = nums[i] * ((power[i] - power[n-i-1]) % MOD)
        result = (result + add_val) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [2, 1, 4, 7]
print(max_power_of_heroes(nums))  # Example output calculation
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** `O(n log n)`
- **Calculating the power of subsets:** `O(n)`
- **Total time complexity:** This amounts to `O(n log n)` given the sorting is the dominant factor.

This approach effectively avoids the need to explicitly handle each subset, making it much more efficient than exponential subset enumeration.
