**2601. Prime Subtraction Operation**

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

You can perform one operation on `nums` where you replace a non-negative integer `nums[i]` with `nums[i] - p` and `p` is a prime number such that `nums[i] - p` >= 0.

Return `true` if you can make `nums` a strictly increasing array using the above operation and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: In the first step, we can replace `nums[1]` with `nums[1] - 2` when `i = 1`, which makes `nums` = [4, 7, 6, 10]. In the second step, we can replace `nums[2]` with `nums[2] - 3`, which makes `nums` = [4, 7, 1, 10]. Finally, we can replace `nums[3]` with `nums[3] - 9`, which makes `nums` = [4, 7, 1, 1]. Now `nums` is strictly increasing.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [6,5,4,3]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make `nums` a strictly increasing array using the given operation.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, here are some questions and assumptions to make sure we understand the problem correctly:

1. Can the same prime number be used multiple times for different elements?
2. If `nums` is already strictly increasing, should we return `true`?
3. Can `p` be any prime number less than or equal to `nums[i]` for any `i`?

Once we have clarified these, we can proceed with the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Generate Prime Numbers**: We first generate all prime numbers up to the maximum possible value in the `nums` array, which is 1000.
2. **Prime Subtraction**: For each element in the `nums` array (starting from the second element), we try to replace it with `nums[i] - p` where `p` is a prime number, such that the resultant array remains strictly increasing after this replacement.

Given the constraints of the problem, generating prime numbers up to 1000 is computationally feasible using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the python code to implement the solution:

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):
    is_prime = [True] * (n+1)
    is_prime[0], is_prime[1] = False, False
    
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
                
    return [i for i in range(2, n+1) if is_prime[i]]

def can_become_strictly_increasing(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return True
    
    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(1000)
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
            found = False
            for prime in primes:
                if nums[i] - prime > nums[i - 1]:
                    nums[i] -= prime
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
    
    return True

# Test cases
print(can_become_strictly_increasing([4, 9, 6, 10])) # Output: True
print(can_become_strictly_increasing([6, 5, 4, 3])) # Output: False
```

## Time Complexity

- Generating primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes takes O(n log log n) where n is the max number (1000 here).
- We iterate through the elements of the `nums` array and in the worst case, check all primes, leading to a complexity of O(n * p) where n is the length of the array and p is the number of primes.

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough.
