title:  Alphabet Board Path-out
permalink: /s1138
---
Given a string `target`, return the sequence of moves to spell out `target` on an alphabet board. The alphabet board is a 5x5 grid of letters from `'a'` to `'z'` in order:
```
"a b c d e"
"f g h i j"
"k l m n o"
"p q r s t"
"u v w x y"
"z"
```
The board has the following layout:
```
[
  "abcde",
  "fghij",
  "klmno",
  "pqrst",
  "uvwxy",
  "z"
]
```
Starting from the position at `[0,0]` (letter `'a'`), you can only move left (`'L'`), right (`'R'`), up (`'U'`), or down (`'D'`). You can also stay in the same position to select the current character (`'!'`). Your goal is to find the path that spells out `target`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `target` string contain characters not present in the board or it is guaranteed that `target` will always contain characters from `'a'` to `'z'`?
2. Are we concerned about the efficiency of the move sequence, or is merely finding any valid sequence sufficient?

## Code
```python
def alphabetBoardPath(target: str) -> str:
    def get_position(c):
        # Given a character, returns the corresponding position on the board
        index = ord(c) - ord('a')
        return (index // 5, index % 5)
    
    result = []
    curr_pos = (0, 0)  # Starting at 'a'
    
    for char in target:
        target_pos = get_position(char)
        
        # Move up before left to handle 'z'
        while curr_pos[0] > target_pos[0]:
            result.append('U')
            curr_pos = (curr_pos[0] - 1, curr_pos[1])
        
        # Move left
        while curr_pos[1] > target_pos[1]:
            result.append('L')
            curr_pos = (curr_pos[0], curr_pos[1] - 1)
        
        # Move down
        while curr_pos[0] < target_pos[0]:
            result.append('D')
            curr_pos = (curr_pos[0] + 1, curr_pos[1])
        
        # Move right
        while curr_pos[1] < target_pos[1]:
            result.append('R')
            curr_pos = (curr_pos[0], curr_pos[1] + 1)
        
        # Once we reach the target character
        result.append('!')
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
print(alphabetBoardPath("leet"))
print(alphabetBoardPath("code"))
```

## Strategy
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - Create a helper function `get_position(c)` that, given a character, computes its position `(row, column)` on the alphabet board.
   
2. **Path Construction**:
   - Initialize the current position to `(0, 0)` (starting at 'a').
   - For each character in the target string:
     - Compute the target position using `get_position(char)`.
     - Move vertically (`'U'` or `'D'`) before moving horizontally (`'L'` or `'R'`) to ensure that when moving from the central rows and columns ('a' to 'y'), we do not accidentally overshoot positions because of the shorter length in the last row.
     - At each step, append the corresponding moves to the result list.
     - Finally, append `'!'` to indicate character selection.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `target` string because we process each character in the string in a constant number of steps (each involving a movement based on fixed distances on a relatively small grid).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the result list that stores the sequence of moves.
