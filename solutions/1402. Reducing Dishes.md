title:  Reducing Dishes-out

You are given an integer array `satisfaction` of length `n` where `satisfaction[i]` is the satisfaction level of the `i`-th dish. You can cook any number of dishes (including none) in any order. The `Like-time coefficient` of the dishes is defined as the sum of `satisfaction[i] * time` (where `time` is the time of cooking and serves as an incrementing integer starting from 1 for the first dish you cook).

Return the maximum `Like-time coefficient` that you can obtain after optimally selecting dishes to cook.

### Example:
```
Input: satisfaction = [-1,-8,0,5,-9]
Output: 14
Explanation: After Removing the second and last dish, the maximum like time coefficient would be:
(5*1 + -1*2 + 0*3) = 14.

Input: satisfaction = [4,3,2]
Output: 20
Explanation: After Removing no dishes the maximum like time coefficient would be:
(4*1 + 3*2 + 2*3) = 20.

Input: satisfaction = [-1,-4,-5]
Output: 0
Explanation: People don't like the dishes. No dishes need to be cooked.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the satisfaction values be negative? (Yes, they can be negative)
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the `satisfaction` array? (Usually a practical constraint is roughly \(10^3\))

## Strategy
1. **Sort the satisfaction array**: Sorting helps us to easily decide the optimal order of cooking dishes to maximize the `Like-time coefficient`.
2. **Iterate from the end**: Calculate the potential `Like-time coefficient` cumulatively from the end of the sorted array. This helps to decide which dishes to skip.
3. **Accumulate positive satisfied dishes**: Add the cumulative sum of positive contributions step-by-step.

## Code
```python
def maxSatisfaction(satisfaction):
    # Sort the satisfaction array
    satisfaction.sort()
    
    # Variables to track the current total coefficient and maximum coefficient found
    total = 0
    max_total = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Traverse from the end of the array to the beginning
    for i in range(len(satisfaction) - 1, -1, -1):
        current_sum += satisfaction[i]
        if current_sum > 0:
            total += current_sum
            max_total = max(max_total, total)
        
    return max_total

# Example usage
print(maxSatisfaction([-1,-8,0,5,-9])) # Output: 14
print(maxSatisfaction([4,3,2]))        # Output: 20
print(maxSatisfaction([-1,-4,-5]))     # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Traversing the array from end to beginning takes \(O(n)\).
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
