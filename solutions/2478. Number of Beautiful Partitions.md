title:  Number of Beautiful Partitions-out
permalink: /s2478
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits (0-9) and an integer `k`. A partition of `s` is called beautiful if:

1. Each part of the partition starts with a prime digit and has length at least `k`.
2. After partitioning, each part (sub-string) only contains prime digits.

A digit is called prime if it's one of the following: `2, 3, 5, 7`.

Return the total number of beautiful partitions of `s`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `1_000_000_007`.

# Clarifying Questions

1. Can partitions overlap? (Assuming no, as partitions imply non-overlapping sub-strings.)
2. Is `k` always less than or equal to the length of `s`? (Assuming yes, since a non-beautiful partition wouldn't be possible if `k > len(s)`.)
3. Is there any constraint on the string's length? (Assuming typical competitive programming constraints, up to 10^5 in length.)

# Strategy

1. **Iterate through possible partitions**: We will iterate through the string `s` and check for every possible partition point whether the partitions meet the criteria of being beautiful.
2. **Prime Checking**: Create a helper function to determine if a digit is prime.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to partition the string that meets the criteria. Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to partition the string up to index `i`.

# Code

```python
class Solution:
    def beautifulPartitions(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        MOD = 1_000_000_007
        
        def is_prime_digit(ch: str) -> bool:
            return ch in "2357"
        
        n = len(s)
        
        # Early exit if length of s is less than k or if the first digit is not prime
        if n < k or not is_prime_digit(s[0]):
            return 0
        
        # DP array to count partitions
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1  # Base case: one way to partition an empty string
        
        for i in range(k, n + 1):  # Start from k because each part should be at least length k
            if is_prime_digit(s[i - k]):  # Check if starting digit of partition is prime
                for j in range(i - 1, max(i - k + 1, 0) - 1, -1):
                    if dp[j] > 0 and (i == n or is_prime_digit(s[j])):  # Ensure sub-string only contains prime digits
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        return dp[-1]

# Example usage
sol = Solution()
print(sol.beautifulPartitions("2357", 2))  # Example testcase, expected output dependent on implementation details
```

# Time Complexity

- **Prime Check**: Each check if a digit is prime is O(1).
- **DP Array Update**: We iterate through the string using nested loops.
  - Outer loop runs `n - k + 1` times (as each segment must be at least `k` long).
  - Inner loop runs k times (constant time for each partition checking prime digits).

Thus overall time complexity is approximately `O(n * k)`, which is efficient for large inputs given typical constraints.

Make sure to test with multiple corner cases and verify correctness as handling edge cases would be crucial.
