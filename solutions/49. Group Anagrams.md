title:  Group Anagrams-out
permalink: /s49
---
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lower-case English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input list contain empty strings?**
   - Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement.
2. **Can the input list contain strings of varying lengths?**
   - Yes, each string can have a different length, but itâ€™s only up to 100 characters.
3. **Is the output order of the groups or within the groups important?**
   - No, the order is not important as long as the anagrams are grouped together.

## Strategy
1. **Use a Hash Map:**
   - We will create a dictionary where the keys are tuples of sorted characters of a string, and the values are lists of strings which are anagrams.
   - Sorting the string itself can be used to check if strings are anagrams because anagrams will result in identical sorted strings.
2. **Iterate Through Each String:**
   - Sort each string and use it as the key in the dictionary.
   - Append the original string to the list corresponding to the sorted tuple key.
3. **Compile the Result:**
   - Extract the lists from the dictionary and return them as the result.

### Example Walkthrough
Consider `strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`:

- After sorting the strings:
  - "eat" => "aet"
  - "tea" => "aet"
  - "tan" => "ant"
  - "ate" => "aet"
  - "nat" => "ant"
  - "bat" => "abt"

- Grouping them in the dictionary (key => value):
  - "aet" => ["eat", "tea", "ate"]
  - "ant" => ["tan", "nat"]
  - "abt" => ["bat"]

- Result: [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

## Code
```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    from collections import defaultdict
    anagrams = defaultdict(list)

    for s in strs:
        sorted_str = tuple(sorted(s))
        anagrams[sorted_str].append(s)

    return list(anagrams.values())

# Test cases
print(groupAnagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))  # [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
print(groupAnagrams([""]))  # [[""]]
print(groupAnagrams(["a"]))  # [["a"]]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting each string:** \(O(K \log K)\) where \(K\) is the maximum length of a string in `strs`
- **Overall:** If there are \(N\) strings each with maximum length \(K\), the total time complexity is \(O(N \times K \log K)\)
