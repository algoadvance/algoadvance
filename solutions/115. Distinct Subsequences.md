title:  Distinct Subsequences-out
permalink: /s115
---
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

For example:
- Input: `s = "rabbbit"`, `t = "rabbit"`
- Output: 3

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the lengths of `s` and `t`?**
   - Typically, such problems have constraints like `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`. It's good to know the upper bounds for efficient algorithm design.
  
2. **What should be returned when `t` is an empty string?**
   - If `t` is an empty string, there is exactly one subsequence of `s` that matches `t` (the empty subsequence).

3. **Should we be concerned with case sensitivity?**
   - Assuming the problem is case sensitive since no additional information is given.
   
4. **Type of characters in `s` and `t`?**
   - Assuming they are both strings composed of lower case English letters only.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We define a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of `s[0..i-1]` which equals `t[0..j-1]`.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][0] = 1`: An empty string `t` is a subsequence of an empty string `s`.
   - `dp[i][0] = 1`: An empty `t` is always a subsequence of any prefix of `s`.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.

3. **Final Answer**: The value in `dp[m][n]`, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`, gives the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`.

### Code
```python
def numDistinct(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    
    # Edge case: if target string `t` is empty
    if n == 0:
        return 1

    # Create a (m+1)x(n+1) DP array initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # An empty string `t` is a subsequence of any prefix of `s`
    for i in range(m + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`. This complexity arises from filling the 2D DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` for the DP table.

This approach ensures we examine all possible subsequences efficiently using dynamic programming.
