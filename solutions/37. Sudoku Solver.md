Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells. A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

1. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

The '.' character indicates empty cells.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Is the input always a 9x9 matrix?
   - Yes, the input is always a 9x9 matrix.
   
2. **Output Format**: Should the function modify the input matrix in place?
   - Yes, the function should modify the 9x9 matrix in place to provide the solution.
   
3. **Are there multiple solutions to a given Sudoku puzzle?**
   - For this problem, assume that the puzzle has a unique solution.

### Code

```python
def solveSudoku(board):
    def is_valid(board, row, col, num):
        num = str(num)
        box_row, box_col = row // 3 * 3, col // 3 * 3
        return not any(
            board[row][i] == num or
            board[i][col] == num or
            board[box_row + i // 3][box_col + i % 3] == num
            for i in range(9)
        )

    def solve(board):
        for row in range(9):
            for col in range(9):
                if board[row][col] == '.':
                    for num in range(1, 10):
                        if is_valid(board, row, col, num):
                            board[row][col] = str(num)
                            if solve(board):
                                return True
                            board[row][col] = '.'
                    return False
        return True
    
    solve(board)

# Example usage:
board = [
    ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
    ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
    [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
    ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
    ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
    ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
    [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
    [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
    [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]

solveSudoku(board)
for row in board:
    print(row)
```

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking**: This problem can be efficiently solved using backtracking. Backtracking involves trying out all possible values for a cell and backtracking if it doesn't lead to a valid solution.
2. **Validation**: Create a helper function `is_valid` to check if placing a number in a specific cell is valid according to Sudoku rules.
3. **Recursive Solve Function**:
   - Find the first empty cell (denoted by '.').
   - Try filling it with numbers 1 through 9.
   - For each number, check if it is valid using `is_valid`.
   - If valid, place the number and recursively try to solve the rest of the board.
   - If the board can be solved with that number, return `True`, else backtrack by setting the cell back to '.'.
4. **Termination**: The recursion terminates when no empty cell is found, indicating the board is completely and correctly filled.

### Time Complexity
- **Worst-Case Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(9^(n*m)), where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid (both 9 in this case). This is because in the worst case, for each empty cell, we attempt all 9 numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n*m) for the recursion stack in the worst case when backtracking deep into the grid.
