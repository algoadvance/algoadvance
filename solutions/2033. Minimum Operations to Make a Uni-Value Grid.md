title:  Minimum Operations to Make a Uni-Value Grid-out
permalink: /s2033
---

Given a 2D grid consisting of integers where every integer represents the number of elements in that cell, you are allowed to perform operations to manipulate the grid. In one operation, you can select any cell and increase or decrease the integer by any value.

You need to perform a series of operations to make the entire grid consist of only one distinct integer, with the constraint that you can only increase or decrease each integer by a fixed possible difference `x`.

Return the minimum number of operations to achieve this. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```python
grid = [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
x = 2
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:**
- We can normalize the grid to a single value by performing the following operations:
  - Difference of 2 to 4 is 2 -> total 1 operation.
  - Difference of 2 to 6 is 4 -> total 2 operations.
  - Difference of 2 to 8 is 6 -> total 3 operations.
  - Total operations = 3
  - Similarly we can proceed for other values and determine the minimum operations required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that all grid values are integers?
2. Is there any constraint on the size of the grid (maximum rows and columns)?
3. Can the grid have negative values?
4. Is the fixed difference `x` guaranteed to be greater than 0?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Flatten the Grid**: Convert the 2D grid into a 1D list for easier manipulations.
2. **Check Feasibility**: Determine if making all elements in the grid the same value is possible. For this, check if every grid value modulo `x` is the same. If not, return `-1`.
3. **Median Value**: Sort the flattened list and use the median value as the target value. The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.
4. **Calculate Operations**: Calculate the number of operations required to convert every element to the median value using the difference `x`.

## Code

Here's the Python code to achieve the solution:

```python
def minOperations(grid, x):
    # Flatten the grid
    flat_list = [element for row in grid for element in row]
    
    # Check if transformation is possible
    remainder = flat_list[0] % x
    for num in flat_list:
        if num % x != remainder:
            return -1
    
    # Sort the flattened list
    flat_list.sort()
    
    # Find the median value
    median = flat_list[len(flat_list) // 2]
    
    # Calculate the number of operations
    operations = 0
    for num in flat_list:
        operations += abs(num - median) // x
    
    return operations

# Example usage:
grid = [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
x = 2
print(minOperations(grid, x))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Flattening the grid**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
2. **Feasibility check**: O(m * n).
3. **Sorting**: O(m * n log(m * n)).
4. **Calculating operations**: O(m * n).

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(m * n log(m * n)).
