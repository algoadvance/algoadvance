title:  Count Beautiful Substrings I-out
permalink: /s2947

You are given a string `s` consisting of only the characters 'a' and 'b'. A substring is considered *beautiful* if it contains an equal number of 'a's and 'b's. You need to determine the count of all beautiful substrings in the given string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the substrings be contiguous?
   - Yes, substrings by definition are contiguous segments of the original string.
   
2. Can the input string be empty?
   - Yes, but in that case, there would be no beautiful substrings.

3. Are we considering substrings of length zero as beautiful?
   - No, only non-empty substrings can be considered.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a variable to keep track of the balance between the number of 'a's and 'b's in the substring. Initialize it to zero.
   - Use a hashmap to keep track of the counts of the balance.

2. **Traversal and Counting**:
   - Traverse through the string while updating the balance:
     - Increment the balance by 1 for 'a'.
     - Decrement the balance by 1 for 'b'.
   - Use the hashmap to count the occurrences of each balance. If the balance is seen before, it implies that the substring between these positions has an equal number of 'a's and 'b's (beautiful substring).

3. **Counting Beautiful Substrings**:
   - For each balance observed, the number of beautiful substrings ending at the current position can be directly inferred from the counts stored in the hashmap.

### Code

```python
def count_beautiful_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    balance = 0
    balance_count = {0: 1}  # Initialize with balance 0 count as 1
    beautiful_substring_count = 0
    
    for char in s:
        # Update balance
        if char == 'a':
            balance += 1
        elif char == 'b':
            balance -= 1
        
        # If the balance has been seen before, it means there are substrings from the previous
        # occurrence(s) of this balance to this position that have equal number of 'a's and 'b's
        if balance in balance_count:
            beautiful_substring_count += balance_count[balance]
            balance_count[balance] += 1
        else:
            balance_count[balance] = 1
    
    return beautiful_substring_count

# Example usage:
s = "aababb"
print(count_beautiful_substrings(s))  # Output example
```

### Time Complexity

This approach has a linear time complexity, i.e., O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, due to the single pass required to calculate the balance and update the hashmap. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the hashmap storing balance frequencies.
