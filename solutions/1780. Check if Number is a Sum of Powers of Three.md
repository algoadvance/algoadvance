title:  Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three-out
permalink: /s1780
---

You are given an integer `n`. You have to determine if `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three. More formally, you need to check if there exist such integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_k` where each `x_i` is distinct and is a power of three ( `x_i = 3^i`) such that:

\[ n = 3^{x_1} + 3^{x_2} + ... + 3^{x_k} \]

Return `true` if `n` can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input `n`?**
   - The input `n` can be any integer where `0 <= n <= 10^7`.

2. **Can `n` be zero?**
   - Yes, `n` can be zero. The sum of an empty set of powers of three is zero, so the function should return `true` for `n = 0`.

3. **Is `n` always non-negative?**
   - Yes, `n` is always a non-negative integer.

### Code

```python
def checkPowersOfThree(n: int) -> bool:
    while n > 0:
        if n % 3 == 2:
            return False
        n //= 3
    return True

# Test cases
print(checkPowersOfThree(12))  # True
print(checkPowersOfThree(91))  # True
print(checkPowersOfThree(21))  # False
```

### Strategy

The strategy relies on the property of ternary (base-3) representation of numbers:

1. Every number can be uniquely represented in a base-3 system, where each digit can only be `0`, `1`, or `2`.
2. To be expressible as a sum of distinct powers of three, the ternary representation of the number must not contain the digit `2`, since any occurrence of `2` would mean we need to use the same power of three twice (which violates the distinctness condition).

Given this insight:
1. While `n` is greater than zero, repeatedly check the least significant digit in the base-3 representation of `n`.
2. If any digit in the base-3 representation of `n` is `2`, return `False`.
3. If we can divide out all the digits without encountering `2`, return `True`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(log_3(n))` because in each iteration we divide `n` by `3`. This means the number of iterations needed is proportional to the number of digits in the base-3 representation of `n`, which is logarithmic to the base `3`.
