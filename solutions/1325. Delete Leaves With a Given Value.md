title:  Delete Leaves With a Given Value-out
permalink: /s1325
---

Given a binary tree root and an integer `target`, delete all the leaf nodes with the value `target`. Note that once you delete a leaf node with value `target`, if its parent becomes a leaf node and has the value `target`, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't delete anymore).

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in the tree are [2, 2, 4]. Removing the leaf nodes with value 2 forms the tree [1, null, 3, null, 4]. Then the 2 that was parent of one of the deleted leaves becomes a leaf with value 2 and is removed to give the final tree.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the tree or the values of the nodes?
   - **A**: No specific constraints are given, but the values are integers.

2. **Q**: Are all node values unique?
   - **A**: No, nodes can have duplicate values, and this is actually integral to the problem.

3. **Q**: Will the root itself ever be a leaf node with the target value?
   - **A**: Yes, the root can be a leaf node with the target value and should be removed if it meets the criteria.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree in a post-order manner (left, right, node). This way, we can ensure that we process and potentially remove the leaves before their parent nodes.

Here's the plan:

1. Define a recursive function `deleteLeaves` that will traverse the tree and perform the deletion operation.
2. This function should:
   - Recursively call itself on the left and right children.
   - Check if the current node is a leaf with the target value. If it is, return `None` to indicate it's removed.
   - Otherwise, return the node itself.
3. Call this recursive function starting from the root.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation for the described solution:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def removeLeafNodes(root: TreeNode, target: int) -> TreeNode:
    def deleteLeaves(node):
        if not node:
            return None
        
        # Recursively call the function on the left and right children
        node.left = deleteLeaves(node.left)
        node.right = deleteLeaves(node.right)
        
        # If the current node is a leaf and its value equals the target, remove it
        if not node.left and not node.right and node.val == target:
            return None
        
        return node
    
    return deleteLeaves(root)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This complexity arises because each node is visited once in the post-order traversal to check and possibly delete it.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is because of the recursive call stack, with H being the maximum depth of the recursion. In the worst case, this can be O(N) for a skewed tree. In the average case for a balanced tree, this could be O(log N).
