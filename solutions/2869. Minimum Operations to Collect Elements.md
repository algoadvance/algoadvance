title:  Minimum Operations to Collect Elements-out
permalink: /s2869
---

You are given an array `nums` consisting of distinct positive integers and an integer `maxValue`. You are also given another integer `threshold`. You need to perform several operations to collect elements-out. In each operation, you can choose **one** still remaining element from the array and remove it.

You perform the above operations until there are no elements left in the array, but you can only remove elements in the range `[threshold, maxValue]`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to remove all elements from the array.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range Inclusivity:** Are the `threshold` and `maxValue` inclusive in the range of values that can be removed?
    - **Assumption:** Yes. `[threshold, maxValue]` is inclusive.
  
2. **Distinct Integers:** Elements in `nums` are distinct positive integers. Is this always true?
    - **Assumption:** Yes, the problem states this explicitly.

3. **Range Validity:** Can `threshold` be greater than `maxValue` and how should it be handled?
    - **Assumption:** I will assume for now that `threshold` will not be greater than `maxValue`.

## Strategy
1. Traverse through the `nums` array and count how many elements fall within the inclusive range `[threshold, maxValue]`.
2. The result will be the count of those elements, because all such elements will need to be removed by operations.

## Code
```python
def min_operations(nums, maxValue, threshold):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if threshold <= num <= maxValue:
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 7, 9, 2]
maxValue = 9
threshold = 4
print(min_operations(nums, maxValue, threshold)) # Output: 2
```

## Walkthrough Example
For the input:
- `nums = [1, 3, 7, 9, 2]`
- `maxValue = 9`
- `threshold = 4`

The numbers within the range `[4, 9]` are `7` and `9`, resulting in `2` operations.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` list.
    - We traverse the list once to count the qualifying elements.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
