There are buckets of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, you can feed the liquid to some pigs, and the pigs will die in precisely `minutesToDie` minutes if they consume the poisonous liquid. With pigs and a testing time limit of `minutesToTest` minutes, you need to determine the minimum number of pigs needed to identify the poisonous bucket within the given time frame.

Given four integers:
- `buckets` representing the number of buckets,
- `minutesToDie` indicating the time it takes for a pig to die after consuming the poisonous liquid,
- `minutesToTest` indicating the total time you have for testing,

Return the minimum number of pigs needed to figure out which bucket contains the poisonous liquid within the allotted time.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to consider cases where `minutesToDie` is greater than `minutesToTest`?
   - No, it's safe to assume `minutesToDie` will be less than or equal to `minutesToTest`.

2. Can the pigs be reused in subsequent tests?
   - No, if a pig dies, it cannot be reused.

3. Is there always exactly one poisonous bucket?
   - Yes.

4. Can we assume that all input values are positive integers?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Core Concept:**
   - Each pig can be used to test multiple buckets by dividing the total `minutesToTest` by `minutesToDie`. This helps calculate how many states (tests) each pig can go through.

2. **Simplified Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many sequential tests we can conduct within the `minutesToTest` limit.
   - The number of states each pig can go through is equal to `1 + (minutesToTest // minutesToDie)`. This is because the pig either dies or doesn't in each interval.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - We can represent the problem in a simplified way using logarithms and combinatorial calculations.
   - If each pig can have `states` outcomes, and we have `n` pigs, the total number of distinct scenarios we can test is `states^n`.

4. **Objective:**
   - Find the smallest `n` (number of pigs) such that `states^n >= buckets`.

## Code

```python
import math

def poorPigs(buckets: int, minutesToDie: int, minutesToTest: int) -> int:
    states = minutesToTest // minutesToDie + 1
    pigs = math.ceil(math.log(buckets) / math.log(states))
    return pigs

# Example usage:
print(poorPigs(1000, 15, 60))  # Output: 5
```

## Explanation

1. **States Calculation:**
   - The number of states a pig can be in is determined by `states = 1 + (minutesToTest // minutesToDie)`.
   - For example, if `minutesToTest` is 60 and `minutesToDie` is 15, one pig can have 5 states (1 initial state + 4 subsequent states by dividing 60 by 15).

2. **Logarithmic Calculation:**
   - To determine the number of pigs required, calculate the number of pigs needed such that `states^pigs >= buckets`.
   - This can be derived by rearranging the formula to `pigs = ceil(log(buckets) / log(states))`.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** due to basic arithmetic operations.
- Space complexity is also **O(1)**.
