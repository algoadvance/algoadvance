title:  Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence-out
permalink: /s1713
---

Given an array `target` and another array `arr`, you need to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`. In one operation, you can insert any element in `arr` at any position. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`.

#### Example:
- **Input**: `target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]`
- **Output**: `2`

- **Input**: `target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]`
- **Output**: `3`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How should the function handle duplicates in `target` or `arr`?**
   - We will treat duplicates as they occur naturally in both arrays.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `target` and `arr`?**
   - Length of `target` will be between 1 and 10^5.
   - Length of `arr` will be between 1 and 10^5.
   
3. **What are the constraints on the values within `target` and `arr`?**
   - Values in both `target` and `arr` arrays are between 1 and 10^9.

### Strategy

1. **Map Values to Indices:**
   - Create a mapping of `target` values to their respective indices.

2. **Transform `arr` to Indices:**
   - Transform `arr` to a sequence of indices based on the `target`'s index mapping. Ignore values in `arr` that are not in `target`.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):**
   - Find the Length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) in the transformed array. This LIS represents the largest part of `target` that is already a subsequence in `arr`.

4. **Compute Operations:**
   - The minimum number of operations required is equal to the length of `target` minus the length of this LIS.

### Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def minOperations(target, arr):
    pos = {val: idx for idx, val in enumerate(target)}
    lis = []
    
    for value in arr:
        if value in pos:
            idx = pos[value]
            pos_in_lis = bisect_left(lis, idx)
            
            if pos_in_lis == len(lis):
                lis.append(idx)
            else:
                lis[pos_in_lis] = idx
                
    return len(target) - len(lis)

# Example usage:
print(minOperations([5, 1, 3], [9, 4, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 2
print(minOperations([6, 4, 8, 1, 3, 2], [4, 7, 6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 1]))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Mapping Creation**: O(n) where `n` is the length of `target`.
- **Transformation and LIS**: Each insertion and lookup operation can be done in logarithmic time. Thus, transforming `arr` and finding the LIS is O(m log k), where `m` is the length of `arr` and `k` is the length of the LIS.

Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n + m log k), which is efficient given the constraints.
