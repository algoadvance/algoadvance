title:  Maximize Grid Happiness-out
permalink: /s1659
---

The problem is to maximize the grid happiness of two types of tenants living in a grid of size `m x n`. There are `introvertsCount` number of introverts and `extrovertsCount` number of extroverts. The grid is initially empty.

The happiness change caused by the placement of an introvert or extrovert is defined by these rules:

- An introvert starts with happiness of 120.
- An extrovert starts with happiness of 40.
- An introvert reduces its happiness by 30 for each adjacent introvert and by 10 for each adjacent extrovert.
- An extrovert increases its happiness by 20 for each adjacent extrovert and by 10 for each adjacent introvert.

The happiness of the grid is the sum of happiness of all the introverts and extroverts placed in the grid.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can two types of tenants (introvert and extrovert) be placed on the same cell?
   - No, each cell can only be occupied by one tenant or be left empty.

2. How are the neighbors defined in the grid?
   - Neighbors are the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

3. Is it always possible to place all tenants in the grid?
   - No, we may run out of space before all tenants are placed.

## Strategy
1. **Define Configuration States**: Use state representation to keep track of the tenants placed in the grid and the happiness values.
2. **Backtracking with Memoization**: Use backtracking to explore all possible placements of tenants combined with memoization to store and reuse results of subproblems.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases where `m*n` < `introvertsCount + extrovertsCount`.

## Code

```python
from functools import lru_cache

class Solution:
    def getMaxGridHappiness(self, m, n, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount):
        
        # Memoize the states
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(pos, introverts_left, extroverts_left, state):
            if pos == m * n or (introverts_left == 0 and extroverts_left == 0):
                return 0

            x, y = divmod(pos, n)  # row and column from position
            result = dp(pos + 1, introverts_left, extroverts_left, state)  # Move to the next cell without placing any tenant

            # Pointers to prev. cells (left and top)
            left = state % 3
            up = state // (3 ** (n-1))

            # Place an introvert
            if introverts_left > 0:
                impact = 120  # Base happiness for introvert
                if y > 0 and left == 1: impact -= 30
                if y > 0 and left == 2: impact -= 10
                if x > 0 and up == 1: impact -= 30
                if x > 0 and up == 2: impact -= 10
                
                next_state = (state * 3 + 1) % (3 ** n)
                result = max(result, impact + dp(pos + 1, introverts_left - 1, extroverts_left, next_state))

            # Place an extrovert
            if extroverts_left > 0:
                impact = 40   # Base happiness for extrovert
                if y > 0 and left == 1: impact += 10
                if y > 0 and left == 2: impact += 20
                if x > 0 and up == 1: impact += 10
                if x > 0 and up == 2: impact += 20
                
                next_state = (state * 3 + 2) % (3 ** n)
                result = max(result, impact + dp(pos + 1, introverts_left, extroverts_left - 1, next_state))

            return result

        return dp(0, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount, 0)

# Example usage:
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.getMaxGridHappiness(2, 3, 1, 2))  # Example call
```

## Time Complexity

The complexity of this solution is exponential due to the state space represented by the positions in the grid and the remaining tenants (`O(3^(m*n) * introvertsCount * extrovertsCount)`). However, memoization reduces redundant computations.

This solution exhaustively explores all possible configurations while leveraging memoization to optimize for overlapping subproblems.
