title:  Smallest Rotation with Highest Score-out
permalink: /s798
---

You are given an array `A` of integers. A rotation of the array means moving all elements of `A` to the right by one position. For example, if `A = [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]`, then `A` after one rotation will be `[0, 2, 3, 1, 4]`. 

A rotation index `k` is the number of times the array is rotated.
  
The score of a rotation is the sum of `A[i] == i (mod length of A)` for `i = 0 to length of A - 1`. In other words, the score of a rotation is the number of times `A[i]` equals `i (mod length of A)`.

Your task is to find the rotation index that gives the highest score. If there are multiple rotation indices with the same score, return the smallest index.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a specific range for the values in the array `A`?**
   - No, the elements can be any integer.

2. **What is the length constraint on array `A`?**
   - The length of the array `A` will be between 1 and 20000.

3. **Can there be negative values in the array?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy

To find the smallest rotation index `k` that maximizes the score, we can use the following observations:

- **Observation 1**: For an element `A[i]`, it will contribute to the score of a rotation `k` if `(i + k) % n == A[i]`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Observation 2**: Instead of checking each rotation, we can track how the score changes when we increment the rotation by 1.

We shall implement the following steps:

1. Calculate the contribution of each position to the score initially (i.e., no rotation).
2. Use a transformation approach to track changes in the score as the rotation index increases.
3. Find the rotation index which results in maximum score.

## Code

```python
def bestRotation(A):
    n = len(A)
    change = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        # If A[i] <= i: it contributes to score if there is 0 rotation
        if A[i] <= i:
            change[0] += 1
        
        change[(i - A[i] + 1) % n] -= 1
        change[(i - A[i] + 1 + n) % n] += 1

    # Calculate max score rotation by applying the change array
    max_score = -1
    current_score = 0
    best_index = 0
    
    for k in range(n):
        current_score += change[k]
        if current_score > max_score:
            max_score = current_score
            best_index = k
    
    return best_index

# Example usage
print(bestRotation([2, 3, 1, 4, 0]))  # Output should be 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initializing the `change` array**: `O(n)`
- **Calculating the contribution for each element and updating the change array**: `O(n)`
- **Calculating the `best_index` by iterating the `change` array**: `O(n)`

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, making this an efficient solution.
