title:  Minimum Number of Refueling Stops-out
permalink: /s871
---

You are given **target** miles. Initially, there is a car with an infinite gas tank capacity and fuel which allows the car to travel **startFuel** miles. There are `stations` positioned along the route, where `stations[i]` is a tuple (position_i, fuel_i), indicating that there's a gas station at position_i miles with fuel_i liters of gas.

Return the minimum number of refueling stops needed to reach the target. If it is impossible to reach the target, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []
Output: 0
Explanation: We can reach the target without any refueling.
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]
Output: -1
Explanation: We canâ€™t reach the target (or the first gas station).
```

**Example 3:**

```plaintext
Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
We start with 10 miles of fuel.
We drive 10 miles and reach the first station (10,60).
We refuel from this station to have 60 miles of fuel.
Then, we drive from 10 + 60 = 70 miles.
We drive 10 miles and reach the second station (20,30).
We refuel from this station to have 30 miles of fuel.
We drive 30 miles and reach the third station (30,30).
We refuel from this station to have 30 miles of fuel.
We drive 30 miles and reach the fourth station (60,40).
We refuel from this station to have 40 miles of fuel.
Finally, we reach the target of 100 miles.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. When there are multiple gas stations that we can potentially stop at, do we have to decide the optimal one, or can we use any arbitrary one?
2. What is the maximum possible length for the input list of `stations`?
3. Should we account for stations that might be positioned beyond the target point?

## Strategy
The strategy to solve this problem involves leveraging a max-heap to always refuel at the station providing the highest amount of fuel, thereby maximizing our chances of reaching the target with minimal stops.

1. Initialize a max-heap (implemented as a min-heap storing negative values, since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap) to keep track of the maximum fuel amounts available at the available stations we've passed.
2. Iterate through the list of gas stations alongside our current range of reachable distance.
3. Whenever a gas station is within the current reachable distance, add its fuel amount to the heap.
4. If at any point our current fuel isn't enough to get to the next station or the target, pop the station with the maximum fuel from the heap and refuel there. Increment the refuel counter and update the current fuel.
5. If after processing all stations, our remaining fuel allows us to reach the target, return the refuel count; otherwise, return -1.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def minRefuelStops(target: int, startFuel: int, stations: list) -> int:
    # Max heap to store fuel amounts at each station we've passed by
    max_heap = []
    # We need to track the number of stops
    stops = 0
    # Current position of the car
    current_position = 0

    # Append the target as the last station with 0 fuel to handle final leg of the journey
    stations.append((target, 0))
    
    # Current fuel we have
    current_fuel = startFuel

    for position, fuel in stations:
        # Drive to the current station
        current_fuel -= (position - current_position)
        current_position = position
        
        # If our current fuel is less than 0, we need to refuel from the previously passed stations
        while current_fuel < 0 and max_heap:
            # Pop the station that provides the most fuel
            current_fuel += -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            stops += 1
        
        # If current fuel is still less than 0 after using all possible refuels, return -1
        if current_fuel < 0:
            return -1
        
        # Add current station's fuel to the heap (as negative value)
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -fuel)
    
    return stops
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(N log N)` where `N` is the number of gas stations. Each push and pop operation in the max-heap takes `O(log N)` time, and since we're doing this for each of the N stations, the overall complexity sums to `O(N log N)`.
