title:  Longest String Chain-out
permalink: /s1048
---

Given a list of words, find the longest string chain with the following properties:
1. A word `w1` is a predecessor of another word `w2` if and only if we can insert exactly one letter into `w1` to get `w2`.
2. A word chain is a sequence of words `[w_1, w_2, ..., w_k]` with `k >= 1`, where `w_i` is a predecessor of `w_{i+1}` for every `1 <= i < k`.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input list of words?
   - What is the maximum length of each word?

2. **Output**:
   - Should we only return the length of the longest chain or also the actual chain?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if the input list is empty?
   - Are all words unique?

Assuming from the problem description:
- The maximum length of words list is `1000`.
- The maximum length of any word is `16`.
- We only need to return the length of the longest chain.
- If the list is empty, the result should be `0`.
- All words are unique.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the words by length. This ensures that when attempting to form chains, we are always considering potential predecessors before successors.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a dictionary `dp` where `dp[word]` represents the length of the longest chain ending with `word`.
   - For each word in the sorted list, try to form predecessors by removing one character at a time and check if this new word exists in `dp`. If it does, potentially update the chain length for the current word.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The overall result will be the maximum value in the `dp` dictionary.

### Code

```python
def longestStrChain(words):
    words.sort(key=len)
    dp = {}
    longest_chain = 1

    for word in words:
        dp[word] = 1
        for i in range(len(word)):
            pred = word[:i] + word[i+1:]
            if pred in dp:
                dp[word] = max(dp[word], dp[pred] + 1)
        longest_chain = max(longest_chain, dp[word])
    
    return longest_chain

# Example usage
words = ["a", "b", "ba", "bca", "bda", "bdca"]
print(longestStrChain(words))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The list of words is sorted by length, which takes \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of words.
- **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each word, we look at all possible predecessors (removing one character), which takes \(O(L^2)\) per word, where \(L\) is the maximum length of a word. Checking and updating in `dp` dictionary takes \(O(1)\) for each operation.

Overall complexity:
\[ O(N \log N + NL^2) \]
Considering \(N \leq 1000\) and \(L \leq 16\), this is efficient for practical purposes.
