title:  Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps-out
permalink: /s1269
---

You have a pointer at index `0` in an array of size `arrLen`. At each step, you can move:
- Right by 1 step
- Left by 1 step
- Stay in the same place (do nothing)

You must perform exactly `steps` steps. After performing all the steps, the pointer should be at index `0` in the array.

Given the two integers `steps` and `arrLen`, return the number of ways in which you can stay at index `0` after performing exactly `steps` steps. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `steps` ever be greater than `arrLen`?**
   - Yes, `steps` can be greater than `arrLen`.
2. **What range of values can `steps` and `arrLen` have?**
   - Both `steps` and `arrLen` are positive integers, and their values can go up to `500`.
3. **Should we return the result as an integer?**
   - Yes, return the result as an integer.

### Strategy
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's denote `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to be at index `j` after `i` steps.

#### Steps
1. Initialize a DP table `dp` with dimensions `(steps + 1) x (min(steps // 2, arrLen) + 1)`.
2. Set the initial condition where `dp[0][0] = 1`, meaning that there is exactly one way to be at index `0` with `0` steps.
3. Iterate over the steps from `1` to `steps`, and for each step, iterate over the positions from `0` to `min(steps // 2, arrLen)`.
4. Update the DP table using the transition:
   - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]` if staying in the same position.
   - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]` if moving right.
   - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j+1]` if moving left.
5. Ensure to take the modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to avoid overflow.
6. The result will be in `dp[steps][0]`.

### Code
```python
def numWays(steps: int, arrLen: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    max_pos = min(steps // 2, arrLen - 1)
    dp = [[0] * (max_pos + 1) for _ in range(steps + 1)]
    
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, steps + 1):
        for j in range(min(i, max_pos) + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]  # Stay at the same position
            if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD  # Move right
            if j < max_pos:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j+1]) % MOD  # Move left
                
    return dp[steps][0]

# Example usage:
print(numWays(3, 2))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\text{steps} \cdot \text{min(steps, arrLen)})\) since we are iterating over `steps` and for each step, we are iterating over the positions up to `min(steps // 2, arrLen)`. Given the constraints, this solution should perform efficiently.

The space complexity is also \(O(\text{steps} \cdot \text{min(steps, arrLen)})\) due to the DP table.

This solution ensures that we efficiently count the number of ways to stay at index `0` after the given number of steps.
