title:  Last Day Where You Can Still Cross-out
permalink: /s1970
---

You are given m x n binary grid `isWater` where:

- `isWater[i][j] == 1` indicates that cell (i, j) is water.
- `isWater[i][j] == 0` indicates that cell (i, j) is land.

A day is represented by an index starting from 0. The task is to find the last day you can still cross from the top row to the bottom row by only walking on land cells. You can move four possible directions: left, right, up, or down.

Returns the last day you can still cross.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can you move diagonally?**
   - No, you can only move in four possible directions (left, right, up, or down).

2. **Can cells that turned into water be crossed?**
   - No, once a cell turns into water it can no longer be crossed.

3. **Are the border cells always land initially?**
   - This depends on the input grid. The configuration can vary per test case.

### Code

```python
def canCross(grid, day):
    # Use BFS to check if there exists a path from the top row to the bottom row
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    # Starting points: all land cells in the first row
    queue = [(0, j) for j in range(n) if grid[0][j] == 0]
    visited = set(queue)
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.pop(0)
        
        # If we reach the last row, path is valid
        if x == m - 1:
            return True
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    
    return False

def latestDayToCross(row: int, col: int, cells: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Initialize the grid with all water
    grid = [[0] * col for _ in range(row)]
    
    left, right = 0, len(cells) - 1
    last_day = 0
    
    # Apply binary search over the days
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        # Reset the grid
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                grid[i][j] = 0
        
        # Make the grid state as of `mid`th day
        for i in range(mid + 1):
            x, y = cells[i]
            grid[x - 1][y - 1] = 1
        
        if canCross(grid, mid):
            last_day = mid + 1  # 1-based index
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return last_day
```

### Strategy

1. **Grid Initialization**: The grid is initially considered with all cells as land (value `0`).
2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the last possible day, we use binary search.
    - **Set Grid State**: For a given day `mid`, the grid is updated to reflect the water cells up to that day.
3. **BFS Path Check**: 
    - Perform a BFS to see if there's a path from any cell in the top row to any cell in the bottom row.
    - If a valid path exists for the current day, move to the later half of the days.
    - If no path exists, move to the earlier half.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: `O(log D)`, where `D` is the number of days (`len(cells)`).
- **Grid Reset and BFS Check**: Each BFS operation takes `O(R * C)` where `R` is the number of rows and `C` is the number of columns.
- **Overall**: The total time complexity is `O((R * C) * log D)`, where `R` is the number of rows, `C` is the number of columns, and `D` is the number of days.

This complexity should be manageable for typical input sizes in competitive programming.
