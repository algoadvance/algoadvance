title:  Apply Discount to Prices-out
permalink: /s2288
---
You are given a string `sentence` containing several words and possibly some prices, formatted as in the following example: 
- "$30" (a price of thirty dollars)
- "$15.60" (a price of fifteen dollars and sixty cents)

You are also given a discount percentage `discount`. Your task is to apply this discount to every price in the `sentence` and format the results with two decimal places. Words in the sentence are separated by exactly one space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the maximum lengths for `sentence` and the value of `discount`?
2. **Price Constraints**: Are all prices properly prefixed with a `$` sign? Are we guaranteed no malformed prices?
3. **Percentage Constraints**: Will `discount` always be a valid percentage value (0-100)?
4. **Format**: Is it guaranteed that the input prices have at most two decimal places?

### Code
Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def apply_discount(sentence: str, discount: int) -> str:
    words = sentence.split()
    discounted_words = []
    
    for word in words:
        if word.startswith("$") and word[1:].replace('.', '', 1).isdigit():
            price = float(word[1:])
            discounted_price = price * (1 - discount / 100)
            discounted_word = f"${discounted_price:.2f}"
            discounted_words.append(discounted_word)
        else:
            discounted_words.append(word)
    
    return " ".join(discounted_words)

# Example usage:
sentence = "there are $1 $2 and 5$ candies in the shop"
discount = 50
print(apply_discount(sentence, discount))  # Output: "there are $0.50 $1.00 and 5$ candies in the shop"
```

### Strategy
1. **Split Sentence into Words**: Split the given sentence by spaces to process each word individually.
2. **Process Each Word**:
   - If a word starts with a `$` and is a valid price, calculate the discounted price.
   - Convert the price from string to float, apply the discount percentage and then format the result back to a string with two decimal places.
   - If a word does not represent a price, keep it unchanged.
3. **Join Words Back Together**: After all words have been processed, join them back into a single string with spaces to form the final sentence.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the sentence. This is because:
- Splitting the sentence by spaces takes \(O(n)\).
- Processing each word takes constant time on average.
- Joining the words back into a single string also takes \(O(n)\).

Overall, the solution is efficient and operates within linear time with respect to the length of the input sentence.
