title:  Binary Tree Postorder Traversal-out
permalink: /s145
---

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

In postorder traversal, the nodes are recursively visited as follows:
1. Visit the left subtree.
2. Visit the right subtree.
3. Visit the root node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the tree is empty?**
   - Return an empty list.

2. **Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the tree may contain duplicate values.

3. **What data structure is used for the binary tree?**
   - The binary tree nodes use classes, typically defined as:

      ```python
      class TreeNode:
          def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
              self.val = val
              self.left = left
              self.right = right
      ```

4. **Is there any constraint on the height of the tree?**
   - There are no explicit constraints mentioned on the height of the tree.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using two main approaches:

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Recursively visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

2. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Use a stack to simulate the call stack of the recursion. Keep track of the nodes and the state of their traversal.

### Code

Here are both approaches in Python:

#### Recursive Approach

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def postorderTraversal(root: TreeNode):
    def helper(node, result):
        if node:
            helper(node.left, result)
            helper(node.right, result)
            result.append(node.val)
    
    result = []
    helper(root, result)
    return result
```

#### Iterative Approach

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def postorderTraversal(root: TreeNode):
    if not root:
        return []

    stack, output = [root], []

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        output.append(node.val)
        if node.left:
            stack.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            stack.append(node.right)

    return output[::-1]
```

### Time Complexity

Both approaches have the same time complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Every node is visited exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - **Recursive Approach**: \(O(h)\) where \(h\) is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.
  - **Iterative Approach**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes, mainly due to the stack used for traversal.

Choose an approach based on the preference for recursion or iteration and constraints such as recursion depth.
