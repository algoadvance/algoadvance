title:  Get Maximum in Generated Array-out
permalink: /s1646
---

You are given an integer `n`. A 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n + 1` is generated in the following way:

- `nums[0] = 0`
- `nums[1] = 1`
- For each `i` such that `2 <= i <= n`:
    - If `i` is even, `nums[i] = nums[i / 2]`
    - If `i` is odd, `nums[i] = nums[i / 2] + nums[i / 2 + 1]`

Return the **maximum** integer in the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if `n` is 0?**
   - Return 0 as `nums[0]` is the only element in the array.

2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - According to the problem statement constraints, `n` is in the range [0, 100].

3. **Are there any constraints on the runtime of the solution?**
   - Since `n` is relatively small (up to 100), an O(n) solution is acceptable.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Create an array `nums` of size `n + 1` and initialize the first two elements `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` as given.
2. **Array Generation**: Iterate from 2 to `n`, and populate elements of `nums` based on whether the current index `i` is even or odd.
3. **Maximum Value**: Track the maximum value encountered while generating the array.
4. **Return Result**: Return the tracked maximum value.

### Code

```python
def getMaximumGenerated(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    nums = [0] * (n + 1)
    nums[0], nums[1] = 0, 1
    max_val = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            nums[i] = nums[i // 2]
        else:
            nums[i] = nums[i // 2] + nums[(i // 2) + 1]
        
        max_val = max(max_val, nums[i])
    
    return max_val
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: This takes O(1) time and space.
2. **Array Generation**: The loop runs `n` times, and each iteration takes O(1) time, so the total complexity for this part is O(n).
3. **Tracking Maximum**: Updating the maximum value during the loop also takes O(1) time per iteration, leading to O(n) cumulatively.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, and the space complexity is **O(n)** due to the array `nums`.
