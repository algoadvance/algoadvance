title:  Robot Collisions-out

You are given an array of integers `positions` where each integer represents the position of a robot on a number line. You are also given a string `directions`, where each character can be either 'L' (moving left) or 'R' (moving right). Each robot moves at the same constant speed, 1 unit per second.

When two robots collide, they both stop moving permanently. Write a function to compute the positions of all robots after all movements have stopped.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input:
positions = [0, 1, 2, 4]
directions = 'RLRL'

Output:
[0, 1, 2, 4]
```

In this example, robots at positions 1 and 2 collide and stop moving, while the other two robots continue moving until they either collide with another robot or move off the number line.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the `positions` always non-negative integers?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of `positions` and `directions`?
3. Can two robots start at the same position?
4. Is it safe to assume that the characters in `directions` are only 'L' or 'R'?
5. What happens if a robot moves off the number line?

### Strategy

To simulate the robot movements and collisions:
1. **Sorting**: Since the positions are given, we need to sort them to process collisions correctly.
2. **Stack or Queue**: Use a stack to keep track of active robots that are moving to the right and check for collisions with robots moving to the left.
3. **Simulate Movements**: Traverse through the list of robots and simulate their movements, using the stack to manage collisions.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def robot_collisions(positions, directions):
    n = len(positions)
    robots = sorted(zip(positions, directions))
    stack = []
    result = []

    for pos, dir in robots:
        if dir == 'R':
            stack.append((pos, dir))
        else:
            while stack and stack[-1][1] == 'R':
                collision_pos = stack.pop()[0]
                if pos - collision_pos > 1:
                    result.append(collision_pos)
                    result.append(pos)
                    continue
                break
    
    return sorted([pos for pos, dir in stack] + result)

# Example Usage:
positions = [0, 1, 2, 4]
directions = 'RLRL'
print(robot_collisions(positions, directions))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 4]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
- **Simulating Movements**: Each robot is processed once, making the stack operations \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), mainly due to the sorting step.

### Discussion

- The solution assumes robots stop moving after a collision.
- Ensures all directions are processed and handles initial sorting to simplify the collision checks.
- The algorithm efficiently handles robot collision using a stack approach, making it optimal for large input sizes.
