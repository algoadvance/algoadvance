The "2564. Substring XOR Queries" problem from LeetCode involves processing multiple queries on a given string to determine the substring that has a XOR value equal to a given query value. 

Given a binary string `s`, we need to perform multiple queries. Each query has a form `[left, right, x]`, where:
- `left` and `right` are the starting and ending indices of the substring to consider from the string `s`.
- `x` is the integer value that we need to match with the XOR of the substring.

We need to return a list of boolean values indicating for each query whether there exists a substring in the given range with a XOR equal to `x`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - This helps in understanding the upper bounds for any optimizations needed.

2. **What are the constraints on `left`, `right`, and `x`?**
   - Are these values within valid and reasonable ranges?

3. **Is the query count significant compared to the length of the string `s`?**
   - This helps in deciding whether precomputation would be beneficial.

4. **Is the binary string `s` guaranteed to contain only '0' and '1'?**
   - This ensures that the input adheres to a binary format.

### Strategy

Here is a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. **Precomputation:**
   - Compute the XOR for all substrings to facilitate quick lookup during queries.
   - Use dynamic programming or prefix XOR arrays to achieve efficient computation.

2. **Prefix XOR:**
   - Build a prefix XOR array where `prefix_xor[i]` represents the XOR of all elements from the start up to the i-th position.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, use the prefix XOR array to compute the XOR of any substring in constant time.
   - Check if the XOR value matches `x` by analyzing known data structures.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def substringXorQueries(s, queries):
    n = len(s)
    
    # Convert string `s` into corresponding integer array
    nums = [int(char) for char in s]
    
    # Precompute prefix XOR array
    prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_xor[i + 1] = prefix_xor[i] ^ nums[i]
    
    results = []
    
    for left, right, x in queries:
        xor_val = prefix_xor[right + 1] ^ prefix_xor[left]
        results.append(xor_val == x)
    
    return results

# Example usage
s = "11010"
queries = [[0, 1, 3], [2, 4, 5], [0, 4, 1]]
output = substringXorQueries(s, queries)
print(output)  # Expected: [True, False, True]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation:** 
  - `O(n)` for building the `prefix_xor` array where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

- **Query Processing:**
  - Each query is processed in `O(1)` due to the direct computation using the `prefix_xor` array.
  - If `m` is the number of queries, the total query processing time is `O(m)`.

- **Overall Time Complexity:** 
  - The overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the number of queries.

This solution ensures efficient computation and quick response to each query by leveraging prefix XOR.
