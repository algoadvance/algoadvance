title:  Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph-out
permalink: /s1761
---

You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer `n` which represents the number of nodes and a 2D array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` represents an undirected edge between node `u_i` and node `v_i`.

A connected trio is a set of three nodes where every pair of the three nodes is connected by an edge. The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges incident to one of the three nodes in the trio.

Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph or `-1` if the graph has no connected trio.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Representation**: Are the node indices zero-based or one-based?
   - Answer: The node indices are one-based.

2. **Edge Cases**: How do we handle cases with less than 3 nodes?
   - Answer: If the number of nodes is less than 3, then no trio can exist, so the result should be `-1`.

3. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the input size?
   - Answer: 
     - `2 <= n <= 400`
     - `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
     - `edges[i].length == 2`
     - `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
     - `1 <= u_i < v_i <= n`
     - There are no repeated edges.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list representation for the graph.
2. **Finding Trios**: For each edge `(u, v)`, check for a common neighbor `w` such that the trio `(u, v, w)` forms a connected trio.
3. **Degree Calculation**: Once a trio is found, calculate the degree of the trio by summing the degree of each node in the trio and subtracting 6 (since each edge in the trio is counted twice in the node degrees).
4. **Result**: Track the minimum degree across all trios found and return the minimum degree.

## Code

```python
def minTrioDegree(n, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Build the graph as adjacency list and degree dictionary
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    degree = defaultdict(int)

    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
        degree[u] += 1
        degree[v] += 1

    min_degree = float('inf')

    # Step 2: Find connected trios and their degree
    for u in range(1, n+1):
        for v in graph[u]:
            for w in graph[u]:
                if v >= w:
                    continue
                if w in graph[v]:
                    # u, v, w is a connected trio
                    trio_degree = degree[u] + degree[v] + degree[w] - 6
                    min_degree = min(min_degree, trio_degree)

    return -1 if min_degree == float('inf') else min_degree

# Example to test
n = 6
edges = [[1,2], [1,3], [3,2], [4,1], [5,2], [3,6]]
print(minTrioDegree(n, edges))  # Expected Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **Finding Trios**: We iterate through each node and its neighbors. For each pair of neighbors, we check if they are connected.
  
  This involves checking all neighbors for every edge, which in the worst case could be O(N^3) since each pair of connections between nodes in the complete graph with N nodes needs to be checked.

- **Overall**: O(N^3) in the worst case, where N is the number of nodes. Given the constraints (N â‰¤ 400), this is feasible.
