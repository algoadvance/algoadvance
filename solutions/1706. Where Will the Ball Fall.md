title:  Where Will the Ball Fall-out
permalink: /s1706

You have a 2D grid of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

- Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.
- A board that redirects the ball to the right spans from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented by `1`.
- A board that redirects the ball to the left spans from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented by `-1`.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the grid. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the `i-th` column at the top, or `-1` if the ball gets stuck in the box.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the grid have any other values outside of `1` or `-1`?
    - No, the grid will only contain `1` and `-1`.

2. What should be the behavior if a ball tries to move outside the grid bounds?
    - The ball will get stuck, and the result for that column will be `-1`.

3. Should the solution consider only valid inputs within the given constraints?
    - Yes, the inputs will be valid and within the constraints mentioned.

### Strategy

We'll simulate the flow of each ball through the grid. For each column `col`, we'll start from the top row and attempt to navigate through the grid based on the board directions. At each step:

- If the direction is `1`, we check if the ball can move right (i.e., it's not at the edge and the next cell is also `1`).
- If the direction is `-1`, we check if the ball can move left (i.e., it's not at the edge and the next cell is also `-1`).

If a ball gets stuck due to moving out of bounds or hitting a `V` shaped pattern, we'll return `-1` for that column. If the ball reaches the bottom successfully, we'll return the column index it falls into.

### Code

```python
def findBall(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    answer = [-1] * n  # Default all positions to stuck `-1`

    for col in range(n):
        c = col  # Start from this column at the top
        for row in range(m):
            next_col = c + grid[row][c]
            # Check if the ball is out of bounds or stuck in a 'V'
            if next_col < 0 or next_col >= n or grid[row][c] != grid[row][next_col]:
                c = -1
                break
            c = next_col
        answer[col] = c
    
    return answer

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1,  1,  1, -1, -1],
    [1,  1,  1, -1, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, 1,  1],
    [1,  1,  1, 1,  -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
]

print(findBall(grid))  # Output: [1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
  - Weâ€™re essentially iterating through each column and then processing each row in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We are using a result list `answer` of size `n`. Other than the input and the result list, no additional space is used that scales with the size of the input.

This approach efficiently simulates the process of a ball traversing through the grid while checking for conditions where it may be stuck.
