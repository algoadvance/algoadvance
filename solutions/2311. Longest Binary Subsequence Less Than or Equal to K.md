title:  Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K-out
permalink: /s2311
---

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`, return the length of the longest subsequence of `s` that makes up a binary number less than or equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the length of `s`?**
   - This will help us determine if our solution needs to be optimized for large inputs.
2. **Can `s` contain characters other than '0' and '1'?**
   - Based on the typical definition of a binary string, `s` should only contain '0' and '1'.
3. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - Although the problem states that `k` is positive, confirming this explicitly ensures there are no edge cases to consider.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the requirements**: We need to form a subsequence whose binary representation is less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Identify potential subsequences**: By definition, removing characters from the original string to form a subsequence implies that the order of remaining characters is preserved.
3. **Filtering out `k`-long subsequences**: Convert subsequences to integers to check if they meet the requirement.

### Code

Let's work out a step-by-step implementation:

1. Traverse the input binary string from right to left (least significant bit to most significant bit) and form the subsequence while ensuring the binary number formed meets the criteria.
2. Keep appending '0's and selectively '1's if they don't violate the constraint.

Hereâ€™s how we can implement this:

```python
def longestSubsequence(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Start with the least significant bit
    length = 0
    num = 0
    power = 1 # Representing the power of 2 (2^0 initially)
    
    # Traverse the string from the end to the beginning
    for bit in reversed(s):
        if bit == '0':
            length += 1  # We can always take '0' because it does not affect the value
            
        else:
            # If adding this bit with the current power of 2 does not exceed k, take it
            if num + power <= k:
                num += power
                length += 1
        
        power *= 2  # Move to the next higher bit (2^1, 2^2, etc.)
    
    return length
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the binary string `s`. We iterate through the string once from the end to the beginning.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we use a fixed amount of additional space.

This algorithm efficiently determines the longest subsequence that satisfies the problem constraints by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and careful selection of bits from the original string.
