title:  Check if it is Possible to Split Array-out
permalink: /s2811
---

You are given an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `m`. You need to determine whether it is possible to split `nums` into one or more non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the elements in each subarray is at least `m`.

Return `true` if it possible to split the array according to the above conditions, otherwise, return `false`.

## Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2, 4, 8, 2, 5], m = 7`
Output: `true`
Explanation: One possible way to split `nums` is `[[2, 4, 8], [2, 5]]`.

## Example 2:
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3], m = 5`
Output: `false`
Explanation: There is no way to split `nums` such that the sum of all elements in each subarray is at least `m`.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the subarrays be of varying sizes?**  
   Yes, as long as they are non-empty and each subarray's sum is at least `m`.

2. **Are negative numbers allowed in the array?**  
   Assuming positive numbers unless stated otherwise.

3. **What constraints do we have on the size of `nums` and the value of `m`?**  
   Confirming typical constraint ranges like `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= m <= 10^9`.

# Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array** and keep a running sum.
2. **Check partitions**: When the running sum reaches or exceeds `m`, we can consider dividing at this point and reset the running sum.
3. **Edge cases**: Single element `nums` where this element is greater than or equal to `m`.

## Approach and Algorithm

1. Initialize a running sum to 0.
2. Iterate through the elements in the array:
   a. Add the current element to the running sum.
   b. If the running sum is at least `m`, reset the running sum to be zero (indicating a new potential split point).
3. After the loop, if the running sum times the number of splits is at least `m`, return `true`.
4. If the loop completes and the running sum was never reset, return `false`.

# Code

```python
def can_split_array(nums, m):
    running_sum = 0
    splits = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        running_sum += num
        if running_sum >= m:
            splits += 1
            running_sum = 0  # Reset running sum for the new subarray
    
    # Check if the number of successful splits meets the requirement
    return splits > 0

# Example test cases
print(can_split_array([2, 4, 8, 2, 5], 7))  # True
print(can_split_array([1, 2, 3], 5))        # False
```

# Time Complexity

The algorithm iterates through the array exactly once, performing constant time operations in each iteration. Hence, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This ensures efficiency even for large input sizes within typical constraints.
