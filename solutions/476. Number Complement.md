Given a positive integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `num = 5`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `5` is `101`, and its complement is `010` which is the binary representation of `2`.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `num = 1`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `1` is `1`, and its complement is `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of the input number `num`?
   **A:** The problem specifies that `num` is a positive integer, typically within the range of a standard 32-bit integer in many problems.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the performance of the solution?
   **A:** Given that this is an interview problem, we should aim for an efficient solution, ideally O(n) where n is the number of bits in the number.

### Strategy
1. **Convert the number to binary:** First, get the binary representation of the number.
2. **Calculate the complement:** Flip each bit in the binary string to get the complement.
3. **Convert back to integer:** Convert the resulting binary string back into an integer.

### Code

```python
def findComplement(num):
    # Find binary representation of the number without the '0b' prefix
    binary_rep = bin(num)[2:]
    
    # Find the complement by flipping each bit
    complement = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_rep)
    
    # Convert the complement back to an integer
    return int(complement, 2)

# Test the function with the provided examples
print(findComplement(5))  # Output: 2
print(findComplement(1))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation
1. **`bin(num)[2:]`**: Converts the integer `num` to a binary string and slices off the '0b' prefix to get a clean binary representation.
2. **`'1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_rep`**: A generator expression that flips each bit in the binary string.
3. **`''.join(...)`**: Joins the flipped bits back into a single string.
4. **`int(complement, 2)`**: Converts the binary string back to an integer.

### Time Complexity
- **Conversion to binary:** O(n), where `n` is the number of bits.
- **Flipping binary string:** O(n), each bit is processed once.
- **Converting back to integer:** O(n), dependent on the number of digits in the binary string.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n).
