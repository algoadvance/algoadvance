Given a pattern and a string `s`, find if `s` follows the same pattern.

Here, follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty word in `s`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the string `s` will contain at least one word.

2. **Can the pattern contain other characters apart from alphabets?**
   - No, the pattern will contain only lowercase alphabets.

3. **Can the words in string `s` contain numbers, punctuation, etc.?**
   - The words in string `s` will consist of lowercase alphabet characters only.

4. **Is the length of `pattern` equal to the number of words in `s`?**
   - Yes, for the pattern to follow the string `s`, their lengths in terms of elements (letters and words) should be equal.

## Strategy:

1. **Split the string into words:** 
   - Use in-built split function to convert string `s` into a list of words.
   
2. **Length Check:**
   - Check if the length of the pattern is equal to the number of words in `s`. If not, return `false`.
   
3. **Mapping Creation:**
   - Use dictionaries to create one-to-one mappings from pattern characters to words and from words to pattern characters.

4. **Check and Validate Mapping:**
   - Iterate through each character in the pattern and each word in the list.
   - Ensure that each character in the pattern maps to exactly one word and vice versa.

## Code:

```python
def wordPattern(pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
    words = s.split()
    
    if len(pattern) != len(words):
        return False
    
    char_to_word = {}
    word_to_char = {}
    
    for char, word in zip(pattern, words):
        if char in char_to_word:
            if char_to_word[char] != word:
                return False
        else:
            char_to_word[char] = word
            
        if word in word_to_char:
            if word_to_char[word] != char:
                return False
        else:
            word_to_char[word] = char
            
    return True
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Splitting the string `s`:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Iterating and creating mappings:** O(k), where `k` is the length of the `pattern` (or the number of words in `s` since they must be equal).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n + k)**, which simplifies to **O(n)** since the length of pattern `k` and the resulting word list length are bounded by the length of the input string `s`.
