title:  Russian Doll Envelopes-out
permalink: /s354
---

This problem is known as the "Russian Doll Envelopes" problem. Given a list of envelopes where each envelope is represented by a pair of integers \[wi, hi\] representing the width and height of the envelope respectively, you must find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (put one inside another). An envelope (wi, hi) can fit into another envelope (wj, hj) if and only if both wi < wj and hi < hj.

### Example:
```
Input: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can envelopes have the same width or height?**
    - Yes, envelopes can have the same width or height.
2. **What will be the size of the input list?**
    - The size can be large, up to 10^4.
3. **Can the dimensions of envelopes be zero or negative?**
    - Typically, dimensions are positive integers as they represent real-world sizes.

### Strategy:

Hereâ€™s the strategy to solve the problem:
1. **Sort the envelopes**: 
    - Sort the envelopes first based on the width in ascending order.
    - If the widths are the same, sort based on the height in descending order.
        - This ensures that envelopes of the same width will not be considered as one fitting into another.
2. **Find the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**:
    - After sorting, the problem reduces to finding the LIS based on height only.

### Code:

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def maxEnvelopes(envelopes):
    if not envelopes:
        return 0

    # Sort envelopes: increasing width and decreasing height for same width
    envelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    # Extract the heights from the sorted envelopes
    heights = [envelope[1] for envelope in envelopes]
    
    # Function to find LIS using binary search
    def lengthOfLIS(nums):
        lis = []
        for num in nums:
            pos = bisect_left(lis, num)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(num)
            else:
                lis[pos] = num
        return len(lis)
    
    return lengthOfLIS(heights)

# Example Usage
envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
print(maxEnvelopes(envelopes))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sort operation.
- **LIS Calculation**: The binary search within the LIS function takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of envelopes.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). 

This solution efficiently handles the problem even for the upper constraint of the input size.
