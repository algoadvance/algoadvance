title:  Climbing Stairs-out
permalink: /s70
---

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

*Example 1:*
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

*Example 2:*
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

*Constraints:*
- `1 <= n <= 45`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the order of steps taken important?**
   Yes, the order in which steps are taken is important. For example, taking steps like `1 + 2` is different from `2 + 1`.

2. **Do we always start at step 0?**
   Yes, you start from step 0.

3. **Can we assume the input will always be an integer within the given range?**
   Yes, the input `n` is always an integer within the range `[1, 45]`.

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The main idea is similar to the Fibonacci sequence approach because from any step `i`, you can either come from step `i-1` or step `i-2`.

Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to reach step `i`. The recurrence relation is:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] \]

Where:
   - `dp[1]` is 1 because there is only one way to climb to the first step.
   - `dp[2]` is 2 because there are two ways to climb to the second step (1+1 or 2).

We will compute `dp` values from `3` to `n` and return `dp[n]`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) because we compute the number of ways to each step only once.

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) because of the extra space used for the `dp` array, but it can be optimized to \(O(1)\) if only the last two computed values are kept.

## Code

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 2
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    
    return dp[n]

# Test cases
print(climbStairs(2))  # Output: 2
print(climbStairs(3))  # Output: 3
print(climbStairs(4))  # Output: 5
```

Alternatively, we can optimize the space complexity to \(O(1)\):

```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2
    
    a, b = 1, 2
    
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b

# Test cases
print(climbStairs(2))  # Output: 2
print(climbStairs(3))  # Output: 3
print(climbStairs(4))  # Output: 5
```

This optimized approach maintains two variables to track the previous two values which saves on space while maintaining the linear time complexity.
