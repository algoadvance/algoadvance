title:  Furthest Building You Can Reach-out
permalink: /s1642
---

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start at building `0` and every move you can either climb to the next building or stay on the current one:

- If you decide to climb to building `i + 1`, you must climb `heights[i + 1] - heights[i]` units, which could be positive, negative, or zero.
- If you use bricks, each brick helps cover one unit of the difference.
- If you use a ladder, you can climb any number of units without using bricks.

Your goal is to reach the furthest building possible. Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

- Is the `heights` array guaranteed to be non-empty?
  - Yes, the `heights` array is guaranteed to have at least one element.
- Can the difference between the heights of two consecutive buildings be negative?
  - Yes, the difference can be negative, which might imply no need to use bricks or ladders for that step.
  
### Code

```python
import heapq

def furthestBuilding(heights, bricks, ladders):
    heap = []
    
    for i in range(len(heights) - 1):
        climb = heights[i + 1] - heights[i]
        
        if climb > 0:
            heapq.heappush(heap, climb)
        
        if len(heap) > ladders:
            bricks -= heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        if bricks < 0:
            return i
    
    return len(heights) - 1

# Example Usage
heights = [4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 14, 12]
bricks = 5
ladders = 1
print(furthestBuilding(heights, bricks, ladders))  # Output: 4
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**: Use a min-heap to track the largest climbs for which you have used bricks so far.
2. **Iterate through Buildings**: For each building, calculate the climb to the next building.
   - If the climb is positive, add it to the heap.
3. **Maintain Ladders Count**: Ensure the heap size does not exceed the number of ladders. If it does, remove the smallest element from the heap (use bricks for that climb instead).
4. **Check Bricks Availability**: Continuously track the bricks left. If bricks become negative, return the current index as you can't move further.
5. **Return the Result**: If you can traverse all buildings, return the length of the heights array minus one.

### Time Complexity

The solution runs in O(N log L) where:
- N is the number of buildings (length of the `heights` array),
- L is the number of ladders.

Using a heap ensures that, in the worst case, each insertion and extraction operation takes O(log L) time, resulting in the overall time complexity of O(N log L).
