title:  Count the Number of Inversions-out
permalink: /s3193
---

Given an array of integers `arr`, return the number of inversions required to sort the array in non-decreasing order. An inversion is a pair `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

2. **Q**: What is the range of the input size?
   - **A**: The input size can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Q**: Is there a specific time complexity requirement?
   - **A**: Given the constraint, an efficient solution such as \(O(n \log n)\) would be expected.

4. **Q**: Should the inversions count include only direct swaps needed for sorting?
   - **A**: The inversions count should include all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

With these clarifications, we can proceed to the strategy.

## Strategy

To count the number of inversions efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. Merge sort works in \(O(n \log n)\) time, and during the merge step, we can count how many inversions are there. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively count inversions in each half.
3. **Combine**: During the merge step, count how many inversions are there when merging the two halves. This happens when an element from the right half is less than an element from the left half during the merge process.

We keep a running total of the number of inversions found during the merge steps.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```python
def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray
    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray
    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted
    inv_count = 0

    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right
    while i <= mid and j <= right:
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in left subarray
            # are greater than arr[j]
            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
            inv_count += (mid-i + 1)
            j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any
    while i <= mid:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any
    while j <= right:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

    return inv_count

def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
    inv_count = 0
    if left < right:
        # mid is the point where the array is divided into two subarrays
        mid = (left + right)//2

        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)

        # Inversions counted during merge step
        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)

    return inv_count

def count_inversions(arr):
    temp_arr = [0]*len(arr)
    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
print("Number of inversions are", count_inversions(arr))
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the merge sort basis.

- **Divide**: This step takes \(O(\log n)\).
- **Merge and Count**: This step takes \(O(n)\) in each level of recursion.

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient and expected given the constraints.
