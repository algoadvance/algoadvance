title:  Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers-out
permalink: /s2094
---
Given an integer array `digits` where each element is a digit from 0 to 9, you need to find all the unique 3-digit even numbers that can be formed using exactly three of the given digits in `digits`. Return the numbers in ascending order as a sorted list.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we use the same digit more than once?**
   - No, each digit should be used exactly once.

2. **What is the expected return type?**
   - The function should return a list of integers.

3. **What if the input array has less than 3 digits?**
   - If the input array has less than 3 digits, it is impossible to form a 3-digit number, hence the output should be an empty list.

4. **Can the input array contain duplicate digits?**
   - Yes, the input array may contain duplicates, but each digit should be used only once per 3-digit number formation.

## Strategy
1. **Filtering for Valid Combinations:**
   - Since the number has to be even, the last digit must be even. We will filter combinations based on this condition.
  
2. **Generate Combinations:**
   - Use permutations to generate all possible 3-digit combinations from the given digits.
  
3. **Check Validity and Uniqueness:**
   - Filter valid 3-digit numbers where the last digit is even.
   - Ensure numbers are unique by using a set.
  
4. **Sorting:**
   - Convert the set to a sorted list and return it.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where there are less than 3 digits in the input array.
   - Handle cases with repeated digits.

## Time Complexity
- Generating all permutations of 3 digits out of n has a complexity of O(n^3) for n digits.
- Filtering and uniqueness checking can also influence time complexity, but since n is limited (digits 0-9), it remains manageable.

## Code

Here is the implementation based on the strategy:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def findEvenNumbers(digits):
    # Convert permutations of digits into potential 3-digit numbers
    unique_numbers = set()
    
    for perm in permutations(digits, 3):
        # Check if last digit is even
        if perm[2] % 2 == 0:
            number = perm[0] * 100 + perm[1] * 10 + perm[2]
            # Ensure it is a 3-digit number (first digit must not be zero)
            if perm[0] != 0:
                unique_numbers.add(number)
    
    # Sort the unique numbers and return them as a list
    return sorted(unique_numbers)

# Example usage
digits = [2, 1, 3, 0]
print(findEvenNumbers(digits))  # Output: [102, 120, 130, 132, 210, 230, 302, 310, 312, 320]
```

Now, this function `findEvenNumbers` will generate and return all unique 3-digit even numbers that can be formed from the given digits, in ascending order.
