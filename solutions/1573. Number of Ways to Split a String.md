title:  Number of Ways to Split a String-out
permalink: /s1573
---

Given a binary string s (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's), we can split s into three non-empty strings s1, s2, s3 (s = s1 + s2 + s3) such that the number of '1's in s1, s2, and s3 are all equal. 

Return the number of ways s can be split into three parts. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Examples

1. Input: s = "10101"
   Output: 4
2. Input: s = "1001"
   Output: 0
3. Input: s = "0000"
   Output: 3

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does each split need to ensure all parts are non-empty?**
   - Yes, all parts (s1, s2, s3) must be non-empty.

2. **What do we return if it's impossible to split the string according to the conditions?**
   - Return 0.

3. **How do we handle cases where the string has no '1's?**
   - We need to handle this as a special case: if the string contains only '0's, we need to see how many ways we can split it.

## Strategy

1. **Edge Cases Handling:** An edge case is when no '1' exists. If the number of all '1's in the string isn't divisible by 3, it's impossible to split the string as described.

2. **Counting Zeros:** For splits where it is possible to split the binary string so that each part has the same number of '1's, we need to count the zeros in particular partitions. We will start counting these from the points where a third of the '1's have been reached.

3. **Mathematical Approach:** We can leverage prefix sums to calculate where valid splits can occur. Specifically, we focus on the number of zeros between the points where the equal partitions of '1's can appear.

## Code

```python
def numWays(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    ones_count = s.count('1')
    
    if ones_count % 3 != 0:
        return 0
    
    if ones_count == 0:
        n = len(s)
        # the number of ways to pick 2 out of (n - 1) positions to insert the splits
        return ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) % MOD
    
    ones_per_part = ones_count // 3
    first_cut_ways = second_cut_ways = 0
    ones = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '1':
            ones += 1
        if ones == ones_per_part:
            first_cut_ways += 1
        if ones == 2 * ones_per_part:
            second_cut_ways += 1
    
    return (first_cut_ways * second_cut_ways) % MOD
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `s`:
  - First pass to count the number of '1's.
  - Second pass to compute the number of ways we can split at the specified points.

We only traverse the string a couple of times, ensuring an efficient solution even for large strings.
