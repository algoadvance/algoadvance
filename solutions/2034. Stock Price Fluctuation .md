title:  Stock Price Fluctuation -out
permalink: /s2034
---

You are given a stream of records about a stock price's history that are being passed to a system. The records are in the form of a tuple (timestamp, price), where:

- `timestamp` is an integer representing the time at which the transaction occurred.
- `price` is the integer price of the stock at that transaction.

You would need to implement the `StockPrice` class:

- `StockPrice()` Initializes the object with no price records.
- `void update(int timestamp, int price)` Updates the stock price at the given timestamp.
- `int current()` Returns the latest stock price.
- `int maximum()` Returns the maximum stock price recorded.
- `int minimum()` Returns the minimum stock price recorded.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the timestamps guaranteed to be unique?**
   - Yes, in the context of the problem, we assume that each update comes with a unique timestamp.

2. **Can timestamps be updated retroactively?**
   - Yes, prices for earlier timestamps can be updated again with new values.

3. **Is there a limit to the number of updates?**
   - The problem does not specify a limit, but we should consider efficient data structures to handle potentially large inputs.

4. **Would there be a need to remove old timestamps?**
   - The problem does not specify this requirement, so we will store all updates.

## Strategy

### Data Structures

We can use the following data structures to enable quick updates and retrievals:

1. **Dictionary (`prices`)**: To store the price at each timestamp.
2. **Max-heap and Min-heap**: To efficiently query the maximum and minimum prices.
3. **Variable (`latest_time`)**: To keep track of the most recent timestamp.

### Methods

1. **update(timestamp, price)**:
   - Update or insert the price corresponding to the given timestamp in the dictionary.
   - Update the latest timestamp if the current timestamp is the most recent.
   - Push the price into both heaps for future queries.

2. **current()**:
   - Return the most recent price using the latest timestamp.

3. **maximum()**:
   - Pop from the max-heap until the top element is valid (i.e., exists in the `prices` dictionary with the correct price).

4. **minimum()**:
   - Pop from the min-heap until the top element is valid.

### Code Implementation

```python
import heapq

class StockPrice:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prices = {}
        self.latest_time = -1
        self.max_heap = []
        self.min_heap = []
        
    def update(self, timestamp: int, price: int) -> None:
        self.prices[timestamp] = price
        if timestamp > self.latest_time:
            self.latest_time = timestamp
        # Push to the max-heap and min-heap; need negation for max-heap
        heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, (-price, timestamp))
        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, (price, timestamp))
        
    def current(self) -> int:
        return self.prices[self.latest_time]
    
    def maximum(self) -> int:
        while self.max_heap:
            price, timestamp = heapq.heappop(self.max_heap)
            if self.prices[timestamp] == -price:
                heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, (price, timestamp))  # valid entry, push back
                return -price
    
    def minimum(self) -> int:
        while self.min_heap:
            price, timestamp = heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)
            if self.prices[timestamp] == price:
                heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, (price, timestamp))  # valid entry, push back
                return price
```

## Time Complexity

- `update(timestamp, price)`: \(O(\log N)\) due to heap insertion.
- `current()`: \(O(1)\) for just retrieving the latest price.
- `maximum()`: \(O(\log N)\) in the worst case due to heap operations.
- `minimum()`: \(O(\log N)\) in the worst case due to heap operations.

This solution efficiently handles updates and queries even with large datasets.
