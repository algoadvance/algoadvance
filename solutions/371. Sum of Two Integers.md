title:  Sum of Two Integers-out
permalink: /s371
---
1. Are negative integers allowed in the input?
2. What are the constraints on the integer values? Are they within the typical 32-bit signed integer range?
3. Should the solution handle overflow situations explicitly, or can we assume the numbers will always be within a safe range?

### Strategy
The problem statement asks us to find the sum of two integers without using the `+` or `-` operators. This can be done using bitwise operations.

#### Approach:
1. **Bitwise XOR** (`^`): This operation will handle the addition without carrying. For example, `5 ^ 3` results in `6` (binary `101 ^ 011 = 110`).
2. **Bitwise AND and Shift** (`&` and `<<`): This will handle the carrying. For example, `5 & 3` results in `1` (binary `101 & 011 = 001`), and `1 << 1` results in `2` (binary `001 << 1 = 010`).

We will:
1. Use XOR to add the numbers without carry.
2. Use AND followed by left shift to calculate the carry.
3. Repeat the process until there is no carry.

#### Handling Negative Numbers:
Python handles arbitrarily large integers with its built-in `int` type, but when simulating 32-bit integer behavior, we need to take special care of overflow:
- Use a mask of `0xFFFFFFFF` to get the last 32 bits.
- Convert results if they exceed the 32-bit signed integer range.

### Code
Let's implement the solution with the above strategy.

```python
def getSum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # 32 bits integer max
    MAX = 0x7FFFFFFF
    # Mask to get last 32 bits
    mask = 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    while b != 0:
        # calulate the carry
        carry = (a & b) << 1
        # add the bits without carry
        a = (a ^ b) & mask
        # apply the carry
        b = carry & mask
    
    # if a is negative, get its positive complement
    if a > MAX:
        a = ~(a ^ mask)
    
    return a

# Example usage:
# a = 1, b = 2, expected output = 3
print(getSum(1, 2)) # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) in average case since the number of bitwise operations is fixed and limited by the number of bits (32 bits in this case).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
