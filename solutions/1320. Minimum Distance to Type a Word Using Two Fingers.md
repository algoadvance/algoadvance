title:  Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers-out
permalink: /s1320
---
You have a keyboard layout as shown below:

```
a b c d e f g h i j
k l m n o p q r s t
u v w x y z
```

Given a word `word`, you have to type this word using two fingers. The initial positions of both fingers are at the start (i.e., no previous position).

Your task is to minimize the total distance the fingers must travel to type the entire word. The distance between any two keys `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on the keyboard is defined as `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the maximum length of the input word?**
   - The word length can be up to 300 characters.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the word?**
   - The word consists only of lowercase English letters.

3. **Is the layout of the keyboard fixed as described in the problem statement?**
   - Yes, the keyboard layout is fixed as described.

4. **How should we handle the starting position of the fingers?**
   - Initially, both fingers are considered to be at a position before the start of the keyboard (e.g., (-1, -1)).

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we need to use Dynamic Programming to keep track of the minimum cost (distance) to type each character using two fingers.

#### Dynamic Programming State
- Define a 3D DP state: `dp[i][f1][f2]` where:
  - `i` is the current index in the word being typed.
  - `f1` is the position of the first finger.
  - `f2` is the position of the second finger.
  
#### Transition
- For each character at position `i`, we have two choices:
  - Move the first finger from its current position `f1` to the current character `word[i]`.
  - Move the second finger from its current position `f2` to the current character `word[i]`.
- Compute the cost in terms of the Manhattan distance and update the DP table accordingly.

#### Base Case:
- `dp[0][(-1, -1)][(-1, -1)] = 0` since no movement is needed initially.

#### Goal:
- Minimize the cost for typing the word when all characters are typed.

### Code:
```python
def minimumDistance(word):
    # Function to convert a character to its position on the keyboard
    def char_position(c):
        idx = ord(c) - ord('a')
        return divmod(idx, 10)
    
    # Memoization dictionary
    memo = {}
    
    # DP function to calculate minimum distance
    def dp(i, f1, f2):
        if i == len(word):
            return 0
        if (i, f1, f2) in memo:
            return memo[(i, f1, f2)]
        
        pos = char_position(word[i])
        
        # Initial position (-1, -1) handling
        if f1 == (-1, -1):
            f1_cost = dp(i + 1, pos, f2)
        else:
            f1_cost = dp(i + 1, pos, f2) + (abs(f1[0] - pos[0]) + abs(f1[1] - pos[1]))
        
        if f2 == (-1, -1):
            f2_cost = dp(i + 1, f1, pos)
        else:
            f2_cost = dp(i + 1, f1, pos) + (abs(f2[0] - pos[0]) + abs(f2[1] - pos[1]))
        
        memo[(i, f1, f2)] = min(f1_cost, f2_cost)
        return memo[(i, f1, f2)]
    
    return dp(0, (-1, -1), (-1, -1))
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity primarily depends on evaluating the state transitions in our DP approach:
- The worst-case scenario involves computing the cost for each position of both fingers across all characters of the word.
- Given the constants (26 letters to their positions on a 2D keyboard), the overall complexity would be approximately `O(N * 26 * 26)`, where `N` is the length of the word. This is because there are `N` positions for each character, and each position can happen with both fingers on one of the 26 possible positions in the keyboard.

### Conclusion:
This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently determine the minimal distance required to type a word using two fingers on a given keyboard layout. It ensures that overlapping subproblems are computed only once, thus reducing redundant calculations.
