title:  Existence of a Substring in a String and Its Reverse-out
permalink: /s3083
---

We are given two strings `s` and `t`. We need to determine whether there exists any substring of `t` that is also a substring of `s` or the reverse of `s`.

Return a boolean value: `True` if there's at least one such substring and `False` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Lengths of Strings**: What are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`?
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Do the comparisons need to be case-sensitive?
3. **Character Set**: Do the strings contain only ASCII characters?

## Strategy

1. **Reverse `s`**: Compute the reverse of string `s`.
2. **Set of Substrings**: Generate all possible substrings of `t` and check if any of these substrings exist in `s` or the reversed `s`.
3. **Optimization**: Instead of generating all substrings of `t`, we can use the inherent Python string operations to check if one of the substrings is in `s` or its reverse.

## Code

The following Python code implements the above strategy:

```python
def check_substring_existence(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    
    # Check all substrings of t
    for i in range(len(t)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(t) + 1):
            substr = t[i:j]
            if substr in s or substr in reversed_s:
                return True
            
    return False

# Example Usage
s = "hello"
t = "world"
print(check_substring_existence(s, t))  # Example output: False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Reversal of String**: Reversing the string `s` will take O(n), where `n` is the length of `s`.
- **Substring Checks**: We check all substrings of `t`, which has a time complexity of O(m^3) due to the nested loops and the `in` check for each substring, where `m` is the length of `t`.

Overall, while the reverse operation is O(n), the dominant factor is the O(m^3) substring checks. If `m` and `n` are the same length, the overall complexity is O(m^3). This is acceptable for small strings, but for larger strings, optimization techniques like suffix trees or Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm might be considered.
