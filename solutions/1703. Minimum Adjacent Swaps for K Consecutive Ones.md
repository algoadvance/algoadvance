title:  Minimum Adjacent Swaps for K Consecutive Ones-out
permalink: /s1703
---

Given an array of binary integers `data`, you need to find the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to group all `1`s together in any location of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the input array contain only 0s and 1s?
   - **A**: Yes, the array will consist of binary integers (0s and 1s).
   
2. **Q**: Is it guaranteed that there will always be at least one `1` in the array?
   - **A**: Yes, it is guaranteed that the array contains at least one `1`.
   
3. **Q**: What are the constraints on the length of the array?
   - **A**: The constraints are 1 ≤ `data.length` ≤ 100,000.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Ones**: First, determine the total number of `1`s in the array. Let's call this count `k`.
   
2. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to count the number of `0`s in each window. The window with the minimum number of `0`s will require the fewest swaps to group all `1`s together.

3. **Calculate Swaps**: For each window, calculate the number of swaps needed to group all `1`s by keeping a running count of `0`s. The window with the fewest `0`s requires the fewest swaps because we only need to swap `0`s into position to create a contiguous block of `1`s.

### Time Complexity

The approach mainly involves iterating through the array to count `1`s and then another pass through the array with a sliding window. Thus, the time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.

### Code

```python
def minSwaps(data):
    # Step 1: Find the total number of 1's (k)
    k = sum(data)
    
    # Edge case: if k is already the length of the array, no swaps are needed
    if k == len(data):
        return 0
    
    # Step 2: Use sliding window to find the minimum number of 0's in any window of size k
    current_zeros = 0
    # Count zeros in the initial window of size k
    for i in range(k):
        if data[i] == 0:
            current_zeros += 1
    
    min_swaps = current_zeros
    
    # Step 3: Slide the window across the array
    for i in range(k, len(data)):
        # Add the next element to the current window
        if data[i] == 0:
            current_zeros += 1
        # Remove the element that is no longer in the window
        if data[i - k] == 0:
            current_zeros -= 1
        
        # Update the minimum swaps needed
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, current_zeros)
    
    return min_swaps

# Example usage:
data = [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
print(minSwaps(data))  # Output could be 3, depending on the configuration
```

### Explanation

1. Calculate the total number of `1`s (`k`).
2. Use a sliding window of size `k` to count the number of `0`s in each window.
3. Find the window with the minimum number of `0`s to determine the minimum number of swaps required.
4. Return the minimum number of swaps.

By efficiently using a sliding window technique, we ensure that the solution runs optimally, even for larger arrays.
