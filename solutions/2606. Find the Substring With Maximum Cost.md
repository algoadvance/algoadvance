title:  Find the Substring With Maximum Cost-out
permalink: /s2606
---

You are given a string `s`, a character mapping `chars` (a string containing unique characters), and an integer array `vals`. The `chars` string and `vals` array form a 1-to-1 mapping where each character in `chars` maps to its corresponding value in `vals`. Each character in `s` that is not present in `chars` has a default value of negative the ASCII value of that character.

Your task is to find the substring of `s` that has the maximum total value, and return that maximum cost.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the input string `s` is empty?**
   - We can assume that an empty string returns a cost of 0 as there are no substrings to consider.

2. **Are all characters in `s` guaranteed to be unique?**
   - No, the string `s` can contain repeating characters.

3. **Are `chars` and `vals` always of equal length?**
   - Yes, `chars` is guaranteed to have the same length as `vals` since it specifies a 1-to-1 mapping.

4. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `s`, `chars`, and `vals`?**
   - The constraints can vary, but let's assume typical constraints as we might find in competitive programming: `1 <= s.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= chars.length == vals.length <= 52` (considering uppercase and lowercase letters).

### Code

```python
def maximumCostSubstring(s: str, chars: str, vals: list[int]) -> int:
    # Create a dictionary to map characters to their given values
    value_map = {char: val for char, val in zip(chars, vals)}
    
    # Function to get the value of a character based on our mapping
    def get_char_value(c):
        return value_map.get(c, -ord(c))
    
    max_cost = float('-inf')
    current_cost = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string `s`
    for char in s:
        char_value = get_char_value(char)
        current_cost += char_value
        
        if current_cost > max_cost:
            max_cost = current_cost
        
        if current_cost < 0:
            current_cost = 0
    
    return max_cost if max_cost != float('-inf') else 0
```

### Strategy

1. **Mapping the Values**:
   - First, create a dictionary to map each character in `chars` to its corresponding value in `vals`.

2. **Calculate Character Value**:
   - Define a helper function `get_char_value` that takes a character and returns its mapped value if it exists in the map or `-ord(c)` otherwise.

3. **Finding Maximum Cost Substring**:
   - Iterate over each character in the string `s`.
   - Use a variable `current_cost` to keep track of the sum of the values of the characters in the current substring.
   - If `current_cost` becomes negative, reset it to 0 (i.e., start a new substring).
   - Update `max_cost` whenever `current_cost` exceeds the previously recorded maximum cost.

4. **Return Results**:
   - Finally, return `max_cost`. If no valid substring is found, return 0.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. The algorithm iterates over each character in the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of the `chars` string. The space is used to store the dictionary mapping.

This approach ensures that the algorithm is efficient and handles the potentially large input size gracefully.
