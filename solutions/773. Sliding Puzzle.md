title:  Sliding Puzzle-out

You are given a 2x3 board representing the starting state of a sliding puzzle. The board contains numbers from 0 to 5, where 0 represents the empty space. You can move the empty space to any of the adjacent (Up, Down, Left, Right) positions to swap with another number. The goal of the puzzle is to reach the target state `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]`.

Write a function `slidingPuzzle` that returns the least number of moves required to reach the target state, or -1 if it is not possible.

Example:
```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
```

Example:
```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Is it always guaranteed that the input board will be a 2x3 matrix?
   - **A:** Yes, according to the problem statement, the board is always 2x3.

2. **Q:** Can the input board contain any numbers other than 0 through 5?
   - **A:** No, the board will only contain numbers from 0 to 5.

3. **Q:** Are all puzzle states reachable?
   - **A:** No, not all puzzle states are reachable. Certain permutations are not possible to achieve.

### Strategy:
The problem can be approached using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible states of the board. BFS is suitable since it explores all possible moves level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to the target state.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Convert the 2D board into a tuple for immutability and easy state comparison.
   - Use a queue to store the current state, number of moves, and position of the zero (empty space).

2. **BFS Exploration:**
   - For each state, try all possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right).
   - Generate new board states by swapping the empty space with the adjacent positions.
   - If the new state matches the target, return the current number of moves + 1.
   - If the state has not been visited, add it to the queue.

3. **Visited States:**
   - Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid re-processing.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the initial state is already the target state, return 0.
   - If the queue is exhausted and no solution is found, return -1.

### Code:
```python
from collections import deque

def slidingPuzzle(board):
    target = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 0))
    start = tuple(tuple(row) for row in board)
    
    # Check if the initial state is the target state
    if start == target:
        return 0
    
    # Directions for movements: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    q = deque([(start, start[0].index(0) if 0 in start[0] else 5, 0)]) # state, pos, moves
    visited = {start}
    
    while q:
        state, zero_pos, moves = q.popleft()
        zero_row, zero_col = divmod(zero_pos, 3)
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = zero_row + dr, zero_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 3:
                new_zero_pos = new_row * 3 + new_col
                # Generate new state as list of lists and then convert to tuple
                new_state = [list(row) for row in state]
                new_state[zero_row][zero_col], new_state[new_row][new_col] = new_state[new_row][new_col], new_state[zero_row][zero_col]
                new_state = tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_state)
                
                if new_state == target:
                    return moves + 1
                
                if new_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state)
                    q.append((new_state, new_zero_pos, moves + 1))
    
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity:
- The maximum number of moves in the worst case is factorial(6) / 2 = 360 (considering even and odd permutations).
- Each state generation and comparison operation is constant O(1).
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(6!) which is approximately O(720), considered manageable for BFS on small graphs.
