title:  Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time-out
permalink: /s1928
---

Given an array of edges where each edge is represented as `[u, v, time]` indicating that there is a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` taking `time` minutes to travel, and an array `passingFees` where `passingFees[i]` is the fee you have to pay whenever you pass through city `i`. Your task is to determine the minimum cost to reach the destination `n-1` from the starting city `0` within a given `maxTime`.

### Input:
- `edges` (List[List[int]]): List of edges where each edge is `[u, v, time]`.
- `passingFees` (List[int]): List of passing fees for each city.
- `maxTime` (int): The maximum time we can spend to reach the destination.

### Output:
- Returns the minimum cost to reach the destination city `n-1` within `maxTime` minutes. If it is not possible to reach the destination within the given time, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that there are no negative weights in the edges?
2. Is it possible that the graph is disconnected (meaning some nodes are unreachable)?
3. Can we assume that `edges` and `passingFees` arrays are well-formed (i.e., indices are within the proper range, no duplicate edges, etc.)?

These clarifications will help in ensuring proper handling of the input data.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a variation of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which is typically used for finding the shortest path in a graph. Instead of the shortest path, we need to find the least costly path within a certain amount of time.

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue to store (cost, time, node). This ensures that we are always expanding the least costly paths first.
3. **Visited State Tracking**: Track the minimum time to reach each node to avoid redundant processing.
4. **BFS/DFS Traversal**: Traverse the graph, updating costs and times until we either find the optimal path or exhaust possibilities.

## Code

Here's the implementation:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def minCost(n, edges, passingFees, maxTime):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Build graph as adjacency list
    for u, v, time in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, time))
        graph[v].append((u, time))
    
    # Priority queue for (current_cost, current_time, node)
    pq = [(passingFees[0], 0, 0)]
    
    # Min time to reach each node with dictionary (node -> time)
    min_time = [[float('inf')] * (maxTime + 1) for _ in range(n)]
    min_time[0][0] = passingFees[0]
    
    while pq:
        current_cost, current_time, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if node == n - 1:
            return current_cost
        
        for neighbor, travel_time in graph[node]:
            new_time = current_time + travel_time
            if new_time > maxTime:
                continue
            new_cost = current_cost + passingFees[neighbor]
            
            if new_cost < min_time[neighbor][new_time]:
                min_time[neighbor][new_time] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, new_time, neighbor))
    
    return -1

# Example usage:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 10], [1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 10], [3, 4, 10]]
passingFees = [5, 1, 2, 20, 1]
maxTime = 30
print(minCost(n, edges, passingFees, maxTime))  # Output: 8
```

## Time Complexity

- Constructing the graph: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- Initializing the priority queue and minimum time table: O(N * T), where N is the number of nodes and T is `maxTime`.
- Priority queue operations: each node can be pushed/popped at most (T / min_edge_time) times, leading to O(E + V log V) complexity because each edge leads to an operation of logarithmic complexity in the priority queue.

Thus, the overall time complexity can be considered as **O(E + E log (E/T))**, which simplifies to approximately **O(E log E)** in the worst case.
