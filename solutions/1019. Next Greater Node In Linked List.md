title:  Next Greater Node In Linked List-out
permalink: /s1019
---
You are given the head of a singly linked list. The nodes in this linked list contain integers. Return an array of integers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the value of the next greater node after the `i`-th node in the linked list. If there is no next greater node, set `answer[i]` to 0.

*Example:*
```
Input: [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size of the linked list?**
   - The size is not explicitly constrained but usually depends on typical constraints; expect typical length constraints (e.g., up to 10000 nodes).

2. **Are all node values positive integers?**
   - For simplicity, yes, all values are non-negative integers.

3. **What if there are multiple same values?**
   - The solution should handle multiple occurrences correctly and still find the next greater value.

4. **Should the output array be in the same order as the input linked list?**
   - Yes, the order of the output array should directly correspond to the nodes of the linked list.

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we can use a combination of stack and array manipulation:
1. **Convert Linked List to Array:** First, convert the linked list to an array to facilitate easier manipulation.
2. **Use Stack for Monotonic Decreasing Tracking:** Utilize a stack to keep track of indices of the array elements such that the elements in the stack are always in a monotonically decreasing order.
3. **Traverse the Array:** Iterate through the array. For each element, check if it is greater than the element represented by the index on top of the stack.
    - If true, pop the index from the stack and set the element at that index to the current element (indicating the next greater element). Continue this until the stack is empty or the top element is greater.
    - Push the current elementâ€™s index onto the stack.
4. **Final Result for Remaining Indices:** After traversing the array, any indices left in the stack do not have a next greater element and should be set to 0.

## Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def nextLargerNodes(head: ListNode):
    # Convert the linked list to a list
    values = []
    while head:
        values.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    
    # Prepare the answer array with all zeros
    answer = [0] * len(values)
    stack = []
    
    # Traverse each value in the array.
    for i, value in enumerate(values):
        # Check if the current value is greater than the value at the index of the top of the stack.
        while stack and values[stack[-1]] < value:
            index = stack.pop()
            answer[index] = value
        # Push the current index to the stack.
        stack.append(i)
    
    return answer
```

## Time Complexity
- **Conversion from Linked List to Array:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
- **Traversing the Array:** O(N), each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(N + N) = O(N), which is efficient for this problem size.

This approach ensures that we process each element a constant number of times, making it optimal for large inputs.
