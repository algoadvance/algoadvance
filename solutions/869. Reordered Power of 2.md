title:  Reordered Power of 2-out
permalink: /s869
---

The problem is to determine if a given integer can be reordered (by re-arranging its digits) to form a power of 2. In other words, we need to check if any permutation of the number's digits can form a power of 2.

Example:
- Input: n = 46
  Output: True (because 46 can be reordered to 64, which is \(2^6\) )

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of n?**
   - Typically, constraints are as follows: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

2. **Is n always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, given the constraints it's always a positive integer.

3. **What about leading zeros in the permutations?**
   - Leading zeros are not considered. For example, for n = 10, "01" isn't a valid sequence.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, our approach will be:
  
1. **Generate All Powers of 2:** We know that powers of 2 grow exponentially and quickly exceed the limit of \(10^9\). We will precompute all powers of 2 up to \(10^9\).

2. **Comparison Using Frequency Counter:** For each power of 2 within our computed list, we will compare its frequency of digits (using a counter) with the digit frequency of our given number. If any of them match, it means the number can be rearranged to form that power of 2.

3. **Implementation:** Using Pythonâ€™s `collections.Counter` will facilitate the frequency count operations efficiently.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
from collections import Counter

def reorderedPowerOf2(n: int) -> bool:
    # Generate powers of 2 up to 2^30, since 2^30 is the largest power of 2 less than 10^9
    powers_of_2 = [str(1 << i) for i in range(31)]
    
    # Create a frequency counter for the digits of the given number n
    n_counter = Counter(str(n))
    
    # Compare digit frequency of n with each power of 2
    for power in powers_of_2:
        if n_counter == Counter(power):
            return True
    
    return False

# Example Usage
n = 46
print(reorderedPowerOf2(n))  # Output: True (because 46 can be reordered to 64, which is 2^6)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating Powers of 2:** Generating the list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{30}\) is \(O(1)\) because there are only 31 such numbers.
- **Frequency Counter Comparison:** Comparing the frequency counters is \(O(d)\) where \(d\) is the number of digits in the largest power of 2. Given the size limit of \(10^9\), the maximum number of digits \(d\) is 10.
- **Total Comparison Operations:** There are at most 31 comparisons, each with a complexity of \(O(d)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(31d) = O(d)\), which simplifies to \(O(1)\) for practical purposes because \(d\) is bounded and small.

This approach ensures both efficiency and correctness for the given problem constraints.
