title:  Burst Balloons-out
permalink: /s312
---

You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst the `i-th` balloon, you will get `nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1]` coins. If `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of bounds of the array, then treat it as if there is a balloon with a `1` painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation: 
nums = [3,1,5,8] -> [3,5,8] -> [3,8] -> [8] -> []
Coins = 3*1*5 + 3*5*8 + 1*3*8 + 3*1*1 = 15 + 120 + 24 + 8 = 167
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array `nums` be empty?**
   - No, it will always contain at least one balloon.
2. **What are the limits on the length of `nums` and values inside `nums`?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 500`, and `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`.

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to calculate the maximum coins we can collect for every possible range of balloons.

1. **DP Table Definition:**
   - Let `dp[left][right]` be the maximum coins we can collect by bursting balloons only in the range `[left, right]`.

2. **Transition:**
   - To decide to burst any balloon `k` in the range `[left, right]`, we consider the coins obtained by bursting balloon `k` multiplied by the values of its adjacent balloons (considering boundaries as well).
   - `dp[left][right]` will be updated using:
     ```
     dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], nums[left-1]*nums[k]*nums[right+1] + dp[left][k-1] + dp[k+1][right])
     ```
  
3. **Boundary Adjustments:** 
   - Extend the `nums` array with 1 at both ends to avoid boundary checks.

4. **Initialization:**
   - The base cases are when `left > right`, where `dp[left][right] = 0`.

## Code

Here's the implementation following the above strategy:

```python
def maxCoins(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    # Adding 1 at both ends
    nums = [1] + nums + [1]
    # DP Table
    dp = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]
    
    # Fill DP table
    for length in range(1, n + 1):  # length of the range
        for left in range(1, n - length + 2):  # start position of the range
            right = left + length - 1  # end position of the range
            for k in range(left, right + 1):  # choose a balloon to burst in the range
                dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], dp[left][k-1] + nums[left-1]*nums[k]*nums[right+1] + dp[k+1][right])
    
    # The answer is the maximum coins we can collect for the range 1 to n
    return dp[1][n]

# Example Usage
print(maxCoins([3,1,5,8])) # Output: 167
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^3)\) due to the three nested loops (over the length of the ranges, starting positions, and the position of the balloon to burst within the range).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) due to the DP table used to store the results for subproblems.
