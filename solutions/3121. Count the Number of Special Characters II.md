title:  Count the Number of Special Characters II-out
permalink: /s3121
---

Given a string, return the number of special characters in it. A special character is defined as any character which is neither a letter nor a digit. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters should be considered as special characters?**
    - Any character that is not a letter (`a-z`, `A-Z`) and not a digit (`0-9`).
  
2. **Should we consider whitespace characters as special characters?**
    - Yes, whitespace characters should also be counted as special characters.

3. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
    - No, the input could be an empty string, in which case the result should be `0`.

4. **Can the input string contain non-ASCII characters?**
    - Clarifying this might be useful, but typically we can assume it includes all possible Unicode characters unless otherwise specified.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the string**: We will iterate through each character in the input string.
2. **Check if the character is a special character**: Using Python's `str.isalnum()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), we can determine if a character is special.
3. **Count special characters**: Maintain a counter that increments every time a special character is encountered.
4. **Return the count**: Finally, return the total count of special characters.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy in Python:

```python
def count_special_characters(s: str) -> int:
    special_char_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if not char.isalnum():  # Check if the character is not alphanumeric
            special_char_count += 1
    return special_char_count

# Example usage
example_string = "Hello, World! 1234"
print(count_special_characters(example_string))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. We have to check each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space (for the counter).

This solution is efficient for a typical string processing task. The linear time complexity ensures it will handle reasonably large strings effectively.
