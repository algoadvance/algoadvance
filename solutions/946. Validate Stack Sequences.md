title:  Validate Stack Sequences-out
permalink: /s946
---
Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, return `true` if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Size of the arrays:** Are both `pushed` and `popped` arrays guaranteed to be of the same length?
    - Yes, both arrays have the same length.
2. **Distinct values:** Are the values in `pushed` array distinct?
    - Yes, all values in both `pushed` and `popped` arrays are distinct.
3. **Order of Operations:** Is `popped` sequence necessarily created from elements of `pushed`?
    - Yes, `popped` is intended to represent a sequence of pop operations that might be derived from elements in `pushed`.

## Strategy
1. Use a stack to simulate the push and pop operations.
2. Iterate through the `pushed` array and push elements onto a simulated stack.
3. For each element pushed, check if the top of the stack matches the next element in the `popped` array.
    - If it matches, pop the top of the stack and move to the next element in `popped`.
    - Continue this process until the end of both arrays.
4. If at the end of the process the stack is empty and all elements in `popped` have been accounted for, then the sequence is valid.

## Time Complexity
- The code will iterate through each array exactly once, making the time complexity `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `pushed` (and `popped`) array.

## Code

```python
def validateStackSequences(pushed, popped):
    stack = []
    pop_index = 0
    
    for element in pushed:
        stack.append(element)  # simulate the push operation
        # simulate the pop operation
        while stack and stack[-1] == popped[pop_index]:
            stack.pop()
            pop_index += 1  # move to the next element in popped array
    
    # if stack is empty, then the sequence is valid
    return not stack

# Example Usage
pushed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
popped = [4, 5, 3, 2, 1]
print(validateStackSequences(pushed, popped))  # Output: True

pushed = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
popped = [4, 3, 5, 1, 2]
print(validateStackSequences(pushed, popped))  # Output: False
```

The example usage demonstrates the validation process. The function `validateStackSequences()` checks if given `pushed` and `popped` sequences can correspond to a stack's operations. The results for provided examples are as expected.
