title:  Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling-out
permalink: /s1235
---
You have `n` jobs, where every job is represented by a triplet `(startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i])`. You are required to find the maximum profit you can achieve by scheduling non-conflicting jobs. 

If you choose a job that ends at time `endTime[i]`, you cannot start another job until `endTime[i]`. 

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. Profit obtained is 20 + 70 + 60 = 150.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the job arrays always of equal length?**
   - Yes, `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` arrays are guaranteed to be of the same length.

2. **Can jobs overlap in terms of time periods?**
   - Yes, jobs can overlap, and the goal is to select non-overlapping jobs with maximal profit.

3. **What are the constraints on the values of `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit`?**
   - `1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 10^9`
   - `1 <= profit[i] <= 10^4`
   - `1 <= n <= 50000`

### Strategy:
The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP) with binary search optimization. The main idea is to sort the jobs by their end times and then employ a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit achievable considering jobs from the first job up to the ith job.

#### Steps:
1. **Sort the jobs**: Sort the jobs by their end times.
2. **Binary Search**: For each job `i`, find the latest job `j` that finishes before the start of job `i` using binary search.
3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: 
   - If we do not take the current job `i`, the profit remains the same as `dp[i-1]`.
   - If we take the current job `i`, the profit is `profit[i] + dp[j]` where `j` is the last job which doesn't overlap with current job `i`.

4. **State Initialization and Transition**:
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (profit before any job starts).
   - Transition: `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], profit[i] + dp[j])`.

### Code:
```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def jobScheduling(startTime, endTime, profit):
    jobs = sorted(zip(endTime, startTime, profit))
    dp = [(0, 0)]  # (endTime, profit)

    for end, start, p in jobs:
        i = bisect_right(dp, (start, float('inf')))
        if dp[i-1][1] + p > dp[-1][1]:
            dp.append((end, dp[i-1][1] + p))

    return dp[-1][1]

# Example Usage:
startTime = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
endTime = [3, 5, 10, 6, 9]
profit = [20, 20, 100, 70, 60]
print(jobScheduling(startTime, endTime, profit))  # Output: 150
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) because we sort the jobs based on their end times.
- **Binary Search**: For each of the `n` jobs, performing a binary search which is \(O(\log n)\).
- **DP Array Update**: \(O(n)\) for iterating through jobs.

So, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n) \]

This ensures the solution is efficient for large inputs as allowed by the problem constraints.
