title:  Making File Names Unique-out
permalink: /s1487
---
Given an array of strings `names` representing file names, you need to ensure that there are no duplicate file names. If a duplicate name appears, you need to add a suffix `(k)` to make it unique, where `k` is the smallest positive integer making the name unique. Return an array of strings where all file names are unique.

### Example:
```
Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]

Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the suffix system expand beyond `(1)` to `(2)`, e.g., `(k)` where `k` can be any positive integer?
2. Will there be inputs where names already have suffixes, such as "filename(2)" directly?
3. Should we consider only valid suffixes of the form `(k)` where k is a positive integer?

## Strategy
1. Create a dictionary to keep track of each name and the next possible smallest integer suffix that will make a name unique.
2. Iterate over the given array `names`.
   - For each name:
     - If the name is not in the dictionary, add it to the result list and set its counter to 1 in the dictionary.
     - If the name already exists in the dictionary, find the smallest suffix `(k)` to make it unique and update the name and the dictionary accordingly.
3. Return the list of unique names.

## Time Complexity
- **Insertion:** O(1) for each name due to dictionary operations.
- **Searching and Updating:** On average, O(1) due to hashing.
- **Overall:** O(n), where n is the number of names in the input list.

## Code

```python
def getFolderNames(names):
    name_count = {}
    result = []
    
    for name in names:
        original_name = name
        if name in name_count:
            curr_suffix = name_count[name]
            while name in name_count:
                name = f"{original_name}({curr_suffix})"
                curr_suffix += 1
            name_count[original_name] = curr_suffix
        name_count[name] = 1
        result.append(name)
    
    return result

# Testing the function
print(getFolderNames(["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]))  # ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
print(getFolderNames(["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]))  # ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
```

This code will iterate through the list of names, ensuring each name is unique by appending a suffix when necessary and keeping track of the next available suffix in the dictionary. The resulting list is returned with all unique file names.
