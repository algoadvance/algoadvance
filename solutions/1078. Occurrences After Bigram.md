title:  Occurrences After Bigram-out
permalink: /s1078
---

Given two strings `first` and `second`, consider occurrences in some text of the form "first second third", where `first` and `second` are exactly the words `first` and `second`, respectively, and `third` is the word immediately following them.

Return a list of all the words `third` for each instance of "first second third" in the text.

Example:
```python
text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student"
first = "a"
second = "good"
```
should return `["girl", "student"]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How do we handle punctuation or case sensitivity?**
   - Assume that all words in the given `text`, `first`, and `second` are lowercase and without punctuation.

2. **What should be done if `first` and `second` appear at the end of the text without a subsequent third word?**
   - If there is no following word after the occurrence of `first second`, skip this occurrence.

3. **Should we consider overlapping occurrences?**
   - No, the phrase `first second third` is a distinct occurrence, and the search should continue after this occurrence.

### Strategy

1. Split the `text` into a list of words.
2. Iterate through the list of words, checking for the pattern `first second`.
3. If the pattern `first second` is found and a subsequent word exists, add the subsequent word to the result list.
4. Return the list of subsequent words.

### Code

```python
def findOcurrences(text, first, second):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(words) - 2):
        if words[i] == first and words[i + 1] == second:
            result.append(words[i + 2])
    
    return result

# Example usage
text = "alice is a good girl she is a good student"
first = "a"
second = "good"
print(findOcurrences(text, first, second))  # Output: ["girl", "student"]
```

### Time Complexity

- Splitting the text into words: O(n) where `n` is the number of characters in the text.
- Iterating through the list of words: O(m) where `m` is the number of words in the list.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m), which is essentially linear with respect to the length of the input text and the number of words in the list. Since `m` will usually be much smaller than `n`, the complexity can often be considered O(n).
