title:  Zuma Game-out

---

You are playing a variation of the game Zuma. In this game, a board consists of several balls in a row, each ball can be colored red ('R'), yellow ('Y'), blue ('B'), green ('G'), or white ('W'). You also have several extra balls in your hand.

You need to remove all the balls from the board. A move consists of inserting a ball from your hand into the board, and then forming a new consecutive sequence of 3 or more balls of the same color, which will then be removed from the board. If this removal leads to more consecutive sequences of 3 or more balls of the same color, the chain reaction continues until no more balls can be removed.

Find the minimal number of balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the board. If you cannot remove all the balls, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the maximum length of the board and hand be defined for better optimization?
2. Are you allowed to use external libraries or is it restricted to the standard Python library?

No additional constraints were given, hence we'll proceed with standard constraints as per LeetCode which typically involves practical limits.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of Depth-First Search (DFS) and memoization. The basic strategy is:
1. Try to insert each ball from the hand into every possible position in the board.
2. Check if inserting the ball causes a sequence of 3 or more balls of the same color to appear. If so, remove those balls and continue removing any new sequences of 3 or more.
3. Repeat the process until the board is empty or no more balls can be removed.
4. Use memoization to remember already computed results for specific board and hand states to improve efficiency.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def findMinStep(board: str, hand: str) -> int:
    def removeConsecutive(board):
        i = 0
        while i < len(board):
            j = i
            while j < len(board) and board[j] == board[i]: 
                j += 1
            if j - i >= 3:
                return removeConsecutive(board[:i] + board[j:])
            else:
                i = j
        return board

    memo = {}
    
    def dfs(board, hand):
        if not board: # all balls are removed
            return 0
        if not hand: # no more balls in hand to insert
            return float('inf')
        key = (board, hand)
        if key in memo:
            return memo[key]
        
        ans = float('inf')
        n = len(board)
        for i in range(len(hand)):
            for j in range(n):
                if j > 0 and board[j] == board[j - 1]:
                    continue
                new_board = removeConsecutive(board[:j] + hand[i] + board[j:])
                new_hand = hand[:i] + hand[i + 1:]
                ans = min(ans, 1 + dfs(new_board, new_hand))
        memo[key] = ans
        return ans
    
    result = dfs(board, hand)
    return -1 if result == float('inf') else result

# Example usage
board = "WRRBBW"
hand = "RB"
print(findMinStep(board, hand))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation
1. **removeConsecutive(board)**: This helper function will recursively remove consecutive sequences of 3 or more balls on the board.
2. **dfs(board, hand)**: This function performs a depth-first search to try every possible insertion of balls from the hand into the board.
    - If the board is empty, it means all balls are removed (`return 0`).
    - If the hand is empty and the board is not, return infinity means no solution from this path.
    - For every possible insertion, update the board and hand, and recursively call the DFS function.
    - Memoize the results to avoid recomputation.
3. **findMinStep(board, hand)**: This is the main function that initializes the memo dictionary and calls the DFS function. The result is adjusted for the case when no solution is found.

## Time Complexity
The complexity is primarily driven by the recursive DFS calls. In the worst case, it can be exponential, but memoization helps reduce redundant computations. Exact complexity is hard to define but the solution attempts to manage feasible bounds within practical input sizes.
