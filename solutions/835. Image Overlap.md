title:  Image Overlap-out
permalink: /s835
---
You are given two binary matrices `img1` and `img2` of size `n x n`. The overlap of one binary matrix on another is defined as the number of positions that have a 1 in both matrices.

In other words, we translate one matrix over the other, and the overlap is the count of positions where both matrices have a 1.

Your task is to find the largest possible overlap of these two matrices.

**Example:**
```
Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],
               [0,1,0],
               [0,1,0]], 
       img2 = [[0,0,0],
               [0,1,1],
               [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == img1.length == img1[i].length`
- `n == img2.length == img2[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 30`
- `img1[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `img2[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Should we consider shifting in all four directions (up, down, left, right)?**
   - Yes, you should consider all possible shifts of one matrix over another.
2. **Do we count overlap for positions that go out of bounds of the matrices?**
   - No, only consider valid positions that remain within the bounds of the matrices.
3. **Should matrices be flexible to rotate or flip over?**
   - No, only translations (shifts) are allowed.

## Strategy
1. **Brute-force Approach:**
   - For all possible translations (shifts) of `img1` over `img2` in vertical and horizontal directions:
     - Calculate the overlap for each translation.
     - Keep track of the maximum overlap encountered.

When `img1` shifts over `img2`, both matrices should be compared within the boundaries (i.e., do not consider regions that go out of bounds).

## Code
Here's the brute-force approach to solving this problem:

```python
def largestOverlap(img1, img2):
    def shift_and_count(x_shift, y_shift, M, R):
        n = len(M)
        count = 0
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(n):
                if 0 <= r + y_shift < n and 0 <= c + x_shift < n:
                    if M[r][c] == 1 and R[r + y_shift][c + x_shift] == 1:
                        count += 1
        return count
    
    n = len(img1)
    max_overlaps = 0
    
    for y_shift in range(-n + 1, n):
        for x_shift in range(-n + 1, n):
            max_overlaps = max(max_overlaps, shift_and_count(x_shift, y_shift, img1, img2))
            max_overlaps = max(max_overlaps, shift_and_count(x_shift, y_shift, img2, img1))
            
    return max_overlaps
```

## Time Complexity
- There are `2 * (2n-1) * (2n-1)` shifts to consider (since we check both `img1` over `img2` and `img2` over `img1`).
- For each shift, we need to check the entire matrix, which requires an `O(n^2)` operation.
- Thus, the time complexity is `O(n^4)`.

This brute-force approach is efficient given the constraint that `1 <= n <= 30`.
