title:  Excel Sheet Column Number-out
permalink: /s171
---

You are given a string `columnTitle` that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:
```
  A -> 1
  B -> 2
  C -> 3
  ...
  Z -> 26
  AA -> 27
  AB -> 28 
  ...
```
You need to return the corresponding column number.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: columnTitle = "A"
Output: 1

Input: columnTitle = "AB"
Output: 28

Input: columnTitle = "ZY"
Output: 701
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= columnTitle.length <= 7`
- `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.
- `columnTitle` is always a valid Excel column title.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will `columnTitle` always be a non-empty string?
   - Yes, according to the constraints, the minimum length is 1.

2. Can we assume all inputs are valid Excel column titles?
   - Yes, the constraints guarantee valid titles consisting of only uppercase letters.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can consider the string as if it were a number in base-26, where 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., and 'Z' to 26. 

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initialize a `result` variable to 0.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
3. For each character, convert it to its corresponding number using the formula: `ord(character) - ord('A') + 1`.
4. Accumulate this number into `result` by repeatedly multiplying the current `result` by 26 (like shifting digits left in decimal system) and adding the new value.

### Example Walkthrough:
For "AB", we compute it as follows:
- Start with result = 0.
- For 'A' (first character): `ord('A') - ord('A') + 1 = 1`
  Update `result`: `result = 0 * 26 + 1 = 1`
- For 'B' (second character): `ord('B') - ord('A') + 1 = 2`
  Update `result`: `result = 1 * 26 + 2 = 28`
- Final result is 28.


## Code

```python
def titleToNumber(columnTitle: str) -> int:
    result = 0
    for char in columnTitle:
        result = result * 26 + (ord(char) - ord('A') + 1)
    return result

# Test cases
print(titleToNumber("A"))   # Output: 1
print(titleToNumber("AB"))  # Output: 28
print(titleToNumber("ZY"))  # Output: 701
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `columnTitle`. This is because we only traverse the string once, performing constant time operations for each character.
