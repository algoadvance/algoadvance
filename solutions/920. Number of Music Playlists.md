### Problem Statement
You are creating a playlist of exactly `goal` songs using `n` different songs. The playlist must satisfy the following conditions:
1. Every song is played at least once.
2. A song can only be repeated if at least `k` other songs have been played since it was last played.

Return the number of possible playlists. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `n` be greater than `goal`?
   - No, because it's given that every song should be played at least once.
   
2. What are the constraints on `n`, `goal`, and `k`?
   - `1 <= n <= goal <= 100`
   - `0 <= k < n`

### Strategy
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Let's define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:
- `i` represents the number of different songs used.
- `j` represents the length of the playlist.

The state transition involves:
1. Adding a new song which hasn't been added before.
2. Repeating a song that has already been added, but ensuring that `k` other songs have been added since it was last played.

The recursion relation will be:
- To form a playlist of length `j` using `i` songs:
  ```python
  dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] * (n - (i-1))  # using a new song
           + dp[i][j-1] * (i - k) if i > k else 0  # repeating a song with enough gap
  ```

### Initial Setup
- `dp[0][0] = 1` since an empty playlist of length 0 with 0 songs has exactly one way.
- For other values, initialize to 0.

### Code
```python
def numMusicPlaylists(n: int, goal: int, k: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Initialize 2D DP table with dimensions (n + 1) x (goal + 1)
    dp = [[0] * (goal + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case: 1 way to create a playlist of length 0 with 0 songs
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    for j in range(1, goal + 1):
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Option 1: Add a new unique song which hasn't been used in the current i songs
            dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1] * (n - (i-1))
            
            # Option 2: Repeat an already used song ensuring distance constraint of k
            if i > k:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1] * (i - k)
            
            dp[i][j] %= MOD

    return dp[n][goal]

# Example usage
print(numMusicPlaylists(3, 3, 1))  # Output: 6
print(numMusicPlaylists(2, 3, 0))  # Output: 6
print(numMusicPlaylists(2, 3, 1))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * goal)`, where `n` and `goal` can go up to 100. This is acceptable within the given constraints.
- Space complexity is also `O(n * goal)` due to the DP table used.
