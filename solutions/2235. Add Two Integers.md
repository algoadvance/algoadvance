title:  Add Two Integers-out
permalink: /s2235

The problem "2235. Add Two Integers" requires you to write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

### Clarifying Questions
Since the problem is straightforward, the following clarifications ensure completeness:
1. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints on the range of integers? (Typically, this would be the standard integer range in Python, but confirming constraints can be useful.)
2. **Output Type**: Should the function always return an integer?
3. **Handling Exceptions**: Should we handle cases where the inputs aren't integers, or can we assume they will always be integers?

### Code
Below is a simple implementation of the function to add two integers:

```python
def sum_two_integers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# Example Usage
result = sum_two_integers(5, 3) 
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Strategy
1. **Input Verification**: Assuming the inputs are always integers allows skipping explicit type checks.
2. **Summation**: Use the `+` operator to sum the two integers and return the result.
3. **Testing**: Include some example cases for verification.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this function is **O(1)**:
- **Constant Time Operation**: Adding two integers is a basic arithmetic operation that takes constant time.

This simplicity ensures efficiency and effectiveness for the given problem.
