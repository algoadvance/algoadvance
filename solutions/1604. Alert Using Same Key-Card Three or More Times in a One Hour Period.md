Leetcode 1604 - Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period

You are given a list of strings `keyName` and `keyTime` where `keyName[i]` is the name of the person who used the key-card at time `keyTime[i]`.

`keyTime` is in the format "HH:MM", and an alert will be generated if any employee uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.

Return a list of unique employee names who received an alert. The output list should be sorted in ascending order by employee names.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `keyName` and `keyTime` arrays always of the same length?**
   * Yes, they both have the same length.
2. **Is the input guaranteed to be valid (i.e., times are in "HH:MM" format and sorted in any specific order)?**
   * Yes, the format is guaranteed to be "HH:MM", but the times are not guaranteed to be sorted.
3. **Can there be multiple entries for the same employee at the exact same time?**
   * No, there won't be any duplicate entries with the same time for the same person.

### Strategy

1. **Parsing Input:** We'll convert the `keyTime` strings into minutes from midnight for easier comparison.
2. **Grouping by Name:** We'll use a dictionary to group all time entries by each employee.
3. **Sorting Times:** For each employee, we'll sort the times in ascending order.
4. **Sliding Window:** Check for any three consecutive times within a 60-minute window using a sliding window (or a two-pointer) technique.
5. **Collect Alerts:** Track employees who meet the criteria and return their names sorted.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import insort

def convert_to_minutes(time: str) -> int:
    """Converts HH:MM time format to minutes from midnight."""
    hours, minutes = map(int, time.split(":"))
    return hours * 60 + minutes

def alertNames(keyName, keyTime):
    # Dictionary to store the access times for each user
    access_dict = defaultdict(list)

    # Populate the dictionary with times converted to minutes
    for name, time in zip(keyName, keyTime):
        minutes = convert_to_minutes(time)
        access_dict[name].append(minutes)

    alerted_users = []

    # Check each user's access times
    for name, times in access_dict.items():
        # Sort the times for the user
        times.sort()
        # Check for any 3 consecutive times within a 1 hour window
        for i in range(len(times) - 2):
            if times[i + 2] - times[i] <= 60:
                alerted_users.append(name)
                break

    # Return the list of users in alphabetical order
    return sorted(alerted_users)

# Example usage
keyName = ["daniel","daniel","daniel","luis","luis","luis","luis"]
keyTime = ["10:00","10:40","11:00","09:00","09:05","09:10","09:15"]

print(alertNames(keyName, keyTime))  # Output: ["daniel","luis"]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Parsing Input:** O(N) where N is the length of `keyName` and `keyTime`.
- **Grouping by Name:** O(N) for inserting into the dictionary.
- **Sorting times for each user:** O(M log M) where M is the number of times for each user.
- **Checking Alerts:** O(M) per user for the sliding window check.

Summarizing:
- **Overall Complexity:** If we consider the worst-case scenario where each user uses the card multiple times, it would be close to O(N log N) due to the sorting step, as N is the total number of accesses.

This solution effectively handles the problem by leveraging efficient data structures and sorting to ensure that we can check for the conditions in a timely manner.
