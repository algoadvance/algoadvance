title:  Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label-out
permalink: /s1519
---
You are given a tree (an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. The root of the tree is the node `0`, and each node has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string `labels` (with `labels[i]` being the label of the `i-th` node).

The tree is represented by a `0-indexed` array `edges` of size `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `i-th` node which have the same label as node `i`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume the input edges to be valid, meaning forming a valid tree and always connecting valid node indices?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the tree, specifically the upper bound for `n`?
3. Is it safe to assume that the graph is always properly connected and contains no cycles?

## Strategy
To solve the problem effectively:
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list for easier traversal.
2. **DFS Traversal**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count labels in each subtree.
3. **Backtracking**: Maintain a count of labels as we backtrack through the DFS to compute the results.

**Steps**:
1. Create an adjacency list from the edge list.
2. Use a DFS function to traverse through the tree, starting from the root node `0`.
3. During DFS traversal, maintain a counter for occurrences of each label within the subtree.
4. Populate the result array based on the label occurrences counted during the DFS traversal.

## Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def countSubTrees(n, edges, labels):
    # Create adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
        
    # Result array
    result = [0] * n
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        # Create a counter for current subtree
        counter = Counter()
        label = labels[node]
        counter[label] += 1
        
        # Perform DFS
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == parent:
                continue
            child_counter = dfs(neighbor, node)
            counter += child_counter
        
        # Result for the current node
        result[node] = counter[label]
        return counter
    
    # Start DFS from the root node 0
    dfs(0, -1)
    return result
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. We visit each node exactly once during the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the adjacency list and the result array. The extra space used by the counter in each DFS call stack frame is bounded by the number of nodes.

This strategy ensures an efficient traversal and calculation of subtree label counts using DFS and backtracking.
