title:  Detonate the Maximum Bombs-out
permalink: /s2101
---

You are given a list of `bombs` where `bombs[i] = [xi, yi, ri]` denotes the coordinates `(xi, yi)` of the ith bomb and its range `ri`. When a bomb is detonated, it will detonate all bombs that are within its range. These bombs will also detonate bombs in their range. Your task is to determine the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you can choose one bomb to detonate initially.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the number of bombs and their range?
   - Are there any particular constraints on the coordinates of the bombs (e.g., limited to positive integers)?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return just the maximum number of bombs detonated, or any additional information such as the indices of the bombs detonated?

Once these clarifications are confirmed, we can proceed to solve the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Treat each bomb as a node in a graph.
   - Create a directed edge from bomb A to bomb B if bomb B lies within the range of bomb A.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Use DFS from each bomb to determine the number of bombs it can detonate directly or indirectly.
   - Track the maximum number of bombs detonated starting from any bomb.

### Code Implementation

First, we will check if a bomb can detonate another bomb using the distance formula. Then represent the problem as a graph and use DFS to find the maximum bombs that can be detonated.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import math

def maximumDetonation(bombs):
    def can_detonate(b1, b2):
        x1, y1, r1 = bombs[b1]
        x2, y2 = bombs[b2]
        return (x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2 <= r1 ** 2

    n = len(bombs)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Build the graph
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and can_detonate(i, j):
                graph[i].append(j)

    # Perform DFS to find the maximum reachable bombs from each bomb
    def dfs(node, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor, visited)
        return visited

    max_detonated = 0
    for i in range(n):
        visited = dfs(i, set())
        max_detonated = max(max_detonated, len(visited))

    return max_detonated

# Example usage:
bombs = [[2, 1, 3], [6, 1, 4]]
print(maximumDetonation(bombs))  # Output should be the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - We check each pair of bombs to determine if there should be a directed edge.
   - Time complexity: \( O(n^2) \) where \( n \) is the number of bombs.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - For each bomb, we may visit all bombs, leading to another \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n^2) \). Given the constraints are moderate, this approach should work efficiently.
