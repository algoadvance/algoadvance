title:  Median of Two Sorted Arrays-out
permalink: /s4
---

The problem "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" is defined as follows:

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run-time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```

Constraints:
- nums1.length == m
- nums2.length == n
- 0 <= m <= 1000
- 0 <= n <= 1000
- 1 <= m + n <= 2000
- -10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the arrays guaranteed to be sorted?**
   - Yes, both input arrays are sorted.
   
2. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - Yes, one of the arrays can be empty but not both simultaneously.

3. **What should be the output format for the median?**
   - The median should be returned as a float.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach on Smaller Array:**
   - Since the overall time complexity is required to be O(log (m+n)), a brute force solution that involves merging both arrays then finding the median would not be efficient enough.
   - Instead, we'll perform a binary search on one of the arrays to find the correct partition point such that the combined median can be derived directly.

2. **Partitioning Logic:**
   - We attempt to partition both arrays such that elements on the left side of the partitions are less than or equal to elements on the right side.
   - Use binary search on the smaller array to efficiently find the partition index that satisfies the above condition.
   
3. **Median Calculation:**
   - Depending on the combined length (odd or even), we calculate the median differently.
   - If the combined length is odd, the median is the maximum of the left partition elements.
   - If even, it is the average of the maximum of the left partition elements and the minimum of the right partition elements.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1: [int], nums2: [int]) -> float:
    # Ensure nums1 is always the smaller array
    if len(nums1) > len(nums2):
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    imin, imax, half_len = 0, m, (m + n + 1) // 2
    
    while imin <= imax:
        i = (imin + imax) // 2
        j = half_len - i
        
        if i < m and nums1[i] < nums2[j - 1]:
            imin = i + 1  # i is too small
        elif i > 0 and nums1[i - 1] > nums2[j]:
            imax = i - 1  # i is too big
        else:
            # i is perfect
            
            if i == 0: 
                max_of_left = nums2[j - 1]
            elif j == 0: 
                max_of_left = nums1[i - 1]
            else: 
                max_of_left = max(nums1[i - 1], nums2[j - 1])
            
            if (m + n) % 2 == 1:
                return float(max_of_left)
            
            if i == m: 
                min_of_right = nums2[j]
            elif j == n: 
                min_of_right = nums1[i]
            else: 
                min_of_right = min(nums1[i], nums2[j])
            
            return (max_of_left + min_of_right) / 2.0

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1,3]
nums2 = [2]
print(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2.0

nums1 = [1,2]
nums2 = [3,4]
print(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2.5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Time Complexity:** O(log(min(m, n)))
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(log (m+n))

This approach ensures that we perform a binary search on the smaller of the two arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`), leading to the logarithmic time complexity required.
