You are given an array of strings. A string A is a subsequence of another string B if A can be obtained from B by deleting some (or no) characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. You need to perform the following tasks:

1. Determine the maximum size of a group of strings where each string is a subsequence of every other string in the group.
2. Determine the total number of such groups in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can a string be a member of more than one group?
   **A**: No, as per the problem, each string can belong to exactly one group.

2. **Q**: Can we assume that all strings contain only lowercase letters?
   **A**: Yes, for simplicity, we can assume that all strings consist of lowercase letters only.

3. **Q**: How large can the array of strings be?
   **A**: Each string can be up to 100 characters long, and the total number of strings can be up to 10^4.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: We represent each string as a node in a graph.
2. **Edges**: There is an edge from node A to node B if A is a subsequence of B.
3. **Connected Components**: Use BFS/DFS to find connected components in the graph. Each connected component will be a group of strings where each string is a subsequence of every other string in the group.
4. **Group Size**: For each connected component, determine its size.
5. **Distinct Groups**: Count the total number of distinct connected components.

### Code

Let's implement the solution step-by-step:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Helper function to determine if A is a subsequence of B
def is_subsequence(A, B):
    it = iter(B)
    return all(char in it for char in A)

def groups_of_strings(strings):
    # Graph construction based on subsequences
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    n = len(strings)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and is_subsequence(strings[i], strings[j]):
                graph[strings[i]].append(strings[j])
                graph[strings[j]].append(strings[i])
    
    visited = set()
    
    def bfs(start_node):
        queue = deque([start_node])
        visited.add(start_node)
        size = 0
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            size += 1
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return size
    
    max_group_size = 0
    num_groups = 0
    
    for string in strings:
        if string not in visited:
            group_size = bfs(string)
            max_group_size = max(max_group_size, group_size)
            num_groups += 1
    
    return max_group_size, num_groups

# Example Usage
strings = ["abc", "ab", "bc", "b"]
max_size, total_groups = groups_of_strings(strings)
print(f"Maximum group size: {max_size}")
print(f"Total number of groups: {total_groups}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction**: We construct the graph where each node represents a string and an edge connects two nodes if one string is a subsequence of the other.
2. **BFS for Connected Components**: We use BFS to explore each connected component starting from unvisited nodes, counting the size of each component.
3. **Tracking Groups**: We keep track of the maximum group size and the total number of groups.

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the number of strings and \(k\) is the average length of the strings (comparing each pair of strings takes \(O(k)\)).
- **BFS Traversal**: \(O(n + E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Overall**: The time complexity is approximately \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\), which should be manageable given the constraints (with \(n\) up to \(10^4\) and \(k\) up to 100).

This approach should solve the problem efficiently for the given constraints.
