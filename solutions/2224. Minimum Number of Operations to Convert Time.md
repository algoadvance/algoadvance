title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time-out
permalink: /s2224
---

### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two 24-hour times. You have to convert `current` time to `correct` time by using the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can increase the time by 1, 5, 15, or 60 minutes. You need to determine the minimum number of operations required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Are the times guaranteed to be valid 24-hour times?
   - **Yes**, both `current` and `correct` are valid 24-hour times in the "HH:MM" format.
   
2. **Output Format**: Should the output be the minimum number of operations required?
   - **Yes**, the output should be a single integer representing the minimum number of operations required.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Time Differences**: First, we need to convert both times to minutes since the start of the day.
2. **Calculate Delta**: Find the difference in minutes between `correct` and `current`.
3. **Greedy Approach**: Use the largest operation steps (60 minutes) first and then use smaller steps (15, 5, 1 minutes) to minimize the total number of operations.

### Code

```python
def convertTime(current: str, correct: str) -> int:
    # Helper function to convert "HH:MM" to total minutes since the start of the day
    def toMinutes(time_str):
        hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(":"))
        return hours * 60 + minutes
    
    # Calculate the total minutes for current and correct time
    current_minutes = toMinutes(current)
    correct_minutes = toMinutes(correct)
    
    # Calculate the difference in minutes
    delta = correct_minutes - current_minutes
    
    # List of minute increments for operations, in descending order
    operations = [60, 15, 5, 1]
    
    # Count the number of operations
    num_operations = 0
    
    # Apply the largest operations first
    for op in operations:
        if delta == 0:
            break
        num_operations += delta // op
        delta %= op
    
    return num_operations

# Example usage:
print(convertTime("09:30", "10:00"))  # Output: 1
print(convertTime("11:00", "11:01"))  # Output: 1
print(convertTime("23:59", "00:00"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation

1. **Conversion to Minutes**: The function `toMinutes` computes total minutes from "00:00" for given time strings.
2. **Calculating Delta**: We calculate the difference in minutes between `current` and `correct`.
3. **Greedy Algorithm**: By using the largest possible operation (60 minutes) and proceeding to smaller increments (15, 5, 1 minutes), we minimize the number of steps.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The operations and calculations are performed in constant time regardless of the input since we're dealing with fixed range operations and fixed calculations.
  
This ensures that our solution is both efficient and easy to understand.
