title:  Total Cost to Hire K Workers-out
permalink: /s2462
---
You are given a list `costs` where `costs[i]` represents the cost of hiring the i-th worker. Additionally, you need to hire exactly `k` workers. However, you can only hire workers consecutively from the beginning or the end of the list. In simpler terms, for each worker you hire, you must either pick the first worker in the remaining group or the last worker in the remaining group.

The goal is to minimize the total cost of hiring the `k` workers.

Write a function `totalCost(costs, k)` that takes in a list of integers `costs` and an integer `k`, and returns the minimum total cost needed to hire exactly `k` workers.

Example:
```
Input: costs = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], k = 2
Output: 30
Explanation: The optimal solution is to hire the 1st and 2nd workers with a total cost of 10 + 20 = 30.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the costs always positive integers?**
    - Yes, you can assume all costs are positive integers.
2. **Can the number of workers `k` be larger than the length of the list `costs`?**
    - No, you can assume `k` is always less than or equal to the length of the list `costs`.
3. **What should be returned if `k` is 0?**
    - Return 0 since no workers need to be hired.

## Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Use a two-pointer approach to represent the range of workers available for hiring.
2. Maintain a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently find and hire the worker with the minimum cost from the available range.
3. Initialize the two pointers at the ends of the list.
4. For each of the k workers to be hired, compare the costs at the left and right ends of the current range, pick the worker with the lesser cost, and move the corresponding pointer inward.
5. Accumulate the total cost and return it after hiring `k` workers.

## Code
```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush

def totalCost(costs, k):
    if k == 0:
        return 0

    min_heap = []
    left, right = 0, len(costs) - 1
    
    # Initial push to the heap for the first k elements from both ends
    while len(min_heap) < k and left <= right:
        heappush(min_heap, (costs[left], left))
        left += 1
        
        if left <= right:
            heappush(min_heap, (costs[right], right))
            right -= 1
    
    total_cost = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        cost, index = heappop(min_heap)
        total_cost += cost
        
        # Push the next element from the corresponding end
        if index <= left and left <= right:
            heappush(min_heap, (costs[left], left))
            left += 1
        elif index >= right and left <= right:
            heappush(min_heap, (costs[right], right))
            right -= 1
    
    return total_cost

# Example usage:
costs = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
k = 2
print(totalCost(costs, k))  # Output: 30
```

## Time Complexity
- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion or extraction from the heap costs O(log k).
- **Push Elements into Heap**: Initially, we push at most 2k elements into the heapâ€”this operation is bounded by O(k log k) time.
- **Extraction and Accumulation**: We extract k elements, each extraction taking O(log k).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(k log k)**.
