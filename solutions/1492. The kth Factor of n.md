LeetCode Problem: 1492. The kth Factor of n

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, you need to return the `k`-th factor of `n`. A factor of `n` is an integer `i` where `n % i == 0`. If there are fewer than `k` factors, return `-1`.

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `n = 12, k = 3`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** The factors of 12 are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`. The 3rd factor is `3`.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `n = 7, k = 2`
- **Output:** `7`
- **Explanation:** The factors of 7 are `1, 7`. The 2nd factor is `7`.

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `n = 4, k = 4`
- **Output:** `-1`
- **Explanation:** The factors of 4 are `1, 2, 4`. There is no 4th factor.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of values for `n` and `k`?
   - **A:** Typically, `n` can range from \( 1 \) to \( 10^4 \), and `k` can also range from \( 1 \) to a value that could be equal to or greater than the number of factors of `n`.

2. **Q:** Should we consider negative factors?
   - **A:** No, only positive factors are considered.

3. **Q:** Is it necessary to maintain the order of factors?
   - **A:** Yes, factors should be considered in ascending order.

### Strategy

To find the k-th factor of `n`, follow this approach:
1. Iterate through all numbers from `1` to `n` to see if they are factors of `n`.
2. Maintain a count of factors found.
3. When the `k`-th factor is found, return it immediately.
4. If fewer than `k` factors are found by the end of the loop, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** since we iterate through all numbers from `1` to `n`.

### Code

```python
def kthFactor(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if count == k:
                return i
    return -1
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. Initialize a counter `count` to `0`.
2. Loop through numbers `i` from `1` to `n`:
   - Check if `i` is a factor of `n` (`n % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a factor, increment the `count`.
   - If `count` matches `k`, return the current number `i`.
3. If no `k`-th factor is found by the end of the loop, return `-1`.

This code ensures that we find the k-th factor in ascending order efficiently.
