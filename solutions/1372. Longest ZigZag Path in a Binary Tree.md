title:  Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1372
---
You are given a binary tree root node. Your task is to find the longest ZigZag path in the binary tree. A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as a sequence of nodes where each parent-child relationship changes direction between left and right.

Return the length of the longest ZigZag path.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there an upper limit to the number of nodes in the binary tree?**
   The problem constraints typically include up to 10^4 nodes for problems like these.

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   Yes, the tree can be empty. If the tree is empty, the length of the longest ZigZag path should be 0.

3. **What is the definition of path length?**
   The length of the path is defined by the number of edges in the sequence.

## Strategy
We need to traverse the binary tree and check the length of the ZigZag paths at each node. To do this, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore each node and its left and right children, while maintaining a direction tracker.

We'll track the maximum ZigZag length using a helper function that considers:
1. The current node.
2. The current length of the path.
3. The direction of the last movement (left or right).

We'll consider two main cases for every node:
1. If we move to the left child, the next move should be to the right child.
2. If we move to the right child, the next move should be to the left child.

The DFS will be initiated twice with directions (left first, right first) to ensure we capture all potential ZigZag paths.

## Code
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
# Define TreeNode according to the given constraints
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right


def longestZigZag(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def dfs(node, direction, length):
        nonlocal max_length
        if node is None:
            return
        max_length = max(max_length, length)
        if direction == 'left':
            dfs(node.left, 'left', 1)  # Start new zigzag path if went to the same direction
            dfs(node.right, 'right', length + 1)
        else:  # direction == 'right'
            dfs(node.left, 'left', length + 1)
            dfs(node.right, 'right', 1)  # Start new zigzag path if went to the same direction

    max_length = 0
    if root:
        dfs(root.left, 'left', 1)  # Start by moving to the left child
        dfs(root.right, 'right', 1)  # Start by moving to the right child
    return max_length
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once in our DFS traversal.

The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the binary tree. This is due to the recursion stack used in the DFS traversal, which, in the worst case of an unbalanced tree, can go up to the height of the tree. In a balanced tree, the height is \(O(\log N)\).
