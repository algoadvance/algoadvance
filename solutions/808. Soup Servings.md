title:  Soup Servings-out

---
There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially, we have `N` ml of each type of soup. There are four kinds of serving operations:

1. Serve 100 ml of both type A and type B soup.
2. Serve 75 ml of type A and 25 ml of type B soup.
3. Serve 50 ml of type A and 50 ml of type B soup.
4. Serve 25 ml of type A and 75 ml of type B soup.

We need to calculate the probability that soup type A will be empty first, plus half the probability that both types of soup will be empty at the same time. Given `N`, return this probability. If `N` is very large, you can assume the probability approaches 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should the range of `N` be?**
   - `N` is a non-negative integer. The problem typically considers large values of `N` to see how the probability asymptotes to 1.
   
2. **Is there any constraint on the precision of the output?**
   - The expected answer should be a floating-point number with reasonable precision for probability values (e.g., up to six decimal places).

3. **Should we consider the memoization technique or a recursive approach?**
   - Given the structure and the need for repeated calculations, memoization or dynamic programming would be beneficial for higher efficiency.

### Strategy

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `N` is larger than a certain threshold (one could choose 4800 based on the nature of the problem), return 1 directly.
   
2. **Recursive Relation with Memoization**:
   - Use recursion to break down the problem. Calculate the probabilities using the given serving operations and utilize memoization to avoid redundant computations.
   
3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - For each operation, calculate the resultant state and recursively compute the probability of that state. Sum up these probabilities accordingly:
     - Probability of only A getting empty first.
     - Probability of both A and B getting empty at the same time.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems to save computation time.

### Code

```python
def soupServings(N: int) -> float:
    if N > 4800:
        return 1.0

    # Scaling down N by a factor of 25 to simplify the problem
    N = (N + 24) // 25
    
    memo = {}

    def dp(a, b):
        if a <= 0 and b <= 0:
            return 0.5
        if a <= 0:
            return 1.0
        if b <= 0:
            return 0.0
        if (a, b) in memo:
            return memo[(a, b)]

        memo[(a, b)] = 0.25 * (dp(a - 4, b) + dp(a - 3, b - 1) +
                               dp(a - 2, b - 2) + dp(a - 1, b - 3))
        return memo[(a, b)]

    return dp(N, N)

# Example Usage:
N = 50
print(soupServings(N))  # Expected Output based on the given value of N
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is approximately `O(N^2)`, where `N` is the scaled-down value of the initial volume of soup. However, the memoization approach ensures that each state is computed only once, making the solution efficient even for relatively large values of `N`.

### Explanation
1. **Scaling**:
   - We scale `N` down by rounding it to the nearest multiple of 25 to reduce the state space.
   
2. **Memoization**:
   - The dictionary `memo` helps in storing the probability values for each state `(a, b)` to avoid redundant recursive calls.

3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For each possible serving operation, the resultant state is computed, and its probability is summed up to derive the final probability value for the given state `(a, b)`.
