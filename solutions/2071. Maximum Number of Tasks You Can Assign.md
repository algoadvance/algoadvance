title:  Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign-out
permalink: /s2071
---

You are given two integers `n` and `m` representing the number of workers and tasks, respectively. You are also given an integer array `workers` of length `n` where `workers[i]` denotes the strength of the ith worker, an integer array `tasks` of length `m` where `tasks[j]` denotes the strength required to complete the jth task, and an integer integer `p` which denotes the limit on strength upgrades you can perform.

Each strength upgrade can be used on a worker to increase their strength by 1 for a task.

You are to return the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to the workers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the tasks and workers guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, both tasks and workers' strengths are positive integers.
   
2. **Can a worker be assigned to more than one task?**
   - No, each worker can be assigned to at most one task.
   
3. **Is it possible that `n` or `m` could be zero?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that `n` and `m` are non-zero.

4. **Does `p` represent a cumulative increase or can it be split among workers?**
   - `p` is a total limit, so it can be distributed across tasks in any manner but the cumulative additional strength cannot exceed `p`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Arrays**:
   - Sort the `tasks` and `workers` arrays to make assignment easier.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers to assign workers to tasks:
     - Start with the strongest workers and the most demanding tasks.
     - Move two pointers: one for tasks and one for workers.
   
3. **Greedy Approach with Upgrades**:
   - First try to assign tasks with the current strength of the workers.
   - If a task cannot be met, use the upgrade points sparingly to meet the requirements.
   - Use a heap to manage allocation of resources efficiently.

4. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to determine the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned given the constraints.

### Code

```python
def maxTaskAssign(tasks, workers, p):
    tasks.sort()
    workers.sort()
    
    def canAssign(k):
        extra_power = p
        task_pointer = k - 1
        
        for i in range(len(workers) - 1, len(workers) - 1 - k, -1):
            if workers[i] >= tasks[task_pointer]:
                task_pointer -= 1
            elif extra_power >= (tasks[task_pointer] - workers[i]):
                extra_power -= (tasks[task_pointer] - workers[i])
                task_pointer -= 1
            else:
                return False
        
        return True
    
    left, right = 0, min(len(tasks), len(workers))
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if canAssign(mid):
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return left

# Example Usage
tasks = [2, 2, 2]
workers = [1, 2, 3]
p = 1

print(maxTaskAssign(tasks, workers, p))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting workers: \(O(n \log n)\)
   - Sorting tasks: \(O(m \log m)\)
   
2. **Binary search iterations**:
   - Binary search over \(O(\min(n, m))\) elements.
   
3. **Checking feasibility (canAssign)**:
   - Each feasibility check requires \(O(k)\), and the number of feasibility checks is \(O(\log(\min(n, m)))\)

Thus, overall time complexity is \(O((n + m) \log (n + m))\).

This approach ensures that we can efficiently find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to the workers using the given strength upgrades.
