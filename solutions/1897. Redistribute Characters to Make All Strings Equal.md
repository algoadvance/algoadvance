title:  Redistribute Characters to Make All Strings Equal-out
permalink: /s1897
---

Given an array of strings `words`, return `true` if you can make all strings in `words` equal using the characters of `words` and `false` otherwise.

**Example:**
```
Input: words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
Output: true
Explanation: Put all the characters in a pool, that is "abc" + "aabc" + "bc" = "aaabbbc".
Then we can use the characters to create "abc", "abc", and "abc".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does it mean to make all strings equal?**
   - It means after redistributing all characters, each word in the list should end up as the same string.
  
2. **Can the strings contain any characters?**
   - For simplicity, we assume lower-case alphabets only.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - Return `true` if it's possible to redistribute the characters to make all strings in the list identical, otherwise `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Characters:** 
   - We will count the frequency of each character across all strings.
   
2. **Checking Divisibility:** 
   - For each character that appears, its total count should be divisible by the length of the list `words`. If all characters satisfy this condition, then it's possible to redistribute them equally, otherwise, it's not.

### Code

```python
def make_equal(words):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each character in all strings combined
    total_char_count = Counter()
    
    for word in words:
        total_char_count.update(word)
    
    # Check if each character count is divisible by the number of words
    num_words = len(words)
    
    for count in total_char_count.values():
        if count % num_words != 0:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage:
words = ["abc","aabc","bc"]
print(make_equal(words))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies:** 
  - Each string is traversed once to update the `Counter`. If `n` is the total number of characters across all strings and `k` is the number of strings, this step takes `O(n)` time.
  
- **Checking Divisibility:**
  - We iterate over the unique characters (at most 26 for lower-case alphabets), so this takes `O(1)` time in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the total number of characters across all strings. 

### Conclusion

By counting the frequencies of each character and ensuring each character's total count is divisible by the number of strings, we can determine if it is possible to redistribute the characters to make all strings equal. This method ensures efficient processing and checks.
