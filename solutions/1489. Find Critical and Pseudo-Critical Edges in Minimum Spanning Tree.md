title:  Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree-out
permalink: /s1489
---

Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]` represents a weighted edge between the vertices `ai` and `bi`. A subset of edges in a graph is a *Maximum Spanning Tree (MST)* if it's a spanning tree and the sum of its weights is the maximum possible amongst all spanning trees.

Find all critical and pseudo-critical edges in the MST. An edge is critical if its removal causes the weight of the maximum spanning tree to increase. An edge is pseudo-critical if it can appear in some MSTs but it's not necessarily in all of them.

Output an array answer where answer[0] is a list of the critical edges and answer[1] is a list of the pseudo-critical edges.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Structure:**
   - `n`: The number of vertices in the graph.
   - `edges`: A 2D list where each element is a triplet [ai, bi, weighti].

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of vertices?
   - How should self-loops be handled if any exist?
   - What's the maximum number of vertices and edges?

## Strategy

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm:**
   - First, compute the MST using Kruskal's algorithm. This will serve as the baseline weight.

2. **Check for Critical Edges:**
   - Remove each edge in turn and compute the MST without that edge. If the MST's total weight increases or it's impossible to find an MST, this edge is critical.

3. **Check for Pseudo-Critical Edges:**
   - Force each edge to be included in the MST, then compute the rest of the MST. If its total weight equals the weight of the baseline MST, it's a pseudo-critical edge.

4. **Helper functions:**
   - Implement union-find (disjoint set) data structure for Kruskal's algorithm.
   - Functions to find MST without a given edge and with a given edge forced.

## Code

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1

def kruskal(n, edges, ban_edge=-1, include_edge=-1):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    weight_sum = 0
    edge_count = 0
    
    if include_edge >= 0:
        u, v, w = edges[include_edge]
        uf.union(u, v)
        weight_sum += w
        edge_count += 1
    
    for i, (u, v, w) in enumerate(edges):
        if i == ban_edge:
            continue
        if uf.find(u) != uf.find(v):
            uf.union(u, v)
            weight_sum += w
            edge_count += 1
            if edge_count == n - 1:
                break
                
    return weight_sum if edge_count == n - 1 else float('inf')

def findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(n, edges):
    # Assign an index to each edge and sort them by weight
    indexed_edges = [(u, v, w, i) for i, (u, v, w) in enumerate(edges)]
    indexed_edges.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    base_weight = kruskal(n, indexed_edges)
    critical, pseudo_critical = [], []
    
    for i, (u, v, w, idx) in enumerate(indexed_edges):
        # Check if it's a critical edge
        if kruskal(n, indexed_edges, ban_edge=i) > base_weight:
            critical.append(idx)
        # Check if it's a pseudo-critical edge
        elif kruskal(n, indexed_edges, include_edge=i) == base_weight:
            pseudo_critical.append(idx)
    
    return [critical, pseudo_critical]

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [0, 3, 1], [0, 2, 1], [3, 4, 1]]
print(findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(n, edges))  # Outputs the lists of critical and pseudo-critical edges
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm:** O(E log E), where E is the number of edges.
2. **Critical/Pseudo-Critical Check:** For each edge, Kruskal's algorithm is run twice. Thus, final complexity is O(E^2 log E).

Given that we must recompute the MST multiple times, the overall complexity is mainly driven by O(E^2 log E).
