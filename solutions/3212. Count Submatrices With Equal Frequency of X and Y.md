title:  Count Submatrices With Equal Frequency of X and Y-out
permalink: /s3212
---

You are given a matrix of integers and two integers, `X` and `Y`. The task is to count the number of submatrices where the frequency of `X` is equal to the frequency of `Y`. 

For example, given the following matrix:

```
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 2, 1],
    [2, 1, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 2, 2]
]

X = 2
Y = 1
```

The task is to find how many submatrices have an equal frequency of `X` and `Y`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, let's clarify a few details about the problem:
1. What is the size range of the matrix? (e.g., dimensions `m` and `n`)
2. What kind of values can `X` and `Y` take? (e.g., Are they always present in the matrix or can they be absent?)
3. Are negative numbers or zeros allowed in the matrix, or only positive integers?
4. Is the submatrix required to be at least `1x1` in size?

Let's assume reasonable defaults if not specified: the matrix size is manageable within common constraints (say, up to `1000x1000`), `X` and `Y` are positive integers that could be present in the matrix, and negative numbers are allowed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Iterate over each possible submatrix in the given matrix.
2. Track the frequency of `X` and `Y` within each submatrix.
3. Count the submatrices where the frequencies of `X` and `Y` are equal.

Here's the strategy in more detail:

1. **Submatrix Generation**: Enumerate all possible submatrices. This involves iterating over all possible top-left and bottom-right corners of submatrices.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: Calculate the frequency of `X` and `Y` for each submatrix.
3. **Comparison and Count**: Compare the frequencies for each submatrix and maintain a count of submatrices where the frequencies are equal.

Given the problem constraints, a brute-force approach could be too slow. We may need to use a prefix sum or another optimization strategy to efficiently count the frequencies within submatrices.

### Time Complexity

The straightforward brute-force solution would require iterating over all possible submatrices, leading to a time complexity of `O(m^2 * n^2)` for an `m x n` matrix. This will involve examining `O(m^2 * n^2)` submatrices, which could be prohibitive for large matrices. 

### Solution Code

Let's implement a brute-force solution as a starting point and then discuss potential optimizations afterward.

```python
def count_submatrices_with_equal_frequency(matrix, X, Y):
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    count = 0
    
    for top in range(m):
        for left in range(n):
            for bottom in range(top, m):
                for right in range(left, n):
                    freq_X, freq_Y = 0, 0
                    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
                        for j in range(left, right + 1):
                            if matrix[i][j] == X:
                                freq_X += 1
                            elif matrix[i][j] == Y:
                                freq_Y += 1
                    if freq_X == freq_Y:
                        count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 2, 1],
    [2, 1, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 2, 2]
]
X, Y = 2, 1
print(count_submatrices_with_equal_frequency(matrix, X, Y))  # Example output
```

This basic solution achieves the goal but may not be efficient enough for larger matrices. Optimizations could include leveraging prefix sums or more advanced data structures to reduce the number of operations needed to compute the frequency of `X` and `Y` in submatrices.
