title:  Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks-out
permalink: /s2244
---
You are given a list of integers representing the difficulty level of each task. Tasks of the same difficulty level can be grouped together, and you can complete at most `3` tasks or at least `2` tasks of the same difficulty level in one round.

You need to determine the minimum number of rounds required to complete all tasks. If it's not possible to complete all tasks, return `-1`.

### Example
**Input**
```
tasks = [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```
**Output**
```
3
```

### Explanation
- You can complete 2 tasks with difficulty `2` in 1 round.
- You can complete all 3 tasks with difficulty `3` in 1 round.
- You can complete 5 tasks with difficulty `4` in 2 rounds (3+2).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the tasks array be empty? 
   - Yes, an empty array should return `0` since no rounds are needed.
  
2. What is the range of the integers in the tasks list? 
   - There are no explicit constraints mentioned here, so we can assume standard integer ranges in Python.

3. Are there any constraints on the length of the tasks array?
   - No explicit constraints mentioned, assume reasonable sizes for the context of coding interviews (e.g., up to tens of thousands of elements).

## Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each difficulty level.
2. **Calculate Rounds**:
   - Iterate over the frequency dictionary:
     - If a task has a frequency of `1`, itâ€™s impossible to complete (since you need at least 2 tasks to complete in one round).
     - If a task has a frequency that is a multiple of `3`, use `f // 3` rounds.
     - If a task has a frequency that is not a multiple of `3`, check if it can be divided into rounds of 2 and 3 (i.e., `freq % 3 == 1` or `freq % 3 == 2`).

## Code
```python
def minimumRounds(tasks):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count frequency of each task
    freq = Counter(tasks)
    
    rounds = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        if count == 1:
            return -1
        
        if count % 3 == 0:
            rounds += count // 3
        else:
            # group in the number of 3's we can + 1 round of 2 or 2 rounds of 2
            rounds += (count // 3) + 1
            
    return rounds

# Example test case
tasks = [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
print(minimumRounds(tasks))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- **Counting Frequencies**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the tasks array.
- **Calculating Rounds**: `O(m)` where `m` is the number of unique tasks, which in the worst case can be up to `n`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`.

## Space Complexity
- The additional space used is primarily for storing the frequency counts, which is `O(m)` where `m` is the number of unique tasks.
  
Overall, the space complexity is `O(n)` in the worst case if all tasks are unique.
