title:  Maximum Balanced Subsequence Sum-out
permalink: /s2926
---
Given a string `s` consisting of only '(' and ')', find a count of balanced subsequences. A balanced subsequence is one where there is an equal number of opening and closing brackets and each prefix has at least as many opening brackets as closing brackets.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints?**
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
   - Is the string guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output Specification?**
   - Should the count be an integer representing the total number of balanced subsequences?

3. **Handling Edge Cases?**
   - How should we handle strings with no possible balanced subsequences (e.g., ")))((((")?
   
Suppose there is no additional input constraint given and the string length can be reasonably large, though not above typical computational limits for coding competitions.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we need the following strategy:
1. **Count Parentheses:** First, count the total number of opening '(' and closing ')' brackets.
2. **Compute Balance:** The number of balanced subsequences will be determined by the minimum count between opening and closing brackets.

### Code
Let's implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def max_balanced_subseq(s: str) -> int:
    # Step 1: Initialize counters
    open_count = 0
    close_count = 0
    
    # Step 2: Count the number of '(' and ')' in the string
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            open_count += 1
        elif char == ')':
            close_count += 1
            
    # Step 3: The number of balanced subsequences is the minimum of these counts
    return min(open_count, close_count)

# Example Usage
s = "(()))("
print(max_balanced_subseq(s))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This efficiency is achieved since we only make a single pass through the string to count the characters. The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are only using a few integer variables for counting.

This solution ensures we find the maximum number of balanced subsequences efficiently.
