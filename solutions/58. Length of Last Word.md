title:  Length of Last Word-out
permalink: /s58

Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**:
   - Is the string guaranteed to contain at least one word?
     - Yes, at least one word is present in the string.

2. **Whitespace Handling**:
   - How should leading or trailing whitespaces be handled?
     - Leading and trailing whitespaces should be ignored. Only the length of the last word should be considered.

3. **Character Set**:
   - Can the string contain any special characters or should it only contain alphabetic characters?
     - The problem specifies words and spaces, so let's assume it can include other non-space characters too.

4. **Output**:
   - What should be returned if there are no non-space characters in the input string?
     - This scenario does not occur based on the guarantee of at least one word in the string.

### Strategy

1. **Trimming Whitespace**:
   - First, we will strip the trailing whitespace from the string to ensure trailing spaces are not considered.

2. **Splitting the String**:
   - We can then split the trimmed string into words based on spaces.
   - The last element in this list of words will be our last word.

3. **Calculating the Length**:
   - Simply return the length of the last word in the list.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def lengthOfLastWord(s: str) -> int:
    # Strip the trailing whitespace if any
    s = s.rstrip()
    
    # Split the string based on spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # The last word will be the last element in the split list
    last_word = words[-1]
    
    # Return the length of the last word
    return len(last_word)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Trimming**: The `rstrip` method runs in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Splitting**: The `split` method also runs in O(n) time.
- **Length Calculation**: The `len` function runs in O(1) time for a string.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity of the function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
