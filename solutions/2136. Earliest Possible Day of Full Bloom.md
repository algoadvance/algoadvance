title:  Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom-out
permalink: /s2136
---

You have `n` flowers with different bloom and grow times. Each flower can only start to grow after it's been planted. You want to plant the flowers in such a way that the earliest full bloom day is achieved.

Specifically:
- You are given two arrays, `plantTime` and `growTime`, each of size `n`, where `plantTime[i]` is the number of days to plant the i-th flower and `growTime[i]` is the number of days to grow the i-th flower after planting it.
- You can plant one flower at a time, but you canâ€™t wait in between planting two flowers.
- Return the earliest day when all flowers will be in full bloom.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is meant by the full bloom day for a flower?**
   - The full bloom day for a flower is the day when both its planting and growing period are completed.

2. **Are the plantTime and growTime arrays guaranteed to have the same length?**
   - Yes, both arrays have the same length `n`.

3. **What should I return if there are no flowers?**
   - If there are no flowers (`n = 0`), return 0.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we should aim to minimize the latest full bloom day by scheduling flower plants in an optimum order.

1. **Sort the Flowers by Grow Time:**
   - One approach is to prioritize planting flowers with longer grow times earlier because they need more time after planting to bloom.

2. **Calculate Planting Schedule:**
   - Track the current day while planting each flower, updating the current day by adding the plant time of the current flower.
   - For each flower, calculate its full bloom day and keep track of the maximum bloom day encountered.

### Code

```python
def earliestFullBloom(plantTime, growTime):
    flowers = list(zip(growTime, plantTime))
    # Sort by grow time in descending order (greater grow time first)
    flowers.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0])

    current_day = 0
    max_bloom_day = 0

    for grow, plant in flowers:
        current_day += plant
        bloom_day = current_day + grow
        max_bloom_day = max(max_bloom_day, bloom_day)

    return max_bloom_day

# Example Test Case
plantTime = [1, 2, 3, 2]
growTime = [2, 1, 2, 1]
print(earliestFullBloom(plantTime, growTime))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The sorting step takes O(n log n) time where `n` is the number of flowers.
- **Loop through flowers:** This step takes O(n) time.
- Overall Time Complexity: O(n log n), dominated by the sorting step.

### Explanation

1. **Sorting Step:** We sort the flowers based on grow time in descending order to ensure that flowers with a longer growing period get planted as early as possible.

2. **Calculation Step:** We iterate through the sorted list, updating the current day with the planting time of each flower and calculating the bloom day. We keep track of the maximum bloom day to determine the earliest possible day when all flowers will be at full bloom.

This strategy ensures that flowers needing more grow time are prioritized, minimizing the latest blooming day effectively.
