title:  Maximum Sum of Two Non-Overlapping Subarrays-out
permalink: /s1031
---

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `firstLen` and `secondLen`, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays of lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [0,6,5,2,2,5,1,9,4], firstLen = 1, secondLen = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: One choice of subarrays is [9] with length 1, and [6,5] with length 2.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= firstLen, secondLen <= 1000
- firstLen + secondLen <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the subarrays overlap?**
   - No, the subarrays should be non-overlapping.
  
2. **What is the range of the values within the array?**
   - The values within `nums` are between 0 and 1000 inclusive.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. **Compute Prefix Sums:** This will allow for efficient calculation of subarray sums.
2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - Iterate over possible positions where the first subarray (`A`) and the second subarray (`B`) can start.
   - Use sliding windows to determine the maximum sum of the two non-overlapping subarrays.
   - Consider two cases:
     - The first subarray appears before the second subarray.
     - The second subarray appears before the first subarray.
3. **Keep Track of Maximum Sum:** Update and maintain the maximum sum encountered.

The sliding window technique ensures that the two non-overlapping subarrays are considered, and the prefix sum ensures that the subarray sums are computed efficiently.

## Code

```python
def maxSumTwoNoOverlap(nums, firstLen, secondLen):
    def maxSum(arr, L, M):
        n = len(arr)
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + arr[i]
        
        max_L = max_M = 0
        max_sum = 0
        
        for i in range(L + M, n + 1):
            max_L = max(max_L, prefix_sum[i - M] - prefix_sum[i - M - L])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, max_L + prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[i - M])
        
        return max_sum

    return max(maxSum(nums, firstLen, secondLen), maxSum(nums, secondLen, firstLen))

# Example usage:
nums = [0, 6, 5, 2, 2, 5, 1, 9, 4]
firstLen = 1
secondLen = 2
print(maxSumTwoNoOverlap(nums, firstLen, secondLen))  # Output: 20
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we compute the prefix sums in \(O(n)\) and then calculate the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays in another \(O(n)\) pass.
