title:  Maximal Rectangle-out

---

Given a binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Type:** Are the elements in the matrix strings (such as '0' and '1') or integers (such as 0 and 1)? The problem description suggests they are strings.
2. **Empty Matrix:** How should the function handle an empty matrix? Is the output 0 in such cases?
3. **Matrix Dimensions:** Are there any constraints on the dimensions of the matrix (e.g., maximum number of rows and columns)?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach combined with a stack to quickly calculate the maximum rectangle area in a histogram, which can be adapted row by row for this matrix:

1. **Convert Matrix:** Convert the matrix of '0' and '1' strings to a matrix of integers for easier computations.
2. **Histogram Representation:** For each row in the matrix, construct a histogram that represents the heights of stacked 1s up to that row.
3. **Maximal Rectangle in Histogram:** Use a stack to find the maximum rectangle area in this histogram for each row.

Here's the overall plan:

- Initialize a `heights` list of zeroes for the first row.
- For each row in the matrix:
  - Update the `heights` list where each entry in `heights[j]` is the count of consecutive 1s up to the current row.
  - Use the "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" algorithm to find the largest rectangle for that updated histogram and keep track of the maximum area.

### Code

```python
def maximalRectangle(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    m = len(matrix)
    n = len(matrix[0])
    
    # Convert matrix of '0' and '1' strings to integers
    matrix = [[int(matrix[i][j]) for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
    
    max_area = 0
    heights = [0] * n
    
    def largestRectangleArea(heights):
        stack = []
        max_area = 0
        heights.append(0)  # Append a sentinel value to handle remaining items in stack
        
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            while stack and heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
                h = heights[stack.pop()]
                w = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
            stack.append(i)
        
        heights.pop()  # Remove the sentinel value
        return max_area
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                heights[j] += 1
            else:
                heights[j] = 0
        
        max_area = max(max_area, largestRectangleArea(heights))
    
    return max_area

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    ["1","0","1","0","0"],
    ["1","0","1","1","1"],
    ["1","1","1","1","1"],
    ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
print(maximalRectangle(matrix))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pre-processing:** Converting matrix of strings to integers takes \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.
- **Histogram Computation:** For each row (total \(m\) rows), updating the `heights` list takes \(O(n)\).
- **Largest Rectangle in Histogram:** This operation has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each row.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\).

This approach is efficient for typical constraints in interview scenarios, handling both the matrix conversion and the histogram calculations within polynomial time.
