title:  Rearrange Array Elements by Sign-out
permalink: /s2149
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers. You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified array follows these conditions:
1. Every `consecutive pair` of integers have different signs.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` should be preserved.

Return the rearranged array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the array?**
    - Yes, the length of the array is even and positive.

2. **How should pairs of integers be treated at the boundaries of the array?**
    - The last element of the array should still follow the alternating sign pattern with its preceding element.

3. **If there are duplicate values, do they need special handling?**
    - No, duplicates do not need special handling beyond maintaining their order.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two lists: one for positive numbers and one for negative numbers.

2. **Separation**:
   - Iterate through the `nums` array and add positive numbers to the positive list and negative numbers to the negative list, maintaining their order.

3. **Merging**:
   - Create a resultant list by alternating elements from the positive and negative lists.

4. **Returning Result**:
   - Return the merged list.

### Code

```python
def rearrangeArray(nums):
    positive_nums = []
    negative_nums = []
    
    # Separate positive and negative numbers
    for num in nums:
        if num > 0:
            positive_nums.append(num)
        else:
            negative_nums.append(num)
    
    result = []
    # Interleave positive and negative numbers
    for pos, neg in zip(positive_nums, negative_nums):
        result.append(pos)
        result.append(neg)
        
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 1, -2, -5, 2, -4]
print(rearrangeArray(nums))  # Output: [3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Separation Step**: O(n) – We iterate through the list once to separate positive and negative numbers.
- **Merging Step**: O(n) – We iterate through the positive and negative lists simultaneously to merge them in the desired pattern.

So the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array.
