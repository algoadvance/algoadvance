title:  Largest Plus Sign-out
permalink: /s764
---

You are given an integer `n` that indicates the size of a `n x n` binary grid. Initially, every cell in the grid is a 1. You are also given an array `mines` where `mines[i] = [xi, yi]` indicates that the cell `(xi, yi)` receives a 0. This action turns the cell `(xi, yi)` into a mine.

You need to find the order of the largest axis-aligned plus sign of 1s contained in the grid after performing these operations. An order of the largest plus sign is defined as the largest integer `k` such that there exists a plus sign of order `k` with its center in some cell of the grid, which contains only 1s. A plus sign of order `k` has a center cell `(r, c)` with the following property that must be true for all `0 <= i < k`:
- The cell `(r, c+i)`
- The cell `(r, c-i)`
- The cell `(r+i, c)`
- The cell `(r-i, c)`

Return an integer that represents the order of the largest plus sign.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`?
   - How many elements can the `mines` array have?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should we return `0` if there is no valid plus sign?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What to do when the entire grid is filled with mines?
   - What if `mines` is empty and there are no 0s in the grid?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a grid initialized with 1s.
   - Set cells to 0 as per the `mines` array.

2. **Pre-computation**:
   - Use four auxiliary arrays to keep track of the number of continuous 1s in all four possible directions from any cell:
     - Left to right
     - Right to left
     - Top to bottom
     - Bottom to top

3. **Cell-wise Computation**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, compute the minimum value from the four auxiliary arrays, which gives the maximum `k` for the plus sign centered at `(i, j)`.

4. **Result Preparation**:
   - The final result will be the maximum value found in the above step.

### Code

```python
def orderOfLargestPlusSign(n, mines):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Initialize the grid
    grid = [[1] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for mine in mines:
        grid[mine[0]][mine[1]] = 0

    left = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    right = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    top = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    bottom = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                left[i][j] = left[i][j-1] + 1 if j > 0 else 1
                top[i][j] = top[i-1][j] + 1 if i > 0 else 1

    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                right[i][j] = right[i][j+1] + 1 if j < n-1 else 1
                bottom[i][j] = bottom[i+1][j] + 1 if i < n-1 else 1

    max_order = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                order = min(left[i][j], right[i][j], top[i][j], bottom[i][j])
                max_order = max(max_order, order)

    return max_order
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n^2) for creating the grid and marking mines.
- **Pre-computation**: O(n^2) for filling each of the four auxiliary arrays.
- **Result Computation**: O(n^2) for determining the order of the largest plus sign.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n^2)**. This is efficient given that we need to consider every cell in the grid and the computations for each cell are constant time operations.

### Edge Cases

1. If `n` is `0`, the function returns `0` as there's no grid.
2. If `mines` covers the entire grid, the function returns `0` since no 1-cell exists.
3. If `mines` is empty, the order of the largest plus sign will be `n//2 + 1`.
