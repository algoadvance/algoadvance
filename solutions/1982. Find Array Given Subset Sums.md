title:  Find Array Given Subset Sums-out
permalink: /s1982
---

Given an integer `n` representing a set containing `2^n` integers from the range `[-10^9, 10^9]` with their subset sums in an array `s`, design an algorithm to return the original array of size `n`.

Your task is to find and return the original array whose subset sums generate the given list `s`.

### Example

Input:

```
n = 3
s = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]
```

Output:

```
[-1, 0, 1]
```

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 15`
- `s.length == 2^n`
- `-10^9 <= s[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the original array need to maintain any specific order?**
   - No, the problem only requires finding a valid original array.

2. **Are there multiple possible answers?**
   - Yes, there could be multiple valid original arrays. Any one of them is an acceptable answer.

3. **Is the subset sum guaranteed to be provided for all 2^n subsets?**
   - Yes, the length of list `s` is given as 2^n, matching the number of subsets.

4. **Are there any duplicate values in the subset sums that we should be aware of?**
   - Yes, the subset sums may include duplicate values.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the subset sums:** Start by sorting the given subset sum array.
2. **Identify the original elements:** The smallest value will generally be identified as part of the subset that excludes the particular value we seek, using this to loop and extract individual original array elements iteratively.
3. **Use an auxiliary set to simulate removing subsets:** As elements are identified, we model exclusion of subsets (essentially simulating subtracting out original elements) by removing these sums from `s`.
4. **Track identified elements and remaining subset sums:** Continue tracking which elements have been identified and what subset sums remain to be processed.

This approach should help iteratively narrow down the set to the original elements.

## Code

```python
def find_original_array(n, s):
    from collections import Counter

    # Sort the subset sums
    s.sort()
    
    # Counter to keep track of the subset sums frequency
    subset_counter = Counter(s)
    
    original_array = []
    
    while len(original_array) < n:
        # The smallest number in sorted s list
        smallest_subset_sum = min(subset_counter)
        
        if smallest_subset_sum != 0:
            print("Error: Expected 0 in the subset sums")
            return -1
        # Determine the next element of the original array
        subset_counter[smallest_subset_sum] -= 1
        if subset_counter[smallest_subset_sum] == 0:
            del subset_counter[smallest_subset_sum]
            
        next_orig_elem = min(subset_counter)
        original_array.append(next_orig_elem)

        # Generate the subsets that include next_orig_elem
        new_subset_counter = Counter()
        for sum_val in list(subset_counter):
            if sum_val + next_orig_elem in subset_counter and subset_counter[sum_val + next_orig_elem] > 0:
                new_subset_counter[sum_val + next_orig_elem] += subset_counter[sum_val]
                new_subset_counter[sum_val] -= subset_counter[sum_val]
                if new_subset_counter[sum_val + next_orig_elem] == 0:
                    del new_subset_counter[sum_val + next_orig_elem]

        subset_counter = {k: v for k, v in new_subset_counter.items() if v > 0}
    
    return original_array

# Example test case
n = 3
s = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]
print(find_original_array(n, s))
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution primarily involves sorting the subset array and performing operations over it. Sorting takes \(O(2^n \log 2^n)\) and subsequent counting and managing operations are \(O(2^n)\). Therefore, in the worst-case scenario, the time complexity is:

\[O(2^n \log 2^n)\]
