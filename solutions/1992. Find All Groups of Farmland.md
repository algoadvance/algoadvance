title:  Find All Groups of Farmland-out
permalink: /s1992
---
You are given a 2D integer array `land` containing `0`s and `1`s where `0` represents a barren land, and `1` represents a piece of farmland. The farms are groups of connected `1`s, where every `1` is reachable from any other `1` in the same farm group by moving horizontally or vertically. The input grid size is `m x n`.

Your task is to find all the groups of farmland and return a 2D array representing the coordinates of the groups. Each group of farmland should be represented as a triplet `[r1, c1, r2, c2]` where:
- `(r1, c1)` is the top-left coordinate,
- `(r2, c2)` is the bottom-right coordinate of the group of farmland.

Example:
```python
Input: land = [
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Connectivity**: Can we assume that farms are only connected orthogonally (horizontally and vertically), but not diagonally?
   - Yes, farms are only connected orthogonally.
2. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the grid size (m x n)?
   - The grid size is guaranteed to be within reasonable limits, such as m, n <= 300.
3. **Multiple Groups**: Can there be multiple groups of farmland in the input?
   - Yes, the grid can contain multiple separate groups of farmland.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We will employ BFS to explore each group of farmland.
2. **Coordinates Tracking**:
   - For each starting `1` encountered in the grid, use BFS to mark all connected `1`s and find the boundary coordinates (top-left and bottom-right corners).
3. **Marking Visited**:
   - Mark visited cells to avoid re-visiting. We can modify the input `land` directly or use a separate `visited` array.
4. **Output Formation**:
   - Collect the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners for each farmland group discovered.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def findFarmland(land):
    m, n = len(land), len(land[0])
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    farmland_groups = []

    def bfs(start_row, start_col):
        queue = deque([(start_row, start_col)])
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        top_left_row, top_left_col = start_row, start_col
        bottom_right_row, bottom_right_col = start_row, start_col
        
        while queue:
            r, c = queue.popleft()
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and land[nr][nc] == 1:
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
                    bottom_right_row = max(bottom_right_row, nr)
                    bottom_right_col = max(bottom_right_col, nc)
        
        return [top_left_row, top_left_col, bottom_right_row, bottom_right_col]

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if land[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                farmland_groups.append(bfs(i, j))
    
    return farmland_groups

# Example usage:
land = [
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
print(findFarmland(land))  # Output: [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Each cell is visited once, and we explore all neighbors in BFS which is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is `O(m * n)` for the `visited` array and the queue used in BFS.

This effectively and efficiently finds and returns all groups of farmland in the given grid.
