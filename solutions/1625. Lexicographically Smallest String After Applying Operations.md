title:  Lexicographically Smallest String After Applying Operations-out
permalink: /s1625
---

Given a string `s` of even length consisting only of digits and two integers `a` and `b`, you can apply either of the following operations any number of times on `s`:

1. Add `a` to all the odd-indexed digits of `s` (0-indexed). Digits will cycle from `9` to `0` after adding.
2. Rotate the string to the right by `b` positions.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `s`, `a`, and `b`?**
   * `s.length` is even and ranges from 2 to 100.
   * `s` consists only of digits.
   * `a` and `b` are integers such that `1 <= a <= 9` and `1 <= b < s.length`.

2. **Can `a` and `b` be negative?**
   * No, they are positive based on the given problem constraints.

3. **What constitutes a lexicographically smallest string?**
   * It is the smallest string according to dictionary order (i.e., comparing characters from left to right).

### Strategy

1. **Generate all possible strings after valid rotations:**
   - Since `b` is a divisor for the length of `s`, we can generate several possible rotations.
   
2. **Apply the addition operation:**
   - For each possible rotation, attempt to add `a` to the odd indexed digits and check the resulting string.
   
3. **Track the smallest string:**
   - Use a set to track seen combinations and avoid redundant operations.
   - Use a queue (BFS approach) to explore each state.

4. **BFS Approach:**
   - Utilize BFS to explore from the initial string. Apply both operations exhaustively while tracking the smallest lexicographical string.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def find_lex_smallest_string(s: str, a: int, b: int) -> str:
    def add_to_odds(ss):
        ss = list(ss)
        for i in range(1, len(ss), 2):
            ss[i] = str((int(ss[i]) + a) % 10)
        return ''.join(ss)
    
    def rotate_right(ss, b):
        return ss[-b:] + ss[:-b]
    
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([s])
    smallest = s
    
    while queue:
        current_string = queue.popleft()
        
        # Operation 1: Add 'a' to each odd index digit
        added_string = add_to_odds(current_string)
        if added_string not in visited:
            visited.add(added_string)
            queue.append(added_string)
            if added_string < smallest:
                smallest = added_string
        
        # Operation 2: Rotate the string to the right by 'b' positions
        rotated_string = rotate_right(current_string, b)
        if rotated_string not in visited:
            visited.add(rotated_string)
            queue.append(rotated_string)
            if rotated_string < smallest:
                smallest = rotated_string
            
    return smallest

# Example usage
s = "5525"
a = 9
b = 2

print(find_lex_smallest_string(s, a, b))  # Expected output: "2050"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Operation 1:** Each addition operation has O(n) complexity.
- **Operation 2:** Each rotation operation has O(n) complexity.
- The BFS ensures we avoid redundant states resulting in O(n^2 * n!) primary time complexity in the worst-case due to the factorial branches. However, practical constraints and the even-length restriction mitigate this.

This approach should be efficient within given problem constraints.
