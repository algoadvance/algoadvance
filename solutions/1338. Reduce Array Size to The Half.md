title:  Reduce Array Size to The Half-out
permalink: /s1338
---

Given an array `arr`, you can choose a set of integers and remove all occurrences of these integers in the array. Return the minimum size of the set so that at least half of the integers of the array are removed.

### Example:
```
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new size of the array 5 (which is half of the size 10).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the range of the array size?**
   - A: The size of the array is between 1 and 100,000.

2. **Q: What values can the array elements have?**
   - A: The elements of the array can be any integer.

3. **Q: Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - A: Yes, the array can contain negative numbers as integers are allowed.

4. **Q: If multiple sets can achieve the minimum reduction, do we need to return any specific set?**
   - A: No, we just need to return the minimum size of the set that can achieve the reduction.

## Strategy

1. **Count Frequency:** Count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Sort Frequencies:** Sort these frequencies in descending order.
3. **Remove Elements:** Start removing elements with the highest frequency until at least half of the array size is removed.
4. **Count the Sets:** Count the number of unique elements removed to achieve this reduction.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def minSetSize(arr):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Sort the frequencies in descending order
    freq_values = sorted(freq.values(), reverse=True)
    
    # Step 3: Remove elements until at least half of the array is removed
    n = len(arr)
    half = n // 2
    current_sum = 0
    num_of_elements = 0
    
    for count in freq_values:
        current_sum += count
        num_of_elements += 1
        if current_sum >= half:
            break
    
    return num_of_elements
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies:** This takes \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Sorting Frequencies:** Sorting the frequencies takes \(O(k \log k)\) time where \(k\) is the number of unique elements in the array.
- **Removing Elements:** This takes \(O(k)\) time.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n + k \log k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(k\) is the number of unique elements. Since \(k \leq n\), the overall complexity can be simplified to \(O(n \log n)\) in the worst-case scenario.
