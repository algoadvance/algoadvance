**LeetCode 1880: Check if Word Equals Summation of Two Words**

You are given three strings `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord`, each consisting of lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'j'` inclusive.

You need to determine if the summation of the numerical values of `firstWord` and `secondWord` equals the numerical value of `targetWord`, where each character represents a digit from 0 to 9, i.e., 'a' represents 0, 'b' represents 1, and so on until 'j' which represents 9.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the input strings guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement.

2. **Can the words have different lengths?**
   - Yes, the input strings can have different lengths.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the strings?**
   - The length of each string is between 1 and 8 inclusive.

### Strategy

1. **Conversion Logic**:
   - Convert each character in the strings to its corresponding numeric value by using its position in the alphabet.
   - Calculate the numerical value of each word by treating these digits as a normal integer.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Sum the numerical values of `firstWord` and `secondWord`.
   - Compare the sum with the numerical value of `targetWord`.

### Code

Let's implement this step-by-step.

```python
def isSumEqual(firstWord: str, secondWord: str, targetWord: str) -> bool:
    def word_to_number(word: str) -> int:
        num_str = ''.join(str(ord(char) - ord('a')) for char in word)
        return int(num_str)
    
    # Calculate the numeric representations of the words
    first_num = word_to_number(firstWord)
    second_num = word_to_number(secondWord)
    target_num = word_to_number(targetWord)
    
    # Check if their summation equals the target number
    return (first_num + second_num) == target_num

# Example Usage
firstWord = "acb"
secondWord = "cba"
targetWord = "cdb"
print(isSumEqual(firstWord, secondWord, targetWord))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion of each word:** O(N) where N is the maximum length of the words (since we iterate through each character).
- There are three words, so the total complexity for converting all words is O(3N) which is simplified to O(N).
- **Summation and comparison:** O(1) operations since these are single integer arithmetic operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the length of the longest string among the three input words.
