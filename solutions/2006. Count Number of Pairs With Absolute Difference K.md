title:  Count Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference K-out
permalink: /s2006
---

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` such that `|nums[i] - nums[j]| == k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input array length and values?**
   - Constraints:
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
     - `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
     - `0 <= k <= 100`

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

3. **Would there ever be negative values for `k`?**
   - No, `k` is guaranteed to be non-negative.

4. **What should the function return if no such pairs are found?**
   - The function should return `0` if no such pairs are found.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate through every possible pair `(i, j)` with `i < j`.
   - Check if the absolute difference `|nums[i] - nums[j]|` is equal to `k`.
   - If it is, count this pair.

2. **Optimized Approach using a Frequency Map:**
   - Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each number in the array.
   - Iterate through the array and for each element `num`, check if `(num + k)` or `(num - k)` exists in the hashmap.
   - The count of both these numbers, if they exist, gives the number of pairs with absolute difference `k`.

### Code

Here's the implementation using the optimized approach:

```python
def countKDifference(nums, k):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    freq_map = defaultdict(int)
    count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Check for pairs with (num + k)
        count += freq_map[num + k]
        # Check for pairs with (num - k)
        count += freq_map[num - k]
        
        # Update the frequency map
        freq_map[num] += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 2, 1]
k = 1
print(countKDifference(nums, k))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the space used by the frequency map (hashmap).

This efficient approach ensures that we only pass through the list a constant number of times and check for conditions in constant time, making it very suitable given the problem constraints.
