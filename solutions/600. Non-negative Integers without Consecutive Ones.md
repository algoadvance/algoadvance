title:  Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones-out
permalink: /s600
---

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to `n` without consecutive ones in their binary representation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum value for `n`?**
   - The problem does not specify a constraint, but for practical purposes and computational limits, we can assume `n` can go up to `10^9`.

2. **What is the expected output?**
   - An integer representing the count of numbers without consecutive ones in their binary representation, up to and including `n`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a combination of dynamic programming and bitwise manipulation. The approach can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Binary Representation**: Convert the given integer `n` to its binary representation for easier manipulation.
  
2. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Use dynamic programming to pre-calculate the number of valid integers without consecutive ones for all possible lengths of binary numbers up to the length of `n`. This is based on the idea that the sequence of numbers without consecutive ones follows the Fibonacci sequence:
    - If the highest bit is '0', the remaining bits form a number less than a certain value.
    - If the highest bit is '1', the next bit must be '0', and the remaining bits form a valid number, similar to shifting.

3. **Count Valid Numbers**: Iteratively count the valid numbers less than or equal to `n` by considering each bit and using the pre-calculated Fibonacci sequence.

### Code

```python
def findIntegers(n):
    # Transform to a binary string
    bin_n = bin(n)[2:]
    length = len(bin_n)
    
    # dp[i] indicates the number of valid integers of length i
    dp = [0] * (length+1)
    dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 2
    
    for i in range(2, length + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    # To count the valid numbers less than or equal to n
    count = 0
    prev_bit = '0'
    
    for i in range(length):
        if bin_n[i] == '1':
            count += dp[length - i - 1]
            if prev_bit == '1':  # Invalid sequence found
                break
            prev_bit = '1'
        else:
            prev_bit = '0'
    
    if '11' not in bin_n:
        count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage
n = 5
print(findIntegers(n))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(L), where L is the length of the binary representation of `n`. This is because we iterate through each bit of `n` once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(L), for the dp array used to store the Fibonacci sequence counts.

This approach efficiently counts the integers without consecutive ones that are less than or equal to `n`.
