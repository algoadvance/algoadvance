title:  Create Sorted Array through Instructions-out
permalink: /s1649
---

Given an integer array `instructions`, you are tasked with creating a sorted array from the elements in the `instructions`. You start with an empty array `sortedArray`. For each element from `instructions`, we need to perform the following operations:

1. Count the number of elements smaller than the current element in `sortedArray`.
2. Count the number of elements larger than the current element in `sortedArray`.
3. Calculate the cost as the minimum of the two counts.
4. Insert the current element into its appropriate position in `sortedArray`.

Return the total cost of creating the sorted array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements in the `instructions` array be negative or are they strictly non-negative?**
    - The problem specifies integers, so assume they might be negative unless otherwise clarified.

2. **What is the maximum length of the `instructions` array?**
    - This typically influences the choice of algorithm and data structures due to performance constraints.

3. **Do we need to handle duplicates in the `instructions` array?**
    - Yes, duplicates are allowed. The problem doesn't specify any constraints against them.

### Strategy

Given the potentially large size of the input (`n` can be up to \(10^5\)), we need an efficient way to:
1. Count the number of elements less than a given element.
2. Count the number of elements greater than a given element.
3. Insert elements into the `sortedArray`.

A naive approach would involve inserting and counting in a sorted array using linear searches and insertions, giving \(O(n^2)\) complexity, which is too slow.

To achieve better performance, we can use a data structure like a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) or a Balanced Binary Search Tree to maintain the counts efficiently. These data structures can provide \(O(\log n)\) insertion and search times.

### Code

Here is the Python code to implement the solution using a Binary Indexed Tree:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

class FenwickTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.tree = [0] * (size + 1)
    
    def update(self, index, value):
        while index <= self.size:
            self.tree[index] += value
            index += index & -index
    
    def query(self, index):
        result = 0
        while index > 0:
            result += self.tree[index]
            index -= index & -index
        return result
    
    def query_range(self, left, right):
        return self.query(right) - self.query(left - 1)

def createSortedArray(instructions):
    max_val = max(instructions)
    fenwick = FenwickTree(max_val)
    
    cost = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(instructions):
        left_cost = fenwick.query(num - 1)
        right_cost = i - fenwick.query(num)
        cost += min(left_cost, right_cost)
        fenwick.update(num, 1)
    
    return cost % MOD

# Example usage
instructions = [1,5,6,2]
print(createSortedArray(instructions))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation

1. **Fenwick Tree Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    - Creates a Fenwick Tree that can handle elements up to the maximum value in the `instructions`.

2. **Update Method (`update`)**:
    - Updates the tree with the count of an element.

3. **Query Method (`query`)**:
    - Queries the tree to get the cumulative count of elements up to a given index.

4. **Main Function (`createSortedArray`)**:
    - Iterates over each instruction, calculates the cost using the Fenwick Tree, and updates the tree with the new element.

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `instructions` array. This is efficient and suitable for the input size constraints typically seen in such problems.
