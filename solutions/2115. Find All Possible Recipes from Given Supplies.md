title:  Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies-out
permalink: /s2115
---
You have a list of recipes you want to make, and the ingredients for each recipe. You also have a list of all the ingredients initially available to you. Each recipe is represented as a string, and each ingredient is also represented as a string.

You are to determine all the recipes that you can possibly make. Given you can reuse the ingredients from the initial supplies as many times as needed.

### Function Signature
```python
def findAllRecipes(recipes: List[str], ingredients: List[List[str]], supplies: List[str]) -> List[str]:
```

### Examples
#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```python
  recipes = ["bread"]
  ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"]]
  supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "corn"]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```python
  ["bread"]
  ```

#### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```python
  recipes = ["bread", "sandwich"]
  ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"], ["bread", "ham"]]
  supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "ham"]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```python
  ["bread", "sandwich"]
  ```

#### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```python
  recipes = ["bread", "sandwich", "burger"]
  ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"], ["bread", "ham"], ["sandwich", "meat"]]
  supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "ham", "meat"]
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```python
  ["bread", "sandwich", "burger"]
  ```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the recipes list or the ingredients list be empty?**
   - Yes, any of these lists may be empty.
2. **Are all ingredients and recipes distinct strings?**
   - Yes, both ingredients and recipes are guaranteed to be distinct strings.
3. **Will there be any cyclic dependencies in the recipes?**
   - No, you can assume there will be no cyclic dependencies among the recipes.

## Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent this problem using a directed graph where:
     - Nodes represent recipes and available ingredients.
     - Directed edges represent dependencies (from ingredient nodes to recipe nodes).

2. **Topological Sorting:**
   - We'll use a topological sorting approach (Kahn's Algorithm) to determine the order of preparation for the recipes.
   
3. **Steps:**
   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Use an in-degree array to keep track of the number of dependencies for each recipe.
   - Use a queue to simulate the process:
       - Start with initial supplies in the queue.
       - Process supplies and reduce the in-degree of dependent recipes.
       - Add recipes whose in-degree drops to 0 to the queue (they can now be made).
   - Continue until the queue is empty.

4. **Determine resulting recipes:**
   - Keep track of recipes that have been processed and return them as the result.

## Code
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def findAllRecipes(recipes, ingredients, supplies):
    # Adjacency list and in-degree count
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Initialize supplies set for O(1) lookups
    supplies_set = set(supplies)
    
    # Initialize graph and in-degree counts
    for i, recipe in enumerate(recipes):
        for ingredient in ingredients[i]:
            graph[ingredient].append(recipe)
            in_degree[recipe] += 1
            
    # Queue for processing available supplies/ingredients
    queue = deque(supplies)
    
    # Result set for finding all possible recipes
    possible_recipes = []

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        if current in in_degree and in_degree[current] == 0:
            possible_recipes.append(current)
        
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
                possible_recipes.append(neighbor)
                
        if current in recipes:
            supplies_set.add(current)
    
    return [recipe for recipe in recipes if recipe in possible_recipes]

# Example Usage:
# recipes = ["bread", "sandwich", "burger"]
# ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"], ["bread", "ham"], ["sandwich", "meat"]]
# supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "ham", "meat"]
# print(findAllRecipes(recipes, ingredients, supplies))#["bread", "sandwich", "burger"]
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(V + E)**, where \( V \) is the number of recipes + number of supplies, and \( E \) is the number of dependencies (edges).
- We traverse every ingredient and recipe and each dependency exactly once.
