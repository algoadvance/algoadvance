title:  Bus Routes-out
permalink: /s815
---

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes, where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the ith bus repeats forever. For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 5, 7]`, this means that the 0th bus travels in the sequence 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> ....

You will start at the bus stop `source` (you are not on any bus initially), and you want to go to the bus stop `target`. You can travel between bus stops by buses only.

Return the minimum number of buses you must take to travel from `source` to `target`. If it is not possible to go from `source` to `target`, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the bus routes bidirectional?** 
   - Yes, you can assume you can travel in both directions on each bus.
2. **Is each bus route a simple cycle or can it terminate?**
   - Each bus route is a cycle and repeats forever.
3. **Can a bus visit a bus stop more than once in its route?**
   - No, each bus visits each stop once per cycle.
4. **Can `source` and `target` be the same?**
   - Yes, if `source` is the same as `target`, the answer should be 0.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Check**:
    - If `source` equals `target`, return 0.

2. **Model as Graph**:
    - Represent the problem as a graph where each node is a bus stop.
    - Edges between nodes represent directly connected bus stops through any bus route.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - Use BFS to find the shortest path (minimum number of bus transfers) from the `source` to the `target`.
    - Nodes represent bus stops; edges represent direct connections via a bus route.

4. **Data Structures**:
    - `stop_to_buses`: A dictionary mapping each bus stop to the set of buses (routes) that service it.
    - `visited_stops`: A set to keep track of visited bus stops.
    - `visited_buses`: A set to keep track of visited bus routes to avoid revisiting them.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def numBusesToDestination(routes, source, target):
    if source == target:
        return 0

    # Map stop to buses
    stop_to_buses = defaultdict(set)
    for bus, route in enumerate(routes):
        for stop in route:
            stop_to_buses[stop].add(bus)

    visited_stops = set()
    visited_buses = set()
    queue = deque([(source, 0)])  # (current_stop, bus_count)

    while queue:
        current_stop, bus_count = queue.popleft()
        if current_stop == target:
            return bus_count

        for bus in stop_to_buses[current_stop]:
            if bus not in visited_buses:
                visited_buses.add(bus)
                for next_stop in routes[bus]:
                    if next_stop not in visited_stops:
                        visited_stops.add(next_stop)
                        queue.append((next_stop, bus_count + 1))

    return -1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the `stop_to_buses` map**: O(N * L) where N is the number of buses and L is the average number of stops per bus.
- **BFS Traversal**: O(N * L), each stop is processed at most once.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(N * L), which is efficient for the problem constraints usually given in such tasks.
