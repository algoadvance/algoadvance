title:  Can You Eat Your Favorite Candy on Your Favorite Day?-out
permalink: /s1744

You are given a 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [favoriteTypei, favoriteDayi, dailyCapi]`. For each query, determine if you can eat your favorite candy on your favorite day. Your task is to return a boolean array where each element corresponds to each query and indicates whether you can or cannot eat your favorite candy on the corresponding favorite day.

Here's a quick rundown of the key points:
- You start with 0 pieces of candy.
- You eat at least 1 piece of candy per day, but no more than `dailyCap` pieces of candy per day.
- `candiesCount[i]` represents the total number of candies of type `i`.

Return a boolean array where each element `i` is `True` if it's possible to eat candy of type `favoriteTypei` on day `favoriteDayi`, otherwise `False`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
   - What are the size constraints on the array `candiesCount`?
   - Are there any specific constraints we should consider for the values in `queries`?
   - Is it possible that `favoriteDayi` is zero or negative?
   - Will there always be enough days to potentially eat the required candy, given that `candiesCount` can be quite large?

Assuming that the constraints are handled well within typical problem constraints (like all values being non-negative and within typical Python handling limits), we can proceed with the given strategy.

### Strategy
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - For each query, determine if you can eat at least 1 piece of candy per day and no more than `dailyCap` pieces of candy per day to reach the favorite type on the favorite day.

2. **Precompute**:
   - Calculate prefix sums of the `candiesCount` array to get the total number of candies available up to any type id.
   - Use these prefix sums to quickly determine if the given query constraints can be met.

3. **Constraints Checking**:
   - Determine the minimum and maximum days needed to potentially reach the favorite type using previously eaten candies (`prefix sums`) and daily capacity.

4. **Boolean Result**:
   - Check if it is possible to eat the favorite type candy on the favorite day by comparing with the computed prefix sums.

### Code
Here's a sample implementation in Python:

```python
def canEat(candiesCount, queries):
    # Calculate the prefix sums
    prefixSums = [0] * len(candiesCount)
    prefixSums[0] = candiesCount[0]

    for i in range(1, len(candiesCount)):
        prefixSums[i] = prefixSums[i - 1] + candiesCount[i]

    results = []
    for favoriteType, favoriteDay, dailyCap in queries:
        # Calculate the minimum and maximum days that could lead to eating this type of candy
        # Min days to start exactly at this type
        totalCandiesBefore = prefixSums[favoriteType] - candiesCount[favoriteType] if favoriteType > 0 else 0
        
        # Max days to start exactly at this type
        totalCandiesUptoAndIncludingType = prefixSums[favoriteType]
        
        # Check feasibility
        minDayToEatThisType = totalCandiesBefore // dailyCap
        maxDayToEatThisType = totalCandiesUptoAndIncludingType - 1
        
        if totalCandiesBefore <= favoriteDay <= maxDayToEatThisType:
            results.append(True)
        else:
            results.append(False)
    
    return results

# Example usage
candiesCount = [7, 4, 5, 3, 8]
queries = [
    [0, 2, 2],  # True
    [4, 2, 4],  # False
    [2, 13, 5],  # True
    [3, 3, 4],  # False
    [3, 16, 2]  # False
]

print(canEat(candiesCount, queries))  # Expected: [True, False, True, False, False]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Precomputation**: O(n) where n is the length of `candiesCount`.
- **Query Processing**: O(1) per query.
- This gives an overall complexity of O(n + q) where q is the number of queries, making the solution efficient.
