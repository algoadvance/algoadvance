Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return `true` if `sentence2` can be equal to `sentence1` after *some* words are deleted from the ends of `sentence1` and `sentence2`. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example:**
```
Input: sentence1 = "My name is Haley", sentence2 = "My Haley"
Output: true
Explanation: We can delete the words "name is" from sentence1 to get "My Haley".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the sentences contain punctuation?**
   - No, the problem statement assumes sentences are made up of words separated by spaces only.
   
2. **Are extra spaces in the input allowed?**
   - According to typical input constraints, no additional spaces beyond single spaces used for word separation are present.

3. **Is the comparison case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, the comparison is case-sensitive as words in the sentences must match exactly in both cases.

### Strategy

1. **Splitting Words**: Split both sentences into lists of words.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a two-pointer technique to compare words from the start and end of both sentences.
3. **Check from Both Ends**: Move inward from both ends and check if words remain the same until the pointers cross each other.

### Code

```python
def areSentencesSimilar(sentence1: str, sentence2: str) -> bool:
    words1 = sentence1.split()
    words2 = sentence2.split()
    
    i, j = 0, 0
    # Compare from the start until words differ or reach end of one list
    while i < len(words1) and i < len(words2) and words1[i] == words2[i]:
        i += 1
    
    # Compare from the end until words differ or reach the beginning
    while j < len(words1) and j < len(words2) and words1[~j] == words2[~j]:
        j += 1
    
    # Ensure the middle parts are either fully checked or overlapping
    return i + j >= min(len(words1), len(words2))

# Test the function with the example given
sentence1 = "My name is Haley"
sentence2 = "My Haley"
print(areSentencesSimilar(sentence1, sentence2))  # Output: True
```

### Strategy Explanation

The main idea is to utilize a two-pointer approach:
1. **Forward Comparison** (`i` pointer): Start from the beginning of both word lists and continue as long as the words match.
2. **Backward Comparison** (`j` pointer): Start from the end of both word lists and continue as long as the words match.
3. **Check Overlap**: By ensuring that the sum of `i` (forward matches) and `j` (backward matches) is at least the length of the shorter sentence, we can confirm that the inner parts of the longer sentence can be removed to make the shorter one match.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)`
  - Where `n` is the length of `sentence1.split()` and `m` is the length of `sentence2.split()`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)`
  - Storing the split words in lists from the two sentences.
