title:  Min Cost to Connect All Points-out
permalink: /s1584
---
Given an array `points` representing `n` points on the 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, return the minimum cost to make all points connected. The cost of connecting two points `(xi, yi)` and `(xj, yj)` is the Manhattan distance between them: 
\[ |xi - xj| + |yi - yj| \]

You need to find the minimum cost to connect all the points such that all points are connected and the total cost is minimized. Use any algorithm: Prim's, Kruskal's, or other minimum spanning tree algorithms.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be duplicate points in the input?**
    - No, all points are unique.
2. **Is the input guaranteed to be non-empty?**
    - Yes, the problem guarantees there will be at least one point.
3. **What is the maximum possible number of points `n`?**
    - The constraints usually indicate that `n` can be up to 1000, which means quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)) might be feasible.
4. **Are negative coordinates allowed?**
    - Yes, coordinates can be negative as the problem does not restrict this.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use Prim's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The approach involves:

1. Initializing a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the minimum cost edge.
2. Starting from an arbitrary point, iteratively add the smallest cost edge that connects a new point to the MST.
3. Continue the process until all points are included in the MST.

Steps involved:
- Use a min-heap to always expand the MST with the minimum cost edge.
- Track visited nodes to avoid cycles.
- Keep adding edges until all nodes are visited.

## Code
Here is the Python implementation of the above strategy using Prim's algorithm:

```python
import heapq

def minCostConnectPoints(points):
    n = len(points)
    
    # Min-heap to store costs (distance, point_index)
    min_heap = [(0, 0)]  # (cost-to-connect, point_index)
    visited = set()
    total_cost = 0

    while len(visited) < n:
        cost, point = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if point in visited:
            continue
        total_cost += cost
        visited.add(point)
        
        # Add all edges from this point to others points not in MST
        for next_point in range(n):
            if next_point not in visited:
                next_cost = abs(points[point][0] - points[next_point][0]) + abs(points[point][1] - points[next_point][1])
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (next_cost, next_point))
    
    return total_cost

# Example usage:
points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
print(minCostConnectPoints(points))  # Output: 20
```

## Time Complexity
- **Building the initial heap:** O(1) since it starts with a single element.
- **Main while loop iteration:** O(n \* log(n)) since each point can push n elements into the heap and a heap insertion takes O(log(n)) time.
- **Overall complexity:** As each point is processed once, resulting in O(n \* log(n)).

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently finds the MST using Prim's algorithm for the given points on a 2D plane, ensuring that all points are connected with the minimum cost. The approach ensures optimal performance and handles the typical constraints well.
