title:  Minimum Incompatibility-out
permalink: /s1681
---
Given an integer array `nums` of length n and an integer k, you need to divide the array into k subsets of equal size such that the incompatibility of the largest subset is minimized.

The incompatibility of a subset is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

Return the minimum possible sum of the incompatibilities of the k subsets after dividing the array `nums`. If no arrangement is possible, return -1.

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [1,2,1,4]
k = 2
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
4
```

**Explanation:** 
- The array `nums` can be divided into subsets `[1,2]` and `[1,4]`.
- The maximum element in the first subset is 2 and the minimum is 1, so the incompatibility is 2 - 1 = 1.
- The maximum element in the second subset is 4 and the minimum is 1, so the incompatibility is 4 - 1 = 3.
- The total incompatibility is 1 + 3 = 4, which is the minimum possible sum of incompatibilities.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all elements in `nums` positive integers?
   - Yes, the problem suggests integers are given without specifying negatives.
2. What is the range of numbers and value of `k` we should consider?
   - The constraints ensure that we can use algorithmic optimizations to find efficient solutions.
3. Can the elements in subsets repeat, or do they need to be unique?
   - Since incompatibility is calculated using unique elements in a subset, each subset should have unique elements.
4. What should be done if the division into k subsets cannot be performed equally?
   - If it's not possible to divide the array into k equal subsets, the function should return -1.

## Strategy
1. **Check if Division is Possible**
   - Check if the array length n is divisible by k. If not, return -1.
   
2. **Backtracking with Memoization**
   - Use backtracking to generate possible valid partitions.
   - Memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - Calculate the incompatibility for each partition.

3. **Convert State to Integer for Memoization**
   - Use bitmasking or tuples to represent states for efficient memoization.

## Code
```python
from functools import lru_cache
from itertools import combinations

def minimumIncompatibility(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    if n % k != 0:
        return -1

    subset_size = n // k

    # Prepare compatibility dictionary
    counts = {num: nums.count(num) for num in set(nums)}
    if any(v > k for v in counts.values()):  # More than k instances of any number
        return -1

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(mask):
        count = bin(mask).count('1')
        if count % subset_size == 0:  # We generated a full subset
            return 0 if mask == 0 else float('inf')

        minValue = float('inf')

        # Iterate over all valid combinations
        i = 0
        while mask & (1 << i) == 0:
            i += 1
        sub_masks = []

        for subset in combinations(range(i, n), subset_size):
            subset_mask = sum(1 << j for j in subset)
            if subset_mask & mask == subset_mask and len(set(nums[j] for j in subset)) == subset_size:
                incompatibility = max(nums[j] for j in subset) - min(nums[j] for j in subset)
                sub_masks.append((subset_mask, incompatibility))

        for sub_mask, incompatibility in sub_masks:
            minValue = min(minValue, dp(mask ^ sub_mask) + incompatibility)
            
        return minValue

    full_mask = (1 << n) - 1    
    result = dp(full_mask)
    return result if result != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage
print(minimumIncompatibility([1, 2, 1, 4], 2))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(2^n * n)`. The `2^n` part arises from the bitmask representation and the `n` from iterating through sub-combinations.
- Space complexity will primarily be driven by memoization, potentially `O(2^n)` for storing each state.

This approach combines efficient subset generation with memoization, ensuring that we use optimal substructure properties to avoid redundant calculations in the backtracking solution.
