title:  Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer-out
permalink: /s2529
---

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum count of either positive integers or negative integers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are zeroes considered as negative or positive integers?**
   - Zeroes are neither positive nor negative, so they should be ignored in the count.

2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Yes, in such a case, the count of positive and negative integers will both be zero, and the output should be zero.

3. **Are there any constraints on the array size?**
   - No specific constraints mentioned, but we should handle large input sizes efficiently.

### Strategy
We will traverse the array once, maintaining two counters: one for counting positive integers and another for negative integers. At the end of the traversal, we return the maximum of these two counts.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the input array `nums`. This is because we only need to traverse the array once.

### Code

```python
def maximumCount(nums):
    positive_count = 0
    negative_count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > 0:
            positive_count += 1
        elif num < 0:
            negative_count += 1
    
    return max(positive_count, negative_count)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, -2, -3, 4, -5, 0]
print(maximumCount(nums))  # Output should be 3
```

The example provided within the code includes zeros to demonstrate that they are indeed ignored in the count. The maximum count of either positive or negative integers is `3` in this example (i.e., there are 3 negative numbers).
