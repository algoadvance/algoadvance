The problem is to generate a sequence called Gray Code for a given number of bits `n`. Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer `n` representing the total number of bits in the code, we need to return any sequence of Gray code.

#### Example:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
```
Given `n` = 2, `[0, 1, 3, 2]` is a valid Gray code sequence. Another valid sequence is `[0, 2, 3, 1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the order of the Gray code sequence matter?**
   - The sequence must follow the rule that successive values differ by exactly one bit, but otherwise any valid sequence is acceptable.

2. **What should be the return type?**
   - The function should return a list of integers representing the Gray code sequence.

3. **What about edge cases like `n = 0`?**
   - For `n = 0`, the Gray code sequence would be `[0]`.

Once these clarifications are made, we can proceed with solving the problem.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization (Base Case)**:
   - Start with the simplest Gray code sequence, which is `[0]` for `n = 0`.

2. **Generate Sequence Iteratively**:
   - For every new bit level from 1 to `n`, build the new sequence based on the existing sequence.

3. **Reflect and Append**:
   - Reflect the current sequence (reverse it), and for each reflected value, add a 1 at the beginning (equivalent to adding `1 << (current level - 1)`).

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Python:

```python
def grayCode(n):
    # Base case for zero bits
    result = [0]
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Reflect the current sequence
        reflected = [x | (1 << i) for x in reversed(result)]
        # Extend the original sequence with the reflected sequence
        result.extend(reflected)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We start with `[0]` for `n = 0`.
2. **First Iteration (i=0, for n=1)**: 
   - Current sequence: `[0]`
   - Reflect and append: `[0]` -> Reflect -> `[0]` -> Append `1 << 0` to the reflected part -> `[1]`
   - New sequence: `[0, 1]`
3. **Second Iteration (i=1, for n=2)**:
   - Current sequence: `[0, 1]`
   - Reflect and append: `[1, 0]` -> Append `1 << 1` -> New values: `[3, 2]`
   - New sequence: `[0, 1, 3, 2]`

This process continues until all levels are processed.

### Time Complexity
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(2^n):
- Each iteration over the bit levels involves reflecting the current sequence.
- Reflection involves reversing the sequence of length `2^i`, where `i` is the current bit level.
- Constructing the new sequence by combining original and reflected requires linear time in the size of the list.

Thus, combining these facts, the overall time complexity is O(2^n).
