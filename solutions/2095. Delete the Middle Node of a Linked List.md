title:  Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List-out
permalink: /s2095
---

You are given the head of a linked list. Implement an algorithm to delete the middle node of the linked list and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list with `n` nodes is defined as the `⌊n / 2⌋`-th node (0-indexed).

**Example:**

- Input: `head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]`
- Output: `[1,3,4,1,2,6]`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What should be returned if the linked list has only one node?
   - Return `None` because the single node is also the middle node to be deleted.
   
2. What if the linked list is empty?
   - Return `None`.
   
3. How should the linked list be represented in the code?
   - We'll assume the linked list is represented using nodes of the following class:
     ```python
     class ListNode:
         def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
             self.val = val
             self.next = next
     ```

### Strategy:
1. **Calculate Length:** Traverse the entire linked list to calculate its length `n`.
2. **Find Middle Element to Delete:** The middle is at index `⌊n / 2⌋`.
3. **Delete Middle Element:** Traverse the list again to the node just before the middle node, and adjust its `next` pointer to skip the middle node.

### Code:
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteMiddle(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        # If there's only one node or the list is empty, return None
        return None

    # Step 1: Calculate the length of the linked list
    length = 0
    current = head
    while current:
        length += 1
        current = current.next
        
    # Step 2: Find the middle index
    middle_index = length // 2

    # Step 3: Traverse to the node before the middle node and adjust pointers
    current = head
    for _ in range(middle_index - 1):
        current = current.next
    
    # current is now the node just before the middle node
    if current.next:
        current.next = current.next.next
    
    return head

# Example usage
# Create the linked list: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6
head = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(7, ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(6)))))))

# Call the function
head = deleteMiddle(head)

# Output helper function
def print_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.val, end=' -> ')
        current = current.next
    print('None')

# Print the modified list
print_list(head)  # Output: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 6 -> None
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Calculate Length:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Traverse to Middle Node:** O(n/2), which simplifies to O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
