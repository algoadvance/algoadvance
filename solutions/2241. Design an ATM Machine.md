title:  Design an ATM Machine-out
permalink: /s2241
---

You are asked to design an ATM machine that can handle various denominations of banknotes. The ATM supports denominations of `20`, `50`, `100`, `200`, and `500` dollar bills. Implement the following methods for the ATM:

1. **`ATM()`:** Initializes the ATM object.
2. **`deposit(banknotesCount: List[int]) -> None`:** Deposits banknotes into the ATM. `banknotesCount` contains exactly five elements representing the number of `20`, `50`, `100`, `200`, and `500` dollar bills deposited respectively.
3. **`withdraw(amount: int) -> List[int]`:** Withdraws the specified amount from the ATM. You need to return the number of banknotes of each denomination that you get in the order `[20, 50, 100, 200, 500]`. If it's not possible to withdraw the exact amount, return `[-1]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the behavior if the withdrawal amount cannot be achieved with the available denominations?
   - Return `[-1]`.
2. Are there any constraints on the range of denominations and amounts for deposits and withdrawals?
   - Assume deposits can be large, and withdrawals will be within the bounds that can be handled by the machine.

## Code

```python
class ATM:
    def __init__(self):
        self.banknotes = [20, 50, 100, 200, 500]
        self.counts = [0]*5

    def deposit(self, banknotesCount: List[int]) -> None:
        for i in range(5):
            self.counts[i] += banknotesCount[i]

    def withdraw(self, amount: int) -> List[int]:
        original_counts = self.counts[:]
        result = [0]*5
        for i in range(4, -1, -1):
            if self.banknotes[i] <= amount:
                num_notes = min(amount // self.banknotes[i], self.counts[i])
                amount -= num_notes * self.banknotes[i]
                result[i] = num_notes
                self.counts[i] -= num_notes
        
        if amount == 0:
            return result
        else:
            self.counts = original_counts
            return [-1]

# Your ATM object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = ATM()
# obj.deposit([count20, count50, count100, count200, count500])
# param_2 = obj.withdraw(amount)
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an ATM object with five slots for different banknote denominations.
   
2. **Deposit**:
   - Add the counts of each denomination from `banknotesCount` to the existing counts.

3. **Withdraw**:
   - Iterate from the highest denomination to the lowest.
   - Check how many notes of the current denomination can be dispensed without exceeding the number available in the ATM and without exceeding the remaining amount needed.
   - Deduct the notes and update the counts accordingly.
   - If after processing all denominations, the remaining amount is zero, the transaction is successful.
   - If not, revert to the original counts and return `[-1]`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(1)` for both deposit and withdraw operations since the denominations are fixed in number (5).

1. **Deposit**: 
   - We always iterate over a fixed array of size 5, resulting in linear time `O(1)` relative to a constant size.

2. **Withdraw**:
   - Similarly, we iterate over the fixed array of denominations, resulting in constant time checks and updates `O(1)`.
