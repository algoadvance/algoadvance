title:  Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length-out
permalink: /s2790
---

You are given an array of integers, `grades`. You need to divide this array into the maximum number of groups, each of which must have strictly increasing lengths.

The length of the groups should satisfy:
- The length of the second group should be greater than the length of the first group,
- The length of the third group should be greater than the length of the second group, and so on.

Return the maximum number of groups you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return, the groups themselves or just the number of groups?**
   - We only need to return the number of groups.

2. **Are there constraints on the size of the `grades` array or the values within the array?**
   - The array can have any length, but for simplicity, let's assume a size constraint of `n` (e.g., \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)).

3. **Can the `grades` array contain negative numbers or zero?**
   - Yes, it can contain any integer values.

4. **Do the actual values within the `grades` array matter when forming groups?**
   - No, only the lengths of the groups matter when forming groups.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll focus on forming the longest sequence of strictly increasing lengths. Here's the strategy:

1. **Identify the Sum of First k Natural Numbers**:
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by \( S_k = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Iterate to Find Maximum `k`**:
   - Iterate from `1` onward to find the maximum number `k` such that \( S_k \leq n \) (where `n` is the length of the `grades` array).

This is because the requirement of having strictly increasing lengths translates to finding the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers does not exceed the length of the `grades` array.

### Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def max_increasing_groups(grades):
    n = len(grades)
    k = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    while current_sum + (k + 1) <= n:
        k += 1
        current_sum += k
        
    return k

# Example usage:
grades = [10, 6, 8, 5, 7, 4, 2, 1, 3]
print(max_increasing_groups(grades))  # Output depends on the length of `grades`
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\sqrt{n}) \)
  - The while loop runs at most \( \sqrt{2n} \) times because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers grows quadratically.

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)
  - We are only using a few additional variables, regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures we can efficiently find the maximum number of groups meeting the rule of strictly increasing lengths.
