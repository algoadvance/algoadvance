title:  Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal-out
permalink: /s1008
---
Given an array of integers that represents the preorder traversal of a binary search tree (BST), construct the BST and return its root.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are all values in the input array unique?
   - What is the maximum possible length of the input array?

2. **Output Specification:**
   - Can the function return the root node of the constructed BST?

3. **Additional Clarifications:**
   - Should we consider balanced BSTs, or is any valid BST acceptable?

Typically, the constraints ensure all values are unique and we'll return the root node of the BST.

### Strategy:
- Given the properties of a BST and a preorder traversal (root -> left -> right), we can devise a recursive strategy to construct the tree.
- We can use a helper function to bound the values for the left and right subtrees.

Here's a step-by-step plan to construct the BST:
1. **Initialize the Index:**
   - Use an index to keep track of the current node being processed in the traversal array.
   
2. **Recursive Construction:**
   - Define a recursive function that takes the range `[lower, upper]` to maintain the BST property.
   - The bounds ensure that each node falls within the valid range.
   
3. **Termination:**
   - If the current index is out of bounds or if the current value doesn't fall within the specified bounds, return `None`.

### Code:
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def bstFromPreorder(preorder):
    # Helper function to build the BST
    def helper(lower=float('-inf'), upper=float('inf')):
        nonlocal idx
        # If all elements are used or the current element is out of bounds
        if idx == len(preorder) or not (lower < preorder[idx] < upper):
            return None
        
        val = preorder[idx]
        idx += 1
        # Construct the current node
        root = TreeNode(val)
        # Build the left and right subtrees
        root.left = helper(lower, val)
        root.right = helper(val, upper)
        return root

    idx = 0
    return helper()

# Example Usage:
preorder = [8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12]
root = bstFromPreorder(preorder)
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Each node is processed exactly once, thus the time complexity at best and worst case scenarios is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree (or length of the preorder array).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The auxiliary space used by the recursion stack depends on the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the height can be \(O(n)\). In the best (balanced tree), it is \(O(\log n)\).

This approach ensures an efficient construction of the BST from its preorder traversal.
