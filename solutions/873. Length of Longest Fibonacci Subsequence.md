title:  Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence-out
permalink: /s873
---

Given a strictly increasing array `arr` of positive integers forming a sequence, write a function `lenLongestFibSubseq` that returns the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. 

A sequence `X1, X2, ..., Xk` is Fibonacci-like if:

- `k >= 3`
- `Xi + Xi+1 = Xi+2` for all `i + 2 <= k`.

If there is no such sequence, return 0.

### Example

**Input:**
```
arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

**Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation:**
```
The longest subsequence that is Fibonacci-like: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum length of the provided array?**
   - The array will have at least 3 elements because the smallest Fibonacci sequence length `k` is 3.

2. **Are there duplicates in the array?**
   - No, the array is strictly increasing, which implies no duplicates.

3. **Can the Fibonacci-like subsequence include non-consecutive elements from the array?**
   - Yes, it can include any elements as long as they follow the Fibonacci property and length criteria.

## Strategy

We need to find the longest subsequence within the array that follows the Fibonacci property. To solve this, we can use a dynamic programming approach:

1. **Use a Set for Quick Lookup:**
   - Construct a set from the array elements to enable O(1) time complexity for checking if a particular element exists.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - Use a dictionary `dp` where `dp[(i, j)]` holds the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence ending with elements at indices `i` and `j`.

3. **Iterate and Update:**
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)` (where `i < j`), compute the previous Fibonacci element as `arr[j] - arr[i]` and check if it exists in the set and also comes before index `i`.
   - If it exists, update `dp[(i, j)]`.

4. **Track the Maximum Length:**
   - Throughout the iterations, keep track of the maximum value in `dp`.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If the maximum length found is greater than or equal to 3, return it; otherwise, return 0.

## Code

```python
def lenLongestFibSubseq(arr):
    arr_set = set(arr)
    n = len(arr)
    dp = {}
    max_len = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            a, b = arr[i], arr[j]
            count = 2
            while a + b in arr_set:
                a, b = b, a + b
                count += 1
            if count >= 3:
                max_len = max(max_len, count)
    
    return max_len if max_len >= 3 else 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The double loop runs in `O(n^2)`, and each internal while loop may run approximately in O(n) at worst as we traverse through the array elements once. This leads us to an overall complexity of O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3) in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The additional space is used for the dictionary `dp` and set `arr_set`, which both have space complexities of O(n). Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n).
