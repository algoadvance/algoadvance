title:  Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves-out
permalink: /s1123
---

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

In a binary tree, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes `p` and `q` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself). A node `r` is a descendant of a node `q` if node `q` lies on the path from `r` to the tree's root.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of deepest leaves?**
   - The deepest leaves are the nodes that have the maximum depth in the tree.

2. **Can the deepest leaves be only leaf nodes?**
   - Yes, by definition, deepest leaves are the nodes which are leaves (no children) at the maximum depth level of the tree.

3. **What should be returned if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, we should return `None`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will adopt a DFS-based approach:

1. **Post-order Traversal**:
   - Perform a post-order traversal (left, right, root) of the tree to visit nodes from bottom to top. 
   - During traversal, calculate the depth of each node and keep track of the deepest leaves.

2. **Identifying LCA**:
   - For each node, check the depth of its left and right subtrees.
   - The LCA of the deepest leaves will be the lowest node where the depths of the left and right subtrees are equal and match the maximum depth of the tree.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - Implement a function that returns both the depth and the LCA of the subtree rooted at each node.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def deepestLeavesLCA(root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return 0, None
        left_depth, left_lca = dfs(node.left)
        right_depth, right_lca = dfs(node.right)
        
        if left_depth > right_depth:
            return left_depth + 1, left_lca
        elif right_depth > left_depth:
            return right_depth + 1, right_lca
        else:
            return left_depth + 1, node
        
    return dfs(root)[1]

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(1)
# root.left = TreeNode(2)
# root.right = TreeNode(3)
# root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
# root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
# root.right.right = TreeNode(6)
# root.left.left.left = TreeNode(7)
# root.right.right.right = TreeNode(8)
# print(deepestLeavesLCA(root).val)  # Output should be 7 or 8â€™s lowest common ancestor
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.

The space complexity is **O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is mainly due to the recursion stack in the DFS traversal which, in the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), can go as deep as the number of nodes in the tree.
