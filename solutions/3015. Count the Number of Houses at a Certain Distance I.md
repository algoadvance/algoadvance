title:  Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance I-out
permalink: /s3015
---

You are given a grid where each cell is either land (0) or a house (1). You are also given a specific distance `d`. Write a function to count the number of houses that are exactly k steps away from any land cell (not less, not more).

For example:
```
Grid:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

d = 2

Output: 4
```

In this example, the houses that are exactly 2 steps away from land cells are 4.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is diagonal movement allowed?**
   - No, only vertical and horizontal movement is allowed.
   
2. **What should be considered as a step?**
   - Moving to an adjacent cell either vertically or horizontally.

3. **Can we assume the grid will be non-empty and will contain at least one house (1) and one land (0)?**
   - Yes, you can assume the grid will contain at least one house and one land cell.

4. **What are the grid size constraints?**
   - You can assume the grid is reasonably small (up to 100x100).

5. **What should be returned if no houses are exactly `d` steps away from any land cell?**
   - Return 0.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**
   - We will use Breadth-First Search to explore each land cell (0) and keep track of the distance.
   - For each land cell, start a BFS and keep a record of the distances in a separate distance matrix.
   - We initialize a queue with all land cells, marking their distance as 0 initially.
   - For each cell processed by the BFS, update its neighboring cells with distance + 1 (if they are houses).

2. **Count the Number of Houses:**
   - After performing BFS for all land cells, traverse the grid to count how many houses have the exact `d` steps recorded.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def count_houses_at_distance(grid, d):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Initialize the distance matrix with -1 (unvisited)
    distance = [[-1] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    queue = deque()
    
    # Enqueue all land cells (0s)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 0:
                queue.append((r, c))
                distance[r][c] = 0
    
    # Perform BFS from all land cells
    while queue:
        row, col = queue.popleft()
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            
            # If it's within bounds and hasn't been visited
            if 0 <= new_row < rows and 0 <= new_col < cols and distance[new_row][new_col] == -1:
                distance[new_row][new_col] = distance[row][col] + 1
                queue.append((new_row, new_col))
    
    # Count houses that are exactly `d` distance away
    count = 0
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 1 and distance[r][c] == d:
                count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0]
]
d = 2
print(count_houses_at_distance(grid, d))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution primarily depends on the BFS traversal.

- **BFS Traversal:** Each cell is visited once, so the total time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.
- **Distance Matrix Initialization and Final Count:** These operations also contribute \(O(m \times n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(m \times n)**.
