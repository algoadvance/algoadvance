title:  Smallest Value of the Rearranged Number-out
permalink: /s2165
---

Given an integer `num`, return the smallest value you can get by rearranging its digits. If there are leading zeros after rearranging, remove them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can `num` be negative or is it always non-negative?
   - What is the range of `num`? Only specified that it's an integer.
   
2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be an integer?

3. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - How should we handle edge cases such as `num` being `0`?

### Strategy

1. **Convert Number to String:**
   - First, convert the number to a string to facilitate the rearrangement of digits.

2. **Handle Negative Numbers:**
   - If the number is negative, convert it to a positive number for sorting, then reapply the negative sign after sorting.

3. **Sort the Digits:**
   - For positive numbers, sort the digits in ascending order.
   - For negative numbers, sort the digits in descending order.

4. **Remove Leading Zeros:**
   - After sorting, leading zeros can be moved to the correct position by ensuring the first digit isn't zero (if possible).

5. **Convert Back to Integer:**
   - Convert the rearranged string back to an integer.

6. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Specifically, ensure that input `0` returns `0`.

### Time Complexity

- The sorting operation is the most computationally expensive part of this solution, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of digits in the input number.

### Code

```python
def smallestNumber(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0:
        return 0
    
    is_negative = num < 0
    num_str = str(abs(num))
    
    sorted_digits = sorted(num_str)
    
    if is_negative:
        # For negative numbers, sort in descending order
        sorted_digits.reverse()
        return -int(''.join(sorted_digits))
    else:
        # For positive numbers, sort in ascending order
        # Ensure no leading zeros
        if sorted_digits[0] == '0':
            for i in range(1, len(sorted_digits)):
                if sorted_digits[i] != '0':
                    # Swap the first non-zero digit with the first position
                    sorted_digits[0], sorted_digits[i] = sorted_digits[i], '0'
                    break
        return int(''.join(sorted_digits))

# Examples to test the function
print(smallestNumber(310))      # Expected output: 103
print(smallestNumber(-7605))    # Expected output: -7650
```

### Explanation

1. **Conversion to String:**
   - Convert `num` to a string to manipulate individual digits.

2. **Negative Handling:**
   - Check if the number is negative. If so, set `is_negative` flag and work with its absolute value.

3. **Sorting the Digits:**
   - Sort the digits in ascending order for positive numbers.
   - For negative numbers, sort in descending order to get the smallest negative value.

4. **Removing Leading Zeros:**
   - Address the leading zeros by ensuring the first digit is non-zero where applicable.

5. **Final Conversion:**
   - Join the sorted digits and convert back to an integer.
   - Apply the negative sign appropriately if the original number was negative.
