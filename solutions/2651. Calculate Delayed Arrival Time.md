title:  Calculate Delayed Arrival Time-out
permalink: /s2651
---

You are given a scheduled arrival time `arrivalTime` (an integer in the range [0, 23]) and a delay duration `delayedTime` (an integer in the range [1, 23]). The task is to calculate the delayed arrival time. The returned time should be in the 24-hour format.

Given:
- `arrivalTime` (int): the initial arrival time in hours.
- `delayedTime` (int): the delay duration in hours.

### Input:
- `arrivalTime` = 10
- `delayedTime` = 5

### Output:
- 15

It should be noted that if the sum exceeds 23, it should wrap around using modulo 24 to represent time in a 24-hour format.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Is the `arrivalTime` given in 24-hour format?
    - Yes, `arrivalTime` is given in 24-hour format (0-23).

2. Should we always return the result in 24-hour format?
    - Yes, always return the result in the 24-hour format.

### Strategy:
1. Add `arrivalTime` and `delayedTime`.
2. Use the modulo operator with 24 to handle any overflow past 23 hours.

### Code:

```python
def findDelayedArrivalTime(arrivalTime: int, delayedTime: int) -> int:
    return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24

# Example usage:
arrivalTime = 10
delayedTime = 5
print(findDelayedArrivalTime(arrivalTime, delayedTime))  # Output: 15
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(1) since we are performing a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.

### Explanation:
1. **Input**: `arrivalTime = 10`, `delayedTime = 5`
   - Calculation: (10 + 5) % 24 = 15
2. The function simply adds the `arrivalTime` and `delayedTime`, and then applies the modulo 24 operation to ensure the time wraps around properly if it exceeds 23 hours.
3. The output is 15, which is the delayed arrival time in a 24-hour format.
