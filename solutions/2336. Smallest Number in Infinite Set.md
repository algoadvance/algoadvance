title:  Smallest Number in Infinite Set-out
permalink: /s2336
---

Design a system that captures the functionality of an "infinite set" of positive integers:
- Initially, the set contains all positive integers starting from 1.
- Implement two methods:

1. `popSmallest()`: This method removes and returns the smallest element in the set.
2. `addBack(num)`: This method adds a positive integer `num` back into the set, if it is not already in the set.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `num`:**
   - Is `num` always guaranteed to be a positive integer?
   - Should we assume any upper limit on the values of `num`?

2. **Concurrency:**
   - Are there any concurrent access concerns?
   - Can we assume single-threaded execution?
  
3. **Efficiency:**
   - Are there any specific constraints on the number of operations or the size of the numbers we might need to handle?

### Assumptions:
1. `num` is always a positive integer.
2. Operations are performed in a single-threaded environment.
3. We need to handle the methods efficiently.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a min-heap to store the numbers that have been added back and are available to be popped again.
   - Use a set to keep track of the numbers that are currently "added back" and are not part of the original infinite set anymore.
   - Use a variable to keep track of the smallest number in the infinite set which has not been added back or popped.

2. **Methods**:
   - **`popSmallest()`:**
     - If the min-heap is not empty, pop the smallest element from the heap.
     - Otherwise, return the next smallest element from the infinite set and increment the tracker.
   - **`addBack(num)`:**
     - If `num` is smaller than the current smallest number that hasn't been returned, and if `num` is not already in the set of added-back numbers, push it to the min-heap and add it to the set.

### Code Implementation

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
import heapq

class SmallestInfiniteSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []
        self.added_back_set = set()
        self.current_smallest = 1

    def popSmallest(self) -> int:
        if self.heap:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(self.heap)
            self.added_back_set.remove(smallest)
            return smallest
        else:
            smallest = self.current_smallest
            self.current_smallest += 1
            return smallest

    def addBack(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num >= self.current_smallest or num in self.added_back_set:
            return
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, num)
        self.added_back_set.add(num)
```

### Time Complexity

1. **`popSmallest()`**: 
   - The heap operation (pop) runs in \(O(\log k)\), where \(k\) is the size of the heap, but if the heap is empty, it's \(O(1)\). The overall complexity is amortized \(O(\log k)\).

2. **`addBack(num)`**: 
   - The heap operation (push) runs in \(O(\log k)\). Checking and adding to the set are \(O(1)\) operations. Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(\log k)\).

The solution ensures that both `popSmallest` and `addBack` are efficient and operate within acceptable time complexity constraints.
