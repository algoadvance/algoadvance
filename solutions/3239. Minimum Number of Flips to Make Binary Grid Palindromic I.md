title:  Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic I-out
permalink: /s3239
---

You are given a `m x n` binary grid `grid` consisting of only `0`s and `1`s. A binary grid is considered palindromic if for each cell `grid[i][j]`, we have `grid[i][j] == grid[m-1-i][n-1-j]`. In one move, you can change any cell's value from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make the grid palindromic.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Size limits of the grid?** 
   - What is the maximum size of the grid (i.e., maximum values for `m` and `n`)?

2. **Edge cases?**
   - What should we return if the grid is already palindromic?
   - What should we do with grids that are non-square (i.e., `m != n`)?

3. **Input Validation?**
   - Can we assume that all entries in the grid are either `0` or `1`?
   
4. **Output?**
   - Do we need just the minimum number of moves or the sequence of changes as well?

## Strategy

Given a binary grid, make it palindromic by ensuring each cell `grid[i][j]` is equal to `grid[m-1-i][n-1-j]`. The minimum number of moves required to achieve this can be determined by comparing pairs of cells and changing the minimum number of cells in each pair.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize Counters:** 
   - Initialize a move counter to zero.

2. **Iterate through Grid:** 
   - Using nested loops, compare each cell `grid[i][j]` to its corresponding cell `grid[m-1-i][n-1-j]`.

3. **Identify Mismatch:**
   - For each pair of cells that don't match, determine how many flips (0s to 1s or 1s to 0s) are required.

4. **Update Counters:**
   - Accumulate the total number of flips needed.

5. **Return Result:**
   - Return the total count of moves required.

### Time Complexity
- **O(m*n/2):** Since each cell is only compared once with its symmetric counterpart, the time complexity is linear with respect to the number of cells in the grid.

## Code

Here's how you could implement this:

```python
def minFlipsToMakeGridPalindromic(grid):
    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0])
    moves = 0
    
    for i in range(m // 2):
        for j in range(n):
            # Compare grid[i][j] with grid[m-1-i][n-1-j]
            pair_a = grid[i][j]
            pair_b = grid[m-1-i][n-1-j]
            
            if pair_a != pair_b:
                moves += 1
                
    # If the grid has an odd number of rows, compare the middle row separately
    if m % 2 == 1:
        middle_row = m // 2
        for j in range(n // 2):
            if grid[middle_row][j] != grid[middle_row][n-1-j]:
                moves += 1
    
    return moves

# Example Usage:
grid = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 1]
]

print(minFlipsToMakeGridPalindromic(grid))  # Output should reflect the minimum flips needed
```

This function iterates through the grid, checking for mismatches between the cells and their mirrored counterparts. Any mismatches found are counted, and the total number of such mismatches gives the minimum number of flips required.
