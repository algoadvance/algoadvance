title:  Implement Stack using Queues-out
permalink: /s225
---

Implement a stack using queues. You should implement the following operations of a stack using standard queue operations:
1. `push(x)` -- Push element x onto stack.
2. `pop()` -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
3. `top()` -- Get the top element.
4. `empty()` -- Return whether the stack is empty.

**Notes:**
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top operations will be called on an empty stack).
- You can only use standard operations of a queue which means only `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `size`, and `isEmpty` operations are allowed.

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few things:

1. Can we use built-in Python `queue` (like `collections.deque` or `queue.Queue`) to implement the solution?
2. Do we have any constraints on the number or size of operations we can perform?
3. Should the operations be optimized for time complexity or are we aiming for a simpler implementation?

Let's assume standard constraints and built-in Python `queue` usage is allowed unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy

We can maintain two queues (`q1` and `q2`) to manage the stack operations effectively:

1. **Push Operation (`push(x)`):**
   - Enqueue the element `x` to `q2`.
   - Dequeue all elements of `q1` and enqueue them to `q2`.
   - Swap the names of `q1` and `q2`.

2. **Pop Operation (`pop()`):**
   - Simply dequeue from `q1` (as it holds the current stack elements in the correct order).

3. **Top Operation (`top()`):**
   - Return the front element of `q1` (peek without dequeuing).

4. **Empty Operation (`empty()`):**
   - Check if `q1` is empty (using its isEmpty method).

This will ensure that all stack operations are simulated using queue operations.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

class MyStack:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.q1 = deque()
        self.q2 = deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q2.append(x)
        while self.q1:
            self.q2.append(self.q1.popleft())
        self.q1, self.q2 = self.q2, self.q1

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.q1.popleft()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.q1[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.q1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Push Operation:** `O(n)` - Since we move all elements from `q1` to `q2` and then swap.
- **Pop Operation:** `O(1)` - Direct dequeuing from `q1`.
- **Top Operation:** `O(1)` - Direct access to the front element of `q1`.
- **Empty Operation:** `O(1)` - Checking if `q1` is empty.

This approach ensures that our stack operations are correctly managed using two queues, while keeping most operations efficient.
