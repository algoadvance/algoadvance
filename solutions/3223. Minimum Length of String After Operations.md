title:  Minimum Length of String After Operations-out
permalink: /s3223
---

We are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. In one operation, we can either:
1. Choose two adjacent characters in the string such that they are equal and remove both of them, or
2. Choose two adjacent characters in the string such that they are not equal and remove both of them.

We want to determine the minimum possible length of the string after performing any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input string `s`?**
   This would help to understand the potential edge cases and optimize the solution accordingly.
   
2. **Can the string be empty?**
   We need to handle cases when the string is empty to avoid unnecessary operations.
   
3. **Is there any restriction on the number of operations?**
   Knowing whether thereâ€™s a limit on the number of operations can affect how we approach the solution.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a **stack**:

1. We will iterate through each character in the string `s`.
2. For each character, we will check the top element of the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, or the top element of the stack is not the same as the current character, we push the current character to the stack.
   - If the top element of the stack is the same as the current character, we pop the top element from the stack (since they can be removed in one operation).
3. After processing all characters, the remaining characters in the stack will represent the minimum possible length of the string after performing the operations.

### Code

```python
def minLengthAfterOperations(s: str) -> int:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if stack and stack[-1] == char:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)
            
    return len(stack)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we process each character exactly once, either by pushing it onto the stack or popping it from the stack, making the operations linear in complexity.

The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case, if no characters can be removed (i.e., the entire string remains in the stack).

Using this approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible length of the string after performing the necessary operations.
