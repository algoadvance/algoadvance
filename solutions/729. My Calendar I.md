title:  My Calendar I-out
permalink: /s729
---
You are implementing a program to manage a calendar of events. Each event is defined by two integers: a start time and an end time. Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

1. `MyCalendar()`: Initializes the calendar object.
2. `bool book(int start, int end)`: Attempts to book an event from `start` to `end` (exclusive). If there is no conflicting event that overlaps with this time range, the event can be booked and the method returns `True`. Otherwise, the method returns `False`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Event Boundaries**: Is the end time inclusive or exclusive? This is important for determining overlaps.
   - The end time is exclusive.
2. **Time Range**: What is the range of possible values for `start` and `end`?
   - The range for `start` and `end` is not explicitly stated but will likely be within a manageable size for memory and computational purposes.
3. **Concurrent Calls**: Will the calendar system handle concurrent calls?
   - Assume no concurrency issues (synchronous single-threaded environment).

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll keep a list to store the intervals of the booked events. For each new booking, we will:
1. Iterate through the list of booked events.
2. Check for any overlap with the new event.
   - An overlap occurs if `start < booked_event_end` and `end > booked_event_start`.
3. If an overlap is found, return `False`.
4. If no overlap is found after checking all booked events, add the new event to the list and return `True`.

This approach ensures that we accurately manage overlapping events while maintaining the simplicity.

### Code
```python
class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the list to store booked intervals
        self.booked = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # Check for overlap with existing bookings
        for s, e in self.booked:
            if start < e and end > s:
                return False
        # If no overlap, book the event
        self.booked.append((start, end))
        return True
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity for each `book` call is `O(n)` in worst case, where `n` is the number of currently booked events. This is because we need to check every existing booking for potential overlaps.
- Space complexity is `O(n)` since we store each booking.
