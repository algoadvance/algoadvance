title:  Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent-out
permalink: /s1662
---

The problem is defined as follows:

*Given two string arrays `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if the two arrays represent the same string, and `false` otherwise.*

A string array represents a string formed by concatenating its elements in order. For example, if `word1 = ["ab", "c"]`, then it represents the string `"abc"`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of `word1` and `word2`?
    - What is the maximum length of each individual string within the arrays?
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if both arrays are empty?
    - Can the arrays contain empty strings as part of their elements?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Concatenate Elements**:
    - Concatenate all the elements of `word1` to form a single string `str1`.
    - Concatenate all the elements of `word2` to form a single string `str2`.
2. **Comparison**:
    - Compare `str1` and `str2`. If they are equal, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def arrayStringsAreEqual(word1, word2):
    # Join all elements of word1 and word2
    str1 = ''.join(word1)
    str2 = ''.join(word2)
    
    # Compare the joined strings
    return str1 == str2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is determined by the time it takes to concatenate the strings:

- **Concatenation**:
    - Let `n` be the total length of all strings in `word1`.
    - Let `m` be the total length of all strings in `word2`.
    - Concatenating all strings in `word1` takes O(n) time.
    - Concatenating all strings in `word2` takes O(m) time.

- **Comparison**: 
    - Comparing two strings of length `n` and `m` in the worst case can take O(min(n, m)).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

### Example

```python
word1 = ["ab", "c"]
word2 = ["a", "bc"]

print(arrayStringsAreEqual(word1, word2))  # Output: True
```
