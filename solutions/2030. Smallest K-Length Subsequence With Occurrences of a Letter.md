title:  Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter-out
permalink: /s2030
---

You're given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a character `letter`, and an integer `repetition`. Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length `k` from the string `s` such that the `letter` appears at least `repetition` times in the subsequence. If no such subsequence exists, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `k` be greater than the length of the string `s`?**
   - No, `k` will always be less than or equal to `s.length`.

2. **Can `repetition` be greater than `k` or the number of occurrences of `letter` in `s`?**
   - No, `repetition` will always be a valid number such that there exists at least one subsequence of length `k` with the `letter` appearing at least `repetition` times.

3. **What should we return if no valid subsequence is found?**
   - Since `repetition` is guaranteed to be valid, this situation does not occur.

### Strategy

To find the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length `k` with at least `repetition` occurrences of `letter`, follow these steps:

1. **Maintain a Stack**: Use a stack to build the smallest subsequence.
2. **Track Remaining Counts**: Keep track of the number of remaining `letter` in the string.
3. **Iterate through the String**: Process each character in the string while maintaining the conditions for the subsequence:
   - Compare and possibly pop elements from the stack to ensure lexicographical order.
   - Ensure that popping an element does not invalidate the subsequence requirements.
   - Push the current character onto the stack if conditions allow.

### Code

```python
def smallestSubsequence(s: str, k: int, letter: str, repetition: int) -> str:
    stack = []
    letter_count = s.count(letter)
    needed_letters = repetition
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        while stack and stack[-1] > char and (len(stack) - 1 + len(s) - i >= k) and (stack[-1] != letter or letter_count > needed_letters):
            popped_char = stack.pop()
            if popped_char == letter:
                needed_letters += 1
        
        if len(stack) < k:
            if char == letter:
                stack.append(char)
                needed_letters -= 1
            elif k - len(stack) > needed_letters:
                stack.append(char)
        
        if char == letter:
            letter_count -= 1

    return ''.join(stack[:k])

# Example usage:
s = "abacb"
k = 3
letter = "b"
repetition = 1
print(smallestSubsequence(s, k, letter, repetition))  # Output: "acb"
```

### Time Complexity

The algorithm processes each character in the string once and maintains a stack. Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. The operations on the stack (push and pop) are \(O(1)\), ensuring efficient processing throughout the string.

This approach ensures that we find the smallest subsequence of the required length and letter occurrence while adhering to lexicographical order constraints efficiently.
