title:  Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s235
---
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
"The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that both nodes `p` and `q` are present in the BST?
2. Do the values of the nodes in the BST follow the BST properties strictly (i.e., left child < parent < right child)?
3. Can the given nodes `p` and `q` be the same node?
4. Is it guaranteed that the input tree is a valid BST?

Assuming:
- Both `p` and `q` are present in the BST.
- The BST properties are strictly followed.
- `p` and `q` are distinct nodes.
- The tree is a valid BST.

### Strategy
1. Utilize the properties of the BST to guide the search for the LCA.
2. Start from the root node.
3. If both `p` and `q` are greater than the current node, move to the right subtree.
4. If both `p` and `q` are less than the current node, move to the left subtree.
5. If one of `p` or `q` is smaller and the other is larger, then the current node is the LCA.
6. Return the node where the above conditions stop holding true for further traversal.

### Code
Here's the implementation in python:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # Start with the root node
        current = root
        
        # Iterate through the tree
        while current:
            # If both p and q are greater than parent
            if p.val > current.val and q.val > current.val:
                current = current.right
            # If both p and q are lesser than parent
            elif p.val < current.val and q.val < current.val:
                current = current.left
            else:
                # We have found the split point i.e. the LCA node.
                return current
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(h), where `h` is the height of the binary search tree. 
- In the best case, the height `h` could be `log(n)` for a balanced tree. 
- In the worst case, the height `h` could be `n` for a degenerate (linked list-like) tree.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
