You are given `k` eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors from 1 to `n`. Each egg is identical and has the following properties:
- If you drop an egg from a floor `f` or higher, it will break.
- If you drop an egg from a floor less than `f`, it will not break.
- You can reuse an egg that does not break in subsequent drops.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of attempts needed in the worst case to find the critical floor `f`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can an egg that has not broken on one floor be dropped from another floor?**
   - Yes, eggs that do not break can be reused.

2. **Does the floor count start from 1?**
   - Yes, floors are numbered from 1 to `n`.

3. **What constitutes a valid drop?**
   - A drop is valid if it helps in determining the critical floor `f`.

### Strategy
We'll use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently.

#### Step-by-Step Strategy
1. **Define the DP state:**
   - Let `dp[k][m]` represent the maximum number of floors that can be checked with `k` eggs and `m` moves.
   
2. **Base Cases:**
   - If we have 0 moves, no floors can be checked: `dp[k][0] = 0`.
   - If we have 1 move, we can only check one floor: `dp[k][1] = 1`.
   - If we have 1 egg, we can only check up to `m` floors linearly with `m` moves: `dp[1][m] = m`.
   
3. **Transition:**
   - For each state `dp[k][m]`, we can drop an egg from a chosen floor `x`.
   - If it breaks, we must search the floors below with `k-1` eggs and `m-1` moves.
   - If it doesn't break, we must search the floors above with `k` eggs and `m-1` moves.
   - Combining these two, the state transition can be defined as:
     ```
     dp[k][m] = dp[k-1][m-1] + dp[k][m-1] + 1
     ```
   - This means that with `k` eggs and `m` moves we can check the combined total of floors by deducting our current move from the remaining moves.

4. **Find the Minimum Number of Moves:**
   - We increment the number of moves until `dp[k][m]` is sufficient to cover `n` floors.

### Code Implementation

```python
def superEggDrop(k: int, n: int) -> int:
    # If we have only one egg, we need to check linearly all floors
    if k == 1:
        return n
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    
    m = 0  # the number of moves
    while dp[k][m] < n:
        m += 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[i][m] = dp[i-1][m-1] + dp[i][m-1] + 1
            
    return m
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(k * log(n))`:
- The `while` loop continues until we can cover `n` floors, effectively making the time complexity logarithmic relative to `n`.
- Within each iteration, we iterate through up to `k` eggs for updating our DP table.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of moves necessary to determine the critical floor using `k` eggs and `n` floors.
