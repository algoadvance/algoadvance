title:  Number of Paths with Max Score-out
permalink: /s1301
---

You are given a square board of characters. You can move on the board starting at the bottom-right corner marked with the character 'S'. You need to reach the top-left corner marked with the character 'E'. The rest of the board is filled with non-negative digits ('0' to '9'). Each move that you make, if you land on a cell with a digit, it increases your score by the value of that digit.

You can move to the left, right, or up from a cell.

You need to find two things:

1. The maximum score you can achieve by reaching the top-left corner.
2. The number of distinct paths that will lead to achieving this maximum score.

Since the number of paths can be large, return the result as a list: [maximum_score, number_of_paths], where number_of_paths should be taken modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be obstacles or special characters on the board other than 'S', 'E', and digits?
   - No, the board only contains 'S', 'E', and digits from '0' to '9'.

2. Can you detail how movements are allowed?
   - You are allowed to move up, left, or right from any cell on the board.

3. Is the board always guaranteed to have a valid path from 'S' to 'E'?
   - Not necessarily, but we need to account for cases where no valid path exists.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will perform dynamic programming to keep track of two things:
     - `max_score[r][c]` - the maximum score to reach (r, c).
     - `path_count[r][c]` - the number of ways to reach (r, c) with the maximum score.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction**:
   - Iterate over the board from bottom-right to top-left.
   - For each cell (r, c), consider the cells from which we can move to (r, c):
     - From right `board[r][c + 1]` (if c+1 is within bounds)
     - From down `board[r + 1][c]` (if r+1 is within bounds)
     - From left `board[r][c - 1]` (if c-1 is within bounds)

3. **Transition and Update State**:
   - Update the max score at `board[r][c]` using the possible previous cells.
   - Update the number of paths using the paths leading to the cell which provided the max score.

4. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure the path passes valid cells, avoid obstacles or non-reachable cells.
   - Adjust the counting modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing, the result for the top-left cell should reflect the maximum score and the number of ways to achieve this score from 'S' to 'E'.

### Code

```python
def pathsWithMaxScore(board):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(board)
    
    # Initialize dp arrays with -inf for max score and 0 for path count
    max_score = [[-float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
    path_count = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Starting point 'S', the score is 0 and 1 way to be here
    max_score[n-1][n-1] = 0
    path_count[n-1][n-1] = 1
    
    # Traverse the board starting from the bottom-right corner
    for r in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        for c in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if board[r][c] in 'XSE':
                continue
            
            current_value = int(board[r][c]) if board[r][c].isdigit() else 0
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)]:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if nr < n and nc < n and max_score[nr][nc] != -float('inf'):
                    if max_score[nr][nc] + current_value > max_score[r][c]:
                        max_score[r][c] = max_score[nr][nc] + current_value
                        path_count[r][c] = path_count[nr][nc]
                    elif max_score[nr][nc] + current_value == max_score[r][c]:
                        path_count[r][c] += path_count[nr][nc]
                        path_count[r][c] %= MOD

    end_max_score = max_score[0][0]
    end_path_count = path_count[0][0]

    if end_max_score == -float('inf'):
        return [0, 0]
    
    return [end_max_score, end_path_count]

# Example usage:
board = [
    "E23",
    "2X2",
    "12S"
]
print(pathsWithMaxScore(board))  # Output: [7, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid (since we scan each cell and its neighbors).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the DP tables `max_score` and `path_count`.
