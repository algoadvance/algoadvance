title:  Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful-out
permalink: /s2914
---

You are given a binary string `s`. A binary string is considered "beautiful" if it doesn't contain any of the substrings "010" or "101". Your task is to determine the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.

### Clarifying Questions

To better understand the problem, here are a couple of questions:
1. What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?
2. Are we allowed to change both `'0'` and `'1'` characters?
3. Is there any constraint on the number of changes we can make?

### Given Information

1. The string consists of only `'0'` and `'1'`.
2. We need to avoid the specific patterns "010" and "101".

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. We will iterate through the string and check for the patterns "010" and "101".
2. Whenever we encounter one of these patterns, we can change the middle character to avoid having the pattern.
3. We will count the minimum changes required as we iterate over the string.

### Time Complexity

The described approach involves iterating through the string once, which makes the time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

### Python Code

Here is the implementation that follows the described strategy:

```python
def min_changes_to_beautiful(s: str) -> int:
    changes = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(s) - 2:
        # Check for the pattern "010" or "101"
        if s[i:i+3] == "010" or s[i:i+3] == "101":
            # Change the middle character (second character in the triplet)
            changes += 1
            # Move the pointer to skip past this triplet to avoid overlapping changes
            i += 3
        else:
            i += 1
    return changes

# Example usage
s = "0101010"
print(min_changes_to_beautiful(s))  # Output should be 2
```

### Explanation

1. The loop iterates over the string until the third-last character.
2. For each triplet (sequence of three consecutive characters), it checks if the triplet matches either "010" or "101".
3. If a match is found, it increments the `changes` counter by 1 and skips the next two characters to avoid overlapping changes.
4. Finally, it returns the total number of changes required.

This solution efficiently ensures that minimal changes are made to the string to make it beautiful.
