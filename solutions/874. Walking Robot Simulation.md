title:  Walking Robot Simulation-out
permalink: /s874
---

The problem is taken from LeetCode (Problem 874: Walking Robot Simulation). Here is the complete problem statement:

A robot is walking in a 2-dimensional grid starting from the origin point (0, 0). The robot can be controlled using commands represented by an integer array. Each command can be:
1. A positive integer `x` which means the robot moves forward `x` units.
2. A value `-1` which means the robot turns 90 degrees to the right.
3. A value `-2` which means the robot turns 90 degrees to the left.

Additionally, there are obstacles located on the grid that the robot must avoid. The obstacles are represented as a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents the coordinates of an obstacle `(ox, oy)`.

The task is to find the maximum Euclidean distance squared from the origin that the robot can reach after executing all the commands.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the initial direction and position of the robot?**
   - The robot starts at the origin `(0, 0)` facing north.

2. **How are obstacles specified?**
   - Obstacles are given as a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the coordinates `(x, y)` of an obstacle.

3. **Are the grid dimensions predefined or infinite?**
   - We can assume the grid is infinite.

4. **Does the robot stop moving if it encounters an obstacle?**
   - Yes, the robot stops before hitting an obstacle and waits for the next command.

### Strategy

Given the problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start at position `(0, 0)` with the initial direction as "north".

2. **Movement & Direction Handling:**
   - Use a dictionary or list to manage the direction transitions.
   - Implement turn commands (`-1` and `-2`) to alter the direction.
   - Handle move commands (positive integers) to update the position, considering obstacles.

3. **Calculating Distance:**
   - Keep track of the maximum Euclidean distance squared to avoid computing square roots.

### Code

Here's the complete implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def robotSim(commands, obstacles):
    # Initial position and direction (north)
    x, y = 0, 0
    # Directions: north, east, south, west
    directions = [ (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0) ]
    current_direction = 0
    
    # Convert obstacles to a set of tuples for faster access
    obstacles = set(map(tuple, obstacles))
    
    max_distance = 0
    
    for command in commands:
        if command == -1:
            # Turn right
            current_direction = (current_direction + 1) % 4
        elif command == -2:
            # Turn left
            current_direction = (current_direction - 1) % 4
        else:
            # Move forward 'command' steps
            dx, dy = directions[current_direction]
            for _ in range(command):
                # Calculate the next position
                next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy
                # Check if the next position is an obstacle
                if (next_x, next_y) in obstacles:
                    break
                # Update the position
                x, y = next_x, next_y
                # Update the maximum distance
                max_distance = max(max_distance, x*x + y*y)
                
    return max_distance

# Example usage
commands = [4, -1, 3]
obstacles = []
print(robotSim(commands, obstacles))  # Output: 25

commands = [4, -1, 4, -2, 4]
obstacles = [[2, 4]]
print(robotSim(commands, obstacles))  # Output: 65
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(|obstacles|) for converting the obstacles list to a set.
- **Processing commands:** Iterate over each command and within each command, iterate up to the given steps. Each move checks set membership in constant time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:

- **O(N + |commands|),** where N is the number of obstacles and |commands| is the length of the command list. Each step of the command involves checking if a position is an obstacle, which is O(1) with a set.

This implementation ensures efficiency and effectively handles the problem constraints.
