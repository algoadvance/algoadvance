title:  Palindrome Partitioning II-out
permalink: /s132
---

The problem "132. Palindrome Partitioning II" on LeetCode is stated as follows:

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 0
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["a"] does not need any cuts.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "ab"
Output: 1
Explanation: The palindrome partitioning ["a","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
```

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
  - **A:** The length of `s` will be at most \(2000\).
- **Q:** Is the input string guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?
  - **A:** Yes, the string consists of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use a dynamic programming approach. The initial idea is to two main steps:

1. **Palindrome Checking:** First, create a 2D table to store whether a substring `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
2. **Dynamic Programming for Minimum Cuts:** Use a 1D array to store the minimum number of cuts needed for the substring `s[0:i]`.

**Step-by-Step Strategy:**
1. **Initialize a 2D array `is_palindrome` such that `is_palindrome[i][j]` will be `True` if `s[i:j+1]` is a palindrome.
2. **Initialize a 1D array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum cuts needed to partition the substring `s[0:i+1]` into palindromic substrings.
3. Fill the `is_palindrome` table:
   - A single character is always a palindrome.
   - For substrings of length 2, check if both characters are the same.
   - For longer substrings, a substring `s[i:j]` is a palindrome if `s[i] == s[j]` and the substring `s[i+1:j-1]` is also a palindrome.
4. Fill the `dp` array using the `is_palindrome` table:
   - If `s[0:i+1]` is a palindrome, `dp[i] = 0`.
   - Otherwise, compute `dp[i]` by considering every possible cut point `j` and update `dp[i]` based on previous results.

### Code

```python
def minCut(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Step 1: Initialize the is_palindrome table
    is_palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        is_palindrome[i][i] = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        is_palindrome[i][i + 1] = (s[i] == s[i + 1])
    
    for length in range(3, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            is_palindrome[i][j] = (s[i] == s[j] and is_palindrome[i + 1][j - 1])
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the DP array for min cuts needed
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if is_palindrome[0][i]:
            dp[i] = 0
        else:
            for j in range(i):
                if is_palindrome[j + 1][i]:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return dp[-1]

# Example Usage
print(minCut("aab"))  # Output: 1
print(minCut("a"))    # Output: 0
print(minCut("ab"))   # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Palindrome Checking:** The `is_palindrome` table is filled in \(O(n^2)\) time.
- **Minimum Cuts Calculation:** The dynamic programming array `dp` is filled in \(O(n^2)\) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).
