title:  Wildcard Matching-out

---

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

- '?' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

### Example:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `s = "aa"`, `p = "a"`
  - Output: `false`
  - Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `s = "aa"`, `p = "*"`
  - Output: `true`
  - Explanation: '*' can match any sequence.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `s = "cb"`, `p = "?a"`
  - Output: `false`
  - Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but 'a' does not match 'b'.

### Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the pattern `p` be empty, and how should it be treated when `s` is non-empty?
2. Can multiple '*' appear consecutively in the pattern, and should they be treated as a single '*'?

## Strategy

1. Dynamic Programming: Use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will be True if the first `i` characters in the string `s` match the first `j` characters in the pattern `p`.
2. Initialization:
    - `dp[0][0]` is True because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
    - `dp[0][j]` should be True if all preceding characters in `p` are '*', since '*' can match an empty sequence.
3. Populate the DP table:
    - If `p[j-1]` is `*`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` (match current character in `s` with `*`) or `dp[i][j-1]` (treat `*` as matching no character).
    - If `p[j-1]` is `?` or `s[i-1] == p[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.

## Code

```python
def isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    dp[0][0] = True  # empty pattern matches empty string
    
    # Initialize first row
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[j-1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j-1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or dp[i][j-1]
            elif p[j-1] == '?' or s[i-1] == p[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
    
    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage:
s = "aa"
p = "*"
print(isMatch(s, p))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the length of the string `s` and `n` is the length of the pattern `p`. We need to fill a DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the DP table.

This approach uses dynamic programming to ensure that every subproblem is solved only once, making it efficient for the given constraints.
