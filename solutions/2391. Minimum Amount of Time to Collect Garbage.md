title:  Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage-out
permalink: /s2391
---

You are given three arrays `garbage`, `travel`, and `time`.

- `garbage[i]` is a string of characters, where each character is either 'M' (metal), 'P' (paper), or 'G' (glass). This string represents the garbage that needs to be collected on the i-th house, where each character in the string represents a distinct piece of garbage.
- `travel[i]` is an array where `travel[i]` represents the time needed to travel from house `i` to house `i + 1`.

You are a garbage collector and you have three trucks: one for each type of garbage (metal, paper, glass). Each truck starts at house 0 and can move from one house to the next in sequence.

The goal is to determine the minimum amount of time required to collect all types of garbage from all the houses.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can all trucks travel simultaneously, or do they collect garbage sequentially?
2. Does the time it takes to collect the garbage from a house depend on the amount of garbage?

### Code

```python
def minTimeToCollectGarbage(garbage, travel):
    # Total time to collect all garbage in each house
    total_collect_time = sum(map(len, garbage))
    
    # Time taken for last truck of each type to reach its maximum house
    last_m, last_p, last_g = 0, 0, 0
    
    # Traverse all houses
    for i in range(len(garbage)):
        if 'M' in garbage[i]:
            last_m = i
        if 'P' in garbage[i]:
            last_p = i
        if 'G' in garbage[i]:
            last_g = i
    
    # Total travel time for each truck
    travel_time = 0
    for i in range(1, len(garbage)): # travel time is only between house 1 to n-1
        if i <= last_m:
            travel_time += travel[i - 1]
        if i <= last_p:
            travel_time += travel[i - 1]
        if i <= last_g:
            travel_time += travel[i - 1]
    
    return total_collect_time + travel_time

# Example usage:
garbage = ["G","P","GP","GG"]
travel = [2,4,3]
print(minTimeToCollectGarbage(garbage, travel))  # Output: 21
```

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Collection Time**: The time it takes to collect all garbage is the sum of the lengths of all strings in the `garbage` array.
2. **Determine Last Houses**: For each type of garbage (metal 'M', paper 'P', glass 'G'), determine the last house that contains that type.
3. **Calculate Travel Time**: 
   - For each house that any garbage truck needs to reach, add the travel time to the total travel time. This is up to the last house containing each garbage type.
   
### Time Complexity

- **O(n + m)** where `n` is the number of houses and `m` is the total length of all garbage strings. The complexity is linear because we make two passes through the `garbage` array: one to calculate the collection times and determine the last relevant houses, and one to sum the travel times.
