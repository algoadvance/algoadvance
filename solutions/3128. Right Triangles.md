title:  Right Triangles-out

---

Given an integer matrix `points` representing distinct points in a 2D plane, the task is to count the number of right-angled triangles that can be formed using three points from the matrix. The matrix `points` has dimensions `n x 2`, where each entry represents the coordinates of a point.

A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the points guaranteed to be distinct?**
   - Yes, the problem states that the points are distinct.

2. **What are the constraints on the size of the matrix `points`?**
   - Typically, the constraints will be such that an efficient solution is necessary, but without specific constraints, we will assume it fits in memory and standard time limits.

3. **Do we need to consider floating-point precision for right angles?**
   - No, since we are working with integer coordinates, we will be using integer arithmetic to determine the presence of right angles.

### Strategy

To determine if a triangle formed by three points (A, B, C) is a right-angled triangle, we can use the following property related to vectors:

- If `A(x1, y1)`, `B(x2, y2)`, and `C(x3, y3)` are the points, a triangle is right-angled if the dot product of at least one pair of its vectors is zero (indicating perpendicularity).

We can derive vectors from combinations of these points:
- Vector AB = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
- Vector AC = (x3 - x1, y3 - y1)
- Vector BC = (x3 - x2, y3 - y2)

Check if any of these vector pairs produce a dot product of zero:
- AB ⋅ AC
- AB ⋅ BC
- AC ⋅ BC

Where two vectors (a1, b1) and (a2, b2) have a dot product calculated as:
\[ a1 \cdot a2 + b1 \cdot b2 \]

### Code

```python
def count_right_triangles(points):
    n = len(points)
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                x1, y1 = points[i]
                x2, y2 = points[j]
                x3, y3 = points[k]
                
                # Calculate vectors
                AB = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
                AC = (x3 - x1, y3 - y1)
                BC = (x3 - x2, y3 - y2)
                
                # Check the dot products
                if (AB[0] * AC[0] + AB[1] * AC[1] == 0 or
                    AB[0] * BC[0] + AB[1] * BC[1] == 0 or
                    AC[0] * BC[0] + AC[1] * BC[1] == 0):
                    count += 1

    return count

# Example usage:
points = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 0]]
print(count_right_triangles(points))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^3)\), where \(n\) is the number of points. This is because we are checking all possible combinations of three points to see if they form a right-angled triangle. Although this is a straightforward solution, it could be optimized further if the constraints require it.
