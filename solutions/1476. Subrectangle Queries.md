title:  Subrectangle Queries-out
permalink: /s1476
---
You are given a `SubrectangleQueries` class with the following operations:

1. `SubrectangleQueries(int[][] rectangle)` - Initializes the object with a rectangular grid of integers `rectangle`.
2. `void updateSubrectangle(int row1, int col1, int row2, int col2, int newValue)` - Updates all values with `newValue` in the subrectangle whose upper left coordinate is `(row1, col1)` and bottom right coordinate is `(row2, col2)`.
3. `int getValue(int row, int col)` - Returns the current value of the coordinate `(row, col)`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Rectangle Mutability:** Should the updates be done in-place on the original rectangle, or is it acceptable to retain a history of updates?
2. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the rectangle and the values within the rectangle?
3. **Usage Frequency:** Can it be assumed that the `getValue` operation is called more frequently than the `updateSubrectangle`?

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Store the current state of the rectangle.
2. **Update:** When updating a subrectangle, iterate through the specified bounds and update each cell with the new value.
3. **Get Value:** Directly return the value from the rectangle at the specified coordinates.

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization `O(m * n)` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the rectangle.
2. **Update Subrectangle `O((row2 - row1 + 1) * (col2 - col1 + 1))`:** This requires updating all cells in the specified subrectangle.
3. **Get Value `O(1)`:** Direct access to a specific cell.

### Solution

Here is a Python class to implement the described functionality:

```python
class SubrectangleQueries:
    def __init__(self, rectangle):
        self.rectangle = rectangle

    def updateSubrectangle(self, row1, col1, row2, col2, newValue):
        for i in range(row1, row2 + 1):
            for j in range(col1, col2 + 1):
                self.rectangle[i][j] = newValue

    def getValue(self, row, col):
        return self.rectangle[row][col]
```

### Example Usage
```python
# Initializing the rectangle
rectangle = [
    [1, 2, 1],
    [4, 3, 4],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
subrectangle = SubrectangleQueries(rectangle)

# Get value at (0, 2)
print(subrectangle.getValue(0, 2)) # Output: 1

# Update subrectangle from (0, 0) to (2, 2) to have all values 5
subrectangle.updateSubrectangle(0, 0, 2, 2, 5)

# Get value at (0, 2) after update
print(subrectangle.getValue(0, 2)) # Output: 5
```

This solution meets the problem requirements by providing a class that correctly updates and retrieves values from the rectangle. The implemented methods ensure the necessary operations for subrectangle updates and value retrieval are executed efficiently.
