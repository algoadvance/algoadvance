Given two positive integers `left` and `right` represented as strings, return the number of **super-palindromes** in the inclusive range `[left, right]`. 

A **super-palindrome** is a number that is a palindrome and whose square root is also a palindrome.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Both `left` and `right` are strings but represent positive integers.
   - 1 <= int(`left`), int(`right`), <= 10^18.
   
2. **Output**:
   - An integer representing the number of super-palindromes in the given range.

3. **Examples**:
   - Input: `left = "4", right = "1000"`
     Output: 4
     Explanation: 4 super-palindromes in range are [4, 9, 121, 484]. Their roots [2, 3, 11, 22] are all palindromes.

4. **Definition Clarification**:
   - A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
   - A super-palindrome is a number that is both a palindrome and whose square root is also a palindrome.

## Strategy

1. **Generate Palindromic Numbers**:
   - Generate palindromic numbers for the square roots up to the square root of `right`.

2. **Check Constraints**:
   - For each of these palindromic numbers, check if its square lies between `left` and `right`.
   - Check if the square itself is also a palindrome.

3. **Palindrome Checker**:
   - Use a helper function to determine if a number (or string) is a palindrome.

## Code

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    return string == string[::-1]

def superpalindromesInRange(left: str, right: str) -> int:
    l = int(left)
    r = int(right)
    
    MAGIC = 100000
    
    count = 0
    
    # Generate palindromes up to MAGIC
    def create_palindromes(magic):
        palindromes = set()
        # Odd length palindromes
        for i in range(magic):
            s = str(i)
            palindromes.add(int(s + s[::-1][1:]))  # Odd length palindrome i, ii, iii, etc
            palindromes.add(int(s + s[::-1]))      # Even length palindrome ii, iv, vi, etc
        return palindromes
    
    palindromic_numbers = create_palindromes(MAGIC)
    
    for num in palindromic_numbers:
        num_square = num**2
        
        # Check if the squared number is between left and right and is a palindrome
        if num_square > r:
            break
        if num_square >= l and is_palindrome(str(num_square)):
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Palindrome Generation**: 
   - Generating palindromes up to `MAGIC` (which is 100,000) takes \(O(MAGIC)\).

2. **Checking Conditions**: 
   - For each palindromic number, checking the square and verifying if it is a palindrome also takes \(O(MAGIC)\).

Overall, the approach runs in \(O(MAGIC)\) considering that we generate and verify up to `100000` palindromes.

## Final Note

This solution effectively narrows the search space by leveraging the properties of palindromes and super-palindromes, making it both efficient and straightforward to implement for the given problem constraints.
