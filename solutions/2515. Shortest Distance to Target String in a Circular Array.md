title:  Shortest Distance to Target String in a Circular Array-out
permalink: /s2515
---

Given a circular array of strings `words` and a string `target`, return the shortest distance between any occurrence of `target` and the starting index `startIndex`.

The circular array means that the next element of the last element is the first element, and the previous element of the first element is the last element.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"]
target = "hello"
startIndex = 1
```
**Output:** 
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
The shortest distance from index 1 ("i") to the target "hello" is indeed 1 (circularly returning to the start).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the circular array contain duplicate elements of the target string?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can have multiple occurrences of the target string.
   
2. **Q:** What should we return if the target string is not found in the array?
   - **A:** We will assume the target string is always present in the array based on the given problem example.

3. **Q:** How should we handle an empty `words` list?
   - **A:** Since the problem assumes the presence of `target` in the array, an empty list is not applicable.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Bidirectional Distance:** For each index `i` where `words[i] == target`:
   - Calculate the forward distance from `startIndex` to `i`.
   - Calculate the backward distance from `startIndex` to `i`.
   - Keep track of the minimum distance found.

2. **Forward Distance:**
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `startIndex`, it is simply `i - startIndex`.
   - If `i` is less than `startIndex` due to the circular nature, it would be `len(words) - startIndex + i`.

3. **Backward Distance:**
   - If `startIndex` is greater than or equal to `i`, it is `startIndex - i`.
   - If `startIndex` is less than `i` due to the circular nature, it would be `startIndex + len(words) - i`.

4. **Return the minimum of all computed distances.**

```python
def shortest_distance_to_target(words, target, startIndex):
    n = len(words)
    min_distance = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        if words[i] == target:
            forward_distance = (i - startIndex) % n
            backward_distance = (startIndex - i) % n
            min_distance = min(min_distance, forward_distance, backward_distance)
    
    return min_distance

# Test Example
words = ["hello","i","am","leetcode","hello"]
target = "hello"
startIndex = 1

print(shortest_distance_to_target(words, target, startIndex))  # Should print 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `words` array. We iterate through the list once to find all occurrences of the target.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we only use a fixed amount of additional space for variables, regardless of the input size.

This method ensures that we find the shortest distance efficiently utilizing a linear scan of the array.
