title:  Vowels Game in a String-out
permalink: /s3227
---

Albert and Bernard are playing a game. They have given a string `S` of lowercase English alphabets and they need to determine the winner based on the following rules:

1. Albert gets a point every time a substring that starts with a vowel and ends with a consonant is found.
2. Bernard gets a point every time a substring that starts with a consonant and ends with a vowel is found.

The vowels in the English language are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and the remaining letters are consonants.

Determine the winner or if it is a draw based on the points each player gets.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the length of the string given in S large (e.g., up to 10^5)?**
   - Yes, this might influence the efficiency of the solution.
2. **Do we need to consider substrings of length 1?**
   - No, because a single character cannot provide both a starting and ending character.
3. **Should the result be case-sensitive?**
   - No, the input string S is lowercase.

### Code

```python
def vowels_game_result(S: str) -> str:
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    
    # Initialize the points for both players
    albert_points = 0
    bernard_points = 0
    
    # Calculate points for Albert and Bernard
    for i in range(len(S)):
        if S[i] in vowels:
            # Every following consonant would contribute to a substring starting with this vowel
            albert_points += len(S) - i - 1 - sum(S[j] in vowels for j in range(i + 1, len(S)))
        else:
            # Every following vowel would contribute to a substring starting with this consonant
            bernard_points += sum(S[j] in vowels for j in range(i + 1, len(S)))
    
    if albert_points > bernard_points:
        return "Albert"
    elif bernard_points > albert_points:
        return "Bernard"
    else:
        return "Draw"

# Example usage:
print(vowels_game_result("aeiou"))
print(vowels_game_result("abcde"))
```

### Strategy

1. **Identify Positions**:
   - Traverse through the string character by character.
2. **Calculate Substrings for Albert**:
   - For each vowel at position `i`, count the trailing consonants to the right which would form valid substrings.
   - All valid substrings starting with a vowel `S[i]` and ending at `S[j]` contribute to Albert's points.
3. **Calculate Substrings for Bernard**:
   - For each consonant at position `i`, count the trailing vowels to the right which would form valid substrings.
   - All valid substrings starting with a consonant `S[i]` and ending at `S[j]` contribute to Bernard's points.
4. **Compare Points**:
   - After traversal, compare points of Albert and Bernard and return the result based on who has more points or if it's a draw.

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity of the solution appears to be \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested summation within the loop, making it inefficient for large input sizes.

An optimized strategy would involve preprocessing to count suffix vowels and suffix consonants efficiently, potentially reducing the complexity to \(O(n)\).

```python
def vowels_game_result(S: str) -> str:
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    n = len(S)
    
    # Initialize suffix arrays for counting vowels and consonants
    suffix_vowels = [0] * (n + 1)
    suffix_consonants = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Populate the suffix arrays
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suffix_vowels[i] = suffix_vowels[i + 1] + (1 if S[i] in vowels else 0)
        suffix_consonants[i] = suffix_consonants[i + 1] + (1 if S[i] not in vowels else 0)
    
    # Calculate points for Albert and Bernard
    albert_points = 0
    bernard_points = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if S[i] in vowels:
            albert_points += suffix_consonants[i + 1]
        else:
            bernard_points += suffix_vowels[i + 1]
    
    if albert_points > bernard_points:
        return "Albert"
    elif bernard_points > albert_points:
        return "Bernard"
    else:
        return "Draw"

# Example usage:
print(vowels_game_result("aeiou"))
print(vowels_game_result("abcde"))
```

The optimized solution works within \(O(n)\) time complexity by precomputing the suffix count arrays, ensuring it can handle large strings efficiently.
