title:  Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable-out
permalink: /s2858
---

Given a directed graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, determine the minimum number of edge reversals needed so that every node is reachable from a specific node `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edges Representation**: How are the edges represented? Are they given as a list of lists, where each sub-list contains two integers representing the directed edge?
2. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the number of nodes and edges?
3. **Output**: Should we return the minimum number of edge reversals or is any other output format required?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. Additionally, use a reversed adjacency list to keep track of possible reversals.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the reachability from node `0`.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Maintain a DP array to store the minimum number of reversals needed for each node to become reachable from node `0`.
4. **Initialization**: Start BFS from node `0` with a priority queue to always extend the node with the smallest number of required reversals.
5. **Edge Relaxation**: For each edge `(u -> v)`, consider both keeping it and reversing it. Update the DP array accordingly.

### Code

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def minEdgeReversals(n, edges):
    # Adjacency list and reverse adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    reversed_graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        reversed_graph[v].append(u)
    
    # Min-heap for priority queue
    pq = [(0, 0)]  # (reversals, node)
    min_reversals = [float('inf')] * n
    min_reversals[0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        reversals, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # Proceed only if this is the smallest number of reversals seen so far
        if reversals > min_reversals[node]:
            continue
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if reversals < min_reversals[neighbor]:
                min_reversals[neighbor] = reversals
                heapq.heappush(pq, (reversals, neighbor))
        
        for neighbor in reversed_graph[node]:
            if reversals + 1 < min_reversals[neighbor]:
                min_reversals[neighbor] = reversals + 1
                heapq.heappush(pq, (reversals + 1, neighbor))
    
    return min_reversals


# Example Usage
n = 4
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 2]]
print(minEdgeReversals(n, edges))  # Expected output might depend on the input graph
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's-like BFS**: `O((V + E) log V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.
- **Total**: The overall time complexity is `O((V + E) log V)`.

This approach efficiently computes the minimum number of edge reversals needed to make every node reachable from node `0` using graphs and priority queues.
