title:  Get Equal Substrings Within Budget-out
permalink: /s1208
---

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the i-th character of `s` to i-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (the absolute difference of the ASCII values of the characters).

You are tasked with finding the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` without exceeding the given cost `maxCost`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can you explain more about the input strings?**
   - Both strings `s` and `t` will be of the same length, and they only contain lowercase letters.

2. **Is the cost function just the ASCII difference?**
   - Yes, the cost of changing a character is given by the absolute difference of their ASCII values.

3. **What is the expected length of the strings?**
   - The length of each string (`s` and `t`) is expected to be within reasonable limits, typically in competitive programming, can be up to 100,000 characters.

4. **What should be returned in case of zero or negative `maxCost`?**
   - For zero or negative `maxCost`, the maximum length of a substring that can be changed is `0` since no changes can be afforded.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the idea is to use a sliding window (or two-pointer) approach:

1. **Sliding Window Mechanics**:
    - Iterate through the strings `s` and `t` using two pointers to define a window `[left, right]`.
    - Calculate the cost of converting the current character in `s` to the corresponding character in `t` and add this to a running `currentCost`.
    - If `currentCost` exceeds `maxCost`, move the `left` pointer to the right to reduce the window size and adjust `currentCost` accordingly.
    - Track the maximum window size observed during the iteration where `currentCost` remains within `maxCost`.

2. **Optimization Insight**:
    - By ensuring we only expand or contract the window in response to the current cost, we efficiently find the maximum valid substring length.

### Code

Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def equalSubstring(s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:
    left = 0
    currentCost = 0
    maxLength = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        currentCost += abs(ord(s[right]) - ord(t[right]))
        
        while currentCost > maxCost:
            currentCost -= abs(ord(s[left]) - ord(t[left]))
            left += 1
        
        maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1)
    
    return maxLength
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. 
- Each character in the string is processed once by the `right` pointer and potentially once more by the `left` pointer.
- This makes the solution efficient and suitable for input sizes common in competitive programming.

The space complexity is **O(1)** as only a fixed number of extra variables are used, independent of the input size.
