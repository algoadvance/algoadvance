title:  Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors-out
permalink: /s1931
---

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing the dimensions of a grid. The task is to count the number of ways to color the grid such that no two adjacent cells have the same color. You have three colors to choose from.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - The grid is `m x n`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
  
2. **What are the available colors?**
   - There are three colors available, typically represented by 0, 1, and 2.

3. **What are the constraints on the grid size?**
   - The problem typically comes with reasonable constraints that `m` and `n` are not excessively large, making computational solutions feasible.

4. **Can we use dynamic programming or memoization to optimize our solution?**
   - Yes, dynamic programming (DP) or memoization is key to efficiently solving the problem by avoiding redundant computations.

Now let's move on to the strategy and the implementation.

### Strategy

1. **Representation of Each Row:**
   - A row can be represented as a sequence of three colors. With three colors and `m` columns, a row can be one of `3^m` possible configurations.
   
2. **Check for Validity:**
   - Ensure no two adjacent cells in a row or column have the same color.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a DP dictionary where the key is the current row configuration and the value is the number of ways to color up to that row without adjacent cells in the same color.
   - Iterate over rows and columns, updating the DP dictionary with valid configurations.

4. **Precomputation:**
   - Precompute all valid row configurations and transitions between them to speed up the DP process.

### Implementation

```python
def colorTheGrid(m, n):
    from itertools import product
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    def is_valid_row(row):
        return all(row[i] != row[i + 1] for i in range(len(row) - 1))
    
    def is_valid_transition(row1, row2):
        return all(row1[i] != row2[i] for i in range(len(row1)))
    
    colors = range(3)
    all_rows = [row for row in product(colors, repeat=m) if is_valid_row(row)]
    valid_transition = {
        row: [next_row for next_row in all_rows if is_valid_transition(row, next_row)]
        for row in all_rows
    }
    
    dp = {row: 1 for row in all_rows}
    
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_dp = {row: 0 for row in all_rows}
        for row in all_rows:
            for next_row in valid_transition[row]:
                new_dp[next_row] = (new_dp[next_row] + dp[row]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    
    return sum(dp.values()) % MOD

# Example usage:
print(colorTheGrid(1, 1)) # Output: 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Is Valid Row:** Check if a row configuration is valid by ensuring no two adjacent cells in the row have the same color.
2. **Is Valid Transition:** Ensure that transitioning from one row to another is valid by checking that no cells in the same column have the same color.
3. **Generate All Rows:** Generate all possible row configurations and filter out invalid ones.
4. **Precompute Transitions:** For each row, precompute which other rows can validly follow.
5. **Dynamic Programming:** Initialize a DP dictionary with the number of ways to color the first column. Iteratively update this dictionary for each subsequent column, summing valid transitions.
6. **Return Result:** Sum the ways to color the last column.

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation:**
  - Generating all rows: O(3^m)
  - Valid transition checks: O((3^m)^2 * m)

- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - Iterating over `n` columns and updating DP states: O(n * (3^m)^2)

For reasonable `m` and `n` (e.g., \( m \leq 5 \)), this complexity is manageable.
