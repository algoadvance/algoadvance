title:  Count Pairs Of Nodes-out
permalink: /s1782
---

You are given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n` that indicates the number of nodes (numbered from `1` to `n`) and a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `u_i` and `v_i`.

Your task is to return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the number of pairs of nodes connected directly or indirectly to the node `i` by exactly two edges.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed to the solution, let's clarify some aspects:
1. **n and edges Validity:** Are `n` and `edges` validated or do we need to consider edge cases like self-loops or parallel edges?
2. **Graph Characteristics:** Should we assume that the graph is connected or can it have disconnected parts?
3. **Output Range:** Are nodes indexed from 1 to n, or 0 to n-1?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Pair Computation:** For each node, we need to count how many pairs of nodes exist that are two edges away from it using the adjacency list.

We'll use the following steps:
1. Build the adjacency list from given edges.
2. For each node, iterate over its neighbors and then over the neighbors of its neighbors, ensuring that we don't count direct neighbors or the node itself.
3. Use a set to prevent counting duplicate pairs for indirect connections.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation following the identified strategy:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def countPairs(n, edges):
    # Step 1: Build the adjacency list for the graph
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)

    # Step 2: Initialize the answer array
    answer = [0] * (n + 1)

    # Step 3: For each node, find pairs of nodes connected by exactly two edges
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        seen = set()  # Set to track nodes already counted
        for neighbor in graph[i]:
            for second_neighbor in graph[neighbor]:
                if second_neighbor != i and second_neighbor not in graph[i]:  
                    pair = tuple(sorted((i, second_neighbor)))
                    if pair not in seen:
                        answer[i] += 1
                        answer[second_neighbor] += 1
                        seen.add(pair)
    
    return answer[1:]

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5]]
print(countPairs(n, edges))  # Output will be the count array for each node

```

### Time Complexity
- **Building Adjacency List:** O(E) where E is the number of edges.
- **Counting Pairs:** O(N * M²) in the worst case where N is the number of nodes and M is the average number of neighbors per node.
Considering both steps, the overall complexity is O(E + N * M²). 

This approach assumes that the graph is not densely connected; otherwise, the solution might require optimization with specific methods for dense graphs.
