title:  Intersection of Two Arrays II-out
permalink: /s350
---

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays, and you may return the result in any order.

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Should the elements in the output be in any specific order?
   **A:** No, the elements can be in any order.

2. **Q:** Can the input arrays contain negative numbers and zeros?
   **A:** Yes, the input arrays can contain any integers including negative numbers and zeros.

3. **Q:** Are the input arrays always non-empty?
   **A:** No, they can be empty. If either of the arrays is empty, the output should be an empty array as well.

4. **Q:** Is it possible for `nums1` or `nums2` to be very large?
   **A:** Yes, it's possible. Optimized solutions would be preferred for large input sizes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, there are several approaches:

1. **Using Hash Maps:** 
   - Count the frequency of each element in `nums1` using a hash map.
   - Iterate through `nums2` and for each element, if it exists in the hash map and its count is greater than zero, add it to the result and decrement the count in the hash map.
   
2. **Sorting and Two Pointers:**
   - Sort both arrays.
   - Use two pointers to find common elements.

Given the nature of the problem, the hash map approach is preferred because it generally provides a better time complexity for unsorted input arrays.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python using the hash map approach:

```python
from collections import Counter

def intersect(nums1, nums2):
    # Create a counter for nums1
    count1 = Counter(nums1)
    result = []

    # Iterate through nums2
    for num in nums2:
        # If num is in the counter and the count is greater than 0
        if count1[num] > 0:
            result.append(num)
            count1[num] -= 1

    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.
  - Creating the counter for `nums1` takes O(m).
  - Iterating through `nums2` and managing the count in the hash map also takes O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) in the worst case where the entire smaller input array could be stored in memory in the form of a counter.
