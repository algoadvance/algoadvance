title:  Find the Median of the Uniqueness Array-out
permalink: /s3134
---
You are given an integer array `nums`. An array `arr` is defined by the unique elements of `nums` in the order they appear. The median of an array `arr` is defined as:
- If the length of `arr` is odd, it is the middle element.
- If the length of `arr` is even, it is the average of the two middle elements.

Return the median of the array `arr`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the array `nums` guaranteed to have at least one element?
2. What are the constraints on the elements in `nums`? Are they all integers? Can they be negative?
3. Should the result be returned in integer format if the median is an integer, or always as a float?

Let's assume:
- The array `nums` is guaranteed to have at least one element.
- The elements in `nums` are all integers and can be negative.
- The median should be returned as a float if the length of `arr` is even and the average is a fraction.

## Strategy
1. First, we will extract the unique elements from `nums` while preserving their order. We can achieve this using an `OrderedDict` to maintain the insertion order while removing duplicates.
2. Once we have the unique elements array `arr`, we will determine its length.
3. If the length of `arr` is odd, the median is the middle element.
4. If the length of `arr` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
5. Finally, return the median value.

## Code
Let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def find_median(nums):
    # Step 1: Extract unique elements while preserving order
    arr = list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(nums))
    
    # Step 2: Calculate length of arr
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Step 3: Find the median
    if n % 2 == 1:  # If the length is odd
        median = arr[n // 2]
    else:  # If the length is even
        median = (arr[n // 2 - 1] + arr[n // 2]) / 2
    
    return median

# Example usage
nums = [3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]
print(find_median(nums))  # Output should be 2
```

## Time Complexity
- Extracting unique elements while preserving order using `OrderedDict.fromkeys(nums)` runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of `nums`.
- Calculating the median is done in O(1) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n).
