title:  Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target-out
permalink: /s1521
---

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `target`, a mysterious function `MysteriousFunction(arr)` is defined as the bitwise AND of every pair `(i, j)` where `0 <= i <= j < len(arr)`. Your task is to find the value of `val` such that `|val - target|` is minimized. Here, `val` is the value of the mysterious function for some contiguous subarray of `arr`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What is the expected input range for the length of `arr` and the values within `arr`?
   - Typically, `arr` can have a length up to \(10^5\) and the values of `arr` can be up to \(10^9\).

2. Should the function handle negative values in `arr`?
   - No, the problem specifies that `arr` contains only non-negative integers.

3. Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, the array is non-empty.

### Strategy:

1. **Bitwise AND Property**:
   - The AND of any set of bits will always be less than or equal to the smallest bitwise AND of any subset.
   - The AND operation minimizes gradually as more bits (subarray values) are included (resulting in `0` for dissimilar bits).

2. **Optimal Approach**:
   - Utilize sliding window or dynamic approach to examine all subarray results.
   - Maintain a minimized difference between the bitwise AND result of any subarray and the target.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Iterate through each element, use a set to keep track of all potential AND values as the window extends.
   - Continuously calculate the minimum absolute difference to the target for each AND result.

### Code:

```python
def closestToTarget(arr, target):
    from sortedcontainers import SortedSet
    
    # Holds all subarray AND results
    result_set = SortedSet()
    
    # Current minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through each element in the array
    for num in arr:
        new_set = SortedSet()
        
        # Add current number
        new_set.add(num)
        
        # Update all values in set with AND operation
        for val in result_set:
            new_set.add(val & num)
            
        # Update the result set
        result_set = new_set
        
        # Calculate the minimum difference
        for val in result_set:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(val - target))
    
    return min_diff

# Example Usage
arr = [9, 12, 3, 7, 15]
target = 5
print(closestToTarget(arr, target))  # Output: should be 2
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization** and **main loop** run in `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
- Each **AND operation and insertion into the SortedSet** incurs an operation cost of `O(log m)`, where `m` is the number of elements in the result_set.
- **Overall Complexity**: The worst-case scenario is quadratic due to the AND operations (because the set contains intermediate AND results), leading to `O(n * log n * log n)`.

This strategy leverages efficient data structures for dynamic set handling to achieve a feasible solution within typical competitive programming constraints.
