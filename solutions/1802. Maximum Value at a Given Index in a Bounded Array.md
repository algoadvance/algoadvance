title:  Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array-out
permalink: /s1802
---

The problem 1802 on LeetCode is as follows:

You are given three positive integers: `n`, `index`, and `maxSum`. You want to construct an array `nums` (0-indexed) that:

1. Contains `n` positive integers.
2. `nums[index]` is maximized.
3. The sum of all elements in `nums` does not exceed `maxSum`.
4. `nums` contains at least one positive integer.

Return `nums[index]` as the maximum possible value.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are all values in the array required to be positive integers?
   - Yes, every element in the array has to be a positive integer.
  
2. Can `nums[index]` be greater than the rest of the elements in the array?
   - Yes, the goal is to maximize `nums[index]`, so it can potentially be greater than the rest of the elements.

## Strategy

### Constraints and Observations

- `1 <= n <= maxSum <= 10^9`
- Because the sum of all elements is bounded by `maxSum`, and all elements are positive integers, each element must be at least 1.

The goal is to maximize the value of `nums[index]` such that the sum of the entire array does not exceed `maxSum`.

### Approach

1. **Binary Search**:
   - Given the constraints, a direct approach would not be feasible. We will use binary search to find the maximum value of `nums[index]`.
   
2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For a given middle value in the binary search, calculate the total sum to determine if it's valid.
   - Use a helper function to calculate the sum of the resultant array with the given middle value at `index`.

### Helper Function

To calculate the sum for a given `mid` value:
- Elements to the left of `index` should form a declining sequence down to 1.
- Elements to the right of `index` should similarly form a declining sequence.
  
We need to handle the cases where the index is near the edges separately to avoid out-of-bound errors.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity to find the maximum value using binary search is `O(log(maxSum) * n)` where `n` is the length of the array. Given constraints make this approach feasible.

## Code

```python
def calculate_sum(n, index, value):
    # This function calculates total sum of elements when value at index is `value`
    left_part_sum = 0
    right_part_sum = 0
    
    # Sum of the elements to the left of index
    if value > index:
        left_part_sum = (value - index + value - 1) * index // 2
    else:
        left_part_sum = (value * (value - 1)) // 2 + (index - value + 1)
    
    # Sum of the elements to the right of index
    if value >= (n - index):
        right_part_sum = (value * (value - 1)) // 2 + (n - index - value)
    else:
        right_part_sum = (value + value - (n - index) + 1) * (n - index) // 2
    
    return left_part_sum + right_part_sum + value

def maxValue(n, index, maxSum):
    left, right = 1, maxSum
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if calculate_sum(n, index, mid) <= maxSum:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return left

# Example usage
print(maxValue(4, 2, 6)) # Expected output 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search**:
   - `left` starts from 1, `right` starts from `maxSum`.
   - Calculate `mid` as the potential value for `nums[index]`.
   - Check if the array sum with `nums[index]` equal to `mid` is within `maxSum`.

2. **Helper Function**:
   - `calculate_sum()` computes the sum of the array given the value at `index` and ensures that the sum of the elements satisfies the sum constraints.

This approach identifies the maximum possible value for `nums[index]` efficiently using binary search.
