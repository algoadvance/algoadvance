title:  Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K-out
permalink: /s363
---

Given an m x n matrix `matrix` and an integer `k`, return the max sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the elements in the matrix?**
   - Typically, the elements can be a mix of positive and negative integers.

2. **What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix?**
   - Generally, the matrix dimensions can be up to 100 x 100.

3. **Can the value of `k` be negative or zero?**
   - Yes, `k` can be any integer, including negative or zero.

4. **Should the submatrix be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the submatrix must contain at least one element.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate on Submatrices**:
   - Use a nested loop to fix the left and right boundaries of the submatrix.
   - Compress the columns in this fixed boundary to form a 1D array that represents the sum of elements in the rows between the boundaries.

2. **Efficient Sum Calculation**:
   - For each pair of column boundaries, use a cumulative approach to calculate the prefix sums and then utilize a sorted container (e.g., a list or binary tree) to find the best possible submatrix sum no larger than `k`.

3. **Utilize Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search within the sorted list of prefix sums to find the maximum subarray sum that is no larger than `k`.

### Code

Here's the full implementation in Python:

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def maxSumSubmatrix(matrix, k):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    # Iterate over the left boundary of the submatrix
    for left in range(cols):
        # Initialize a list to store the row sums for the current pair of boundaries
        row_sums = [0] * rows
        
        # Iterate over the right boundary of the submatrix
        for right in range(left, cols):
            for i in range(rows):
                row_sums[i] += matrix[i][right]
            
            # Now find the max subarray no larger than k using cumulative sums
            cum_sum = 0
            sorted_sums = SortedList([0])
            
            for sum_val in row_sums:
                cum_sum += sum_val
                # We need to find the smallest cumulative sum >= (cum_sum - k)
                target = cum_sum - k
                
                idx = sorted_sums.bisect_left(target)
                if idx < len(sorted_sums):
                    max_sum = max(max_sum, cum_sum - sorted_sums[idx])
                
                sorted_sums.add(cum_sum)
    
    return max_sum
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop (Left Boundary)**: O(n)
- **Inner Loop (Right Boundary)**: O(n)
- **Row Sums Update**: O(m)
- **Insert and Search in SortedList**: O(m log m)

So, the overall time complexity is O(n^2 * m log m), which generally should be efficient given the problem constraints.

### Explanation

1. **Outer and Inner Loops**: These fix the left and right boundaries of the submatrix.
2. **Row Sums Update**: This collapses the current submatrix into a 1D problem.
3. **Cumulative Sums and SortedList**: These steps help in finding the maximum sum rectangle that doesnâ€™t exceed `k` effectively using binary search.
