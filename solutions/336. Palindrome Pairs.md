Given a list of unique words, your task is to find all pairs of distinct indices `(i, j)` such that the concatenation of the two words, i.e., `words[i] + words[j]`, is a palindrome.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the words contain upper-case letters?**
   - No, the problem considers only lower-case letters.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the words list?**
   - The length of the list can go up to \(10^4\), and the length of individual words is up to \(300\).

3. **Do we need to consider any special characters or spaces in words?**
   - No, the words contain only lower-case alphabets without any special characters or spaces.

Understanding these constraints will help in coming up with an efficient solution.

## Strategy

1. **Reverse and Hash Map:** For each word, store its index in a hash map (`word_map`) with the reversed word as the key.
  
2. **Palindrome Check:** For each word, break it into two parts in all possible ways, check if any of these parts form a palindrome with a word from the hash map.
  
3. **Two Palindrome Parts:** 
   - If left part is a palindrome, check if the reversed right part exists in `word_map`.
   - If right part is a palindrome, check if the reversed left part exists in `word_map`.

4. **Special Case (Empty String):** If an empty string exists in the list, then it can pair with any palindrome word because concatenating any word with an empty string will result in the same word.

## Code

```python
def palindromePairs(words):
    def is_palindrome(check):
        return check == check[::-1]

    word_map = {word[::-1]: i for i, word in enumerate(words)}
    results = []
    
    for i, word in enumerate(words):
        n = len(word)
        for j in range(n + 1):
            left, right = word[:j], word[j:]
            
            # If left is a palindrome, check if reversed right exists in word_map
            if is_palindrome(left) and right in word_map and word_map[right] != i:
                results.append([word_map[right], i])
                
            # If right is a palindrome, check if reversed left exists in word_map
            # Avoid duplicates by ensuring right is non-empty
            if j != n and is_palindrome(right) and left in word_map and word_map[left] != i:
                results.append([i, word_map[left]])
                
    return results
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building word_map:** \(O(N \times M)\), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of words.
- **Main Loop:** For each word, where each word has length up to M, checking palindrome for each substring takes:
  - **Palindrome Check:** \(O(M / 2)\)
  - **Total:** \(O(N \times M^2)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity could be approximated as \(O(N \times M^2)\). Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough for the typical input sizes.

## Conclusion

This approach leverages the properties of palindromes and efficient lookups using hash maps, ensuring that all possible pairs are checked while minimizing redundant checks. Itâ€™s built to handle the given constraints effectively.
