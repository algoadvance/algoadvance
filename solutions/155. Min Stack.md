Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto the stack.
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values that can be pushed onto the stack?**
   - No, the problem does not specify any constraints on the values.

2. **Is there any limit to the size of the stack?**
   - No, the problem does not specify any size limits for the stack.

3. **What should be the behavior if `pop` or `top` is called on an empty stack?**
   - Since this is a typical interview question, we can assume the stack is not empty when `pop` or `top` is called. Otherwise, we may need to handle exceptions or errors appropriately.

## Strategy

To keep track of the minimum element in constant time, we can use an auxiliary stack that maintains the current minimum elements. Here's how we can design the `MinStack`:

- Use two stacks: 
  - `main_stack` to store the actual values.
  - `min_stack` to store the minimum values at each level.

- When a new value is pushed onto the `main_stack`:
  - Also push it onto the `min_stack` if it is smaller than or equal to the current minimum element, or if the `min_stack` is empty.
  
- When a value is popped from `main_stack`:
  - Also pop from the `min_stack` if the popped value is the same as the current minimum.

- The `top` operation returns the top of the `main_stack`.

- The `getMin` operation returns the top of the `min_stack`.

By doing this, we ensure that all operations run in constant time, `O(1)`.

## Code

```python
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.main_stack = []
        self.min_stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.main_stack.append(val)
        if not self.min_stack or val <= self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        if self.main_stack:
            top_value = self.main_stack.pop()
            if top_value == self.min_stack[-1]:
                self.min_stack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        if self.main_stack:
            return self.main_stack[-1]
        return None # Should not happen, as per our assumptions.

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        if self.min_stack:
            return self.min_stack[-1]
        return None # Should not happen, as per our assumptions.
```

## Time Complexity

- `push(val)`: O(1) because appending to both stacks is a constant-time operation.
- `pop()`: O(1) because popping from both stacks is a constant-time operation.
- `top()`: O(1) because accessing the last element is a constant-time operation.
- `getMin()`: O(1) because accessing the last element in the `min_stack` is a constant-time operation.

This design ensures that all required operations are performed in constant time, meeting the problemâ€™s requirements.
