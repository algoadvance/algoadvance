title:  Sum of Left Leaves-out
permalink: /s404
---
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of its parent.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 24
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
```


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the binary tree be empty?**
   - Yes, in that case, the sum should be `0`.

2. **What are the range of values for the node values and the number of nodes?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`. 
   - `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`.

3. **Are the nodes guaranteed to have unique values?**
   - No, node values are not guaranteed to be unique.

4. **Can we assume the input is always a valid binary tree?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the input is always a valid binary tree.


## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can perform a traversal of the binary tree (using DFS or BFS) and check each node to see if it is a left leaf. If a node is determined to be a left leaf, we add its value to a running sum.

### Steps:
1. **Define a Helper Function:**
   - Create a helper function that will recursively traverse the tree.
   - This function should take an additional parameter to keep track of whether the current node is a left child.
   
2. **Recursive Traversal:**
   - For each node, check if it is a left leaf:
     - If it is, add its value to the sum.
     - If not, continue traversing its children.
   - Sum the values of all left leaves.
   
3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the tree is empty, return `0`.

### Time Complexity
- Each node is visited exactly once, hence the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def is_leaf(node):
            return node is not None and node.left is None and node.right is None
        
        def dfs(node, is_left):
            if node is None:
                return 0
            if is_leaf(node) and is_left:
                return node.val
            return dfs(node.left, True) + dfs(node.right, False)
        
        return dfs(root, False)

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(3)
# root.left = TreeNode(9)
# root.right = TreeNode(20)
# root.right.left = TreeNode(15)
# root.right.right = TreeNode(7)
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.sumOfLeftLeaves(root))  # Output: 24
```

## Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class:** Defined to provide the structure of each tree node.
2. **Solution Class:**
   - The `sumOfLeftLeaves` function initializes the recursive `dfs` function.
   - The `is_leaf` helper function checks if a node is a leaf.
   - The `dfs` function traverses the tree, summing the values of left leaves:
     - It returns the node's value if it is a left leaf.
     - Otherwise, it recursively sums the values of all left leaves in both the left and right subtrees.
   
By using the `dfs` function recursively, the solution ensures that all left leaves are identified and their values summed appropriately. This approach works efficiently within the constraints provided.
