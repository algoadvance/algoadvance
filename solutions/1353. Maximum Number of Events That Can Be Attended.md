title:  Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended-out
permalink: /s1353
---
You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event i at any day `d` where `startDayi <= d <= endDayi`. You can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the days strictly positive integers?**  
   Yes, days are strictly positive integers.
   
2. **Can events overlap in their timing?**  
   Yes, events can overlap. 

3. **Is the input always valid?**  
   Yes, assume that the input is always valid and within constraints.

4. **What are the constraints on the number of events or their duration?**  
   The number of events is up to `100,000`, and each event's duration can range from `1` to `100,000`.

## Strategy
1. **Sort Events**:
   - First, we sort the events based on their start day. If two events have the same start day, we sort them by their end day.

2. **Use a Min-Heap**:
   - We will use a min-heap to keep track of the end days of the events we are currently considering.

3. **Iterate Through the Days**:
   - We iterate through each day from the start of the first event to the end of the last event.
   - For each day, we remove the events from the heap whose end day is less than the current day (since we can no longer attend those).
   - If there are any events that start on the current day, we add their end days to the heap.
   - If there are events available to attend (i.e., the heap is not empty), we attend the event that ends the earliest (remove the smallest element from the heap), and increment our count of attended events.

4. **Output the Count**:
   - The count will represent the maximum number of events we can attend.

## Code
```python
import heapq

def maxEvents(events):
    # Sort events by start day
    events.sort()
    total_days = max(event[1] for event in events)
    event_id = 0
    attended_events = 0
    min_heap = []
    
    # Iterate over each day
    for day in range(1, total_days + 1):
        # Remove events from heap that have ended before the current day
        while min_heap and min_heap[0] < day:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # Add all events that start on this day to the heap
        while event_id < len(events) and events[event_id][0] == day:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, events[event_id][1])
            event_id += 1

        # Attend the event that ends the earliest (if any)
        if min_heap:
            heapq.heappop(min_heap)
            attended_events += 1

    return attended_events
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the events**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Processing each event in the heap**: \(O(n \log n)\) in the worst case, where n is the number of events.
- **Total Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\)

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle large numbers of events and days within the given constraints.
