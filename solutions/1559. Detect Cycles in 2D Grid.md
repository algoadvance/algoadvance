title:  Detect Cycles in 2D Grid-out
permalink: /s1559
---

You are given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell in `grid` contains a lowercase English letter. You need to determine if there exists any cycle in the grid.

A cycle is defined as a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the four directions (left, right, up, down) if the next cell has the same character.

Return `true` if there exists a cycle in the grid, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we revisit a cell during our DFS (Depth First Search) traversal?**
   - Yes, but a revisit to form a cycle should include the condition that the path length is at least 4.

2. **What is the content of `grid`?**
   - `grid` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Can the grid contain up to the largest dimension constraints?**
   - Yes, the grid can be large, so we have to consider the efficiency of our solution.

4. **Is diagonal movement allowed?**
   - No, movement is restricted to up, down, left, and right only.

### Strategy

To detect cycles in the grid, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) along with proper tracking of visited cells. We'll keep track of the parent cell to differentiate between visiting the same cell in a valid way (as part of the exploration) and forming an invalid cycle.

- **Visited Matrix**: To track already visited cells.
- **DFS**: Recursively visit cells and check if we can form a cycle.
- **Cycle Check**: Ensure the length of the cycle is at least 4 and we do not revisit the immediate parent cell.

### Code

```python
def containsCycle(grid: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
    def dfs(x, y, parent_x, parent_y, start_char):
        if visited[x][y]:
            return True
        
        visited[x][y] = True
        for dx, dy in directions:
            new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n and grid[new_x][new_y] == start_char:
                if (new_x, new_y) != (parent_x, parent_y):
                    if dfs(new_x, new_y, x, y, start_char):
                        return True
        return False

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # Up, Down, Left, Right

    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                if dfs(i, j, -1, -1, grid[i][j]):
                    return True
    return False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\). In the worst case, we may have to visit every cell in the grid once. The DFS traversal is linear with respect to the number of cells in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) due to the visited matrix and the recursive stack space.
