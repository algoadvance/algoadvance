### [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the input array `nums`?
   **A:** The array `nums` will have a length between 0 and \(10^5\), and the elements of `nums` will be integers in the range of \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).

2. **Q:** Can we modify the input array?
   **A:** Yes, but for a more general solution, assume the input array should not be modified.

3. **Q:** What should the function return if `nums` is an empty array?
   **A:** If `nums` is empty, it will obviously contain no duplicates, so the function should return `false`.

## Strategy
To determine if there are any duplicate elements in the array, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have encountered so far:
1. Initialize an empty set.
2. Iterate over each element in the array `nums`.
3. For each element, check if it is already in the set:
   - If it is, return `true` (since we have found a duplicate).
   - If it is not, add it to the set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, return `false`.

This approach is efficient because checking membership and adding elements to a set both have average time complexity of \(O(1)\).

## Code
```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because each element is checked for membership in a set (average \(O(1)\) time) and potentially added to the set (also average \(O(1)\) time).
- The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) in the worst case, as we may need to store all \(n\) elements in the set if there are no duplicates.
