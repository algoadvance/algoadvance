title:  Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves-out
permalink: /s1509
---

Given an array `nums`, you are allowed to choose one element in the array and change it to any value to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. You can make at most three moves. Return the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after three moves.

- Example 1:
    - Input: `nums = [5,3,2,4,1]`
    - Output: `0`
  
- Example 2:
    - Input: `nums = [1,5,0,10,14]`
    - Output: `1`
  
- Example 3:
    - Input: `nums = [6,6,0,1,1,4,6]`
    - Output: `2`

- Constraints:
  - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
  - `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. What should be done if the array length is less than or equal to 3?
   - If the array length is less than or equal to 3, it can be adjusted to have zero difference (since we can change up to three elements).

2. Are the array elements limited to integer values only?
   - Yes, the array elements are integers.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, you should consider the following ideas:

1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting helps you identify the smallest and the largest elements to focus on the potential changes.
2. **Identify Key Elements:** Since we can make at most three moves, identify the effect of changing the three largest elements or the three smallest elements.
3. **Calculate Potential Scenarios:** By analyzing the top 3 assumed smallest and largest elements, compute different scenarios where changes happen among the first and the last elements of the sorted array.
4. **Select the Minimal Difference:** From the potential scenarios, select the one which minimizes the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

## Code:

```python
def minDifference(nums) -> int:
    if len(nums) <= 4:
        return 0

    nums.sort()
    # We only need to consider the smallest and largest 4 elements
    return min(
        nums[-1] - nums[3],         # Change the 3 smallest values
        nums[-2] - nums[2],         # Change the 2 smallest values and 1 largest value
        nums[-3] - nums[1],         # Change the 1 smallest value and 2 largest values
        nums[-4] - nums[0]          # Change the 3 largest values
    )
```

## Explanation:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `nums` is sorted to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
   
2. **Handling Small Arrays:**
   - If the length of `nums` is 4 or less, we can directly change all elements to a single value, so the difference is 0.

3. **Calculations:**
   - We calculate four possible outcomes:
     - Changing the three smallest elements.
     - Changing two smallest elements and one largest element.
     - Changing one smallest element and two largest elements.
     - Changing the three largest elements.
   
3. **Return Minimum Difference:**
   - Return the minimum of the calculated differences by observing the impact of the changes allowed.

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` as the sorting is done in place and no significant additional space is used.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum difference by leveraging sorting and a strategic selection of changes.
