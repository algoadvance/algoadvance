title:  Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries-out
permalink: /s2503
---

You are given a 2D grid of integers and several query points on the grid. For each query point, you need to determine the maximum sum of any path from the top-left corner (0, 0) of the grid to that query point. You may only move down or to the right at any step. Implement a function that receives the grid and the list of query points, and returns a list of maximum sums for each query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Size:** Is the grid always a square, or can it be any m x n dimensions?
    - The grid can be any dimensions (m x n).

2. **Boundaries:** What are the constraints on the grid values and dimensions?
    - Typically, constraints will be provided in the problem statement, but assume reasonably sized grids for the context of coding interviews (e.g., up to 1000 x 1000).

3. **Path Update:** Are diagonal paths or other moves allowed, or just down and right?
    - Only down and right movements are allowed.

4. **Query Nature:** Are query points guaranteed to be within the grid dimensions?
    - Yes, all query points will be within the grid dimensions.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a DP Table:**
   - Create a 2D list dp where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum sum to reach cell (i, j) from (0, 0).

2. **Fill DP Table:**
   - The value at `dp[i][j]` will be the value of `grid[i][j]` plus the maximum of values from the top cell `dp[i-1][j]` and the left cell `dp[i][j-1]`.

3. **Query Results:**
   - For each query point, simply read the precomputed value from the `dp` table.

### Code

```python
def max_points_from_grid_queries(grid, queries):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
        
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Fill the DP table
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Fill the first row and first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0]
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    # Process the queries
    results = []
    for x, y in queries:
        results.append(dp[x][y])
    
    return results

# Example usage
grid = [
    [5, 3, 2],
    [1, 4, 6],
    [0, 7, 8]
]
queries = [(2, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]
print(max_points_from_grid_queries(grid, queries))  # Output: [20, 12, 15]
```

### Time Complexity

- **DP Table Filling Step:** We have to fill an m x n table, so the complexity is O(m * n).
- **Query Processing Step:** Each query is O(1) as it simply accesses a precomputed value in the dp table.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(m * n + q)**, where q is the number of queries. This is efficient given typical constraints in coding interviews.
