Design a system that simulates a browser's history functionality, which includes visiting new URLs, navigating back in history, and navigating forward in history. Your task is to implement the `BrowserHistory` class:

```python
class BrowserHistory:
    def __init__(self, homepage: str):
        # Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
    
    def visit(self, url: str) -> None:
        # Visits url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.
    
    def back(self, steps: int) -> str:
        # Moves steps back in history and returns the current page after the move.
    
    def forward(self, steps: int) -> str:
        # Moves steps forward in history and returns the current page after the move.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Initialization**: Is the homepage given during initialization guaranteed to be a valid URL string?
2. **Edge Cases**: Should we handle cases where `back` or `forward` attempts to move beyond the bounds of history?
3. **Performance Considerations**: Are there any constraints on the number of operations or size of the URLs that we need to consider?

## Strategy

To implement the `BrowserHistory` class, we can use two stacks:
- **History Stack**: will store the pages visited.
- **Forward Stack**: will store the forward history pages after a back navigation.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Initialize the history stack with the homepage.
   - Initialize the forward stack as empty.
   
2. **Visit**:
   - Clear the forward stack.
   - Append the new URL to the history stack.

3. **Back**:
   - Pop pages from the history stack and push them onto the forward stack up to `steps` times or until there are no more pages to go back to.
   - The current page will be the top of the history stack.

4. **Forward**:
   - Pop pages from the forward stack and push them onto the history stack up to `steps` times or until there are no more pages to go forward to.
   - The current page will be the top of the history stack.

### Code Implementation

```python
class BrowserHistory:
    def __init__(self, homepage: str):
        self.history = [homepage]
        self.forward_stack = []
        self.current = 0

    def visit(self, url: str) -> None:
        self.history = self.history[:self.current+1]  # truncate the forward history
        self.history.append(url)
        self.current += 1
        self.forward_stack = []  # clear forward history

    def back(self, steps: int) -> str:
        self.current = max(0, self.current - steps)
        return self.history[self.current]

    def forward(self, steps: int) -> str:
        self.current = min(len(self.history) - 1, self.current + steps)
        return self.history[self.current]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1)
- **Visit**: O(n) due to list slicing (since we may potentially slice the entire list history up to the current page)
- **Back**: O(1)
- **Forward**: O(1)

This design ensures that navigating back and forward is efficient, while visiting new pages may have a linear time complexity based on the current position in the history.
