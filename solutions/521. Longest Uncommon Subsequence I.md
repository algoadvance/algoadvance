[Leetcode: Longest Uncommon Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-i/)

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between `a` and `b`. A subsequence of a string `s` is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from `s`. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" but "aed" is not. 
An uncommon subsequence between `a` and `b` is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input strings be empty?**
   - Yes, according to the problem constraints, the strings can be empty.
   
2. **What is the length range of the strings?**
   - The length of `a` and `b` can be at most 100.

3. **Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that both strings contain only lowercase English letters.

4. **Are there any specific edge cases we should consider?**
   - Yes, edge cases where one or both strings are empty.

### Strategy

1. **Compare the Strings Directly:**
   - If the strings `a` and `b` are not the same, the longest uncommon subsequence is the longer string because it cannot be a subsequence of the other string. If they are the same, there is no uncommon subsequence, so the result is `-1`.

2. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Check if `a` is equal to `b`.
   - If they are equal, return `-1`.
   - If they are not equal, return the maximum length between `a` and `b`.

### Code

```python
def findLUSlength(a: str, b: str) -> int:
    if a == b:
        return -1
    else:
        return max(len(a), len(b))

# Example test cases
print(findLUSlength("aba", "cdc"))  # Output: 3
print(findLUSlength("aaa", "bbb"))  # Output: 3
print(findLUSlength("aaa", "aaa"))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because:

- The comparison of two strings of length up to 100 is a constant time operation.
- The length calculations `len(a)` and `len(b)` are also constant time operations.

So, the overall time complexity is constant, **O(1)**.
