title:  Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid-out
permalink: /s1536
---

You are given an `n x n` binary grid where each row must contain exactly one `1` and `n-1` `0`s. A row is considered valid if all the `1`s in that row are in the lower half (including the middle row if `n` is odd). The task is to find the minimum number of swaps required to make all rows valid. You are allowed to swap any two rows.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the minimum and maximum values of `n`?
     - \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \)
   
2. **Output:**
   - If it's not possible to make all rows valid, what should be returned?
     - Return `-1`.

3. **Grid Characteristics:**
   - Can we assume that each row already contains exactly one `1` as per the problem?
     - Yes, each row will contain exactly one `1`.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Validity of a Row:**
   - A row `i` (0-indexed) in the grid is valid if the position of `1` (say `j`) satisfies `j >= i`.

2. **Find Trailing Zero Count:**
   - For each row, calculate how many trailing zeros are there after the `1`.

3. **Greedy Approach to Determine Swaps:**
   - Use a greedy algorithm to count the number of swaps needed:
     - For each row \(i\), ensure that the number of trailing zeros in this row is at least \(n - i - 1\). If not, find the nearest such row below it and swap them.
     - Keep track of these swaps.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Traverse through the grid row by row, performing necessary swaps.
   - If you reach a row and cannot find a valid row to swap from below, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the proposed approach is \(O(n^2)\) since, in the worst case, we might traverse subarrays of size \(O(n)\) for each of the \(n\) rows during swaps.

### Implementation

```python
def minSwaps(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    
    # Function to calculate trailing zeros in each row
    def trailingZeros(row):
        zeros = 0
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if row[i] == 1:
                break
            zeros += 1
        return zeros
    
    # Calculate the number of trailing zeros for each row
    trailing_zero_counts = [trailingZeros(row) for row in grid]
    
    swaps = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        required_zeros = n - i - 1
        if trailing_zero_counts[i] >= required_zeros:
            continue
        
        # Find the row to swap with
        swap_row = i
        while swap_row < n and trailing_zero_counts[swap_row] < required_zeros:
            swap_row += 1
        
        if swap_row == n:
            return -1
        
        for j in range(swap_row, i, -1):
            trailing_zero_counts[j], trailing_zero_counts[j - 1] = trailing_zero_counts[j - 1], trailing_zero_counts[j]
            swaps += 1
    
    return swaps

# Example usage
grid = [
    [0,0,1],
    [1,0,0],
    [0,1,0]
]
print(minSwaps(grid)) # Output: 3
```

This solution iterates over each row and, if necessary, looks for valid rows below it to swap into the current position, counting the swaps made. If itâ€™s not possible to ensure every row is valid, it returns `-1`.
