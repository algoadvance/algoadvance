title:  Convert a Number to Hexadecimal-out
permalink: /s405
---
Given an integer `num`, return a string representing its hexadecimal representation. For negative integers, two’s complement method is used.

**Constraints:**
- `-2^31 <= num <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Should the hexadecimal letters be in uppercase or lowercase?
   - **A**: The hexadecimal letters should be in lowercase.

2. **Q**: How should we handle negative numbers?
   - **A**: We should use two’s complement for negative numbers, which involves a bit manipulation strategy.

3. **Q**: What should be returned if `num` is `0`?
   - **A**: The string `"0"` should be returned.

## Code

```python
def toHex(num):
    if num == 0:
        return "0"

    # handle negative numbers by adjusting for two's complement
    if num < 0:
        num += 2**32

    hex_chars = "0123456789abcdef"
    result = []

    while num > 0:
        result.append(hex_chars[num % 16])
        num //= 16

    return "".join(reversed(result))
```

## Strategy
1. **Edge Case for Zero**: Directly return `"0"` if the number is zero.
2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: Convert the negative numbers to their two’s complement equivalent by adding `2^32` (since we're dealing with 32-bit integers).
3. **Convert to Hexadecimal**: Use hexadecimal characters `"0123456789abcdef"` to construct the resultant string.
   - Append the appropriate character by taking `num % 16`.
   - Reduce `num` by dividing it by `16`.
   - Add characters to a list and reverse it at the end for correct order.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(log N)`, where `N` is the absolute value of the input number. This is because we're dividing the number by `16` repeatedly, which reduces the number of operations proportional to the logarithm base 16.
- The space complexity is `O(log N)` as well due to the list used for storing the hexadecimal digits.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, including negative numbers and zero.
