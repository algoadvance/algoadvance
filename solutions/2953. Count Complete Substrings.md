title:  Count Complete Substrings-out
permalink: /s2953
---

You are given a string `s`, which consists of only lowercase English letters. A substring is called complete if all letters of the alphabet are present at least once in it. Return the number of complete substrings in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the length of the input string `s` be very large?
   - Yes, the length of `s` can be large (up to 10^5).
   
2. Are the substrings non-overlapping or can they be overlapping?
   - Substrings can be overlapping.
   
3. Should the substrings be distinct or can we count the same substring multiple times?
   - The same substring can be counted multiple times if it meets the criteria.
   
4. What should be returned if there's no complete substring?
   - Return `0` if no complete substring is found.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently check each possible substring of `s`.
2. **Frequency Count**: Maintain a frequency count of characters within the current window.
3. **Early Termination**: As soon as we have a window with all 26 characters, we count all possible substrings starting from the leftmost character of the current window that are complete.

### Code

The solution approach involves:
1. Using a sliding window to maintain current substring.
2. Expanding and contracting the window to ensure it covers at least all characters from 'a' to 'z'.
3. Counting each valid substring that covers all characters.

```python
def count_complete_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    def is_complete(freq_map):
        return len(freq_map) == 26
    
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    freq_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    for i in range(n):
        freq_map.clear()
        for j in range(i, n):
            freq_map[s[j]] += 1
            if is_complete(freq_map):
                # All substrings from s[i:j+1] to s[i:n] are complete
                count += (n - j)
                break
                
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst-case Time Complexity**: O(n^2).
  - For each starting position i from 0 to n-1, we might need to scan from i to n-1.
  - While this nested loop leads to O(n^2) complexity, this approach checks for completeness quicker due to early termination.
  
- **Sliding Window Enhancement**: This can potentially be further optimized with a better sliding window and hash set but depends on the problem constraints.

This solution ensures that we keep a balance between readability, maintainability, and performance within reasonable constraints.
