In this problem, you are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` whose length is a power of 2.

Apply the following algorithm on `nums` repeatedly until the length of `nums` becomes 1:
1. Create a new 0-indexed integer array `newNums` of length `nums.length / 2`.
2. For every even index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length / 2`, assign the value of `newNums[i]` as:
   - `newNums[i] = min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])` if `i` is even.
   - `newNums[i] = max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])` if `i` is odd.
3. Replace the array `nums` with `newNums`.
4. Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.

Return the last number that remains in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers or is it only non-negative integers?
2. Is there an upper limit to the size of the input array?
3. Are there any constraints on the values within the `nums` array?

Clarifications:
1. Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
2. The size of `nums` is guaranteed to be a power of 2, but no specific upper limit is provided.
3. There are no constraints on the values of the numbers within `nums`.

## Code
Let's proceed to implement this in Python.

```python
def minMaxGame(nums):
    while len(nums) > 1:
        newNums = []
        for i in range(len(nums) // 2):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                newNums.append(min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]))
            else:
                newNums.append(max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]))
        nums = newNums
    return nums[0]

# Test the function with an example input
print(minMaxGame([1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 8, 2, 2]))  # Expected output depends on the input sequence.
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Start with the array `nums`.
2. **Iteration until single element**:
   - Create a new array called `newNums` at each iteration.
   - For each pair of elements in `nums`:
     1. If the index is even, take the minimum of the pair.
     2. If the index is odd, take the maximum of the pair.
   - Replace `nums` with `newNums`.
3. **Termination**: When the length of `nums` becomes 1, return the single element in `nums`.

## Time Complexity
- **Iteration per round**: O(n/2) comparisons, where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Number of rounds**: O(log n), since the length of the array is reduced by half each round.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

This approach effectively reduces the problem size at each step, ensuring efficient execution even for larger inputs.
