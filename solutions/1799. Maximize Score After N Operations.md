title:  Maximize Score After N Operations-out
permalink: /s1799
---

You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of length `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations to maximize your score in the following way:
- In the `i-th` operation (1-indexed), you pick any two elements `nums[x]` and `nums[y]` from `nums` (0-indexed) that have not been picked in any previous operation, and add `i * gcd(nums[x], nums[y])` to your score.
- You must return the maximum score that you can achieve after performing `n` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `nums[i]`:** What is the range of values for the elements of `nums`?
   - Typically, `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6` for this type of problem.
   
2. **Range of `n`:** What is the maximum possible value of `n`?
   - `1 <= n <= 7` (since `nums` can have up to `14` elements).

3. **Order of operations:** Does the order in which `nums[x]` and `nums[y]` are picked matter?
   - Yes, the index `i` in the `i-th` operation influences the score, so the order does matter.

4. **Output:** Should the function return the score directly?
   - Yes, the function should return the maximum score possible after performing `n` operations.

### Strategy

To maximize the score:
1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization:**
   - Use a recursive approach to explore all possible pairs of numbers and their combinations.
   - Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
   - Represent the state using a bitmask to keep track of which elements have already been used.
   - Iterate through the array and compute the gcd for each pair of numbers, and calculate the potential contribution to the score for each operation.

### Code

```python
import math
from functools import lru_cache

def maxScore(nums):
    n = len(nums) // 2
    
    # Helper function to calculate gcd 
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def backtrack(mask, ops):
        if ops > n:
            return 0
        max_score = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if not (mask & (1 << i)) and not (mask & (1 << j)):
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << i) | (1 << j)
                    current_score = ops * gcd(nums[i], nums[j])
                    next_score = backtrack(new_mask, ops + 1)
                    max_score = max(max_score, current_score + next_score)
        return max_score
    
    return backtrack(0, 1)

# Example usage
nums = [i for i in range(1, 15)]  # Test with a suitable nums array
print(maxScore(nums))
```

### Time Complexity

- **State Space Complexity:** There are `(2n choose 2) / 2` different pairs for `n` operations in a bitmask of size `2n`, giving us roughly \( \text{O}(2^{2n}) \) states.
- **Function Calls:** For each state, we perform \( O(n^2) \) function calls for pair combinations of remaining elements.
  
Combining these:
- The overall **time complexity** is \( \text{O}(n^2 \cdot 2^{2n}) \).
- Given the constraints (`1 <= n <= 7`), this complexity is manageable.

With `n` capped at `7`, solving this problem using bit masking and memoization ensures we can handle the state space effectively within a reasonable runtime.
