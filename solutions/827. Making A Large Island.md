title:  Making A Large Island-out
permalink: /s827
---

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1, to make a larger island.
An island is a 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of 1s.

Return the size of the largest island in `grid` after applying this operation.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size constraint of `grid` ?**
   - The size of the grid, `n x n`, is usually constrained by reasonable computational limits, like `1 <= n <= 500`.

2. **Can we assume the input grid can contain at least one 1?**
   - Yes, we can assume that the grid will contain at least one 1.

3. **Is it possible for the grid to be entirely filled with 1s or 0s?**
   - Yes, the grid can be either entirely filled with 1s or entirely filled with 0s.

4. **Which data structure should be used to return the result?**
   - An integer representing the size of the largest island after one change is sufficient.

## Strategy

1. **Identify All Islands and Their Sizes**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify and label all islands.
   - Store the size of each island and create a unique label for each island.

2. **Check Potential Island Growth**:
   - Traverse each cell with value 0 and check its 4-neighbors.
   - Calculate the potential size if this 0 is converted to 1 and merges one or more neighboring islands.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If the grid is entirely filled with 1s, return the size of the whole grid.
   - If the grid is entirely filled with 0s, return 1 (turn one 0 to a 1).

4. **Merge Results**:
   - Track the maximum island size found in the process.

## Time Complexity

- **Island Identification**: \(O(n^2)\) using DFS/BFS.
- **Grid Traversal for Maximum Size Calculation**: \(O(n^2)\).
- Overall complexity is still \(O(n^2)\).

## Code

```python
def largestIsland(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    island_size = {}
    island_id = 2  # Starting ID for islands to differentiate from 1 and 0

    def dfs(r, c, island_id):
        stack = [(r, c)]
        area = 0
        while stack:
            cr, cc = stack.pop()
            if 0 <= cr < n and 0 <= cc < n and grid[cr][cc] == 1:
                grid[cr][cc] = island_id  # Re-label the island
                area += 1
                for nr, nc in ((cr-1, cc), (cr+1, cc), (cr, cc-1), (cr, cc+1)):
                    stack.append((nr, nc))
        return area
    
    # Label each island and calculate its size
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                island_size[island_id] = dfs(r, c, island_id)
                island_id += 1
    
    # Return the largest island found if no 0s are present (edge case)
    if island_id == 2:  # if we didn't label any island, only original 1 exists
        return n * n

    # Check each 0 cell to see the maximum island size we can get by converting it to 1
    max_island = max(island_size.values(), default=0)
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):
            if grid[r][c] == 0:
                seen = set()
                current_area = 1  # Starting with this cell turned to 1
                for nr, nc in ((r-1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c-1), (r, c+1)):
                    if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] > 1:
                        seen.add(grid[nr][nc])
                for island in seen:
                    current_area += island_size[island]
                max_island = max(max_island, current_area)
    
    return max_island
```

This approach covers all cases and ensures correctness by properly labeling islands and considering each potential 0-to-1 conversion.
