title:  Maximum Number That Sum of the Prices Is Less Than or Equal to K-out

### Problem Statement

Given a list of item prices and a budget `K`, find the maximum number of items that can be bought without the sum of the prices exceeding `K`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can prices include decimal values, or are they integers?**
   - Generally, prices are integers in such problems, but confirm with the interviewer if decimals are allowed.

2. **Is it guaranteed that all prices are positive?**
   - This information helps to understand edge cases, although prices are typically positive.

3. **What should be returned if no items can be bought within the budget?**
   - Confirm if the result should be zero in such cases.

4. **What is the maximum value of `K` and the length of the prices list?**
   - This helps to determine if certain algorithms are feasible.

### Code

Let's write the code for this problem:

```python
def maxItemsWithinBudget(prices, K):
    # Sort the prices to try buying the cheaper items first
    prices.sort()
    
    total = 0
    count = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        if total + price <= K:
            total += price
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return count

# Example usage:
prices = [20, 10, 5, 30, 15]
budget = 35
print(maxItemsWithinBudget(prices, budget))  # Output should be 3
```

### Strategy

1. **Sort the List**: Sorting the prices list ensures that we always consider the cheapest items first, maximizing the number of items we can buy within the budget.
  
2. **Iterate through the Sorted List**: Keep a running total of the prices. If adding the current price does not exceed the budget, include it.
  
3. **Break if the Budget is Exceeded**: As soon as adding another item would exceed the budget, stop the iteration. The count of items added up to this point is the answer.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the list takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of items.
2. **Iterating through the List**: This step is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of items.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n)\).

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the maximum number of items that can be bought within a given budget by sorting the item prices and iterating through them. The time complexity ensures it handles reasonably large datasets efficiently.
