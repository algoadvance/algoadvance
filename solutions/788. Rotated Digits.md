788. Rotated Digits

X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X. Each digit must be rotated, and the result must be a valid number.

Each digit must be rotated as follows:
- 0 is rotated to 0
- 1 is rotated to 1
- 8 is rotated to 8
- 2 is rotated to 5
- 5 is rotated to 2
- 6 is rotated to 9
- 9 is rotated to 6

A number is valid if each digit can be rotated to form another valid digit. A number is different if it does not include any of {3, 4, 7}.

Given a positive integer `N`, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if `N` is 0 or 1? We should handle small values of `N` correctly.
2. **Constraints:**
   - Positive integer `N` (1 <= N <= 10^4). We need to ensure the solution scales well within this range.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Good and Bad Digits:**
   - Good digits: {0, 1, 8, 2, 5, 6, 9}
   - Bad digits: {3, 4, 7}
   
2. **Check Each Number:**
   - Iterate through each number from `1` to `N`.
   - For each number, check if it contains only good digits.
   - Additionally, ensure it contains at least one of the "rotatable" digits that change when rotated (i.e., 2, 5, 6, 9) to confirm it becomes a different number after rotation.

3. **Count the Good Numbers:**
   - Use a counter to keep track of numbers that meet the criteria described above.

### Code

```python
def rotatedDigits(N: int) -> int:
    def is_good(number):
        valid = {'0', '1', '8', '2', '5', '6', '9'}
        changes = {'2', '5', '6', '9'}
        num_str = str(number)
        
        if any(digit in '347' for digit in num_str):
            return False
        
        return any(digit in changes for digit in num_str)

    count = 0
    for num in range(1, N + 1):
        if is_good(num):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage:
print(rotatedDigits(10))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation

1. **Helper Function (`is_good`):**
   - `number` converted to string form allows easy iteration digit by digit.
   - We check if any digit is in the set {'3', '4', '7'} which is invalid.
   - Ensure at least one digit is in the set {'2', '5', '6', '9'} ensuring it changes upon rotation.

2. **Main Function (`rotatedDigits`):**
   - Iterate through the range `1` to `N`.
   - Use the helper function `is_good` to check each number.
   - Count and return the total numbers that meet the criteria.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N * K) where N is the input number and K is the average number of digits in numbers â‰¤ N.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant extra space excluding the input size.
