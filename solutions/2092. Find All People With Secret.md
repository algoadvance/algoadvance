title:  Find All People With Secret-out
permalink: /s2092

You are given a list of `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` indicates that person `xi` and person `yi` met at time `timei`. Person `0` has a secret and initially shares the secret with a subset of persons in the first meeting. You have to return a list of all people who know the secret after all meetings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there any specific order in the returned list?**
   - No specific order is required for the returned list.
  
2. **Are the meeting times guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order?**
   - We should not assume any specific ordering of the meeting times.
  
3. **Do we need to account for people knowing the secret only from the first meeting or also from subsequent meetings?**
   - People can learn and share the secret in subsequent meetings as well.

4. **Are there any constraints on the number of people or the number of meetings?**
   - If not specified, we should assume that constraints are within typical competitive programming limits (e.g., up to 100,000).

### Strategy
1. **Parse and Sort the Meetings:**
   - Sort meetings by time to process them in order.

2. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   - Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage which people know the secret. Union people who meet at the same time.

3. **Process the Meetings:**
   - Add all people who meet at the same time to the Union-Find data structure.
   - Union these people and mark the ones who know the secret.

4. **Propagation:**
   - Check if any of the people within the same set know the secret. If any do, mark the whole set as knowing the secret.

5. **Final Extraction:**
   - Collect all the people who know the secret using the Union-Find data structure.

This approach ensures that we process meetings efficiently and propagate the secret correctly.

### Code
```python
def findAllPeople(n, meetings, firstPerson):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Sort meetings by time
    meetings.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Union-Find Helper Functions
    parent = list(range(n))
    rank = [0] * n
    known = set([0, firstPerson])
    
    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]
    
    def union(x, y):
        rootX = find(x)
        rootY = find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            if rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]:
                parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]:
                parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                parent[rootY] = rootX
                rank[rootX] += 1

    time_to_meetings = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y, t in meetings:
        time_to_meetings[t].append((x, y))
    
    for t in sorted(time_to_meetings.keys()):
        temp_set = set()
        
        # Union all meetings at the same time
        for x, y in time_to_meetings[t]:
            union(x, y)
            temp_set.add(x)
            temp_set.add(y)
            
        # Find a person who knows the secret
        any_contains_secret = any(find(p) in known for p in temp_set)
        
        if any_contains_secret:
            # Union known people with all in temp_set
            for x in temp_set:
                known.add(find(x))
    
    return list(known)

# Example Usage
n = 6
meetings = [[1, 2, 5], [2, 3, 8], [1, 5, 10]]
firstPerson = 1
print(findAllPeople(n, meetings, firstPerson))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting Meetings:** `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of meetings.
- **Union-Find Operations:** Each union and find operation is near constant time, `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, extremely slow-growing.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(m log m + k * α(n))` where `k` is the number of union/find operations performed.
