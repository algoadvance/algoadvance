title:  Maximum Points After Enemy Battles-out
permalink: /s3207

You are engaged in a battle game where you have `n` enemy soldiers lined up in a row. You have to defeat these enemies to earn points. Each soldier `i` has a certain number of points `point[i]` you get for defeating them. However, there's a twist to the game rules:

1. If you decide to defeat an enemy soldier `i`, the soldiers at index `i-1` and `i+1` also get taken out in the battle (if they exist).
2. Your task is to determine the maximum points you can accumulate by defeating the enemies.

Given an array `point` of integers where `point[i]` represents the points awarded for defeating the `i`-th enemy, return the maximum points you can accumulate.

### Examples

- Input: `points = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `9`
- Explanation: Defeat the 3rd enemy (3 points), which also defeats the 2nd (2 points) and 4th (4 points). Total = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9.

- Input: `points = [3, 7, 5, 6, 8]`
- Output: `18`
- Explanation: Defeat the 2nd enemy (7 points), which also defeats the 1st (3 points) and 3rd (5 points). Then defeat the 5th enemy (8 points). Total = 7 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 23.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can points array have negative numbers?
2. What is the length range for the points array?
3. If points array is empty, should we return 0?

## Strategy

This problem resembles the "House Robber" problem where you have to decide whether to include or exclude an element based on some rules.

We can approach this with dynamic programming where:
- We use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points you can accumulate by evaluating up to the `i`-th index.
- When calculating `dp[i]`, we have two choices:
  1. Don't defeat the `i-th` enemy and get `dp[i-1]`.
  2. Defeat the `i-th` enemy and get `points[i]` plus `dp[i-2]` (if `i-2` is a valid index).

### Base Cases
- `dp[0] = points[0]` (if there is only one enemy)
- `dp[1] = max(points[0], points[1])` (if there are at least two enemies)

We will iterate through the points array, updating the `dp` array as described.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of enemy soldiers, because we process each element exactly once. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the `dp` array.

## Code

```python
def max_points(points):
    if not points:
        return 0
    n = len(points)
    if n == 1:
        return points[0]
    
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = points[0]
    if n > 1:
        dp[1] = max(points[0], points[1])
    
    for i in range(2, n):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], points[i] + dp[i-2])
    
    return dp[-1]

# Example usage:
points = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(max_points(points))  # Output: 9 

points = [3, 7, 5, 6, 8]
print(max_points(points))  # Output: 18 
```

This code initializes the `dp` array and iterates through the points array, updating the `dp` values based on the described dynamic programming approach. Finally, it returns the maximum points accumulated, which would be located at `dp[-1]` (the last element in the `dp` array).
