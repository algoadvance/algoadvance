title:  Count Elements With Maximum Frequency-out
permalink: /s3005
---
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, count the number of elements with the maximum frequency in the array.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: The number 3 has the maximum frequency which is 3, and there is only one number with this frequency.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array be empty?
    - No, as per typical constraints, there must be at least one element in the array.
2. Are there any constraints on the values within the array?
    - No specific constraints provided, so we can assume typical integer values within a reasonable range.
3. What if multiple elements have the maximum frequency?
    - The task is to count how many unique elements have the maximum frequency.

## Strategy
1. Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. Determine the maximum frequency from this dictionary.
3. Count how many unique elements have this maximum frequency.

## Code
```python
def countMaxFrequencyElements(nums):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
    freq_count = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in freq_count:
            freq_count[num] += 1
        else:
            freq_count[num] = 1
    
    # Step 2: Determine the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq_count.values())
    
    # Step 3: Count how many elements have the maximum frequency
    max_freq_count = 0
    for count in freq_count.values():
        if count == max_freq:
            max_freq_count += 1
    
    return max_freq_count

# Test example from the problem statement
print(countMaxFrequencyElements([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]))  # Output should be 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Step 1:** Calculating the frequency of each number involves iterating through `nums`, which takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Step 2:** Finding the maximum frequency from the frequency dictionary takes \(O(n)\) time since we need to traverse all unique elements in the worst case.
- **Step 3:** Counting how many elements have the maximum frequency takes \(O(n)\) time in the worst case, as each element could be unique.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).
