title:  Number of Pairs Satisfying Inequality-out
permalink: /s2426
---

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, each of length `n`, and an integer `diff`. Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:

- `0 <= i < j < n` and 
- `nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` contain negative numbers?
   **A**: Yes, the arrays can contain negative numbers.
2. **Q**: Can the value of `diff` be negative?
   **A**: Yes, `diff` can be negative.
3. **Q**: What are the constraints on the size of the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`?
   **A**: Direct details aren't provided, but let's assume that `n` can be reasonably large to affect both time and space complexity considerations.
4. **Q**: Are the array elements bounded within a certain range?
   **A**: Not specified, so assume typical 32-bit integer ranges `[-2^31, 2^31 - 1]`.

### Strategy

The problem essentially boils down to counting pairs `(i, j)` that satisfy a given inequality. We can rephrase the inequality for better understanding:

\[ \text{nums1}[i] - \text{nums1}[j] \leq \text{nums2}[i] - \text{nums2}[j] + \text{diff} \]

Re-arranging terms, we get:

\[ \text{nums1}[i] - \text{nums2}[i] \leq \text{nums1}[j] - \text{nums2}[j] + \text{diff} \]

Define an auxiliary array `arr` where:

\[ \text{arr}[i] = \text{nums1}[i] - \text{nums2}[i] \]

The problem reduces to determining the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:

\[ \text{arr}[i] \leq \text{arr}[j] + \text{diff} \; \text{and} \; 0 \leq i < j < n \]

Using a data structure to efficiently count ranges can help. We can use either a Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) or a sorted list with binary search to achieve an efficient solution. Here, we'll use the sorted list approach for easier code understanding.

### Code

Here's the Python code implementing the solution:

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def number_of_pairs(nums1, nums2, diff):
    n = len(nums1)
    arr = [nums1[i] - nums2[i] for i in range(n)]
    sorted_list = SortedList()
    count = 0

    for value in arr:
        # Count elements in sorted_list that are <= value + diff
        count += sorted_list.bisect_right(value + diff)
        # Insert current value into sorted_list for future counts
        sorted_list.add(value)

    return count

# Example usage
nums1 = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
nums2 = [9, 2, 2, 6, 5]
diff = 3
print(number_of_pairs(nums1, nums2, diff))  # Output: Appropriate count based on the example
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building `arr[]`:** O(n)
- **Inserting into and querying `SortedList`:** O(n log n)

Overall time complexity: **O(n log n)** due to the maintenance of the SortedList and frequent insertions and queries. This should be efficient enough for reasonably large input sizes.

### Explanation
1. Construct the array `arr`.
2. Use a `SortedList` to maintain elements seen so far.
3. For each element in `arr`, count how many previously seen values satisfy the inequality.
4. Update the count and return the result.

This approach leverages efficient range counting to minimize the runtime complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes.
