title:  Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II-out
permalink: /s1751
---

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]` and an integer `k`. The i-th event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given the condition that you can attend at most `k` events.

Your task is to find the maximum sum of values that you can achieve by attending at most `k` non-overlapping events.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can events overlap?**
   - Yes, events can overlap based on their start and end days.

2. **What determines a non-overlapping event?**
   - Two events are non-overlapping if they do not share any day in common, i.e., the end day of one event is less than the start day of the next event.

3. **What is the size of the input?**
   - The number of events can be large. Hence, an efficient solution is needed.

4. **Is there any guarantee that events are given in any particular order?**
   - No, the events might not be given in any specific order.

### Strategy

A Dynamic Programming (DP) approach combined with binary search (or a segment tree) can be used to solve this problem efficiently. Here's how to structure this solution:

1. **Sort the Events**: Sort the events based on their end days. This will help in easily finding non-overlapping events using binary search.
2. **DP State Definition**:
   - `dp[i][j]`: The maximum value achievable by attending up to `j` events considering the first `i` events.
3. **Transition**:
   - For each event `i`, if it is not attended, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.
   - If it is attended, we need to find the last non-overlapping event before event `i` (`p`), and then transition as:
     - `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[p][j-1] + valuei)`.
4. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to efficiently find the last event that ends before the current event starts.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the above strategy:

```python
import bisect

def maxValue(events, k):
    # Step 1: Sort events based on their ending day.
    events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Step 2: Initialize dp array.
    n = len(events)
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Step 3: Create an array of end times.
    end_times = [event[1] for event in events]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Extract event information
        start, end, value = events[i - 1]
        
        # Find the last non-overlapping event using binary search
        p = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, start - 1)
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            # Case 1: Don't attend the current event
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            # Case 2: Attend the current event
            if p > 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[p][j - 1] + value)
    
    return max(dp[n])

# Example usage
events = [[1, 2, 4], [3, 4, 3], [2, 3, 10]]
k = 2
print(maxValue(events, k))  # Expected output: 10
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` because we need to sort the events.
2. **DP and Binary Search Operations**:
   - We have `O(n * k)` iterations due to the nested loops.
   - Inside the loop, each binary search operation (`bisect_right`) is `O(log n)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + n * k log n)`, which is efficient for large inputs.
