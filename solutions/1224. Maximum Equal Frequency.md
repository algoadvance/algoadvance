title:  Maximum Equal Frequency-out
permalink: /s1224
---

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, you need to find the maximum possible value of `m` such that there is at most one integer `x` with a frequency different from the rest by at most one. The length of `nums` is at most \(10^5\).

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any restrictions on the values in the array `nums`?
   - No, the values are positive integers.

2. Should the subsequence be contiguous?
   - The maximum `m` refers to the length of the prefix of the array `nums`, not a contiguous subsequence.

3. What should be returned?
   - Return the maximum value `m` such that there is at most one integer `x` with a frequency different from the rest by at most one.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the idea is to:
- Use a hash map to track the frequencies of elements and another to track the frequencies of those frequencies.
- Iterate through the array while updating the frequency maps.
- For each position in the array, check if the frequencies of the elements satisfy the conditions for the maximum equal frequency criteria.

We keep track of:
1. Frequency of each number.
2. How many numbers have a specific frequency.
3. We check the conditions to see if removing one element or decreasing the frequencies results in a valid state:
   - All elements have the same frequency.
   - All elements have the same frequency except one element that has a frequency of one.
   - All elements have the same frequency except one element that has a frequency greater by one.

## Code

```python
def maxEqualFreq(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    freq_count = defaultdict(int)
    max_length = 0
    max_freq = 0
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if freq[num]:
            freq_count[freq[num]] -= 1
            if freq_count[freq[num]] == 0:
                del freq_count[freq[num]]
        
        freq[num] += 1
        max_freq = max(max_freq, freq[num])
        freq_count[freq[num]] += 1
        
        condition1 = max_freq == 1
        condition2 = freq_count[max_freq] * max_freq == i + 1
        condition3 = freq_count[max_freq] * max_freq == i
        condition4 = freq_count[max_freq - 1] * (max_freq - 1) == i - max_freq + 1
        
        if condition1 or condition2 or condition3 or condition4:
            max_length = i + 1
    
    return max_length
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we iterate through the array once while performing constant time operations for each element, thanks to hash maps (dictionary operations in Python).

The space complexity is also approximately \(O(n)\) in the worst case when we have to store the frequency counts for each distinct number in the array.
