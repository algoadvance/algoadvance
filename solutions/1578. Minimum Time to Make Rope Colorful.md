title:  Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful-out
permalink: /s1578
---

Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. Each balloon is colored with one of the 26 English letters. Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to have the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. The cost of removing each balloon is given in an array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time needed to remove the `i-th` balloon.

Given a string `colors` and an array `neededTime`, return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Remove the balloons with the least neededTime to remove balloons 'a' at positions 0 and 2 (both with cost 1 and 3).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can we assume all inputs (colors and neededTime arrays) are of the same length?
   - **A**: Yes, both the `colors` string and `neededTime` array have the same length n.
   
2. **Q**: Can the `neededTime` array have negative values?
   - **A**: No, `neededTime` values are all non-negative.

3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values of `neededTime`?
   - **A**: The `neededTime` values are non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Traversal**: We will traverse the `colors` string to detect consecutive balloons with the same color.
2. **Cost Calculation**: When we find consecutive balloons with the same color, we determine the minimum cost to remove balloons to avoid having consecutive balloons of the same color.
3. **Sum Accumulation**: We will maintain a running total of the minimum removal times for all such pairs/groups of consecutive same-colored balloons.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. Initialize a variable to keep the total minimum time.
2. Traverse the `colors` string:
   - Compare each character with the next character to see if they are the same.
   - If they are the same, add the minimum of their removal times to the total cost.
   - Ensure the next comparison is between non-removed balloons.
3. Return the accumulated minimum removal time once traversal is complete.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def minCost(colors, neededTime):
    totalCost = 0
    n = len(colors)
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if colors[i] == colors[i-1]:
            # Increment totalCost by minimum of neededTime[i] and neededTime[i-1]
            # and only keep the balloon with the larger neededTime value for further comparisons
            totalCost += min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i-1])
            # Update neededTime[i] to be the max so in the next iteration we still consider the higher one
            if neededTime[i] < neededTime[i-1]:
                neededTime[i] = neededTime[i-1]
                
    return totalCost
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `colors` string. We only make a single pass through the string and do constant time operations for each pair of elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
