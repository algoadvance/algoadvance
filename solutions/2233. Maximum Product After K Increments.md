title:  Maximum Product After K Increments-out
permalink: /s2233
---
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can pick any number from `nums` and increment it by `1`. You need to perform exactly `k` operations and maximize the product of all the elements of the array. Return the maximum product you can get after `k` operations.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [0, 4], k = 5
Output: 20
Explanation: Increment the first number 5 times.
``` 

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain zeroes or negative numbers?
2. What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and the value of `k`?
3. Can `nums` be an empty array?

## Strategy
To maximize the product after `k` operations:
1. We should increment the smallest elements first because it has the most potential to affect the product significantly.
2. By using a min-heap, we can efficiently extract the smallest element and then push the incremented value back.

## Code
Here is the Python code implementing this strategy:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

def maximumProduct(nums, k):
    # Convert nums into a min-heap
    heapify(nums)
    
    while k > 0:
        # Extract the smallest element
        smallest = heappop(nums)
        # Increment it
        smallest += 1
        # Push it back to the heap
        heappush(nums, smallest)
        # Decrement k
        k -= 1
    
    # Calculate the product of the elements in the heap
    product = 1
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    for num in nums:
        product = (product * num) % mod
    
    return product
```

## Time Complexity
- Building the heap from the array takes O(n) time.
- Each increment operation involves removing and adding an element to the heap, each of which is O(log n).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + k log n). 

This approach should be efficient for reasonably large inputs given typical constraints in coding interviews.
