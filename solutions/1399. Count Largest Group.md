title:  Count Largest Group-out
permalink: /s1399
---

You are given an integer `n`. Let `f(x)` be the sum of digits of `x` for `x` in the range `[1, n]`.

Return the number of groups that have the largest size, where a group is defined as a set of integers having the same sum of digits.

### Clarifying Questions

Before implementing the solution, let's clarify the problem with some questions:
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Let's assume `1 <= n <= 10^4`.
2. **What should be the output if there's only one integer?**
   - If there's only one integer, the output should be 1.

Given these questions, we know that we will need to handle fairly large values of `n` efficiently.

### Strategy

1. **Sum of Digits Calculation**: Create a helper function to compute the sum of digits of any integer.
2. **Group Counting**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of the sum of digits for each number in the range `[1, n]`.
3. **Find the Largest Group Size**: Determine the maximum frequency in the dictionary.
4. **Count Largest Groups**: Count how many groups have this maximum frequency.

### Code
Here's how we can implement this:

```python
def count_largest_group(n: int) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict

    def sum_of_digits(x: int) -> int:
        total = 0
        while x > 0:
            total += x % 10
            x //= 10
        return total

    digit_sum_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Calculate sum of digits for each number and count occurrences
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        digit_sum = sum_of_digits(i)
        digit_sum_count[digit_sum] += 1

    # Find the size of the largest group
    max_size = max(digit_sum_count.values())
    
    # Count the number of groups that have the largest size
    largest_groups_count = sum(1 for size in digit_sum_count.values() if size == max_size)
    
    return largest_groups_count
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sum of Digits Calculation**: For each number from 1 to `n`, we compute the sum of digits. This can be done in `O(log k)` time where `k` is the number itself.
2. **Iteration and Counting**: We iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n`, which is `O(n)`.
3. **Finding Maximum and Counting**: These operations are `O(m)` where `m` is the number of unique sums of digits.

Since `n` can be as large as `10^4`, the dominant term is `O(n * log n)`. Thus, the overall time complexity is:

**O(n log n)**

This should be efficient enough for the given problem constraints.
