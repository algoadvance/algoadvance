title:  Corporate Flight Bookings-out
permalink: /s1109
---
You are given a 2D integer array `bookings` where `bookings[i] = [first_i, last_i, seats_i]` represents a booking for seats_i seats on each flight from first_i to last_i (inclusive).

Return an integer array `answer` of length `n`, where `answer[i]` is the total number of seats booked on flight `i`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Inputs**: What are the typical sizes for `n` and the length of `bookings`?
   - The problem constraints will provide these values, but usually `n` can be up to 20000 and `bookings` can be up to 20000.
2. **Booking Bounds**: Are the indices in `bookings` 1-based or 0-based?
   - The problem states that the bookings use 1-based indexing.
3. **Empty Bookings**: Can there be an empty bookings list?
   - Yes, and in such cases, the output should be an array of zeros of length `n`.
4. **Validation**: Should we validate the inputs for any constraints?
   - For the purpose of this problem, we generally assume inputs are valid as per constraints specified in the problem.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a "difference array" approach:

1. **Difference Array**: Use a difference array to handle booking operations in an efficient way:
   - A difference array allows us to perform range update operations in constant time.
   - Instead of directly adding `seats_i` to all elements from `first_i` to `last_i`, we increase the value at `first_i` by `seats_i` and decrease the value at `last_i + 1` by `seats_i`.

2. **Compute Results**: Once the difference array is updated, we can then compute the actual bookings by taking the prefix sums of the difference array.

### Code
```python
def corpFlightBookings(bookings, n):
    # Step 1: Initialize the difference array of size n+1 with 0's
    diff = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Step 2: Apply the bookings to the difference array
    for booking in bookings:
        first_i, last_i, seats_i = booking
        diff[first_i - 1] += seats_i
        if last_i < n:
            diff[last_i] -= seats_i
        
    # Step 3: Compute the result using prefix sums
    answer = [0] * n
    current_booking = 0
    for i in range(n):
        current_booking += diff[i]
        answer[i] = current_booking
    
    return answer
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n + k), where `n` is the number of flights and `k` is the number of bookings.
  - Updating the difference array takes O(k) time.
  - Computing the actual bookings from the prefix sums takes O(n) time.
- Space complexity is O(n) due to the difference array, which requires extra space proportional to the number of flights.

This strategy ensures that the solution is efficient even for larger values of `n` and `bookings`.
