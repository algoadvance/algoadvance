title:  Generate Binary Strings Without Adjacent Zeros-out
permalink: /s3211
---
You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to generate all possible binary strings of length `n` that do not contain `00` as a substring.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["101", "011", "111", "010", "110"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on input:**
   - What is the range of `n`?
   - Answer: 1 ≤ n ≤ 20

2. **Output format:**
   - Should the output be in any specific order (e.g., lexicographical)?
   - Answer: No specific order is required.

3. **Input validation:**
   - Should we handle invalid inputs, or can we assume the input will always be within the constraints?
   - Answer: The input can be assumed to be within the constraints provided.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach:
1. **Recursive Generation:** Generate binary strings by placing either `0` or `1` at each position and ensuring no two adjacent `0`s are placed.
2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, the valid strings are ["0", "1"].
   - If `n` is 2, there are three valid strings ["01", "10", "11"].
3. **Recursive Cases:**
   - If the current string ends with `1`, we can append both `0` and `1`.
   - If the current string ends with `0`, we can append only `1`.

Using Depth-First Search (DFS), we ensure that the generated strings do not contain adjacent `0`s.

### Code

```python
def generate_binary_strings(n):
    def dfs(n, current):
        if n == 0:
            result.append(current)
            return
        
        if not current or current[-1] == '1':
            dfs(n - 1, current + '0')
        
        dfs(n - 1, current + '1')
    
    result = []
    dfs(n, "")
    return result

# Example Usage
n = 3
print(generate_binary_strings(n))  # Output: ["101", "011", "111", "010", "110"]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(2^n)`, as in the worst case, we generate all possible sequences of length `n` (which is `2^n` sequences). However, due to the constraint of not allowing `00`, the actual number of strings is less. The space complexity is also `O(2^n)` since we store all results and use the call stack.
