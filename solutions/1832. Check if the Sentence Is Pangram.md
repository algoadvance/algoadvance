title:  Check if the Sentence Is Pangram-out
permalink: /s1832
---
A pangram is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string sentence containing only lowercase English letters, return true if sentence is a pangram, or false otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Type**: What is the type of the input? 
   - The input is a string containing only lowercase English letters.
2. **Output Type**: What is the type of the output?
   - The output is a boolean value, either `True` or `False`.
3. **Constraints**: 
   - The length of the sentence could be up to \(10^4\).
   - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Use a Set for Uniqueness**: Since we need each letter to appear at least once, we can utilize a set to keep track of distinct letters encountered in the string.
2. **Check Set Length**: After processing the string, if the size of the set is 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet), then the string is a pangram.
3. **Efficiency**: 
   - Insertion into a set and checking its length is efficient.
   - We traverse the string once, making the overall time complexity linear.

### Code
```python
def checkIfPangram(sentence: str) -> bool:
    # A set to track all unique letters in the sentence
    seen_letters = set()
    
    # Iterate through each character in the sentence
    for char in sentence:
        seen_letters.add(char)
    
    # Check if we have all 26 letters
    return len(seen_letters) == 26

# Example usage
sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
print(checkIfPangram(sentence))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once and inserting into the set is on average \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), because the set will hold at most 26 characters regardless of the input size.

Thus, this solution is efficient and straightforward for checking if a sentence is a pangram.
