title:  Most Frequent Even Element-out
permalink: /s2404
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. Find the most frequent even element.

1. If there is a tie, return the smallest one.
2. If there is no such element, return `-1`.

Example:
- Input: `nums = [0,1,2,2,4,4,1]`
- Output: `2`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the array `nums`? 
     - The length of `nums` can be from 1 to \(10^5\).
   - What are the value ranges for elements in `nums`?
     - Elements in `nums` can be from 0 to \(10^5\).

2. **Output Specifics:**
   - What should be the output if there are no even numbers in the array?
     - If there are no even numbers in the array, return `-1`.

### Strategy

1. **Filter Out Even Numbers:**
   - Loop through the array `nums` and identify all even numbers.
2. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Use a dictionary to maintain a count of all even numbers.
3. **Determine Most Frequent and Smallest:**
   - Traverse the dictionary to find the most frequent even number. In case of a tie in frequency, choose the smaller number.
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no even numbers are found, return `-1`.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementation based on our strategy:

```python
def most_frequent_even(nums):
    # Dictionary to store the frequency of even elements
    freq = {}
    
    # Iterate through nums and count frequencies of even numbers
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
    
    # No even numbers case
    if not freq:
        return -1
    
    # Determine the most frequent even number, 
    # If there's a tie, return the smallest even number.
    most_frequent = -1
    max_freq = 0
    
    for num, count in freq.items():
        if count > max_freq or (count == max_freq and num < most_frequent):
            max_freq = count
            most_frequent = num
    
    return most_frequent
    
# Example usage:
nums = [0,1,2,2,4,4,1]
print(most_frequent_even(nums))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Filtering and Counting:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Finding Most Frequent:** O(k), where k is the number of unique even numbers (since we are simply iterating through the dictionary entries).

Overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.
