title:  Clumsy Factorial-out
permalink: /s1006
---

The problem requires us to compute the clumsy factorial of a given integer `N`. The clumsy factorial of `N` is defined as starting with the traditional factorial definition but using a fixed sequence of operations: multiplication `*`, division `/`, addition `+`, and subtraction `-`, in this cyclic order. Operations are applied sequentially from `N` down to `1`.

For example, for `N = 10`, the clumsy factorial is calculated as follows:
```
10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of `N`? (It will typically be positive integers.)
2. **Division Handling**: Should integer division be used throughout? (Yes, use integer division, i.e., `//` operator.)
3. **Order of Operations**: Confirm the cyclic order of operations: multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), addition (`+`), and subtraction (`-`).

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Result**: Start with `N` and iterate downwards.
2. **Cyclic Operations**: Use a cycle of operations: [`*`, `/`, `+`, `-`] using modulo operation to determine the current operation.
3. **Chunk Processing**: Every four numbers can be processed as a group using these operations sequentially.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases for small values of `N`.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the clumsy factorial in Python:

```python
def clumsy(N: int) -> int:
    if N == 0: 
        return 0
    if N <= 2: 
        return N
    if N == 3:
        return 6
        
    # The result starts with the first term (N * (N-1) // (N-2))
    result = N * (N - 1) // (N - 2)
    N -= 3

    # Initialize a flag for addition to be true for the next operation
    add_next = True

    while N > 0:
        if add_next:
            if N > 2:
                result += (N + (1 - N - 1 * (N - 2) // 4))
            elif N == 2:
                result += (2 * 1)
            else:  # N == 1
                result += 1
            add_next = False
        else:
            if N > 2:
                result -= (N * (N - 1) // (N - 2))
            elif N == 2:
                result -= (2 * 1)
            else:  # N == 1
                result -= 1
            add_next = True
        
        N -= 4

    return result

# Testing the function with an example
print(clumsy(10))  # Should output 12
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N / 4) = O(N)\), where `N` is the given number. Each cycle processes four elements and reduces N by 4.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a few extra variables.
