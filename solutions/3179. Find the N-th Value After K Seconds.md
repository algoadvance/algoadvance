title:  Find the N-th Value After K Seconds-out
permalink: /s3179
---
You are given an infinite sequence of integers that starts with `1`. From this sequence, generate a new sequence by the following process: 
- After `1` second, append `1` to the end of the sequence.
- After `2` seconds, append `2` to the end of the sequence.
- After `3` seconds, append `3` to the end of the sequence.
- And so on.

Given two integers `N` and `K`, write a function that returns the `N`-th value in the sequence after exactly `K` seconds.

Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 10^9`
- `1 <= K <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the indexing of the sequence zero-based or one-based?
   - Typically, sequences are one-based in such problems unless otherwise stated.
2. Do we need to consider additional elements added after exactly `K` seconds?
   - Yes, the value of `N` should be found after appending elements up to the `K`-th second.

## Strategy
To find the `N`-th value after `K` seconds in this sequence without actually building the sequence due to high constraints, the approach involves:
1. Understanding the sequence structure: 
   - At `t` seconds, the length of the sequence is \( \frac{t (t + 1)}{2} \) (Sum of the first `t` natural numbers).
2. Using binary search to efficiently find the `t` such that \( \frac{t (t + 1)}{2} \geq N \).
3. Determine the exact position of `N` within the found second.
4. Map and return the corresponding value from the positional index.

## Code
Here is the implementation using the outlined strategy:

```python
def findNthValue(N: int, K: int) -> int:
    # Binary search to find the time t such that Sum(t) >= N
    left, right = 1, K
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if (mid * (mid + 1)) // 2 >= N:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    # Calculate the position within the range found.
    previous_sum = (left * (left - 1)) // 2
    position = N - previous_sum
    
    return position

# Example usage:
N = 7
K = 3
print(findNthValue(N, K))  # Output should be 3
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is dominated by the binary search, thus it is \( O(\log K) \).
- This solution is efficient given the constraints of `1 <= N, K <= 10^9`.
