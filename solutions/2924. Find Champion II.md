### Problem Statement
In a given list of scores, determine the "Champion II-out". The "Champion II-out" is defined as the player who has the second-highest score in a list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of the length of the list?
    - Are there any constraints on the values of the scores (e.g., are they all positive integers, can they be negative)?
    - Can there be duplicate scores?
    - What should be the output if there are fewer than 2 unique scores?
   
2. **Output**:
    - If there are fewer than 2 unique scores, should we return any specific value or raise an exception?

### Strategy
1. **Handle Edge Cases**:
    - If the list has fewer than 2 elements or fewer than 2 unique scores, return a specific value or raise an exception as per the requirement.
  
2. **Unique Score Extraction**:
    - Extract unique scores using a set to eliminate duplicates.
  
3. **Finding the Second-Highest Score**:
    - Sort the unique scores in descending order and pick the second element.
  
4. **Time Complexity**:
    - Using set to find unique elements is O(n).
    - Sorting unique elements is O(U log U) where U is the number of unique elements.

### Code
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def find_champion_ii_out(scores):
    # Convert the list to a set to get unique scores
    unique_scores = list(set(scores))
    
    # If there are fewer than 2 unique scores, return None or raise an Exception
    if len(unique_scores) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Sort the unique scores in descending order
    unique_scores.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Return the second element in the sorted list
    return unique_scores[1]

# Example usage
scores = [10, 20, 40, 10, 20, 30, 40]
print(find_champion_ii_out(scores))  # Output: 30
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: 
    - Converting the list to a set takes O(n) time.
    - Sorting the unique elements takes O(U log U) time (where U is the number of unique elements, and U â‰¤ n).
    - Overall, the time complexity is O(n) + O(U log U) which simplifies to O(n log n) in the worst case when U is close to n.

- **Space Complexity**:
    - Using a set of unique scores requires O(U) space.
    - Therefore, the space complexity is O(U), which is O(n) in the worst case.
