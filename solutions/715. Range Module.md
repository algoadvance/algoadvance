You are tasked with implementing a data structure that can efficiently track and query the coverage of multiple ranges on a number line. This problem can be solved using a class `RangeModule` with the following functionalities:

1. **addRange(left: int, right: int)**: Adds the range [left, right) to the range module. The interval includes left and goes up to but not including right.
2. **queryRange(left: int, right: int)**: Returns true if every integer in the range [left, right) is currently being tracked by the range module.
3. **removeRange(left: int, right: int)**: Stops tracking every integer in the range [left, right).

The data structure should efficiently manage these operations, especially when dealing with overlapping and adjacent ranges.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the input ranges guaranteed to be valid (i.e., left < right)?**
   - Yes, all input ranges are valid.

2. **What is the range of the input values for `left` and `right`?**
   - Typically, it is safe to assume the inputs are within the range of standard Python integers.

3. **Are there any constraints on the maximum number of add, query, and remove operations?**
   - There are no explicit constraints, so we should assume the operations could be numerous.

4. **Should we consider integer overflow concerns or assume Python handles it?**
   - We assume Python handles integer overflow.

### Strategy:

To manage ranges efficiently, we can use a data structure that allows for quick updates and queries:
- A list of intervals, which can be kept sorted to facilitate merging and splits.

For each operation:
1. **addRange(left, right)**:
   - Merge the new interval with any overlapping intervals.

2. **queryRange(left, right)**:
   - Perform a check to see if the entire range [left, right) is covered by the tracked intervals.

3. **removeRange(left, right)**:
   - Split intervals if the range [left, right) intersects with any tracked intervals.

To maintain performance:
- Keep intervals sorted.
- Use binary search where applicable for efficiency.

### Code:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

class RangeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intervals = []

    def addRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> None:
        new_intervals = []
        placed = False
        for start, end in self.intervals:
            if end < left or start > right:
                new_intervals.append((start, end))
            else:
                left = min(left, start)
                right = max(right, end)
        new_intervals.append((left, right))
        self.intervals = []
        for start, end in sorted(new_intervals):
            if self.intervals and self.intervals[-1][1] >= start:
                self.intervals[-1] = (self.intervals[-1][0], max(self.intervals[-1][1], end))
            else:
                self.intervals.append((start, end))

    def queryRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> bool:
        idx = bisect_right(self.intervals, (left, float('inf')))
        if idx == 0:
            return False
        return self.intervals[idx - 1][0] <= left < right <= self.intervals[idx - 1][1]

    def removeRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> None:
        new_intervals = []
        for start, end in self.intervals:
            if end <= left or start >= right:
                new_intervals.append((start, end))
            else:
                if start < left:
                    new_intervals.append((start, left))
                if end > right:
                    new_intervals.append((right, end))
        self.intervals = new_intervals
```

### Time Complexity:

- **addRange**: The time complexity is approximately O(n) in the worst case, because we may have to merge multiple intervals.
- **queryRange**: The time complexity is O(log n) due to binary search.
- **removeRange**: Similar to addRange, the worst case is O(n).

In summary, efficient interval management requires careful handling of overlapping and adjacent intervals to ensure that the class methods operate within acceptable time bounds.
