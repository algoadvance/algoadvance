title:  Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three-out
permalink: /s3190
---

Given an array of integers `nums`, find the minimum number of operations required to make all elements divisible by 3. In one operation, you can increase or decrease an element of the array by 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the values in `nums`?**
   - The values can be any integer within typical constraints for an array element in competitive programming.
   
2. **Is there a constraint on the length of the array `nums`?**
   - The length of the array can be anything reasonable for LeetCode problems, typically up to 10^5.

3. **What kind of operations can we perform?**
   - You can increase or decrease any element by 1 in a single operation.

4. **Are there any edge cases we need to handle, like empty arrays or arrays with a single element?**
   - While the problem typically assumes a non-empty array, an empty array would trivially require 0 operations.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Remainders**:
    - For an element `x`, if `x % 3 == 0`, it is already divisible by 3.
    - If `x % 3 == 1`, we need 2 steps to make `x` divisible by 3 (either -1 or +2).
    - If `x % 3 == 2`, we need 1 step to make `x` divisible by 3 (either +1 or -2).
    
2. **Counting Each Case**:
    - We traverse the array and count how many elements fall into each of the above three categories.
    
3. **Sum Up the Operations**:
    - Calculate the total minimum operations required by summing the operations needed for each remainder group.
    - Total operations = count of `x % 3 == 1` * 2 + count of `x % 3 == 2`.

### Code

```python
def min_operations_to_divisible_by_3(nums):
    remainder_1_count = 0
    remainder_2_count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        remainder = num % 3
        if remainder == 1:
            remainder_1_count += 1
        elif remainder == 2:
            remainder_2_count += 1
            
    operations = remainder_1_count * 2 + remainder_2_count
    
    return operations

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(min_operations_to_divisible_by_3(nums))  # Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because we are making a single pass over the array to count the remainders, and the operations required for each element are performed in constant time.
