Given two integers `low` and `high`, return a sorted list of all the integers in the range `[low, high]` inclusive that have sequential digits.

Sequential digits are digits in an integer that follow each other in increasing order. For example, 123, 234, etc.

### Example
```python
Input: low = 100, high = 300
Output: [123, 234]

Input: low = 1000, high = 13000
Output: [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678, 6789, 12345]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range Bounds:** Can `low` and `high` be negative or should we assume they're always non-negative integers?
   - Assume `low` and `high` are always non-negative integers.

2. **Range Validity:** Should we consider cases where `low` is greater than `high`?
   - We will assume proper input validation, such that `low` is always less than or equal to `high`.

3. **Output Format:** Should the output always be sorted?
   - Yes, the result should always be sorted.

## Strategy
1. **Generate Sequential Numbers:** We create a function to generate all sequential digits that are numbers with increasing consecutive digits.
2. **Filter Based on Range:** Filter these generated sequential numbers to fit within the provided `low` and `high` range.

### Steps:
1. **Generate Candidates:** Start with generating numbers like 12, 23, 34... up to 123456789.
2. **Build Sequential Numbers:** Build sequential numbers dynamically or using a list of pre-calculated sequences.
3. **Filter the List:** Filter these numbers using the given `low` and `high` boundaries.
4. **Return Sorted List:** Since the numbers are generated in increasing order, they will naturally be sorted.

### Code

```python
def sequential_digits(low: int, high: int):
    sequential_numbers = []
    # Generate all sequential digits numbers from 12 to 123456789
    for length in range(2, 10):  # lengths of digit sequences from 2 to 9
        for start in range(1, 10 - length + 1):  # starting digits
            num = int(''.join(str(start + i) for i in range(length)))
            sequential_numbers.append(num)

    # Filter the numbers within the specified range
    result = [num for num in sequential_numbers if low <= num <= high]
    return sorted(result)  # Optional since generated numbers are already sorted

# Example usage
print(sequential_digits(100, 300))     # Output: [123, 234]
print(sequential_digits(1000, 13000))  # Output: [1234, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678, 6789, 12345]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Generation Time:** Creating the sequential numbers involves nested loops controlled by fixed ranges (`length` from 2 to 9 and `start` from 1 to a maximum of `9-length+1`).
  - This has a constant time complexity as it does not depend on `low` and `high`.

- **Filtering Time:** Linear in the number of generated sequential digits, which is a small constant factor resulting in `O(n)` where `n` is the number of precomputed sequential numbers (which is at most 36).

Thus, the overall complexity is effectively `O(1)` given the low, fixed number of potential sequential digits.
