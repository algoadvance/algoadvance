title:  Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps-out
permalink: /s2400
---
You are given two integers `startPos` and `endPos` representing the start and end positions on a one-dimensional number line. You are also given an integer `k`, representing the number of steps you need to take. In one step, you can move either one position to the left or one position to the right.

Return the number of different ways you can reach the position `endPos` starting from `startPos` after exactly `k` steps. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `startPos`, `endPos`, or `k` be negative?**
   - No, all inputs are non-negative integers.

2. **Is there a maximum constraint on the values of `startPos`, `endPos`, and `k`?**
   - The problem does not explicitly state, but typically, it should be inferred that the values are within a manageable range for computational purposes (e.g., 0 to 10^9).

3. **What should be returned if it's impossible to reach `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps?**
   - Return 0 if it's impossible.

### Strategy
To determine the number of ways to reach `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps:

1. **Dynamic Programming** can efficiently solve this problem. We can use a dictionary to memoize the states we've already computed to avoid redundant calculations.
   
2. **Recursive Approach with Memoization**:
   - Define a recursive function `dp(steps_remaining, current_pos)` that returns the number of ways to reach `endPos` from `current_pos` given `steps_remaining` steps.
   - Base cases:
     - If `steps_remaining` == 0: return 1 if `current_pos` == `endPos`, else return 0.
   - Recursive case:
     - From `current_pos`, you can move either left or right. Thus combine the results of these two options for recursive subproblems.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the number of ways can be large, we'll use `MOD = 10**9 + 7` to keep the results manageable and as required by the problem.

### Code

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def numberOfWays(startPos, endPos, k):
    memo = {}
    
    def dp(steps_remaining, current_pos):
        if (steps_remaining, current_pos) in memo:
            return memo[(steps_remaining, current_pos)]
        
        if steps_remaining == 0:
            return 1 if current_pos == endPos else 0
        
        # Number of ways to current_pos in steps_remaining steps
        ways_left = dp(steps_remaining - 1, current_pos - 1)
        ways_right = dp(steps_remaining - 1, current_pos + 1)
        
        memo[(steps_remaining, current_pos)] = (ways_left + ways_right) % MOD
        return memo[(steps_remaining, current_pos)]
    
    return dp(k, startPos)

# Example usage:
# print(numberOfWays(1, 2, 3)) # Output the number of ways to reach 2 from 1 in exactly 3 steps
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(k * (2 * maxPos))`, where `maxPos` is derived from the maximum possible range that the position can extend to accommodate all `k` steps.
    - In the worst case, each position `current_pos` needs to be explored for each step from 0 to `k`.
- The space complexity is also `O(k * (2 * maxPos))` because of the memoization storage.

This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently solve the problem, reducing redundant computations and ensuring that the solution remains manageable within computational limits.
