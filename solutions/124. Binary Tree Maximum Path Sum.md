LeetCode Problem 124: **Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum**

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The path in the example tree is (2 -> 1 -> 3)
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The path in the example tree is (15 -> 20 -> 7)
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Question:** Can the tree contain negative values?
   - **Answer:** Yes, nodes can have negative values.
   
2. **Question:** Should the path sum include only nodes or edges?
   - **Answer:** The sum includes nodes, not edges.

3. **Question:** Does the path need to be continuous and follow any specific order?
   - **Answer:** The path must be continuous, but it doesn’t need to follow any particular order in the nodes beyond parent-child links.

## Strategy

1. **Problem Analysis:** For each node in the tree, we need to consider paths that pass through it. The path sum for each node can be calculated as:
   - The maximum path sum from the left subtree + node's value + maximum path sum from the right subtree.
   - Additionally, for recursion purposes, the calculated maximum path going from this node to any leaf node should be max(node’s value + left subtree maximum, node’s value + right subtree maximum, node’s value).

2. **Approach:**
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
   - For each node calculate:
     - The maximum path sum including both left and right subtrees.
     - Update the global maximum path sum if the current sum through the node is higher.
   - Return the maximum path to the caller, considering only one side of the subtree (left or right).

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single node tree.
   - Tree with all negative values.

## Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal max_sum
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            # Recursively compute the maximum path sum of the left and right subtrees
            left_max = max(0, dfs(node.left))
            right_max = max(0, dfs(node.right))
            
            # Current maximum path sum including the current node
            current_max = node.val + left_max + right_max
            
            # Update the global maximum path sum if the current path sum is greater
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_max)
            
            # Return the maximum path sum passing through this node
            return node.val + max(left_max, right_max)
        
        # Initialize global maximum path sum
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        dfs(root)
        return max_sum
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the function call stack space using recursion.

This strategy and solution ensure that we efficiently find the maximum path sum in the binary tree with clear handling of edge cases.
