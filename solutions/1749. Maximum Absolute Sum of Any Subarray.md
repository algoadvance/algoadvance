title:  Maximum Absolute Sum of Any Subarray-out
permalink: /s1749

Given an integer array `nums`, find the maximum absolute sum of any (possibly empty) subarray of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Example
- **Example 1:**
  - **Input:** `nums = [1,-3,2,3,-4]`
  - **Output:** `5`
- **Example 2:**
  - **Input:** `nums = [2,-5,1,-4,3,-2]`
  - **Output:** `8`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain only positive or only negative numbers?
   - Yes, the array can contain any combination of integers within the given range.
2. What should be the output if `nums` is an empty array?
   - The constraints guarantee that the length of `nums` is at least 1, so we don't need to handle the empty array case.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize the concepts related to the Kadane's Algorithm for finding the maximum sum subarray, but with some modifications to account for both positive and negative subarrays.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Maximum Subarray Sum:** 
   - Compute the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's Algorithm.
   
2. **Minimum Subarray Sum:** 
   - Compute the minimum subarray sum using a variant of Kadane's Algorithm.

### Outline of the Algorithm
1. Initialize two variables `max_sum` and `min_sum` to `0`.
2. Traverse the array, maintaining the current maximum and minimum subarray sums.
3. For each element update:
   - The running maximum sum of the subarray.
   - The running minimum sum of the subarray.
4. The result will be the maximum of the absolute values of `max_sum` and `min_sum`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n)` since we are traversing the array only once.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code

```python
def max_absolute_sum(nums):
    max_sum = 0
    min_sum = 0
    current_max = 0
    current_min = 0

    for num in nums:
        current_max = max(current_max + num, num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_max)
        current_min = min(current_min + num, num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_min)

    return max(abs(max_sum), abs(min_sum))

# Example usage:
print(max_absolute_sum([1, -3, 2, 3, -4]))      # Output: 5
print(max_absolute_sum([2, -5, 1, -4, 3, -2]))  # Output: 8
```

By applying this approach, we effectively find both the maximum positive subarray sum and the maximum negative subarray sum, and the absolute maximum is derived from the higher of these values.
