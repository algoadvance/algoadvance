title:  Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid-out
permalink: /s2257
---

You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing a `m x n` grid, where each cell is initially unguarded (marked as 0). You are also given two arrays `guards` and `walls` where `guards[i] = [row_i, col_i]` and `walls[i] = [row_i, col_i]` represent the positions of the guards and walls on the grid, respectively.

A guard can see every cell in its row and column except for any parts blocked by a wall. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard who can see the cell. Return the number of unguarded cells in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can guards see through other guards?**
   - No, guards cannot see past walls or other guards.
   
2. **Can guards guard themselves?**
   - Yes, the cell where the guard is placed is considered guarded.

3. **What are the possible values for `m` and `n`?**
   - Assume `1 <= m, n <= 1000`.

4. **Can there be multiple guards or walls at the same position?**
   - No, each position is unique either containing a guard or a wall.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a `m x n` grid initialized to 0 indicating all cells are initially unguarded.
   - Mark the positions of guards with a distinct value, say `G`, and walls with another value, say `W`.

2. **Guarding cells:**
   - For each guard, mark the cells in its row and column as visible (guarded) until a wall or edge of the grid is encountered.
   - Ensure to skip marking when another guard or wall is encountered.

3. **Count unguarded cells:**
   - After marking guards' vision, count the number of cells that remain unguarded.

### Code

```python
def countUnguarded(m, n, guards, walls):
    GRID_EMPTY = 0
    GRID_GUARD = 1
    GRID_WALL = 2
    GRID_GUARDED = 3
    
    # Initialize the grid
    grid = [[GRID_EMPTY] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Place guards and walls on the grid
    for r, c in guards:
        grid[r][c] = GRID_GUARD
    for r, c in walls:
        grid[r][c] = GRID_WALL
    
    # Directions: right, down, left, up
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Set guard's vision in all 4 directions
    for r, c in guards:
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            while 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n:
                if grid[nr][nc] == GRID_WALL or grid[nr][nc] == GRID_GUARD:
                    break
                if grid[nr][nc] == GRID_EMPTY:
                    grid[nr][nc] = GRID_GUARDED
                nr, nc = nr + dr, nc + dc
    
    # Count unguarded cells
    unguarded_count = 0
    for row in grid:
        for cell in row:
            if cell == GRID_EMPTY:
                unguarded_count += 1
    
    return unguarded_count

# Example use:
m = 4
n = 6
guards = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 3]]
walls = [[0, 1], [2, 2], [1, 4]]

print(countUnguarded(m, n, guards, walls))  # Output will be the number of unguarded cells.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(m * n) to create and initialize the grid.
- **Placing Guards/Walls:** O(g + w), where `g` is the number of guards and `w` is the number of walls.
- **Guarding Cells:** O(g * (m + n)). Each guard might look over a whole row and column.
- **Counting Unguarded Cells:** O(m * n), since we need to check every cell in the grid.

Overall time complexity: **O(m * n + g * (m + n))**, which is efficient for reasonably large grid sizes.
