title:  Set Matrix Zeroes-out
permalink: /s73
---
Given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0's`.

You must do it in place.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix (m and n)?**
   - Typical constraints for LeetCode problems are decent sized matrices (e.g., up to 200x200).
   
2. **Is there any restriction on the auxiliary space usage?**
   - Given the requirement to do it "in place," it is implied that we should aim to minimize extra space usage.

3. **Are there specific constraints on matrix elements (range of values)?**
   - The problem is typically about integers and we should assume all elements can be any integer, including negatives.

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Zero Entries:**
   - Traverse the matrix and identify the rows and columns that need to be zeroed out.

2. **Mark Rows and Columns:**
   - Use the first row and the first column as markers to store this information.

3. **Zero Out Marked Rows and Columns:**
   - Use the markers to update the matrix elements to zero accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases to Consider:**
   - Handle the zeroing of the first row and first column separately since they are used as markers.

### Code:

```python
def setZeroes(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return

    m, n = matrix.length, matrix[0].length
    first_row_has_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(n))
    first_col_has_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(m))
    
    # Use first row and column to mark zeros
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][0] = 0
                matrix[0][j] = 0
    
    # Zero out cells based on markers except the first row and first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:
                matrix[i][j] = 0

    # Zero out the first row if needed
    if first_row_has_zero:
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[0][j] = 0
    
    # Zero out the first column if needed
    if first_col_has_zero:
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][0] = 0
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - We only traverse the matrix a couple of times, leading to a linear scan of all elements.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use the matrix's first row and first column as storage for zeroing instructions, hence no extra space proportional to the input size is used except for a few variables.
