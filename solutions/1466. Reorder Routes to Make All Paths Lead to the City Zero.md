title:  Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero-out
permalink: /s1466
---

You are given `n` cities labeled from `0` to `n-1` and an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents a directed edge from city `a_i` to city `b_i`. Each city is connected to exactly one other city except the central city `0`.

Your task is to reorder the connections such that every city can be visited starting from city `0`. Return the minimum number of edges that need to be reordered.

### Example
```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges [1,3], [2,3], and [4,5] to make all paths lead to city 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are all the cities guaranteed to be reachable from city `0` initially (if possibly in reverse)?
2. Can edges point back to city 0 directly or other cities?
3. Is it possible to have duplicate edges or self-loop?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can:
1. Construct a graph in both the original direction and the reversed direction.
2. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse from city `0`.
3. Count the number of reorders needed:
   - When traversing, if we encounter an edge in the original direction, it means the edge needs to be reversed.
   - If we traverse in the reversed direction, we do not need to change the edge since it leads to the root city.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the graph takes O(n).
- Traversing the graph using BFS takes O(n).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def minReorder(n, connections):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    reverse_graph = defaultdict(list)

    # Build the graph and reverse graph
    for a, b in connections:
        graph[a].append(b)
        reverse_graph[b].append(a)

    # Use BFS to count the changes needed
    visited = [False] * n
    queue = deque([0])
    visited[0] = True
    reorder_count = 0

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        # Traverse original graph and count changes
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                reorder_count += 1
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append(neighbor)
        # Traverse reverse graph (no changes needed)
        for neighbor in reverse_graph[current]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append(neighbor)

    return reorder_count

# Example usage
n = 6
connections = [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 0], [4, 5]]
print(minReorder(n, connections))  # Output: 3
```
This function `minReorder` constructs the two graphs, uses BFS to count the reorderings necessary, and finally returns the count.
