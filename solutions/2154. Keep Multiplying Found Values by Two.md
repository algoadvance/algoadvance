title:  Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two-out
permalink: /s2154

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Your task is to find a value, `original`, which is in the `nums` array and keep multiplying it by `2` as long as it is present in the array. Once the value does not exist in the array, return the final value.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicity in `nums`:**
   - Q: Can there be duplicate values in the `nums` array?
   - A: Yes, it's possible.

2. **Array Properties:**
   - Q: Are there any restrictions on the size or range of the numbers in `nums`?
   - A: The problem does not specify, so we assume typical integer values.

3. **Initial Value:**
   - Q: Should the `original` value always be chosen from the `nums` array?
   - A: Yes, `original` must be a value from the `nums` array.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Start with a given initial value, `original`.

2. **Set for Fast Lookup:**
   - Convert `nums` into a set to allow O(1) average-time complexity for checking the presence of values.

3. **Multiplication Loop:**
   - While `original` is in the set, multiply it by 2.
   - Once `original` is not found in the set, break the loop and return the current value of `original`.
   
This ensures that the solution is efficient and leverages fast membership testing.

### Time Complexity

- Converting `nums` to a set: O(n)
- Each lookup operation in the set: O(1) on average
- In the worst case, if `original` starts very small and doubles many times before it is not found, the loop can run multiple times, but still, this would be much fewer operations compared to any linear or quadratic approach.

Hence, the overall time complexity would be approximately O(n).

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def findFinalValue(nums, original):
    nums_set = set(nums)
    while original in nums_set:
        original *= 2
    return original
```

#### Example Walkthrough:

- Given `nums = [5, 3, 6, 1, 12]` and `original = 3`:
  - `original = 3` is in `nums_set` -> multiply `original` by 2 -> `original = 6`.
  - `original = 6` is in `nums_set` -> multiply `original` by 2 -> `original = 12`.
  - `original = 12` is in `nums_set` -> multiply `original` by 2 -> `original = 24`.
  - `original = 24` is not in `nums_set`, return `original = 24`.

This approach ensures we find the correct value efficiently.
