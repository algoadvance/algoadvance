title:  Latest Time You Can Obtain After Replacing Characters-out
permalink: /s3114
---
You are given a string `time` in the format `HH:MM` representing the latest possible time you could produce by changing at most 2 characters from the initial `time`. Return the latest possible time you can get.

For example:
- If `time = "2?:?0"`, you can replace the `?` with digits to produce the latest possible time, which is "23:50".
- If `time = "0?:3?"`, the latest possible time is "09:39".

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Do we always guarantee that the format will be `HH:MM`?
   - Yes.
2. Are the `:` and all non-`?` characters valid digits for a time?
   - Yes, any non-`?` characters will be valid digits.

## Strategy:
1. For the first character (`time[0]`), determine if itâ€™s `?`. If it is, consider the constraints based on the second character (`time[1]`).
   - If `time[1]` is between `0-3` or `?`, set `time[0]` to `2`.
   - Otherwise, set `time[0]` to `1`.
2. For the second character (`time[1]`), if it's `?`:
   - If `time[0]` is `2`, set it to `3`.
   - Otherwise, set it to `9`.
3. For the third character, it's always `:` and does not need modification.
4. For the fourth character (`time[3]`), if it's `?`, set it to `5` (latest possible for tens of minutes).
5. For the fifth character (`time[4]`), if it's `?`, set it to `9` (latest possible for units of minutes).

## Code:

```python
def latestTime(time: str) -> str:
    # Convert string to a list of characters for easier manipulation
    time = list(time)
    
    # Determine the maximum hour
    if time[0] == '?':
        if time[1] == '?' or time[1] < '4':
            time[0] = '2'
        else:
            time[0] = '1'
    
    if time[1] == '?':
        if time[0] == '2':
            time[1] = '3'
        else:
            time[1] = '9'
    
    # The ':' character does not change, so time[2] is untouched
    
    # Determine the maximum minute for tens place
    if time[3] == '?':
        time[3] = '5'
    
    # Determine the maximum minute for units place
    if time[4] == '?':
        time[4] = '9'
    
    # Convert list of characters back to string
    return ''.join(time)

# Example usage
print(latestTime("2?:?0"))  # Output: "23:50"
print(latestTime("0?:3?"))  # Output: "09:39"
print(latestTime("1?:22"))  # Output: "19:22"
print(latestTime("?4:5?"))  # Output: "14:59"
```

## Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs with constant time complexity, i.e., \(O(1)\), since the length of the time string is fixed and small (always 5 characters, including the colon). Each operation (checking, setting characters) is performed a constant number of times. Thus the overall complexity is \(O(5)\) or more generally \(O(1)\).
