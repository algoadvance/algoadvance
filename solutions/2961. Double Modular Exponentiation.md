### Problem Statement

You are given four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `m`. You are required to compute the value of \( a^b \mod m \) under the constraint that the exponent \( b \) itself may be large and given in modular format \( b^c \mod (m-1) \). Compute the value of \( (a^{(b^c \mod (m-1))} \mod m) \).

### Example
Suppose you are given the integers `a = 3`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`, and `m = 11`. You need to compute:

1. Compute `b^c mod (m-1)`:
   - \( b^c = 5^7 \)
   - \( m - 1 = 11 - 1 = 10 \)
   - \( 5^7 \mod 10 \)

2. Compute `a` raised to the power obtained in step 1 modulo `m`:
   - If the power obtained in step 1 is \( x \), then compute \( a^x \mod m \)

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `m` guaranteed to be positive?
2. How large can the integers be?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use modular exponentiation to handle potentially large exponents efficiently. The steps are as follows:

1. Use the modular exponentiation technique to compute \( b^c \mod (m-1) \).
2. Use the result of step 1 to compute \( a \) raised to that power, modulo \( m \).

Pythonâ€™s built-in `pow` function supports three arguments of the form `pow(base, exp, mod)`, which directly computes \( \text{base}^\text{exp} \mod \text{mod} \) efficiently. We can use this to our advantage.

### Code

Here's how we can implement this:

```python
def double_modular_exponentiation(a, b, c, m):
    # Compute the exponent e = (b^c mod (m-1))
    mod_exp = pow(b, c, m-1)
    
    # Compute the result = (a^mod_exp mod m)
    result = pow(a, mod_exp, m)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
a = 3
b = 5
c = 7
m = 11

print(double_modular_exponentiation(a, b, c, m))  # Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity

- Computing `b^c mod (m-1)` using `pow` function takes \( O(\log c \cdot \log \log m) \).
- Computing `a^e mod m` using `pow` function takes \( O(\log e \cdot \log \log m) \).

The overall time complexity is dominated by the larger of the two logarithmic operations, making it highly efficient even for large values.
