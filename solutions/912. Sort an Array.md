title:  Sort an Array-out
permalink: /s912
---

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   - The size of the array can range from 1 to 50000.
   
2. Can the list contain negative integers?
   - Yes, the list can contain both negative and positive integers.
   
3. Are there any constraints on the space complexity?
   - No specific constraints were mentioned, so use of extra space is allowed if needed.

4. Are there any duplicate elements in the array?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

## Strategy

We'll use the Merge Sort algorithm for this problem. Merge Sort is a classical divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array. It is well-suited for this problem because it has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is optimal for sorting arrays.

### Steps:
1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.
2. **Recursively Sort**: Apply merge sort recursively to sort each half.
3. **Merge**: Merge the two sorted halves to produce the sorted array.

### Code Implementation

```python
def sortArray(nums):
    # Helper function to merge two sorted arrays
    def merge(left, right):
        sorted_array = []
        i = j = 0
        
        # Merge elements from left and right arrays in sorted order
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                sorted_array.append(left[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                sorted_array.append(right[j])
                j += 1
        
        # Add remaining elements from left array if any
        while i < len(left):
            sorted_array.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        
        # Add remaining elements from right array if any
        while j < len(right):
            sorted_array.append(right[j])
            j += 1
        
        return sorted_array
    
    # Main function to perform merge sort
    def merge_sort(array):
        if len(array) <= 1:
            return array
        
        mid = len(array) // 2
        left_half = merge_sort(array[:mid])
        right_half = merge_sort(array[mid:])
        
        return merge(left_half, right_half)
    
    return merge_sort(nums)

# Example usage
nums = [5, 2, 3, 1]
print(sortArray(nums))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Divide**: The array is divided into halves at each step, taking \(O(\log n)\) steps.
- **Merge**: Each level of merge operation processes all \(n\) elements of the array, taking \(O(n)\) time.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity

Merge sort requires additional space for the temporary arrays used in the merge operation. The space complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the size of the input array.

By following this approach, we can efficiently sort the array in optimal time.
