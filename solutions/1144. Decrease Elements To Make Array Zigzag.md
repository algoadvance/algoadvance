title:  Decrease Elements To Make Array Zigzag-out
permalink: /s1144
---

Given an array `nums` of integers, a *zigzag* array is defined as an array where:
- Every even-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements,
- or every odd-indexed element is greater than adjacent elements.

Your goal is to make a given array into a zigzag array by decreasing some of its elements. The cost of decreasing an element is how much you decrement it by. Return the minimum cost of transforming the given array into a zigzag array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can the array be empty or have a single element?**
   - A: The array may be empty. If it has one element, no modifications are needed, so the cost would be 0.

2. **Q: Are there any restrictions on the values within the array?**
   - A: The values are general integers; they can be positive, negative, or zero.

3. **Q: Can we increase elements, or are we restricted only to decreasing elements?**
   - A: We can only decrease the elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we have two potential forms for our zigzag array:
1. Even-indexed elements are greater than adjacent elements.
2. Odd-indexed elements are greater than adjacent elements.

We will calculate the cost for both forms and return the minimum.

#### Steps:
1. Iterate through the array and calculate the cost required to make every even indexed element greater than adjacent elements.
2. Do the same where every odd indexed element is greater than adjacent elements.
3. Compare the two costs and return the minimum.

### Code
```python
def minCostToMakeZigzag(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    def calculate_cost(make_even_greater):
        cost = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            decrease = 0
            if make_even_greater:
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    if i > 0 and nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                        decrease = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1
                    if i < len(nums) - 1 and nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]:
                        decrease = max(decrease, nums[i + 1] - nums[i] + 1)
            else:
                if i % 2 != 0:
                    if i > 0 and nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
                        decrease = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1
                    if i < len(nums) - 1 and nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]:
                        decrease = max(decrease, nums[i + 1] - nums[i] + 1)
            cost += decrease
        return cost

    cost_1 = calculate_cost(make_even_greater=True)
    cost_2 = calculate_cost(make_even_greater=False)
    return min(cost_1, cost_2)

# Example Usage
print(minCostToMakeZigzag([1,2,3])) # Output: 2
print(minCostToMakeZigzag([9,6,1,6,2])) # Output: 4
```

### Strategy Explained
1. **calculate_cost Function**: 
    - The function takes a boolean parameter `make_even_greater` which indicates whether the even or odd indexed elements should be greater.
    - For each element in the array, if it's an even index and `make_even_greater` is `True`, then check both left and right neighbors to calculate how much we need to decrease the current element to make the condition hold.
    - Do a similar check for odd indexed elements when `make_even_greater` is `False`.
2. **Calculate Costs**:
    - Call `calculate_cost` twice: once ensuring even-indexed elements are greater, and once ensuring odd-indexed elements are greater.
3. **Return the Minimum**:
    - The final result is the minimum of the two costs calculated.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of `calculate_cost` function is \( O(n) \) because we iterate through the array once and perform constant time operations for each element. Since we call this function twice, the overall time complexity remains \( O(n) \).

This solution is both efficient and straightforward, ensuring the minimum cost calculation for making the array a zigzag array.
