title:  Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank-out
permalink: /s1503
---

We are given a plank of length `n` units and some ants are moving either left or right on the plank. The `i-th` ant starts at position `pos[i]` and moves at a constant speed of 1 unit per second. Some ants will fall off the plank by moving past its endpoints (position 0 and position n), and once they fall off, they cannot come back to the plank. 

We are asked to return the moment when the last ant falls off the plank.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the positions of ants unique or can multiple ants be at the same starting position?
2. Do we need to consider the situation where ants might bump into each other?
3. What are the constraints on `n` and the size of `pos`?
   
Given the nature of the problem, we can assume:
- Positions of ants (`pos`) are unique.
- Ant collisions can be disregarded since ants swapping directions is equivalent to them passing through each other without changing the overall time taken for them to fall off.

## Strategy

Given the nature of the ants' movement and the plank:
1. Ants moving to the left from any position `k` will fall off at time `k` (since they travel `k` units to reach the left end).
2. Ants moving to the right from any position `k` will fall off at time `n-k` (since they travel `n-k` units to reach the right end).

To find the last moment when an ant falls off the plank:
- For left-moving ants, find the maximum of their starting positions.
- For right-moving ants, find the maximum of the differences between `n` and their starting positions.
- The maximum of these two acquired values gives the solution.

## Code

```python
def getLastMoment(n: int, left: List[int], right: List[int]) -> int:
    # The last moment for the ants moving to the left
    last_left = max(left) if left else 0
    # The last moment for the ants moving to the right
    last_right = max(n - pos for pos in right) if right else 0
    # Return the maximum of the last moments
    return max(last_left, last_right)
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(m + p)`, where `m` is the length of the list `left`, and `p` is the length of the list `right`. This is because we are finding the maximum value in each list, which requires a single pass through each list. Therefore, the solution is efficient given the constraints likely present in this problem.
