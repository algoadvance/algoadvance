title:  Number of Ways to Earn Points-out
permalink: /s2585
---

You are given `n` types of tasks. Each task type `i` has a fixed number of points `points[i]` associated with it and can be performed `count[i]` times. You need to find the number of distinct sequences of tasks that can be performed to earn exactly `target` points.

Return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the points and counts for each task type guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, they are guaranteed to be positive integers.
   
2. **Is there a specific range for `n` and `target`?**
   - Typically, these problems will have constraints mentioned elsewhere, but let's assume they are within reasonable bounds for solving computationally (e.g., `1 <= n <= 50` and `1 <= target <= 1000`).

3. **Can tasks be performed in any order, or is the order fixed?**
   - Tasks can be performed in any order, but we are interested in distinct combinations that add up to the target points.

### Strategy

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we need to calculate the number of ways to achieve a specific sum (in this case, the `target` points) using given sets of points that can be repeated a certain number of times (given by `count`).

We'll use a 2D DP approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve `j` points by considering the first `i` types of tasks. 

1. **Initialization**: Set `dp[0][0]` to 1 to represent achieving 0 points with 0 tasks.
2. **State Transitions**: For each task type, update the DP table based on the possible counts of that task type.
3. **Final State**: The result will be stored in `dp[n][target]`.

### Code

```python
def num_ways_to_earn_points(n, points, count, target):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize a DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (target + 1)
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(target + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Iterate over each type of task
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            for k in range(1, count[i-1] + 1):
                if j >= k * points[i-1]:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k * points[i-1]]
                    dp[i][j] %= MOD

    return dp[n][target]

# Example usage:
# n = 3, points = [1, 2, 3], count = [3, 2, 1], target = 4
# output should be 7
n = 3
points = [1, 2, 3]
count = [3, 2, 1]
target = 4
print(num_ways_to_earn_points(n, points, count, target))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \times target \times \max(count))\), where `n` is the number of task types, `target` is the target score we need to achieve, and `max(count)` is the maximum count for any task type. This is because for each task type, we iterate over all possible sums up to `target` and for each sum, we consider all possible repetitions of the current task type up to the given count.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(n \times target)\) due to the DP table used to store the intermediate results.
