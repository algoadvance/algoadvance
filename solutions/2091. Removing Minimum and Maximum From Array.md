title:  Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array-out
permalink: /s2091
---

You are given a 0-indexed array of distinct integers `nums`. There are two elements in the array that you need to consider â€“ the **minimum** and **maximum** elements.

- You need to remove both elements from the array. You can achieve this by performing the following three types of operations any number of times (possibly zero):
  1. Remove an element from the front of the array.
  2. Remove an element from the back of the array.
  3. Remove an element from either the front or the back of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to remove both the minimum and maximum elements from the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the minimum and maximum elements be the same?
   - **A**: No, the problem specifies that elements in the array are distinct.

2. **Q**: What should be returned if the array has only two elements?
   - **A**: You would need only 1 operation to remove both elements if they are the only elements in the list.

3. **Q**: Is the array size guaranteed to be at least 2?
   - **A**: Yes, constraints guarantee that `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

### Strategy

We should consider the following steps to solve the problem:

1. Identify the indices of the minimum and maximum elements.
2. Calculate the number of operations required to remove both elements in the following scenarios:
   - Remove from the front up to the element which is farther back, considering the minimum index and maximum index.
   - Remove from the back up to the element which is farther front, considering the minimum index and maximum index.
   - Remove one from the front and one from the back.
   
3. Compare the number of operations required for each scenario and return the minimum.

### Code

```python
def minimumDeletions(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    min_idx = nums.index(min(nums))
    max_idx = nums.index(max(nums))

    # Ensure min_idx is less than or equal to max_idx for simplicity
    if min_idx > max_idx:
        min_idx, max_idx = max_idx, min_idx
    
    # Removing both from front
    remove_front = max_idx + 1
    
    # Removing both from back
    remove_back = n - min_idx

    # Removing min from front and max from back
    remove_min_front_max_back = (min_idx + 1) + (n - max_idx)

    # Removing max from front and min from back
    remove_max_front_min_back = (max_idx + 1) + (n - min_idx)

    return min(remove_front, remove_back, remove_min_front_max_back, remove_max_front_min_back)

# Example Usage
print(minimumDeletions([1, 3, 4, 2, 5])) # Output should be 3
print(minimumDeletions([10, -1])) # Output should be 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because:
- Finding the indices of the minimum and maximum elements takes O(n).
- Calculating the number of operations based on those indices involves constant time operations (O(1)).

Hence, the overall complexity is O(n).
