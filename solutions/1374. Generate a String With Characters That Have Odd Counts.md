title:  Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts-out
permalink: /s1374
---
Given an integer `n`, return a string with `n` characters such that each character in the string occurs an odd number of times.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string because the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: "xy"
Explanation: "xy" is a valid string because the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings as well, such as "ag" and "ur".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 7
Output: "holasss"
```

### Clarifying Questions:
Before proceeding, let's clarify the following:
1. Is the output guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters only?
2. Should the function handle edge cases like `n = 1`?
3. Is there a restriction on the number of distinct characters we can use in the output string?

### Code:
Let's assume the answers to the clarifying questions are: 
1. Yes.
2. Yes.
3. No limitation on the number of distinct characters as long as each occurs an odd number of times.

### Strategy:
1. If `n` is odd, we can return a string consisting of `n` occurrences of a single character (e.g., `"a"*n`).
2. If `n` is even, we can return a string consisting of one character `n-1` times and another character `1` time (e.g., `"a"*(n-1)+"b"`). This ensures both characters have odd occurrences.

### Time Complexity:
The solution involves constructing a string of length `n`, hence the time complexity is `O(n)`.

```python
def generateTheString(n: int) -> str:
    if n % 2 == 1:  # odd
        return "a" * n
    else:  # even
        return "a" * (n - 1) + "b"

# Test cases
print(generateTheString(4))  # Output: "aaab"
print(generateTheString(2))  # Output: "ab"
print(generateTheString(7))  # Output: "aaaaaaa"
print(generateTheString(1))  # Output: "a"
print(generateTheString(5))  # Output: "aaaaa"
```

This code should correctly generate a string where all characters have odd counts, satisfying the problem's constraints.
