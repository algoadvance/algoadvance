title:  Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks-out
permalink: /s1986
---

You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i]` is the time required to complete the `i-th` task. You are also given an integer `sessionTime` which indicates the maximum duration of a single working session. You need to determine the minimum number of working sessions needed to finish all the tasks. A working session is any non-negative integer that does not exceed `sessionTime`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it possible for the tasks array to be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one task.

2. **Can the sum of the tasks be greater than sessionTime?**
   - Yes, that's why we need to determine the minimum number of sessions required.

3. **Are task durations positive integers?**
   - Yes, task durations are positive integers.

4. **Is there any specific requirement on how tasks are divided among sessions?**
   - The only requirement is that the sum of tasks in each session should not exceed `sessionTime`.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the tasks in descending order to try and fit larger tasks in available session spaces more efficiently.
2. **Backtracking with Memoization**: Use backtracking to try every combination of tasks within sessions, memoizing results to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Subset Sum Problem**: The challenge closely resembles the subset sum problem where sessions represent subsets whose sums should not exceed `sessionTime`.

### Time Complexity

The problem potentially has an exponential number of subsets to evaluate (2^n where n is the number of tasks). By implementing memoization and pruning through sorting, we may reduce the actual computations but in the worst case, it remains exponential.

### Code

Here is a Python solution using backtracking and memoization:

```python
def minSessions(tasks, sessionTime):
    tasks.sort(reverse=True)
    n = len(tasks)
    
    # Memoization dictionary
    memo = {}
    
    def dfs(mask, remaining):
        if mask == (1 << n) - 1:
            return 0
        
        if (mask, remaining) in memo:
            return memo[(mask, remaining)]
        
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            if not mask & (1 << i):
                if remaining >= tasks[i]:
                    res = min(res, dfs(mask | (1 << i), remaining - tasks[i]))
                else:
                    res = min(res, 1 + dfs(mask | (1 << i), sessionTime - tasks[i]))
        
        memo[(mask, remaining)] = res
        return res
    
    return 1 + dfs(0, sessionTime)

# Example usage:
tasks = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sessionTime = 6
print(minSessions(tasks, sessionTime))
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting Tasks**: Begin by sorting the tasks in descending order to fit the largest tasks first.
2. **Bitmask Representation**: Use a bitmask to represent the set of tasks that have been scheduled, where each bit corresponds to a task.
3. **Memoization**: Employ a dictionary to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
4. **Recursive DFS with Pruning**: Use a depth-first search approach where we try to fit each task into the current session if possible; otherwise, we start a new session.

The solution starts by attempting to fit the largest tasks first and utilizes memoization to keep track of the minimum sessions required for subproblems, greatly improving efficiency compared to a naive approach.
