title:  Minimum Cost to Convert String I-out
permalink: /s2976
---

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, and an integer `c`. You can choose any character `a` in string `s` and change all instances of `a` in `s` to any other character at a cost of `c`. You'll then adjust `s` this way until it equals `t`. You need to find the minimum cost required to convert `s` to `t`.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `s.length == t.length`
- `0 <= c <= 10^4`
- `s` and `t` contain lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the cost `c` vary for different character changes?
   - No, `c` is the uniform cost for any character change.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the characters in `s` and `t`?
   - Both strings contain only lowercase English letters.

3. Should the case with `s` already equal to `t` be handled?
   - Yes, in such cases, the minimum cost should be zero.

## Strategy:

1. **Identify positions where characters in `s` do not match characters in `t`.** 
2. **Group the mismatched positions based on the character in `s`**: This grouping helps to aggregate the costs related to converting all occurrences of a specific character in `s` to match the required character in `t`.
3. **Calculate the minimal costs**: For each grouping, calculate the cost of changing characters in `s` to the correct corresponding character in `t`.

Here is how we can implement this strategy:

## Code:

```python
def minCostToConvertString(s: str, t: str, c: int) -> int:
    if s == t:
        return 0
    
    cost = 0
    n = len(s)
    mismatches = {}
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] != t[i]:
            if s[i] not in mismatches:
                mismatches[s[i]] = []
            mismatches[s[i]].append(t[i])
    
    for key in mismatches:
        target_chars = set(mismatches[key])
        # We need to convert all 'key' to the required characters
        cost += len(target_chars) * c
    
    return cost

# Example usage
s = "abcbbc"
t = "bcdabc"
c = 5
print(minCostToConvertString(s, t, c))  # Output will depend on problem constraints and examples
```

### Strategy:
1. **Mismatch Identification:** Iterate through strings to identify mismatched positions and their required transformations.
2. **Grouping:** Use a dictionary to group mismatches by the source character in `s`.
3. **Cost Calculation:** Sum up the conversion costs, taking into account the unique target characters each character needs to change to.

### Time Complexity:
- **Mismatch Identification:** \(O(n)\) where `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Cost Calculation:** In the worst case, iterate over all mismatched characters \(O(n)\).
The overall complexity is linear, \(O(n)\). Given the constraints, this approach should perform efficiently.

End of the code. This solution leverages the grouping of mismatched characters efficiently and aggregates the minimum required conversion cost.
