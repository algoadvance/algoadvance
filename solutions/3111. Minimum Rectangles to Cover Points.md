title:  Minimum Rectangles to Cover Points-out
permalink: /s3111
---

You are given an array of integer points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the 2D plane. You need to find the minimum number of rectangles required to cover all the points.

The problem requires us to cover all the given points using the smallest number of non-overlapping rectangles.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a rectangle cover multiple points?**
   Yes, one rectangle can cover multiple points as long as all those points lie inside or on the boundary of the rectangle.

2. **Can some points overlap?**
   Yes, the input array of points can have duplicate points.

3. **Are the points with integer coordinates only?**
   Yes, the points are all given as integer coordinates [xi, yi].

4. **Are there any limits on the number of points or the values of xi and yi?**
   The constraints will generally be defined by typical problem constraints on Leetcode, such as 1 <= points.length <= 10^4 and ranges for xi and yi.

# Strategy

To solve this problem, we need an algorithm to create the fewest possible rectangles while covering all the points. Here are potential steps and strategies:

1. **Sorting**: We might sort the points to simplify the grouping process.
2. **Greedy Grouping**: We can try grouping points that are close to each other into a rectangle.
3. **Use of Sweep Line or Divide & Conquer**: These classical techniques for planar problems might help partition the points efficiently.

A simplified approach to try initially:
- Consider each point and try to form a rectangle with the next points that have the minimal maximum y-value difference.
- Use a greedy approach to find the largest possible rectangles iteratively.

# Code

```python
def minRectangles(points):
    # 1. Sort points by x-coordinate initially (Then we could potentially process them in 'columns')
    points.sort()
    
    used = [False] * len(points)
    # Function to find the points in the next available rectangle
    def form_rectangle(ind):
        x_min, y_min = points[ind]
        x_max, y_max = x_min, y_min
        used[ind] = True
        # Extend the rectangle to include maximum available points
        for j in range(len(points)):
            if not used[j] and x_min <= points[j][0] <= x_max and y_min <= points[j][1] <= y_max:
                used[j] = True
                x_max = max(x_max, points[j][0])
                y_max = max(y_max, points[j][1])
                
        for j in range(len(points)):
            if not used[j] and points[j][0] <= x_max and points[j][1] <= y_max:
                used[j] = True
    
    # Main loop
    rectangle_count = 0
    for i in range(len(points)):
        if not used[i]:
            form_rectangle(i)
            rectangle_count += 1
    
    return rectangle_count

# Example usage:
points = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 5]]
print(minRectangles(points))  # This will print the minimum number of rectangles needed
```

# Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the points**: O(n log n)
2. **Processing each point**: O(n^2) in the worst case, as each point might be checked against every other point.

Thus, the algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, and sorting adds an additional O(n log n). Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

This is a high-level sketch and may need to be adjusted based on specific test cases and constraints provided. More efficient solutions might involve complex geometric algorithms.
