title:  Masking Personal Information-out
permalink: /s831
---
Leetcode's problem 831, "Masking Personal Information," involves creating a function to mask personal information. The masked information can be either an email address or a phone number, depending on the format of the provided string.

The rules are:
1. Email addresses:
   - Lowercase all the names.
   - Mask all characters of the first name except the first and last.
   - Maintain the domain name as is.
   
   Example: "LeetCode@leetcode.com" -> "l*****e@leetcode.com"

2. Phone numbers:
   - Remove all non-digit characters and mask all digits except the last four.
   - Add a country code if applicable, which can be inferred from the length of the digits.
   - Use the format `"***-***-XXXX"` where 'XXXX' are the last four digits.
   - If there are more digits, prepend the country code in the format `"+C-***-***-XXXX"` where C is the number of digits the country code has.
   
   Example: "1(234)567-890" -> "***-***-7890"
           "+86 (10)12345678" -> "+**-***-***-5678"

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Email Characters**: Does the email domain need to be case preserved? 
   - No, the entire email should be lowercased.

2. **Phone Number Optional Characters**: Are we allowed to have spaces or other optional characters in the resultant phone number?
   - No, the resultant phone number format should strictly follow the standard, only containing "-" as the delimiter.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Type of Data**:
   - Check if the input contains an "@" symbol to determine if it is an email.

2. **Email Masking**:
   - Convert everything to lowercase.
   - Split the email into the local part and the domain.
   - Mask the local part by keeping the first and last characters visible and replacing other middle characters with "*****".
   
3. **Phone Number Masking**:
   - Extract all digits from the input string.
   - Mask all digits except the last four.
   - Determine the country code based on the number of digits.
   - Format it accordingly, with or without the country code.

## Code

```python
def maskPII(s: str) -> str:
    if '@' in s:
        # Email case
        name, domain = s.lower().split('@')
        return name[0] + "*****" + name[-1] + "@" + domain
    else:
        # Phone number case
        digits = [char for char in s if char.isdigit()]
        num_digits = len(digits)
        local = "***-***-" + ''.join(digits[-4:])
        
        if num_digits == 10:
            return local
        else:
            country_code = "+" + "*" * (num_digits - 10)
            return country_code + "-" + local

## Examples
# Testing the function with examples provided:
print(maskPII("LeetCode@LeetCode.com")) # Output: "l*****e@leetcode.com"
print(maskPII("1(234)567-890"))         # Output: "***-***-7890"
print(maskPII("+86 (10)12345678"))      # Output: "+**-***-***-5678"
```

## Time Complexity
- **For Emails**: The steps involve a couple of string operations (lowercase conversion, split, and concatenation), resulting in an O(n) complexity where n is the length of the email string.
- **For Phone Numbers**: Filtering out digits and formatting is straightforward with a complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string containing the phone number.

Overall, both scenarios operate in linear time relative to the length of the input string.
