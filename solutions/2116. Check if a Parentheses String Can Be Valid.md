title:  Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid-out
permalink: /s2116
---

You are given a parentheses string `s` and a string `locked`, both of the same length `n`. The string `s` contains only the characters `'('` and `')'`. The string `locked` contains only the characters `'0'` and `'1'` where:

- `'1'` means the corresponding character in `s` cannot be changed.
- `'0'` means the corresponding character in `s` can be changed to either `'('` or `')'`.

Your task is to determine if the parentheses string `s` can be made valid by changing some of the characters marked as `'0'` in the string `locked`.

A parentheses string is considered valid if:
1. It is the empty string.
2. It can be written as `AB` (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings.
3. It can be written as `(A)`, where A is a valid string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the length of the string `s` be zero?**
   Yes, in which case `s` is trivially valid.
   
2. **Is the length of `s` and `locked` always guaranteed to be the same?**
   Yes, as per the problem statement.

3. **What should be the output format?**
   The output should be a boolean value, `True` if it is possible to make the string valid, otherwise `False`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the length of `s` is odd, return `False` since a valid parentheses string must have an even length.

2. **Balance Check**:
   - Use a balance counter to keep track of the number of excess opening parentheses.
   - Traverse the string twice, forward and backward, to account for flexibility in changing parentheses.
   
3. **Flexibility with '0' in locked**:
   - While traversing, when encountering '0' in `locked`, treat it as either `(` or `)` to keep balance in check.

### Code

```python
def canBeValid(s: str, locked: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) % 2 != 0:  # If length is odd, it's impossible
        return False
    
    # Forward check
    balance = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if locked[i] == '0' or s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:  # If at any point closing parentheses are more
            return False
    
    # Backward check
    balance = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        if locked[i] == '0' or s[i] == ')':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:  # If at any point opening parentheses are more
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage:
s = "())("  # Example string
locked = "0100"  # Example locked
print(canBeValid(s, locked))  # Expected output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves two linear passes over the string. Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

This approach ensures that we carefully track the parentheses balance while considering the flexibility of changing characters where `locked` is '0'.
