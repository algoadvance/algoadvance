title:  Count the Number of Infection Sequences-out
permalink: /s2954
---

You are given an integer `n` which represents the number of people in a room, and an integer `k` which represents the amount of time difference required for a sequence to be considered an infection sequence.

An infection sequence is defined as a sequence of time differences between the infections of people such that for every sequence of time differences, each time difference is less than or equal to `k`.

Write a function `countInfectionSequences(n: int, k: int) -> int` that returns the number of valid infection sequences modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the infections ordered or unordered?**
    - The infections are ordered sequences.
    
2. **Is there a way to interpret the problem in combinatorial terms?**
    - Yes, the problem can be seen as counting the number of sequences of `n-1` time differences (i.e., `n-1` intervals between `n` infections) such that each difference is between `1` and `k`.

3. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
    - Typical constraints would be \(1 \leq n, k \leq 1000\) but it might be higher.

## Strategy

This problem resembles a combinatorial count and can be approached by Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to infect `i` people with the `j`th time difference allowed.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid sequences to infect `i` people with `j` time difference allowed.
   - Set `dp[1][1]` to `1` since there is exactly one way to start an infection.

2. **DP Transition:** 
   - For each `i` from `2` to `n` (number of infections):
     - For each `j` from `1` to `k` (time differences allowed):
       - Sum the counts from valid previous state cells `dp[i-1][m]` where `1 <= m <= k`.

3. **End Sum:**
   - Sum up all sequences that lead to exactly `n` infections using the last row from `dp`.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - As per the problem requirement, return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity should be \(O(n \cdot k^2)\) because for each entry we iterate over `k` to sum up previous results.

### Code

```python
def countInfectionSequences(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        dp[1][j] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            for m in range(1, k + 1):
                if i - 1 >= 0:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][m]) % MOD
                    
    result = sum(dp[n][j] for j in range(1, k + 1)) % MOD
    return result

# Test
print(countInfectionSequences(3, 3))  # Example test case
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to count and sum the number of valid infection sequences. The result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
