title:  Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks-out
permalink: /s2379
---

You are given a string `blocks` of length `n` where each character is either 'W' or 'B', representing white or black blocks respectively. You are also given an integer `k`, the number of consecutive black blocks you want. The task is to determine the minimum number of recolors needed to get at least `k` consecutive black blocks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - `1 <= k <= n <= 100`
    - `blocks[i]` is either 'W' or 'B'

2. **Output**:
    - Return the minimum number of recolors needed to get `k` consecutive 'B' blocks.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
    - Use a sliding window of size `k` to traverse through the `blocks` string.
    - Count the number of white blocks ('W') within the sliding window.
    - As we slide the window from the start of the string to the end, update the count based on the new character added to the window and the character removed from it.
    - Track the minimum number of white blocks for any window position, since each white block in the window represents a recolor required to obtain `k` consecutive black blocks.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Start with the first window (the first `k` characters) and count the number of 'W' blocks.
    - Slide the window across the string, updating the count of 'W' based on the characters entering and leaving the window.

3. **Final Result**:
    - The minimum number of white blocks counted in any window during the slide represents the minimum number of recolors needed.

## Code

```python
def minimumRecolors(blocks: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the minimum recolors to a large number.
    min_recolors = float('inf')
    
    # Count the number of 'W' in the initial window of size k.
    current_recolors = blocks[:k].count('W')
    
    # Initialize min_recolors with the first window's count of 'W'
    min_recolors = min(min_recolors, current_recolors)
    
    # Slide the window across the string, updating counts.
    for i in range(1, len(blocks) - k + 1):
        # Check the character that is leaving the window
        if blocks[i - 1] == 'W':
            current_recolors -= 1
        # Check the character that is entering the window
        if blocks[i + k - 1] == 'W':
            current_recolors += 1
        # Update the minimum recolors needed
        min_recolors = min(min_recolors, current_recolors)
    
    return min_recolors
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Counting the 'W' in the first window takes `O(k)`.
- **Sliding Window**: Each update of the window and minimum recolors calculation takes constant time `O(1)`.
- **Total**: The sliding window moves through the entire length of the string (`n-k+1` positions), making the overall time complexity `O(n)`.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum recolors required to achieve at least `k` consecutive 'B' blocks.
