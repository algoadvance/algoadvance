title:  Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II-out
permalink: /s1209
---

Given a string `s`, a k-duplicate removal consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal characters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

You need to repeatedly make `k`-duplicate removals on `s` until you cannot anymore. 

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. 

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

#### Example:

1. Example 1:
   - Input: `s = "abcd", k = 2`
   - Output: `"abcd"`
   - Explanation: There are no `k`-length adjacent duplicates to remove in the string.

2. Example 2:
   - Input: `s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3`
   - Output: `"aa"`
   - Explanation: 
     - First round: Remove "eee" to get "ddbbcccbdaa"
     - Second round: Remove "bbb" to get "ddcccbdaa"
     - Third round: Remove "ccc" to get "dddaa"
     - Fourth round: Remove "ddd" to get "aa"
   
3. Example 3:
   - Input: `s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2`
   - Output: `"ps"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input string always a non-empty string?
2. Should the final string be returned if there are no `k`-duplicate removals possible?
3. Is it safe to assume that `k` is always an integer greater than 1? 

### Strategy

#### Steps:
1. Iterate through the string while using a stack to keep track of characters and their counts.
2. For each character in the string:
   - If the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack has the same character, increment the count.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character from the stack.
   - If the stack is empty, we push the character with its count (initially 1).
3. Reconstruct the final string from the characters and their counts stored in the stack.

#### Stack Structure:
- Use a stack where each element is a tuple of the form `(character, count)`.

### Code

```python
def removeDuplicates(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
            stack[-1] = (char, stack[-1][1] + 1)
            if stack[-1][1] == k:
                stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append((char, 1))
    
    result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(removeDuplicates("deeedbbcccbdaa", 3)) # Output: "aa"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`, because we are iterating through the string once and each operation on the stack (push/pop) takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case for the stack, which holds the characters and their counts.

This approach ensures that we effectively and efficiently remove adjacent duplicates in the string.
