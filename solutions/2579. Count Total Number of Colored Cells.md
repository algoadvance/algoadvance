title:  Count Total Number of Colored Cells-out
permalink: /s2579

From LeetCode:

You are given a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of operations you need to perform. Initially, you have a 1x1 grid with a single cell colored black.

In each operation, you color all the cells adjacent to one or more black cells. Note that cells that are colored during an operation will not be colored again in later operations.

Return the total number of black cells after `n` operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Edges of the grid**: Do we assume an infinite grid?
   - Yes, treat the grid as infinite for simplicity.
2. **Diagonal cells**: Are diagonal cells counted as adjacent?
   - No, only vertically and horizontally adjacent cells are considered.

### Strategy
1. **Observation**: Each operation essentially expands the size of the colored grid by a certain pattern.
   - Initially (n=1), we have a single colored cell.
   - For n=2, we color the 4 adjacent cells around the initial one, making a total of 5 cells.
   - For n=3, each of these new cells will color their adjacent cells as well, forming a ring around the previous configuration.
   
2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - For n=1: 1 cell.
   - For n=2: 5 cells (1 initial + 4 new).
   - For n=3: 13 cells (5 from previous step + 8 new).
   
   We can observe that the number of new cells added in each step forms a pattern of concentric rings:
   - n=1: \(1^2\)
   - n=2: \(2^2 - 1\) new cells
   - n=3: \(3^2 - 3\) new cells

   Each nth step looks like n^2 including the initial overlapping cells.

3. **General Formula**:
   - The total number of cells after n steps can be calculated using the sum of a quadratic sequence: \( T_n = n^2 + (n-1)^2 \)

### Code

```python
def coloredCells(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return 1 + 4 * ((n-1) * n // 2)

# Testing the function
print(coloredCells(1))  # Output: 1
print(coloredCells(2))  # Output: 5
print(coloredCells(3))  # Output: 13
print(coloredCells(4))  # Output: 25
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Condition**: For \(n=1\), we simply return 1 because only the initial cell is colored.
2. **Formula**: We calculate the number of cells using the sum of series for rings:
   - The growth pattern is in perfect squares where the formula captures the cumulative addition from each ring.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(1)\) because the solution involves a direct computation, which takes a constant amount of time irrespective of the input size \(n\).

By following this strategy, the problem becomes manageable through mathematical deduction rather than iterative computation, providing us with an optimal solution.
