title:  Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum-out
permalink: /s1413
---
Given an array of integers `nums`, you start with an initial value `startValue = 0`. On each element of the array, you can modify `startValue` using the following process:
- Change the `startValue` to `startValue + nums[i]` for each element in the array `nums` from left to right.

However, we need to ensure that `startValue` remains positive for each step.

Write a function `minStartValue(nums)` that finds the minimum initial value of `startValue` such that when it is processed through the given array, it remains positive at every step.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the integer values that can be in `nums`?**
   - The problem typically allows for standard constraints such as `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`.

2. **What is the length of `nums`?**
   - Usually, it can be between `1` and `10000`.

3. **Will `nums` contain both positive and negative integers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers including zero.

4. **Can we have an empty array?**
   - No, as per the constraints, the array will have at least one element.

### Strategy
To ensure that the `startValue` remains positive after each step, we will:
1. Initialize a `cumulative_sum` value starting from 0.
2. Traverse through each element in the array and update the `cumulative_sum`.
3. Track the minimum value of `cumulative_sum` encountered during this traversal.
4. To guarantee all values of the `cumulative_sum` are positive, `startValue` must be greater than or equal to the absolute minimum `cumulative_sum` observed plus 1.

### Code
Here is the Python code to implement this solution:

```python
def minStartValue(nums):
    cumulative_sum = 0
    min_cumulative_sum = 0

    for num in nums:
        cumulative_sum += num
        min_cumulative_sum = min(min_cumulative_sum, cumulative_sum)
    
    # The minimum startValue must be 1 - the minimum cumulative sum encountered
    return 1 - min_cumulative_sum
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize `cumulative_sum` to 0 and `min_cumulative_sum` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array `nums`. For each element:
   - Add the element to `cumulative_sum`.
   - Track the minimum value of `cumulative_sum` encountered so far.
3. The required `startValue` must be at least `1 - min_cumulative_sum` to ensure that the running total never drops below 1.

### Time Complexity
- The solution traverses the list once, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This ensures the solution is efficient even for larger input sizes.
