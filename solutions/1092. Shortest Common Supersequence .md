title:  Shortest Common Supersequence -out
permalink: /s1092
---

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

A string `s` is a subsequence of a string `t` if deleting some number of characters from `t` (possibly 0) results in the string `s`.

### Example:
```text
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
"cabac" is the shortest string that has both "abac" and "cab" as subsequences.
"abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
"cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input strings be empty?**
   - Yes, it's possible. We need to handle the cases where either `str1` or `str2` or both are empty.

2. **Are all characters lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, we can assume the input strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

3. **Do we need to check for multiple shortest common supersequences?**
   - No, we just need to return one valid solution if there are multiple.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming and backtracking. The main idea is to find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of `str1` and `str2`, and then use this LCS to construct the Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS).

### Steps:

1. **Compute the LCS of `str1` and `str2`:**
   - Use dynamic programming to build a DP table that finds the LCS.

2. **Construct the SCS using the LCS:**
   - Traverse both strings and insert characters into the result string from both strings while following the LCS.

### Code

```python
def shortestCommonSupersequence(str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Compute the LCS using dynamic programming
    m, n = len(str1), len(str2)
    dp = [["" for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if str1[i-1] == str2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + str1[i-1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], key=len)
    
    lcs = dp[m][n]
    
    # Step 2: Construct the SCS using the LCS
    i, j = 0, 0
    res = []
    
    for c in lcs:
        # Add characters from str1 and str2 to result until we reach c
        while i < len(str1) and str1[i] != c:
            res.append(str1[i])
            i += 1
        while j < len(str2) and str2[j] != c:
            res.append(str2[j])
            j += 1
        # Add the common character from LCS
        res.append(c)
        i += 1
        j += 1
    
    # Add remaining characters from str1 and str2
    res.append(str1[i:])
    res.append(str2[j:])
    
    return "".join(res)

# Example usage
str1 = "abac"
str2 = "cab"
print(shortestCommonSupersequence(str1, str2))  # Output: "cabac"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding LCS:** O(m * n) where `m` is the length of `str1` and `n` is the length of `str2`.
- **Constructing SCS:** O(m + n), as we traverse the strings once more to construct the final sequence.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)**.
