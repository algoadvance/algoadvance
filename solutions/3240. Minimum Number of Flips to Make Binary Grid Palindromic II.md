title:  Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II-out
permalink: /s3240
---

Given an `m x n` binary grid where each value is either `0` or `1`, you need to find the minimum number of flips required to make the grid palindromic. Flipping a cell changes the value from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`. A grid is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward in both rows and columns. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the grid dimensions always non-zero?**
   - Yes, the grid will always have dimensions `m` and `n` where both are greater than 0.

2. **Can the grid have both even and odd dimensions?**
   - Yes, either dimension can be even or odd.

3. **What does "reads the same forward and backward" mean for the grid in this context?**
   - A palindromic grid `G` should satisfy `G[i][j] == G[m-1-i][n-1-j]` for all valid `i` and `j`.

4. **Are there edge cases such as very small or very large grids that need special handling?**
   - The physical constraints of doing for both very small (1x1) and large grids need consideration. We assume we have constraints manageable by typical competitive programming standards.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Symmetry**:
   - For a grid to be palindromic, every cell at `(i, j)` must match the cell at `(m-1-i, n-1-j)`. 

2. **Pairing Cells**:
   - We examine pairs of corresponding cells that should be equal in a palindromic configuration.

3. **Counting Mismatches**:
   - For each mismatch at `(i, j)` and its counterpart `(m-1-i, n-1-j)`, determine the minimum flips required.

4. **Iterating through half the grid**:
   - We only need to iterate through half of the grid, as checking each side effectively checks the other.

5. **Flipping Count**:
   - For each pair, if they are not equal, flipping one of them needs to be considered.

### Code Implementation

```python
def min_flips_to_palindromic(grid):
    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0])
    flips = 0

    for i in range((m + 1) // 2):
        for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
            # Coordinates for the symmetric cells
            cells = [
                (i, j),
                (m - 1 - i, j),
                (i, n - 1 - j),
                (m - 1 - i, n - 1 - j)
            ]

            # Collect the values of the symmetric cells
            values = [grid[x][y] for x, y in cells]

            # Count the number of 1s and 0s in these cells
            count_0 = values.count(0)
            count_1 = values.count(1)

            # Minimum flips needed to make this set of cells identical
            flips += min(count_0, count_1)
    
    return flips

# Example usage
grid = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1]
]

print(min_flips_to_palindromic(grid))  # Output should be the minimum flips
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, because we iterate through each cell or set of cells once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we are only using a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

By following this approach, we can efficiently determine the minimum number of flips required to make the binary grid palindromic.
