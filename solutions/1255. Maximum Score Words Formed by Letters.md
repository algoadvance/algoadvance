title:  Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters-out
permalink: /s1255
---
You are given a list of words, a list containing each letter's score, and a list of available letters. Each letter's score is represented by an integer where the index corresponds to the letter (i.e., score[0] is the score for 'a', score[1] is the score for 'b', etc.). 

You need to form words using the given letters to achieve the maximum total score. Each letter can only be used once in forming each word. Return the maximum score you can achieve.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the same letter be used in forming multiple different words?**
   - Yes, but once a letter is used for one particular word, it can't be reused for another word directly if it's from the same pool of available letters.
2. **Can words be partially formed?**
   - No, words should be formed completely using the available letters.

## Strategy
1. **Convert Words to Scores:** First, calculate the score for each word using the given scores array.
2. **Use Backtracking:** Use a backtracking approach to try all possible combinations of words. Maintain a dictionary to keep track of available letters and update it as we form words.
3. **Prune Unusable Words:** Skip words if they cannot be formed with the remaining available letters to reduce computation.
4. **Maximize the Score:** Keep track of the maximum score found during the backtracking process.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(2^N)\) where \(N\) is the number of words. Each word can either be included or excluded, leading to \(2^N\) combinations.
- Calculating word scores and checking available letters is \(O(L)\) where \(L\) is the length of the word.

Given the exponential nature of the problem, this is a standard approach for combinatorial optimization problems.

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def maxScoreWords(words, letters, score):
    def get_word_score(word):
        return sum(score[ord(char) - ord('a')] for char in word)
    
    def can_form_word(word, letter_count):
        word_count = Counter(word)
        for char in word_count:
            if word_count[char] > letter_count[char]:
                return False
        return True

    def backtrack(index, letter_count):
        if index == len(words):
            return 0
        
        # Option 1: Skip the current word
        max_score = backtrack(index + 1, letter_count)
        
        # Option 2: Include the current word if we can form it
        word = words[index]
        if can_form_word(word, letter_count):
            word_score = get_word_score(word)
            # Reduce the count of letters
            for char in word:
                letter_count[char] -= 1
            
            max_score = max(max_score, word_score + backtrack(index + 1, letter_count))
            
            # Backtrack: restore the count of letters
            for char in word:
                letter_count[char] += 1
        
        return max_score
    
    letter_count = Counter(letters)
    return backtrack(0, letter_count)

# Example usage
words = ["dog", "cat", "dad", "good"]
letters = ['a', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'g', 'o', 'o']
score = [1, 0, 9, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
print(maxScoreWords(words, letters, score))  # Output: 23
```

This code initializes a letter count from the given letters and recursively checks the maximum score achievable by either including or excluding each word. It ensures all words can be formed with the current available letters before trying to include them, to optimize the solution.
