title:  Decompress Run-Length Encoded List-out
permalink: /s1313
---

You are given a list `nums` where each pair of elements in the list represent `[frequency, value]` sequence. Your task is to return the decompressed version of the list where each `value` appears `frequency` times consecutively in the list.

Example:
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
- Output: `[2,4,4,4]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Size Constraints**: What is the maximum length of the input list `nums`?
   - The length of `nums` is guaranteed to be even, and it's between 2 and 100.
2. **Element Constraints**: What are the possible values for frequency and value?
   - Frequency values are between 1 and 100.
   - Value elements are between 1 and 100.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize an empty list**:
   - This will be used to store the decompressed values.
   
2. **Iterate through the `nums` list**:
   - Loop through the list in steps of 2.
   - For each pair of elements, extract the frequency and value.
   
3. **Extend the list**:
   - Use the `extend` method to add the `value` repeated `frequency` times to the resulting list.

4. **Return the decompressed list**:
   - After processing all pairs, return the resulting list.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: Every pair is processed once, and for each frequency `f`, we add `f` elements to the result. In the worst case, where the total number of elements added is proportional to the sum of frequencies, time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the sum of all frequencies in the input list.
- **Space Complexity**: The extra space used is O(n), where `n` is the length of the output list.

## Code

```python
def decompressRLElist(nums):
    decompressed_list = []
    for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
        frequency = nums[i]
        value = nums[i + 1]
        decompressed_list.extend([value] * frequency)
    return decompressed_list
```

### Example Run

Let's test the implementation with one of the provided examples:

**Example 1:**

- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Output: `[2, 4, 4, 4]`

**Explanation**:
- The first pair is `[1, 2]`: This means `2` appears `1` time.
- The second pair is `[3, 4]`: This means `4` appears `3` times.

So, the decompressed list is `[2, 4, 4, 4]`.

Using the provided implementation, this would effectively solve the given problem.
