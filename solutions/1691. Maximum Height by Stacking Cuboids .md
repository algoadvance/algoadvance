title:  Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids -out
permalink: /s1691
---

You are given a list of `n` cuboids where the dimensions of the i-th cuboid is `[width_i, length_i, height_i]` (0-indexed). You can place cuboids on top of each other. If you place cuboid `i` on top of cuboid `j`, then both the width and length of cuboid `i` must be less than or equal to the width and length of cuboid `j`, and the same should hold for height.

You can also rearrange any cuboid's dimensions by rotating it to put it in another dimension order, which means you can use any permutation of dimensions for each cuboid.

Return the maximum height of the stack of cuboids.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can cuboids be rotated?**
   - Yes, cuboids can be rotated to any of their three dimensions.
   
2. **Is there any specific order that we should consider for the stacking?**
   - No specific order given, just ensure the conditions are met for stacking (width, length, height).

3. **Are all dimensions positive?**
   - Yes, all provided dimensions are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Rotation and Sorting:**
   - For each cuboid, sort its dimensions to facilitate comparison.
   - Additionally, sort all cuboids based on the sorted dimensions to make it easier to apply a dynamic programming approach later.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use DP to keep track of the maximum stack height that can be achieved with each cuboid as the base.
   - Iterate over each pair of cuboids to determine if one can be stacked over the other according to the dimensions.
   - Keep updating the `dp` array to reflect the maximum possible height starting with each cuboid.

3. **Result Extraction:**
   - The result will be the maximum value in the DP array.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def maxHeight(cuboids):
    # Step 1: Normalize all cuboids by sorting the dimensions of each cuboid
    for c in cuboids:
        c.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Sort the cuboids based on sorted dimensions
    cuboids.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Initialize the DP array where dp[i] is the max height with cuboid i on top
    n = len(cuboids)
    dp = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = cuboids[i][2] # Initially, the height is just the height of the cuboid
    
    # Step 4: Compute the maximum height using DP
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if cuboids[i][0] >= cuboids[j][0] and \
               cuboids[i][1] >= cuboids[j][1] and \
               cuboids[i][2] >= cuboids[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cuboids[i][2])
    
    # The result will be the maximum value in dp array
    return max(dp)

# Example usage
cuboids = [[50,45,20],[95,37,53],[45,23,12]]
print(maxHeight(cuboids))  # Output should be 190 (based on the example input)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Dimensions:** Sorting each cuboid takes \(O(3 \log 3)\) which is \(O(1)\). Doing this for `n` cuboids results in \(O(n)\).
- **Sorting Cuboids:** Sorting `n` cuboids takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Dynamic Programming:** Filling the DP table involves a nested loop that results in a complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

Combining these steps, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the DP array.
