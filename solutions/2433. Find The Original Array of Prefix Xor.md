title:  Find The Original Array of Prefix Xor-out
permalink: /s2433

You are given an array `pref` of size `n`. This array represents the prefix xor of some array `arr`, which means:
- `pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]` for `0 <= i < n`.
You need to find the array `arr`, corresponding to the given `pref` array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the values in `pref`?**
   - Typically, the values are within the range of integers in Python.
2. **What is the size of the array `pref`?**
   - This can vary, but for complexity analysis, we consider the size `n`.

### Strategy
- Given the prefix xor array `pref`, the `i-th` element of `arr` can be derived from the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `pref`.
- Let's understand the relation mathematically:
  - From the definition, if `pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]`, then:
    - `arr[0] = pref[0]` because the prefix xor up to the first element is just the first element itself.
    - For `i > 0`, `arr[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i-1]` because:
      - `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i] = pref[i]`
      - `arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i-1] = pref[i-1]`
      - Therefore, `arr[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i-1]`

### Code
Here's the Python code to compute the desired `arr` from `pref`:

```python
def findArray(pref):
    n = len(pref)
    arr = [0] * n
    arr[0] = pref[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        arr[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i-1]
    
    return arr
```

### Time Complexity
The code iterates through the `pref` array of size `n` once, performing constant time operations for each element.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the resulting `arr` array.

This is efficient given that it converts the prefix xor array into the original array in linear time and space.
