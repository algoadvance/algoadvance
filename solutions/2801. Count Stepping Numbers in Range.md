title:  Count Stepping Numbers in Range-out
permalink: /s2801
---
You are given two positive integers `low` and `high` represented as strings. A **stepping number** is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1. For example, 321 is a stepping number while 421 is not.

Return the number of stepping numbers in the inclusive range [low, high].

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input strings `low` and `high` be very large numbers?
   - Yes, they can be large, hence they are given as strings.
2. Are leading zeros allowed in the representation of the numbers?
   - No, since these are positive integers, no leading zeros are expected.
3. Can we use Python's integer operations on these strings after converting them?
   - Yes, converting them to integers for comparison and arithmetic operations is allowed.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Thoughts**: Since straightforward checking of each number in the range might be computationally infeasible due to the size of the numbers, we should look at using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to generate stepping numbers within the possible digit range.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to explore all stepping numbers starting from digits 1 to 9 (0 is excluded because it doesnâ€™t contribute to positive numbers unless it's the only digit).
   - For each number, append the next possible digits that form valid stepping numbers.
   - Continue this process until we generate numbers that exceed the upper limit.
   - Count numbers that fall within the given `low` to `high` range.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure the range includes checking boundaries [low, high].
   - Handle the range where `low` might be equal to `high`.

### Time Complexity:
- The approach is efficient in generating only valid stepping numbers and is much better than the brute force approach. The most time-consuming operation is likely maintaining and checking the queue.

Here is the implementation in Python:

### Code:
```python
from collections import deque

def count_stepping_numbers(low: str, high: str) -> int:
    low = int(low)
    high = int(high)
    
    if low > high:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(1, 10):  # Include digits 1 to 9 to create stepping numbers
        queue.append(i)
    
    count = 0
    
    while queue:
        num = queue.popleft()
        
        if num > high:
            continue
        
        if low <= num <= high:
            count += 1
        
        last_digit = num % 10
        
        next_step_num_a = num * 10 + (last_digit - 1)
        next_step_num_b = num * 10 + (last_digit + 1)
        
        if last_digit > 0 and next_step_num_a <= high:
            queue.append(next_step_num_a)
        if last_digit < 9 and next_step_num_b <= high:
            queue.append(next_step_num_b)
    
    return count

# Example Usage
low = "10"
high = "10000"
print(count_stepping_numbers(low, high))  # Output should be the count of stepping numbers in the given range
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Convert `low` and `high` from strings to integers for comparison.
2. **Queue Setup**: Start BFS with digits 1 to 9.
3. **Main Loop**: Process each number, generate potential next stepping numbers and add them to the queue if within bounds.
4. **Counting**: Increment count whenever a valid stepping number within the range is found.
5. **Edge Handling**: Skip any numbers that exceed `high` immediately to optimize processing.

This approach effectively generates and counts stepping numbers in the specified range without brute-forcing through every number.
