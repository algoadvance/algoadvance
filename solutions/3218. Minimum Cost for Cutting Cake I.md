title:  Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I-out
permalink: /s3218
---

You are given a rectangular cake of size `h x w` and two arrays of integers `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where:
- `horizontalCuts[i]` is the distance from the top of the rectangular cake to the ith horizontal cut.
- `verticalCuts[i]` is the distance from the left of the rectangular cake to the ith vertical cut.

Return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at each horizontal and vertical position provided in the arrays `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of `h` and `w`?**
    - Both `h` (height of the cake) and `w` (width of the cake) will be between 2 and \(10^9\).
2. **What are the constraints on the elements in `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` arrays?**
    - Length of `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` will be between 1 and \(10^5\).
    - Each element in `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` will be between 1 and \(h-1\) or \(w-1\) respectively.
3. **Can the cuts be unordered?**
    - Yes, the cuts can be provided in any order. We need to sort them to calculate the maximum segments.

### Strategy

1. **Sort `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts`:**
    - This helps in calculating the maximum distances between consecutive cuts.
    
2. **Calculate maximum distance between adjacent horizontal cuts:**
    - Include the edges of the cake (0 and `h`) in your considerations.
    - This can be calculated using the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list, including the edges.
    
3. **Calculate maximum distance between adjacent vertical cuts:**
    - Similarly, include the edges of the cake (0 and `w`) in your considerations.
    - Find the maximum difference.

4. **Calculate the area of the largest possible piece:**
    - Multiply the maximum horizontal gap with the maximum vertical gap.
    - Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code

```python
def maxArea(h, w, horizontalCuts, verticalCuts):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    horizontalCuts.sort()
    verticalCuts.sort()
    
    # Maximum horizontal gap
    max_h_gap = max(horizontalCuts[0], h - horizontalCuts[-1])
    for i in range(1, len(horizontalCuts)):
        max_h_gap = max(max_h_gap, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i - 1])
    
    # Maximum vertical gap
    max_v_gap = max(verticalCuts[0], w - verticalCuts[-1])
    for i in range(1, len(verticalCuts)):
        max_v_gap = max(max_v_gap, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i - 1])
    
    # Calculate the maximum area
    max_area = (max_h_gap * max_v_gap) % MOD
    return max_area
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` – \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\), where \( n \) is the length of `horizontalCuts` and \( m \) is the length of `verticalCuts`.
- Calculating maximum gaps – \(O(n + m)\).
- Overall Time Complexity – \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\).

This should be efficient enough given the constraints.
