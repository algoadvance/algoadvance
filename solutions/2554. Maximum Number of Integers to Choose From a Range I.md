title:  Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I-out
permalink: /s2554
---

Given two integers `n` and `k`, consider an array of integers of length `n` where each element is `k`. Your task is to determine the maximum number of integers you can choose from the array while ensuring that the sum of the chosen integers does not exceed `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we always use all `n` elements, or can we choose any subset?
    - We can choose any subset.
  
2. Can `k` be less than `n`?
    - Yes, `k` can be less than `n`.

3. Are the elements in the array necessarily equal to `k` as described in the problem statement?
    - No, the array elements are not necessarily `k`. This was a misunderstanding. We should consider a different case: choosing integers from the range `[1, k]`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Greedy Approach**: Start by choosing the smallest integers and keep summing them up until adding the next integer would exceed `k`.

### Steps:

1. Initialize the sum as `0`.
2. Start picking integers from `1` onwards.
3. For each integer `i`, keep adding it to the sum as long as the sum does not exceed `k`.
4. Track the count of such integers.

By following the above steps, we ensure we pick the maximum number of smallest integers without exceeding the sum `k`.

## Code

```python
def max_count(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    current_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if current_sum + i <= k:
            current_sum += i
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return count
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The loop runs from `1` to `k`, so in the worst case, the time complexity is \(O(k)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using only a few extra variables.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently finding the maximum number of integers that can be chosen such that their sum does not exceed `k`.
