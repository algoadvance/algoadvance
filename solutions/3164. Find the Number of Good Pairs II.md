title:  Find the Number of Good Pairs II-out
permalink: /s3164
---

You are given a list of postive integers `nums`. A tuple `(i, j, k)` is a good tuple if the elements at these indices form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of `d`. Specifically, `nums[j] - nums[i] = d` and `nums[k] - nums[j] = d`. Find the number of good tuples in the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the difference `d` be negative?**
   - No, it's always the same absolute difference `d`.

2. **What is the size range for `nums`?**
   - The size of `nums` can be from 3 to 10^4.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums`?**
   - The values in `nums` are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Loop through all possible `i` and `j` pairs**: For each pair `(i, j)`:
    - Calculate the difference `d = nums[j] - nums[i]`.
    
2. **Find the corresponding `k`**: Check if there exists a `k` such that `nums[k] = nums[j] + d` and `k > j`. Count such tuples.

3. **Edge cases**: 
   - If `nums` has less than 3 elements, there are no possible good tuples and the result is 0.

### Code

```python
def count_good_tuples(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n < 3:
        return 0

    good_tuples_count = 0

    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            d = nums[j] - nums[i]
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if nums[k] - nums[j] == d:
                    good_tuples_count += 1

    return good_tuples_count
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: The algorithm involves three nested loops, so its time complexity is \(O(n^3)\), which may not be optimal for large values near the upper constraint of \(10^4\).

#### Optimization Solution (if possible)

Since \(O(n^3)\) can be inefficient, we could consider using a hash map to keep track of counts of differences to reduce time complexity.

### Optimized Strategy

1. Use a hash map to track how many times each possible value for the next element in the arithmetic sequence has appeared as we iterate through the array.

2. Iterate through the list while maintaining counts of previous elements that would form potential good tuples with the current element.

### Optimized Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def count_good_tuples(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n < 3:
        return 0

    count = 0
    # Dictionary to store count of how many times each diff has occurred
    prev = defaultdict(int)

    for j in range(n):
        val_j = nums[j]
        for i in range(j):
            val_i = nums[i]
            d = val_j - val_i

            # Check how many times (nums[i] - d) appears in the dictionary before i
            if (val_i - d) in prev:
                count += prev[val_i - d]

        for i in range(j):
            val_i = nums[i]
            prev[val_i] += 1

    return count
```

### Optimized Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the optimized solution is \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops, but it leverages hash map lookups which are \(O(1)\) on average.

### Final Notes

- This solution is now optimal for larger values of \(n\) while maintaining readability and correctness. If there are any additional constraints or considerations, they could further refine this approach.
