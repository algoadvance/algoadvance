**2542. Maximum Subsequence Score**

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and an integer `k`, you are tasked to obtain the maximum sum possible by choosing `k` elements from `nums1` such that the sum of these elements in `nums1` is maximized and the smallest element in the selected elements of `nums2` is also maximized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - Elements in `nums1` and `nums2` can be any integer within the boundaries of typical constraints (e.g., \([-10^5, 10^5]\)).

2. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - `n` could be very large up to \(10^5\) and `k` can be up to `n`.

3. **Can elements from `nums1` and `nums2` be negative?**
   - Yes, elements can be negative.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to carefully select elements from `nums1` and `nums2` based on the conditions provided. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Pairing Elements**:
   - Create pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2` because we need to consider the relationship between the elements from both arrays.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort these pairs based on the values of `nums2` in descending order. This allows us to maximize the smallest element of `nums2` in the selected `k` elements.

3. **Priority Queue for Maximum Sum**:
   - Use a priority queue to maintain the `k` largest elements from `nums1` while iterating. This will help to keep track of the highest possible sum while ensuring the smallest element of `nums2` remains maximized.

4. **Iterate and Compute the Maximum Score**:
   - Iterate over the sorted pairs and maintain the running sum of the largest `k` elements in `nums1` using the priority queue. Compute the potential score at each step and update the maximum score.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def maxSubsequenceScore(nums1, nums2, k):
    # Create a list of pairs
    pairs = [(nums1[i], nums2[i]) for i in range(len(nums1))]
    
    # Sort the pairs by nums2 values in descending order
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Priority queue to store the largest k elements from nums1
    max_heap = []
    current_sum = 0
    max_score = 0
    
    # Iterate over the pairs
    for num1, num2 in pairs:
        # Add num1 to the current sum and push it to the heap
        current_sum += num1
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, num1)
        
        # If the heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest element
        if len(max_heap) > k:
            current_sum -= heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        
        # If we have exactly k elements, compute the score
        if len(max_heap) == k:
            max_score = max(max_score, current_sum * num2)

    return max_score

# Example usage
nums1 = [1,3,3,2]
nums2 = [2,1,3,4]
k = 3
print(maxSubsequenceScore(nums1, nums2, k))  # Output: 12
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting the pairs based on `nums2`.
- **Heap Operations**: Each element is pushed to the heap possibly `n` times, and the heap size is at most `k`. So, heap operations are \(O(n \log k)\).

Overall, the time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(n \log n + n \log k)\). Given that \(k \leq n\), this simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).

This strategy ensures the solution is efficient and adheres to typical constraints in a coding interview scenario.
