### Problem Statement

We need to design a `Bitset` class that will efficiently manage a collection of bits. Here's the detailed functionality required:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `__init__(size: int)`: Initializes a Bitset of the given size with all bits set to 0.

2. **Operations:**
   - `fix(idx: int)`: Sets the bit at index `idx` to 1.
   - `unfix(idx: int)`: Sets the bit at index `idx` to 0.
   - `flip()`: Flips all the bits of the Bitset.
   - `all() -> bool`: Checks if all bits are set to 1.
   - `one() -> bool`: Checks if at least one bit is set to 1.
   - `count() -> int`: Counts the number of bits set to 1.
   - `toString() -> str`: Returns a string representation of the Bitset.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Bounds:** Are there constraints on the size of the Bitset?
2. **Concurrency:** Will the methods be called concurrently from different threads?
3. **Performance:** Are there any specific performance requirements?

### Code

Here's a Python implementation of the `Bitset` class:

```python
class Bitset:
    
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.bits = [0] * size
        self.flipped = False
        self.ones_count = 0

    def fix(self, idx: int):
        if not self.flipped and self.bits[idx] == 0:
            self.bits[idx] = 1
            self.ones_count += 1
        elif self.flipped and self.bits[idx] == 1:
            self.bits[idx] = 0
            self.ones_count += 1

    def unfix(self, idx: int):
        if not self.flipped and self.bits[idx] == 1:
            self.bits[idx] = 0
            self.ones_count -= 1
        elif self.flipped and self.bits[idx] == 0:
            self.bits[idx] = 1
            self.ones_count -= 1

    def flip(self):
        self.flipped = not self.flipped
        self.ones_count = self.size - self.ones_count

    def all(self) -> bool:
        return self.ones_count == self.size

    def one(self) -> bool:
        return self.ones_count > 0

    def count(self) -> int:
        return self.ones_count

    def toString(self) -> str:
        if not self.flipped:
            return ''.join(map(str, self.bits))
        else:
            return ''.join('1' if x == 0 else '0' for x in self.bits)
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Initially, all bits are set to 0, and we keep a count of bits set to 1 (`ones_count`). Also, maintain a `flipped` flag to indicate whether the entire Bitset is flipped.
  
2. **Fix and Unfix:** Depending on whether the Bitset is flipped or not, adjusting the respective bit and updating the ones count accordingly.

3. **Flip Operation:** Toggle the `flipped` state and adjust the `ones_count` by subtracting it from the total size of the Bitset.

4. **Checking Conditions:** Use the ones count to check if all bits are set or if at least one bit is set.

5. **String Representation:** Generate the string representation based on the current flipped state.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n), where n is the size of the Bitset.
- **fix, unfix, and flip:** O(1) operations.
- **all, one, count:** O(1) operations.
- **toString:** O(n), where n is the size of the Bitset (since generating the string involves iterating through the bits).

This approach ensures that the operations are efficient and scalable for large Bitsets.
