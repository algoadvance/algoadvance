title:  Find the Safest Path in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2812
---

You are given a 2D grid of size `n x n` where each cell has a value representing the danger level of that cell. Your task is to find the safest path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1). The safety of a path is determined by the maximum danger level of any cell in the path. You want to minimize this maximum danger level.

You can move up, down, left, or right from a cell but cannot move diagonally. Your task is to return the minimum possible maximum danger level for any path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are all cell values non-negative integers?
   - Yes, assume all cell values are non-negative integers.
2. Can the grid size `n x n` be non-square?
   - No, the grid is guaranteed to be a square of size `n x n`.
3. What should be returned if there's no path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner?
   - It's guaranteed there will always be a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm or a binary search combined with BFS (Breadth-First Search).

### Approach 1: Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm
1. Use a priority queue to keep track of the minimum "maximum danger level" paths.
2. Start from the cell (0, 0) and proceed to expand paths in all possible directions.
3. For each cell, update the path's maximum danger level and push the new states into the priority queue.
4. Continue this until we reach the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-1).

### Approach 2: Binary Search with BFS
1. Perform a binary search on the possible danger levels.
2. For each mid value of danger level in the binary search, perform a BFS to check if there is a path from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) such that no cell has a danger level greater than `mid`.
3. Adjust the search range based on whether such a path exists or not.

We will implement the more intuitive approach, which is the modified Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def safestPath(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
    
    # Priority queue to store the state as (max_danger_level, x, y)
    pq = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)]
    # Matrix to store the minimum maximum danger level to each cell
    max_danger = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
    max_danger[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    while pq:
        danger, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if x == n-1 and y == n-1:
            return danger
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:
                new_danger = max(danger, grid[nx][ny])
                if new_danger < max_danger[nx][ny]:
                    max_danger[nx][ny] = new_danger
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_danger, nx, ny))
                    
    # Since it's guaranteed there's a path, we should never reach here.
    return -1

# Example usage:
grid = [
  [1, 3, 1],
  [6, 5, 1],
  [4, 2, 1]
]
print(safestPath(grid))  # Output should be 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n^2 log n)** where `n` is the side length of the grid. This is because each cell is pushed and popped from the priority queue at most once, and each push/pop operation takes **O(log(n^2))** which simplifies to **O(log n**).

In summary:
- Constructing the grid and initializing data structures takes **O(n^2)**.
- Each movement (expanding states) operation takes **O(1)**.
- Each push/pop operation on the priority queue takes **O(log n)**.
