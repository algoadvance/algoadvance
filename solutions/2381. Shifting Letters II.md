title:  Shifting Letters II-out
permalink: /s2381
---

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array `shifts` where `shifts[i] = [start_i, end_i, direction_i]`. For every `i`, shift the characters in `s` from the index `start_i` to the index `end_i` (inclusive) in the direction `direction_i`. If `direction_i` = 1, shift the characters to the right, else shift the characters to the left.

Incrementing and decrementing characters is defined as:
- Shifting right means increasing the character in the alphabet.
- Shifting left means decreasing the character in the alphabet.

Wrap around if necessary, for example:
- Shifting 'z' to the right gives 'a'.
- Shifting 'a' to the left gives 'z'.

Return the final string after all such shifts to `s` are applied.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `shifts` array contain overlapping intervals?
2. What should the function return if `shifts` array is empty?
3. Is the input string `s` always non-empty?

### Code Strategy
1. Create an array `net_shifts` of zeros of the same length as `s`.
2. Populate `net_shifts` using the `shifts` array:
   - Increment position `start_i` by 1 for right shifts.
   - Decrement position `start_i` by 1 for left shifts.
   - Increment position `end_i + 1` by -1 for right shifts (to cancel the shift effect starting from position `end_i + 1`).
   - Decrement position `end_i + 1` by +1 for left shifts.
3. Compute the prefix sum over the `net_shifts` to get the actual shift values at each position.
4. Construct the final string by shifting each character in `s` according to the shift values.
5. Handle wrap-around properly using modular arithmetic.

### Code
```python
def shiftingLetters(s: str, shifts: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    net_shifts = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Process all shifts and update the net_shifts array
    for start, end, direction in shifts:
        if direction == 1:
            net_shifts[start] += 1
            if end + 1 < n:
                net_shifts[end + 1] -= 1
        else:
            net_shifts[start] -= 1
            if end + 1 < n:
                net_shifts[end + 1] += 1
    
    # Calculate the prefix sum in net_shifts to get the effective shift for each character
    for i in range(1, n):
        net_shifts[i] += net_shifts[i - 1]
    
    # Construct the final string with the net effective shifts
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        # calculate the effective shift for this character
        shift = net_shifts[i] % 26
        # shift the character accordingly
        new_char = chr(((ord(s[i]) - ord('a') + shift) % 26) + ord('a'))
        result.append(new_char)
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the number of shifts. This consists of:
  - O(m) to process all shift operations.
  - O(n) to compute the prefix sum and construct the result string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the `net_shifts` array.
