title:  Path Sum II-out
permalink: /s113
---

You are given the root of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`. Return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals `targetSum`. A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum height of the binary tree?**
   - This affects the potential depth of the recursion.
2. **What should be done if the root is `null`?**
   - An empty tree should return an empty list.
3. **What should be done if no paths meet the `targetSum`?**
   - Return an empty list.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Use DFS to traverse all paths from the root to leaves.
2. **Backtracking:** Use a list to store the current path and backtrack once a leaf is reached or a wrong path is detected.
3. **Path Sum Calculation:** Keep track of the current sum as we traverse the tree. If a leaf is reached and its path sum equals `targetSum`, append the path to the result list.

### Code

```python
from typing import List, Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pathSum(root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    def dfs(node, current_path, current_sum):
        if not node:
            return
        
        # Include the current node to the path
        current_path.append(node.val)
        current_sum += node.val
        
        # Check if it's a leaf
        if not node.left and not node.right and current_sum == targetSum:
            result.append(list(current_path))
        else:
            # Continue DFS on left and right subtrees
            dfs(node.left, current_path, current_sum)
            dfs(node.right, current_path, current_sum)
        
        # Backtrack: remove the current node from the path
        current_path.pop()
    
    result = []
    dfs(root, [], 0)
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\) due to the recursion stack and the space needed for storing the current path for each node until backtracking. In the worst case, the binary tree could be a linked list, increasing the stack depth to \(N\).

This solution ensures that we explore every path from the root to the leaf and check if the path sum equals the `targetSum`. Each potential path is considered exactly once, leading to an efficient and clear implementation.
