title:  Find the K-Sum of an Array-out
permalink: /s2386
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The K-Sum of an array is the k-th largest sum of all possible non-empty subarrays of the array. 

For example:
- If the array is [2, 4, -1] and `k` is 3, the 3-Sum will be the k-th largest sum of subarrays among {2}, {4}, {2, 4}, {4, -1}, etc.

Your task is to write a function `k_sum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int` that returns the K-Sum. The constraints are:
- The length of `nums` is between 1 and \(10^5\).
- Each element in `nums` is between -\(10^5\) and \(10^5\).
- `k` is between 1 and the total number of subarrays of the array.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Negative Numbers**: Can the array have negative numbers? (From the problem statement and examples, yes)
2. **Duplicates**: Will there be duplicates allowed in the array? (Yes, based on standard array characteristics)
3. **Single Element Arrays**: Will the array always have at least one element? (Yes, array length is between 1 and \(10^5\))

## Strategy

Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to handle large input sizes. A brute-force solution that computes all subarray sums would be infeasible because of its \(O(n^3\)) time complexity in the worst-case scenario. 

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Prefix Sums**: Calculate prefix sums for the array.
2. **Max-Heap (Priority Queue)**: Use a max-heap to keep track of the k largest sums encountered.
3. **Iterate Subarrays**: Iterate through all possible subarrays using the prefix sums and maintain the k largest sums.

The high-level idea is:
- Use a min-heap (of size k) to store the k largest subarray sums.
- For each subarray sum found, if it's larger than the smallest value in the heap, replace that smallest value.
- At the end, the min-heap will contain the k largest sums, and the kth largest will be the smallest element in this heap.

### Time Complexity:
The process involves maintaining a heap of size k while iteratively processing all subarray sums:
- **Heap Operations**: \(O(\log k)\) for each subarray sum
- **Subarray Sums Generation**: \(O(n^2)\)

Let's implement the solution with this strategy.

## Code

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from itertools import accumulate

def k_sum(nums, k):
    # Generate prefix sums
    prefix_sums = [0] + list(accumulate(nums))
    min_heap = []
    
    # helper function to add to heap keeping size <= k
    def add_to_heap(sum_val):
        if len(min_heap) < k:
            heappush(min_heap, sum_val)
        else:
            if sum_val > min_heap[0]:
                heappushpop(min_heap, sum_val)
    
    n = len(nums)
    # Iterate over all possible subarrays
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start + 1, n + 1): # end is exclusive
            subarray_sum = prefix_sums[end] - prefix_sums[start]
            add_to_heap(subarray_sum)
        
    # The smallest element in the min-heap of size k is the k-th largest sum
    return min_heap[0]

# Example usage
print(k_sum([2, 4, -1], 3))  # Should print the 3rd largest sum from all subarray sums
```

### Explanation:
- We compute the prefix sums for efficient subarray sum computation.
- We use a helper function to maintain a heap of size k with the largest sums encountered.
- For each subarray sum (computed via prefix sums), we attempt to add it to the heap.
- After processing all subarrays, the k-th largest sum is the smallest element in our min-heap of size k.

This approach is far more efficient given the problem constraints and ensures we find the k-th largest sum without generating all possible subarray sums explicitly.
