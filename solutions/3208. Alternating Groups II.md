title:  Alternating Groups II-out

Given a list of positive integers `arr`, rearrange the integers such that the arrangement alternates between even and odd numbers. The relative order among the values should be preserved, i.e., it should be a stable sort. Assume the array contains equal numbers of even and odd numbers.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** 
   - Can the array be empty?
   - Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - What should we do if there are unequal numbers of even and odd numbers?

2. **Output specifics:**
   - Can we modify the input array in place or should we return a new array?
   - Is there any specific order (starting with even or odd) to be followed?

## Assumptions based on typical problem constraints
- The array will have an equal number of even and odd numbers.
- The array will not be empty.
- We need to return a new array with the elements arranged with alternating even and odd numbers while preserving their relative order.
- We will start the array with an even number if the first element in the original array is even; otherwise, we will start with an odd number.

Letâ€™s define a strategy to solve this problem.

## Strategy

1. **Segregate numbers into even and odd lists:** 
   - Traverse through the array and append even numbers to one list and odd numbers to another list.
   
2. **Merge the lists alternately:**
   - Use two pointers to iterate through both even and odd lists, adding one element from each list alternately to the result array.

## Code

```python
def alternate_even_odd(arr):
    # Lists to hold the separated even and odd numbers
    evens = []
    odds = []
    
    # Separate the elements into evens and odds
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            evens.append(num)
        else:
            odds.append(num)
    
    # Result array to hold the alternate arrangement
    result = []
    even_index, odd_index = 0, 0
    
    # Determine whether to start with even or odd
    start_with_even = arr[0] % 2 == 0
    
    # Merge evens and odds alternately
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if (start_with_even and i % 2 == 0) or (not start_with_even and i % 2 != 0):
            result.append(evens[even_index])
            even_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(odds[odd_index])
            odd_index += 1
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because:
- We traverse through the array once to separate the even and odd numbers.
- We traverse through the even and odd lists to merge them alternately into the result array.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
arr = [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5]
print(alternate_even_odd(arr))  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5]
```
