title:  Maximum of Absolute Value Expression-out
permalink: /s1131
---
Given two arrays of integers `arr1` and `arr2` of the same length, `n`, the absolute value expression is defined as:

\[ |arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j| \]

where \( |x| \) denotes the absolute value of \( x \).

Return the maximum value of the above expression.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What are the maximum and minimum values for elements in `arr1` and `arr2`?
   - How large can `n` be?

2. **Output**: 
   - We need to return a single integer which is the maximum value of the given expression.

Typical constraints might be:
- Arrays `arr1` and `arr2` have length `n`, where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- Elements of the arrays are within the range of \([-10^6, 10^6]\).

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to break down the expression and consider different cases caused by the absolute values. The primary observation here is that absolute values introduce piecewise functions. To simplify, we consider each combination of positive/negative scenarios for the terms inside the absolute values.

There are 8 possible cases when we break down the absolute value terms, but because the absolute value of an expression and its negation are the same, we just need to consider 4 unique cases:

1. \( (arr1[i] - arr1[j]) + (arr2[i] - arr2[j]) + (i - j) \)
2. \( (arr1[i] - arr1[j]) + (arr2[i] - arr2[j]) - (i - j) \)
3. \( (arr1[i] - arr1[j]) - (arr2[i] - arr2[j]) + (i - j) \)
4. \( (arr1[i] - arr1[j]) - (arr2[i] - arr2[j]) - (i - j) \)

For each of these cases, determine the maximum difference by maintaining the maximum and minimum possible values obtained by evaluating the expression for all \(i\).

### Code
```python
def maxAbsValExpr(arr1, arr2):
    n = len(arr1)
    result = 0
    for (p, q, r) in [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, -1), (1, -1, 1), (1, -1, -1)]:
        max_val = -float('inf')
        min_val = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            value = p * arr1[i] + q * arr2[i] + r * i
            max_val = max(max_val, value)
            min_val = min(min_val, value)
        result = max(result, max_val - min_val)
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
The above algorithm primarily involves iterating through the arrays linearly while maintaining the maximum and minimum values for each of the four cases. Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input arrays, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Explanation
- We iterate through four different combinations of \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\).
- For each of these combinations, we calculate the "value" based on the current index \(i\).
- We keep track of the maximum and minimum values for each combination.
- Finally, we return the maximum difference encountered.

This method ensures that we consider all possible configurations that account for the absolute values without redundancy, making it both comprehensive and efficient.
