You are given an `n x n` grid representing a field of cherries, where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of cherries in cell `(i, j)`. Initially, you are at the top-left cell `(0, 0)`, and you want to reach the bottom-right cell `(n-1, n-1)` while collecting as many cherries as possible. After reaching the bottom-right cell, you must return to `(0, 0)` by following the same rules: you can only move right or down on the way to the bottom-right and left or up on the way back. However, after picking a cherry, the cell becomes empty (`grid[i][j]` = 0).

You need to determine the maximum number of cherries you can collect and return to `(0, 0)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - What are the possible values of `n`?
   - Can the grid contain negative values?
   - Are there any obstacles that you cannot traverse (e.g., cells that block the path)?

2. **Movement constraints:**
   - Can you explain the movement constraints in more detail? Specifically, are diagonal movements allowed?

3. **Edge cases:**
   - What should be returned if the initial or final cell contains a negative number or an obstacle?
   - How should the solution behave if the path to the bottom-right or back is blocked?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to avoid recalculating subproblems. We need to keep track of the cherry count from both the forward path (from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)`) and the backward path (from `(n-1, n-1)` to `(0, 0)`). 

Given the constraints of the problem, a 3-dimensional DP table can be used:
1. `dp(r1, c1, r2)` which represents the maximum number of cherries collected when "person one" is at `(r1, c1)` and "person two" is at `(r2, c2)` where `c2 = r1 + r2 - c1`.

### Steps:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If any indices go out of bounds, or there's an obstacle, return a minimum value.
   - If both persons reach `(n-1, n-1)`, return the value of cherries at that cell.

2. **Transitions:**
   - Compute the next state of cherries collected based on the valid movements (right-down, down-right).

3. **Memoization:**
   - Store the results of subproblems to avoid recalculations.

### Code:

```python
def cherryPickup(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    memo = {}
    
    def dp(r1, c1, r2, c2):
        if r1 >= n or c1 >= n or r2 >= n or c2 >= n or grid[r1][c1] == -1 or grid[r2][c2] == -1:
            return float('-inf')
        if (r1, c1) == (n-1, n-1) and (r2, c2) == (n-1, n-1):
            return grid[r1][c1]
        if (r1, c1, r2, c2) in memo:
            return memo[(r1, c1, r2, c2)]
        
        result = grid[r1][c1]
        if (r1, c1) != (r2, c2):
            result += grid[r2][c2]
        
        result += max(dp(r1+1, c1, r2+1, c2),
                      dp(r1, c1+1, r2, c2+1),
                      dp(r1+1, c1, r2, c2+1),
                      dp(r1, c1+1, r2+1, c2))
        
        memo[(r1, c1, r2, c2)] = result
        return result
    
    return max(0, dp(0, 0, 0, 0))

```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach can be analyzed as follows:
- Each state is defined by four variables `(r1, c1, r2, c2)`.
- There are `n^4` possible states.
- Each state takes `O(1)` time due to memoization.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^4)`.

This complexity might be high for large `n`, but it is manageable within the typical constraint limits.
