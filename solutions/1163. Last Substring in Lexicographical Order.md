title:  Last Substring in Lexicographical Order-out
permalink: /s1163
---

Given a string `s`, return the last substring in lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Length**: What is the expected length of the input string `s`?
   - The length of the input string can be up to \(10^5\).
   
2. **Character Set**: Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Return Value**: What should the function return if the input string is empty?
   - Given the constraints, we assume the string is non-empty.

### Strategy:

1. **Observation**: We need to find the lexicographically greatest substring. Given that any suffix of the string is a valid substring, we can focus on the suffixes.

2. **Suffix Comparison**: We should iterate through the string and compare suffixes starting from different positions to determine the greatest one.

3. **Optimal Approach**: Rather than comparing every possible suffix (which would be computationally expensive with \(O(n^2)\) complexity), we can use a linear scan technique:
   - Initialize an index `i` to 0 and a potential answer starting at the same position.
   - Iterate over each character, and compare the substrings starting at these positions:
     - Skip characters to advance through not lexicographically maximal options efficiently.

### Code:

Here is the linear scan-based approach implemented in Python:

```python
def lastSubstring(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    i, j, offset = 0, 1, 0
    
    while j + offset < n:
        if s[i + offset] == s[j + offset]:
            offset += 1
        else:
            if s[i + offset] < s[j + offset]:
                i = max(i + offset + 1, j)  # Skip unnecessary comparisons
            else:
                j = j + offset + 1
            
            # Reset offset
            offset = 0
            
    return s[i:]

# Test the solution
print(lastSubstring("abab")) # Expected output: "bab"
print(lastSubstring("leetcode")) # Expected output: "tcode"
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the provided solution is \(O(n)\):
- The while loop moves the pointer `j` across the string, and the offset increment helps skip over unnecessary comparisons.
- Thus, we iterate through the string in linear time.

### Explanation of Code:

- **Initialization**: Start with two positions `i` and `j`. `i` tracks the start of the current best candidate. `j` explores new candidates.
- **Comparison**: For each comparison, check character by character:
  - If characters match, increment the offset.
  - If they differ, update the start indices accordingly and reset the offset.
- **Return Result**: After all comparisons, the best starting index `i` leads to the lexicographically largest substring.

This approach avoids redundant comparisons and efficiently narrows down the lexicographically largest suffix.
