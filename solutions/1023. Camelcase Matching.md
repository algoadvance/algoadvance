Given an array of strings `queries` and a string `pattern`, return a list of boolean values `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if `pattern` matches `queries[i]`, and `false` otherwise.

A query word `queries[i]` matches `pattern` if we can insert lowercase letters into `pattern` to make it equal to `queries[i]`. Specifically, we can insert each lowercase letter anywhere in the pattern, and we should still be able to form the query word exactly.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters can the strings in `queries` and `pattern` contain?**
   - Both `queries` and `pattern` can only contain English uppercase and lowercase letters.

2. **What is the maximum length for each string in `queries` and `pattern`?**
   - The lengths are not provided, but we'll assume they fit within typical constraints for leetcode problems (usually up to 1000 characters).

3. **What is the range for the number of strings in `queries`?**
   - We will assume `queries` can contain up to 1000 strings.

4. **Are there any restrictions on case sensitivity?**
   - Yes, the problem is case-sensitive. Only lowercase can be inserted into `pattern` to match `queries`.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each query in `queries`.**
2. **For each query, check if it matches the `pattern` using two pointers:**
   - One pointer (`pi`) for the `pattern`.
   - One pointer (`qi`) for the `query[i]`.
3. **Match query characters against pattern while allowing lowercase characters in the query to be ignored.**
4. **If all characters in the pattern are used and the remaining characters in the query (if any) are lowercase, the query matches the pattern.**
5. **Create and return a list of boolean values representing whether each query matches the pattern.**

### Code

```python
def camelMatch(queries, pattern):
    def matches(query, pattern):
        pi = 0
        for char in query:
            if pi < len(pattern) and char == pattern[pi]:
                pi += 1
            elif char.isupper():
                return False
        return pi == len(pattern)
    
    return [matches(query, pattern) for query in queries]

# Example usage
queries = ["FooBar", "FooBarTest", "FootBall", "FrameBuffer", "ForceFeedBack"]
pattern = "FB"
print(camelMatch(queries, pattern))  # Output: [True, False, True, True, False]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iterating through each query:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of queries.
- **Matching each query against the pattern:**
  - Each character in the query is checked once, making this operation \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of the query.
- **Overall time complexity:** \(O(n \times m)\) where \(n\) is the number of queries and \(m\) is the average length of the queries.

### Explanation

1. The `matches` function uses two pointers to iterate through both the query and the pattern.
2. It ensures characters match as required and allows unmatched lowercase letters in the query.
3. It returns `True` if all characters in the pattern are used exactly and the remainder of the query contains no unmatched uppercase letters.
4. The outer list comprehension applies this logic to all queries and gathers the results into a list.
