title:  Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges-out
permalink: /s2580
---
Given a list of ranges, you need to determine the number of ways you can group the given ranges such that no two ranges in one group overlap. A range is represented by a list of two integers `[start, end]` which indicates an inclusive interval of numbers. Two ranges `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` are said to overlap if there exists an integer `x` such that `a <= x <= b` and `c <= x <= d`.

The problem is to count the number of ways to group the list of ranges such that no ranges in a group overlap each other.

### Example
```python
Input: ranges = [[1,3], [4,6], [5,7], [8,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The 3 groups can be:
- [[1,3]], [[4,6], [8,10]], and [[5,7]]
- [[1,3]], [[4,6]], and [[5,7], [8,10]]
- [[1,3]], [[4,6], [5,7]], and [[8,10]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the range endpoints inclusive?
    - Yes, the range endpoints are inclusive.
2. Can the ranges be provided in any order?
    - Yes, the ranges can be provided in any order.
3. Are ranges guaranteed to be valid, i.e., start <= end?
    - Yes, all given ranges are valid.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the Ranges:** First, we need to sort the ranges based on their starting point.
2. **Merge Overlapping Ranges:** Using a greedy algorithm, merge all the overlapping ranges. This will give us the non-overlapping intervals which maximize the coverage.
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Using dynamic programming, count the number of ways to partition the sorted ranges into groups where no two intervals within a group overlap.

### Merging Overlapping Ranges
1. **Initialize:** Start with the first range as the current merged range.
2. **Iterate Through the Sorted Ranges:** For each subsequent range, check if it overlaps with the current merged range.
   - If it does, merge it with the current range.
   - If it doesn't, start a new merged range.

### Dynamic Programming Solution
1. Define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to split the first `i` ranges into groups of non-overlapping ranges.
2. For each interval, try to form a new group ending at that interval and count the number of ways to form groups using the previous intervals that do not overlap with this group.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the ranges: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Dynamic programming step: \(O(n^2)\)

## Code

```python
def countWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges(ranges):
    ranges.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    n = len(ranges)
    
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # There's one way to group zero ranges
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_range = ranges[i - 1]
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]  # Start with previous value
        for j in range(i - 1, 0, -1):
            if ranges[j - 1][1] < current_range[0]:
                dp[i] += dp[j]
                break

    return dp[n]

# Example Usage
ranges = [[1, 3], [4, 6], [5, 7], [8, 10]]
print(countWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges(ranges))  # Output: 3
```

## Explanation
1. **Sort the Ranges:** The ranges are sorted based on starting points.
2. **Initialize the DP array:** The `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to group the first `i` ranges.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** For each range, we calculate the number of ways to form groups using non-overlapping ranges before it.
4. **Return the result:** The final result is in `dp[n]`.

This approach ensures we count all possible ways to group the ranges without overlaps effectively.
