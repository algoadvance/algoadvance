title:  Largest Number After Mutating Substring-out
permalink: /s1946
---

You are given a string `num`, which represents a large integer, and an integer array `change` of length 10. The integer array is a mapping where the digit `i` maps to `change[i]`.

You may choose to mutate a single substring of `num`. To mutate a substring, choose two indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) with `0 <= l <= r < len(num)` and replace each digit `num[i]` with `change[num[i]]` for `l <= i <= r`.

Return the largest possible number that can be obtained after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of `num`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What if `change[i]` is the same as `i` for some or all digits?**
   - You don’t need to mutate those specific digits, as mutating them doesn't increase the number.
2. **Can `num` contain leading zeros?**
   - The problem statement typically doesn’t mention leading zeros for the integer representation, but unless stated otherwise, we assume it doesn’t contain them.
3. **What are the constraints on the length of `num`?**
   - The constraints typically would be reasonable for performance considerations, commonly observed to be up to 10^5 or so.

## Strategy
1. **Traversing Through the String:**
   - We need to find the first position from where mutating gives a larger number.
   - Continue mutating as long as the mutated number is larger.

2. **Choosing the Substring:**
   - Start from the leftmost position where the change results in a larger value.
   - Continue to the right until the change would no longer result in a larger value.

3. **Greedy Approach:**
   - As soon as mutation ceases to increase the digit, stop the mutation process to ensure the largest possible number.

## Code
```python
def maximumNumber(num: str, change: List[int]) -> str:
    num_list = list(num)
    mutated = False 

    for i in range(len(num_list)):
        current_digit = int(num_list[i])
        new_digit = change[current_digit]

        if new_digit > current_digit:
            num_list[i] = str(new_digit)
            mutated = True
        elif new_digit < current_digit and mutated:
            break

    return ''.join(num_list)

# Example Application
num = "132"
change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]
print(maximumNumber(num, change)) # Expected output: "832"
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `num` since we traverse through the string once.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the creation of the `num_list`.

The above solution ensures the largest possible number by leveraging a simple greedy approach to mutate digits profitably based on the given mapping.
