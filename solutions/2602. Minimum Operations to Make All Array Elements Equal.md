title:  Minimum Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal-out
permalink: /s2602
---
You are given an array of integers `nums` comprising `n` elements, and you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal. In each operation, you can increment or decrement any element by `1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `nums`?
   - Is there a limit to the size of `nums`?

2. **Output:**
   - What should the function return if `nums` is already composed of equal elements?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle an empty array?

### Strategy
To make all elements of the array equal, the optimal strategy is to make all elements equal to the median of the array. The reason for choosing the median is that the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from all the elements in a sorted array.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array `nums`.
2. Find the median of the array.
3. Compute the total number of operations required to make each element equal to the median.

### Code
Here is the Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def min_operations(nums):
    # If the array is empty, return 0
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the array
    nums.sort()
    
    # Find the median
    n = len(nums)
    median = nums[n // 2] if n % 2 == 1 else (nums[(n // 2) - 1] + nums[n // 2]) // 2
    
    # Calculate the total number of operations to make all elements equal to the median
    operations = sum(abs(num - median) for num in nums)
    
    return operations

# Example usage:
print(min_operations([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 2
print(min_operations([1, 10, 2, 9]))  # Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- Finding the median and summing the absolute differences takes `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this approach is `O(n log n)`.

This solution should efficiently handle typical constraints found in interview problem settings.
