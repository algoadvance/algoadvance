title:  Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N-out
permalink: /s1016
---
Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `n`, return `true` if the binary representation of every integer in the range `[1, n]` is a substring of `s`, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of `s` and the value of `n`?**
   - This will help to determine the feasibility of different approaches.
2. **What should I return if `s` is empty?**
   - This is important for handling edge cases.
3. **Does the binary string `s` only contain '0' and '1'?**
   - To ensure data integrity and avoid handling unexpected characters.

## Example
- **Input:** `s = "0110", n = 3`
- **Output:** `true`
- **Explanation:** Binary representations of 1, 2, and 3 are "1", "10", and "11" respectively, and all are substrings in "0110".

## Strategy
1. **Generate all binary representations** of numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Check each binary representation** to see if it is a substring of `s`.
3. **Return `true` if all are substrings**, otherwise `false`.

The main task here is substring checking, which should be efficient.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution mainly depends on the length of the binary representations (which are log(n) in length) for up to `n` numbers.
- For each binary string, we check if it is a substring of `s`, which is `O(m)` where `m` is the length of `s`.
  
Overall time complexity will be approximately `O(n * m * log(n))`.

## Code

```python
def queryString(s: str, n: int) -> bool:
    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Convert number to binary string
        bin_str = bin(i)[2:]
        # Check if the binary string is a substring of s
        if bin_str not in s:
            return False
    return True
```

This code does the following:
1. Converts each integer from 1 to `n` into its binary representation.
2. Checks if each of these binary representations is a substring of `s`.
3. Returns `false` immediately if any binary representation is not found; otherwise, it returns `true` after checking all numbers.

This ensures efficient solution checking given the constraints.
