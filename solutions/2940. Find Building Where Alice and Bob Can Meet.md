title:  Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet-out
permalink: /s2940
---

Given a 2D grid of buildings where some buildings are empty (`0`) and some buildings contain either Alice (`A`) or Bob (`B`), find the building that is closest to both Alice and Bob. The building should minimize the sum of the distances from Alice and Bob. Assume that Alice and Bob can move up, down, left, and right.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - The grid can vary in size. Let's assume it is not larger than 100x100 based on typical interview constraints.

2. **Are there any obstacles in the grid?**
   - No, the grid only contains empty buildings (`0`), buildings with Alice (`A`), and buildings with Bob (`B`).

3. **Can Alice and Bob start in the same building?**
   - Yes, it's possible for Alice and Bob to start in the same or different buildings.

4. **How is the distance measured?**
   - The Manhattan distance will be used (i.e., the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\)).

5. **What should be returned in case of multiple optimal solutions?**
   - If there are multiple optimal buildings, any one of them can be returned.

### Strategy

1. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from Alice's location to calculate the shortest distance from Alice to all empty buildings.
2. Perform another BFS from Bob's location to calculate the shortest distance from Bob to all empty buildings.
3. Sum the distances from Alice and Bob to determine the building with the minimum total distance.
4. Ensure not to count buildings that Alice or Bob start in as valid meeting points if there are other buildings to consider.

### Time Complexity

- Both BFS operations take \(O(n \times m)\) where \(n\) and \(m\) are the dimensions of the grid.
- Combining the results also takes \(O(n \times m)\).
- Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\).

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(grid, start):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    distances = [[-1 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    queue = deque([start])
    distances[start[0]][start[1]] = 0
    
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        current_dist = distances[x][y]
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and distances[nx][ny] == -1:
                distances[nx][ny] = current_dist + 1
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    
    return distances

def find_building(grid):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    alice = bob = None
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                alice = (i, j)
            elif grid[i][j] == 'B':
                bob = (i, j)
    
    if not alice or not bob:
        return -1  # In case Alice or Bob is missing
    
    alice_distances = bfs(grid, alice)
    bob_distances = bfs(grid, bob)
    
    min_distance = float('inf')
    meeting_point = (-1, -1)
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0 and alice_distances[i][j] != -1 and bob_distances[i][j] != -1:
                total_distance = alice_distances[i][j] + bob_distances[i][j]
                if total_distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = total_distance
                    meeting_point = (i, j)
    
    return meeting_point

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 'A', 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 'B'],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]
print(find_building(grid))  
```

This solution sets up a breadth-first search (BFS) from Alice's and Bob's positions to find the shortest distance to all other buildings. It then identifies the building with the smallest sum of these distances.
