title:  Reverse Words in a String III-out
permalink: /s557
---
Given a string `s`, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` contains printable ASCII characters.
- `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- There is at least one word in `s`.
- All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input string contain punctuation or special characters within the words?**
   - Yes, the input can contain any printable ASCII characters.
2. **Are multiple consecutive spaces allowed?**
   - No, all the words are separated by a single space and there are no leading or trailing spaces.

### Strategy
1. Split the input string `s` into words based on spaces.
2. Reverse each word individually.
3. Join the reversed words back together with a space separator.
4. Return the resulting string.

### Code
```python
def reverseWords(s: str) -> str:
    # Split the string into words
    words = s.split()
    # Reverse each word and store the results back
    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]
    # Join the reversed words with space separator
    return ' '.join(reversed_words)

# Testing the function with the provided examples
print(reverseWords("Let's take LeetCode contest"))   # "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
print(reverseWords("God Ding"))                      # "doG gniD"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the string into words:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string since we traverse each character to split the words.
- **Reversing each word:** Each word is reversed in O(m) where `m` is the length of the word. Summed over all words, this still results in O(n).
- **Joining the words:** This operation involves traversing all characters to create the new string, which is O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This algorithm efficiently handles the provided constraints and should perform well within the given limits.
