title:  Valid Parenthesis String-out
permalink: /s678
---
Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: `'('`, `')'`, and `('*'`, write a function to check whether the string is valid. The string is considered valid if it can be converted to an empty string by applying the following rules:
1. Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
2. Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
3. Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
4. '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string `""`.

Your task is to implement the function `checkValidString(s: str) -> bool`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string `s` be empty?
   - **Yes**, an empty string is a valid input.
2. What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
   - Let's assume the input string can be up to 100 characters long.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a greedy algorithm with two counters:
- `low`: Represents the minimum number of open parentheses that must be closed.
- `high`: Represents the maximum possible number of open parentheses.

We iterate through the string, updating `low` and `high` based on the character:
1. For `'('`, increment both `low` and `high`.
2. For `')'`, decrement both `low` and `high`.
3. For `'*'`, decrement `low` (treat `'*'` as `')'` or `''`) and increment `high` (treat `'*'` as `'('`).

After processing the string:
- `low` must be zero (i.e., no unbalanced open parentheses are guaranteed required).
- `high` must not be negative during traversal.

### Code

```python
def checkValidString(s: str) -> bool:
    low = 0
    high = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '(':
            low += 1
            high += 1
        elif char == ')':
            if low > 0:
                low -= 1
            high -= 1
        elif char == '*':
            if low > 0:
                low -= 1
            high += 1
        if high < 0:
            return False
    return low == 0

# Example Usage:
print(checkValidString("()"))     # True
print(checkValidString("(*)"))    # True
print(checkValidString("(*))"))   # True
print(checkValidString("((*)"))   # True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We only pass through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using only a few variables for counting.

### Edge Cases
1. Empty string: `""` should return `True`.
2. String with mixed valid and invalid substrings: Check handling edge cases like `"())*", "(*))((*)"`.
