3129. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I-out

You need to find all possible stable binary arrays of a given length, `n`. A binary array is considered stable if it does not have two consecutive `1`s. You should return the results sorted in lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value of `n`?
   - Is `n` always a positive integer?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output be a list of strings representing the binary arrays?
   - Do we need to handle any special characters or only "0" and "1"?

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Are there any specific performance constraints or time limits?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all valid binary arrays of length `n`. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Initialization and Recursion:**
   - We will use a helper function to recursively build the valid binary arrays.
   - Initialize an empty list to store the results.

2. **Backtracking Logic:**
   - Start with an empty string and recursively add '0' or '1' while ensuring that no two '1's are consecutive.
   - If adding '1', ensure the previous character is not '1'.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If the length of the current array equals `n`, add it to the results list.

4. **Sorting:**
   - By generating the results in a consistent order, we should end up with them in lexicographical order directly.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(2^n) in the worst case since we are generating all binary arrays of length `n`. However, due to the constraint that no two `1`s can be consecutive, the actual number of arrays generated will be less.

### Code

```python
def find_stable_binary_arrays(n):
    def backtrack(current):
        # Base case: if the array's length is n, add to results
        if len(current) == n:
            result.append(current)
            return
        
        # Add '0' to the array and proceed
        backtrack(current + '0')
        
        # Add '1' only if the last character is not '1'
        if not current or current[-1] != '1':
            backtrack(current + '1')
    
    result = []
    backtrack("")
    return result

# Example usage
n = 3
print(find_stable_binary_arrays(n))
```

Here's a quick clarification for the example usage with `n = 3`:
- Output should include: ["000", "001", "010", "100", "101"]

This approach ensures that all possible valid binary arrays of length `n` are generated and returned in lexicographical order.
