title:  Backspace String Compare-out
permalink: /s844
---

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `'#'` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue to be empty.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Characters Consideration**: Are we assuming that the strings only consist of lowercase letters and the `'#'` character?
   - Yes, the strings will only consist of lowercase letters and the `'#'` character.

2. **String Length**: Is there any constraint on the length of the strings `s` and `t`?
   - The problem does not specify specific constraints, but typical LeetCode constraints apply where strings can be up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 200 characters).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the typing of the given strings considering the backspace (i.e., `'#'` character). 

Hereâ€™s the strategy we'll use:
1. We will process each string to effectively handle the backspaces, resulting in a final string that is equivalent to the text editor's state.
2. We can create a helper function `build` which constructs the final string after processing the backspaces.
3. Compare the results for both strings.

### Code

```python
def backspaceCompare(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    def build(string):
        result_stack = []
        for char in string:
            if char != '#':
                result_stack.append(char)
            elif result_stack:
                result_stack.pop()
        return ''.join(result_stack)
    
    return build(s) == build(t)

# Test Cases
print(backspaceCompare("ab#c", "ad#c"))  # Should print True
print(backspaceCompare("ab##", "c#d#"))  # Should print True
print(backspaceCompare("a#c", "b"))      # Should print False
```

### Time Complexity

- The `build` function iterates through the given string once, processing each character.
- Thus, each call to `build` is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Since we call `build` twice (once for each string), the overall time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `t`.

### Explanation

1. **Helper Function `build(string)`**:
    - Uses a stack to build the resultant string.
    - For each character in the string:
        - Append the character to the stack if it is not a backspace (`'#'`).
        - If it is a backspace and the stack is not empty, pop the last character from the stack.
    - Finally, join the stack to form the resultant processed string.

2. **Comparison**:
    - Use the helper function to process both strings `s` and `t`.
    - Compare the results of both processed strings directly. If they are equal, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

This solution effectively captures the key requirement of handling backspace characters and efficiently compares the resultant strings.
