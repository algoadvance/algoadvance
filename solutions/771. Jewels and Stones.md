You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
- Letters are case-sensitive, so `a` is considered a different type of stone from `A`.

**Example:**
```python
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the strings `jewels` and `stones` always non-empty?**
   - Yes, for the sake of this problem, you can assume they are non-empty.
   
2. **Do the strings contain only alphabetic characters?**
   - Yes, both `jewels` and `stones` contain only alphabetic characters and are case-sensitive.

3. **Can there be duplicate characters in the `jewels` string?**
   - No, the `jewels` string contains unique characters.

### Strategy:
1. **Set Conversion for Jewels:** Convert the `jewels` string into a set for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
2. **Count Matching Stones:** Iterate through each character in `stones` and count how many of these characters are present in the `jewels` set.

### Code:
```python
def numJewelsInStones(jewels: str, stones: str) -> int:
    jewels_set = set(jewels)  # Step 1: Convert 'jewels' to a set
    count = 0
    
    for stone in stones:  # Step 2: Iterate through 'stones'
        if stone in jewels_set:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Conversion to set:** O(J), where J is the length of the `jewels` string.
- **Iteration through stones:** O(S), where S is the length of the `stones` string.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(J + S), which is efficient given that set lookups are O(1) on average.

### Explanation with Example:
For the input `jewels = "aA"` and `stones = "aAAbbbb"`
- Convert `jewels` to a set: `{'a', 'A'}`
- Iterate through the `stones`: count how many times characters 'a' and 'A' appear in `stones`.
- The characters 'a' and 'A' appear 3 times in total, hence the output is 3.
