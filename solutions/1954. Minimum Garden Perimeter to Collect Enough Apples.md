title:  Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples-out
permalink: /s1954
---

You are given an integer `neededApples` representing the number of apples you need to collect. The farmer has planted apple trees in the form of an infinite 2D grid. Each tree at position `(x, y)` produces `|x| + |y|` apples.

You need to determine the minimum perimeter of a square garden centered at `(0, 0)` such that the total number of apples inside or on the boundary of the garden is at least `neededApples`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the coordinates of the grid integers only?
   **A**: Yes, the coordinates are integer values.

2. **Q**: Is the garden always a square?
   **A**: Yes, the garden is always a square centered at `(0, 0)`.

3. **Q**: How is the perimeter of the square garden calculated?
   **A**: The perimeter of a square with side length `2n` is `8n`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Structure**: Each layer `n` at coordinates `(-n, n)`, `(n, -n)` etc. can be thought of as a concentric ring. You'll need to calculate the number of apples contributed by each ring.
  
2. **Incremental Approach**: Start from a small square and keep expanding it until you collect at least `neededApples`. For each increment (`n` to `n+1`), count the apples added by the periphery of the new larger square.

### Detailed Steps:

1. Calculate the apple contribution of each layer added.
2. Accumulate apple count until the total apples inside and on the boundary of the square meet or exceed `neededApples`.
3. Track the side length, and once the condition is met, compute the perimeter.

### Implementation and Code

```python
def minimumPerimeter(neededApples: int) -> int:
    total_apples = 0
    n = 0
    
    while total_apples < neededApples:
        n += 1
        # Apples added by the new outer layer
        layer_apples = 12 * n * n
        total_apples += layer_apples
        
    # Perimeter of the square with side length 2 * n
    return 8 * n

# Example usage:
print(minimumPerimeter(1))  # Output: 8
print(minimumPerimeter(13)) # Output: 16
print(minimumPerimeter(1000000000)) # Output: ...
```

### Time Complexity

In the worst case, the time complexity for this approach is `O(sqrt(k))`, where `k` is proportional to `neededApples`. This is because with each `n`, the number of apples added grows quadratically, meaning the number of layers needed grows slowly relative to `neededApples`.

This provides a clear and concise solution to finding the minimum perimeter required for collecting the desired amount of apples by iteratively expanding the garden and checking apple count at each stage.
