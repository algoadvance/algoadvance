title:  Sum of Total Strength of Wizards-out
permalink: /s2281
---

Given an integer array `strength`, where `strength[i]` represents the strength of the ith wizard, you are required to calculate the sum of the total strength of all non-empty contiguous subarrays. The total strength of a subarray is defined as the product of the minimum value in the subarray and the sum of all elements in the subarray.

Return the sum of the total strength of all non-empty contiguous subarrays. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if the array is empty?**
   - Normally, this shouldn't happen as per problem statement, but we can assume the return value to be 0.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the size of the array and the values?**
   - Usually for such problems, the values can be quite large, so efficient algorithms are necessary.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Subarray Bounds Efficiently**: We should identify the minimum values for potential subarrays efficiently using a monotonic stack.
2. **Prefix Sums for Subarray Sums**: Use prefix sums to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.
3. **Efficient Calculation**: Use mathematical tricks and data structures to avoid the \(O(n^3)\) complexity.

We will use a monotonic stack to keep track of next and previous less elements efficiently. Combining this with prefix sums will allow us to calculate sums effectively.

## Pseudocode
1. Compute prefix sums.
2. Use two passes to find the next and previous less elements for each index.
3. Use the computed information to efficiently calculate the required sum.

## Code

Here's the Python code for the solution:

```python
def totalStrength(strength: list[int]) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(strength)
    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i + 1] = (prefix[i] + strength[i]) % MOD

    prev_less = [-1] * n
    next_less = [n] * n

    stack = []
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and strength[stack[-1]] > strength[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            prev_less[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    stack = []
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and strength[stack[-1]] >= strength[i]:
            stack.pop()
        if stack:
            next_less[i] = stack[-1]
        stack.append(i)

    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        l = prev_less[i]
        r = next_less[i]
        
        left_sum = (prefix[i] - (prefix[l + 1] if l != -1 else 0)) % MOD
        right_sum = (prefix[r] - prefix[i]) % MOD
        
        left_count = i - l
        right_count = r - i
        
        total += strength[i] * ((right_sum * left_count) - (left_sum * right_count)) % MOD
        total %= MOD

    return total

# Example usage:
# strength = [1, 3, 1, 2]
# print(totalStrength(strength))  # Expected Output: <some number>
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \(O(n)\)
2. **Finding Previous and Next Less Elements**: \(O(n)\)
3. **Final Summation Calculation**: \(O(n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This should be efficient and effective for large inputs within typical constraints.
