title:  Shortest Distance to a Character-out
permalink: /s821
---
Given a string `s` and a character `c`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character `c` in the string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be the output if the character `c` is not found in the string `s`?
   **A:** The problem guarantees that the character `c` will be present in the string `s`.
   
2. **Q:** Can the string contain uppercase and lowercase letters?
   **A:** Yes, the string can contain uppercase and lowercase letters.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   **A:** The length of the string `s` can range from 1 to 10,000.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:
1. **Pass from Left to Right:** Traverse the string from left to right, tracking the position of the last-seen character `c`. Calculate the distance from each character to this last-seen position and store it in a result array.
2. **Pass from Right to Left:** Traverse the string from right to left, again tracking the position of the last-seen character `c`. Update the result array with the minimum distance found from either of the two passes.

### Code
```python
def shortestToChar(s: str, c: str) -> [int]:
    n = len(s)
    result = [float('inf')] * n
    
    # Left to right pass
    prev_position = float('-inf')
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == c:
            prev_position = i
        result[i] = i - prev_position
    
    # Right to left pass
    prev_position = float('inf')
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == c:
            prev_position = i
        result[i] = min(result[i], prev_position - i)
    
    return result

# Example Usage
s = "loveleetcode"
c = 'e'
print(shortestToChar(s, c))
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The solution requires two passes through the string, each taking linear time. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space Complexity:** We are using an additional array of size `n` to store the result, so the space complexity is O(n).

This approach ensures we efficiently compute the shortest distance from each character in the string `s` to the given character `c`.
