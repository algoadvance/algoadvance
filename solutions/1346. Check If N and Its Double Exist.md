title:  Check If N and Its Double Exist-out
permalink: /s1346
---

Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exists two integers `N` and `M` such that `N` is twice `M` (i.e., `N = 2 * M`).

In other words, determine if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `arr[i]` is double `arr[j]`.

You need to return `True` if such elements exist, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.

2. **Q**: Can the values in the array be zero?
   - **A**: Yes, zero can be part of the array, and zero is considered a special case where `0 = 2 * 0`.

3. **Q**: What should be the return type?
   - **A**: The function should return a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

### Strategy:

1. We can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far as we iterate through the array.
2. For each element `x` in the array, we check if `x/2` or `2*x` exists in the set.
3. If either `x/2` or `2*x` is found in the set, we return `True`.
4. If none of the elements satisfy the condition, we return `False` at the end.

### Code:

```python
def checkIfExist(arr):
    seen = set()
    for x in arr:
        if x / 2 in seen or x * 2 in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(x)
    return False
```

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**: We iterate through the array once (`O(n)`) and each check and insertion in the set takes `O(1)` on average. Hence, the total time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.

### Explanation:

- We have a set called `seen` to track the elements we've come across.
- For each element `x` in the array:
  - We check if `x / 2` or `2 * x` is already in `seen`.
  - If either condition is true, we return `True`.
  - Otherwise, we add `x` to the set.
- If we finish the loop without returning `True`, it means no such pair exists, and we return `False`.

### Example:

- For the input `arr = [10, 2, 5, 3]`, the function should return `True` because `10` is twice `5`.
- For the input `arr = [7, 1, 14, 11]`, the function should return `True` because `14` is twice `7`.
- For the input `arr = [3, 1, 7, 11]`, the function should return `False` because no element is twice another in the array.
