title:  Remove Linked List Elements-out
permalink: /s203
---

Given the head of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that have `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.

#### Example:
1. Input: `head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6]`, `val = 6`
   Output: `[1,2,3,4,5]`
2. Input: `head = []`, `val = 1`
   Output: `[]`
3. Input: `head = [7,7,7,7]`, `val = 7`
   Output: `[]`

### Clarifying Questions

To solve this problem accurately, here are a few clarifications:
1. Can the linked list be empty?
   - Yes, if the linked list is empty, return an empty list.
2. Are all node values positive integers?
   - Yes, it is typically assumed unless stated otherwise.
3. Should we consider any specific constraints on time or space complexity?
   - The solution should be efficient, ideally O(n) time complexity where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeElements(head: ListNode, val: int) -> ListNode:
    # Create a dummy node that helps with edge cases such as deleting the head node
    dummy = ListNode(next=head)
    current = dummy

    # Traverse the list
    while current and current.next:
        if current.next.val == val:
            # Remove the node by pointing to the next of next node
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next
    
    # Return the new list head, which is the next of dummy node
    return dummy.next

# Example Usage
def build_linked_list(values):
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    for value in values:
        current.next = ListNode(val=value)
        current = current.next
    return dummy.next

def print_linked_list(head):
    result = []
    while head:
        result.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print(result)

# Testing the function
head = build_linked_list([1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5, 6])
print_linked_list(removeElements(head, 6))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Strategy

1. **Dummy Node**: Creating a dummy node, whose next points to the head, allows us to handle cases where the head itself might need to be removed without special conditions.
2. **Traversal**: Traverse the list with a pointer `current`. Every time a node with `current.next.val == val` is found, remove it by pointing `current.next` to `current.next.next`.
3. **Efficiency**: This ensures that every node is visited once, making our solution O(n) in time complexity.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handles cases where the list is empty, or all elements are the value to be removed, effectively returning the correct node or an empty list.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we're not using any extra space that grows with the input size; just a few pointers.

This should effectively solve the problem of removing elements from a linked list.
