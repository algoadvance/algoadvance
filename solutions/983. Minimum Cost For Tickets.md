title:  Minimum Cost For Tickets-out
permalink: /s983
---

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an array `days`. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:
- a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars,
- a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars,
- a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow you to travel for that number of days, only consistent within the cost. A 7-day pass allows you to travel for 7 consecutive days.

Return the minimum amount of money you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.

### Example:
```python
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11

Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= days.length <= 365`
- `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
- `days` is in strictly increasing order.
- `costs.length == 3`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we assume that the `days` array is always strictly increasing as stated in the constraint?
2. Are there any days outside of `days` for which we need to consider travel costs?
3. Should we handle edge cases such as when there is only one day of travel?

## Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem.

1. **Define DP Array**: Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover all traveling days up to day `i`.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize `dp` to a large number (infinite cost), except for `dp[0]` which should be `0` because there is no cost for day `0`.
3. **Filling DP Array**:
  - Use nested loops to fill the `dp` array. For each day in `days`, check the cost of adding a 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day pass from the last checkable point.
4. **Result Extraction**: The value `dp[365]` will contain the minimum cost to cover all traveling `days`.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def mincostTickets(days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
    max_day = 365
    day_set = set(days)
    dp = [0] * (max_day + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, max_day + 1):
        if i not in day_set: 
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        else:
            dp[i] = min(dp[max(0, i - 1)] + costs[0],
                        dp[max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1],
                        dp[max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2])
    return dp[max_day]

# Example Usage
days = [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 20]
costs = [2, 7, 15]
print(mincostTickets(days, costs))  # Output: 11

days = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 30, 31]
costs = [2, 7, 15]
print(mincostTickets(days, costs))  # Output: 17
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N + D)`, where `N` is the number of days in the given `days` list and `D` is 365, the number of total days in a year.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(D)` because we're using a `dp` array of size `D + 1`.

In summary, this solution ensures efficient calculation of minimum travel costs by leveraging dynamic programming effectively.
