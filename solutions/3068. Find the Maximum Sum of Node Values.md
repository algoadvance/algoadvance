title:  Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values-out
permalink: /s3068
---

You are given a binary tree where each node has a value. The task is to find the maximum sum of values in nodes of any level in the binary tree. The level of a node is defined as the number of edges in the path from the root node to the node.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the range of values the nodes can have?**
   - Node values can range from negative to positive integers.

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - Yes, in case of an empty tree, the sum should be 0.

3. **What is the maximum height of the tree we need to handle?**
   - Assume the maximum height can be large but we are not given a specific limit, so handle it efficiently.

4. **Are we allowed to use extra space to store level sums?**
   - Yes, we can use additional space for storing the level-wise sums before computing the max.

### Strategy:

1. **Level Order Traversal**: We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level.
2. **Store Level Sums**: Maintain a list or dictionary to store sums of each level.
3. **Track Maximum**: While traversing, keep updating the maximum sum encountered for any level.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle empty tree scenario by returning 0.

### Code:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def maxLevelSum(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    level_sums = defaultdict(int)
    queue = deque([(root, 0)])  # (node, level)
    
    while queue:
        node, level = queue.popleft()
        level_sums[level] += node.val
        
        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, level + 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, level + 1))
    
    for lvl, sum_val in level_sums.items():
        if sum_val > max_sum:
            max_sum = sum_val
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
# Construct a binary tree
#        1
#       / \
#      2   3
#     /|   |\
#    4 5   6 7

# root = TreeNode(1)
# root.left = TreeNode(2)
# root.right = TreeNode(3)
# root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
# root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
# root.right.left = TreeNode(6)
# root.right.right = TreeNode(7)

# print(maxLevelSum(root))  # Output should be the maximum sum of node values at some level
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing the queue and the level sums. In the worst case, the queue might store all nodes of the last level, which is approximately N/2 nodes. The dictionary for level sums will have at most height levels, which is O(h) but typically less than O(N).

This approach is efficient and should handle the provided constraints effectively.
