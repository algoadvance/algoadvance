title:  Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array-out
permalink: /s1671
---
Given an integer array `nums`, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make `nums` a mountain array.

An array `nums` is a mountain array if:

- `nums.length >= 3`
- There exists some index `i` (0-indexed) with `0 < i < nums.length - 1` such that:
  - `nums[0] < nums[1] < ... < nums[i]`
  - `nums[i] > nums[i + 1] > ... > nums[nums.length - 1]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?
   - No, all elements in `nums` are unique.

2. What is the range of the length of `nums` and the values of its elements?
   - The length of `nums` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`
   - The values of `nums` are in the range `[0, 10^4]`

### Strategy

To form a mountain array, we need:
1. An increasing subsequence followed by a decreasing subsequence.
2. The peak element should be higher than the elements just before and just after it.

To achieve this, we can employ a dynamic programming approach:
1. Compute the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at each index.
2. Compute the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) starting at each index.
3. To form a mountain array at index `i`, the length of elements forming the mountain is `LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1` (since the peak element is counted twice).
4. The minimum number of removals will then be the total length of the array minus the maximum mountain array length found.

### Code

```python
def minimumMountainRemovals(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n < 3:
        return 0  # Since we cannot form a mountain array

    # Step 1: Calculate the LIS ending at each index
    LIS = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(0, i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j] and LIS[i] < LIS[j] + 1:
                LIS[i] = LIS[j] + 1

    # Step 2: Calculate the LDS starting at each index
    LDS = [1] * n
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):
            if nums[i] > nums[j] and LDS[i] < LDS[j] + 1:
                LDS[i] = LDS[j] + 1

    # Step 3: Find the maximum length of the mountain array
    max_mountain_length = 0
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if LIS[i] > 1 and LDS[i] > 1:
            max_mountain_length = max(max_mountain_length, LIS[i] + LDS[i] - 1)

    # Step 4: Calculate the minimum number of removals
    return n - max_mountain_length

# Example usage
nums = [2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]
print(minimumMountainRemovals(nums))  # Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity
- Calculating LIS and LDS individually takes O(n^2) time because we are using a nested loop.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n^2) because we perform O(n^2) operations to compute LIS and LDS arrays.
- Space complexity is O(n) because we are using additional arrays to store LIS and LDS values.
