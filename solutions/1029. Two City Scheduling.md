A company is planning to interview 2n people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCost_i, bCost_i]`, the cost of flying the i-th person to city A is `aCost_i`, and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is `bCost_i`.

Return the minimum cost to fly exactly n people to city A and n people to city B.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does `costs` array represent?**
   - The `costs` array is a list of lists where the `i`-th sublist contains two elements: `[aCost_i, bCost_i]`.
   - `aCost_i` is the cost of flying the i-th person to city A.
   - `bCost_i` is the cost of flying the i-th person to city B.

2. **What is the size of the `costs` array?**
   - The length of the `costs` array is always `2n`, where `n` is the number of people to be flown to each city.

3. **What should be the output?**
   - The output should be the minimum total cost required to fly exactly `n` people to city A and `n` people to city B.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Differences:**
   - Calculate the difference in cost for each person if they were to fly to city A instead of city B (i.e., cost[i][0] - cost[i][1]).

2. **Sort by Differences:**
   - Sort the list of people based on the calculated differences. This helps in prioritizing the assignment in such a way that minimizes the overall cost.

3. **Assignment:**
   - Assign the first `n` people in the sorted list to city A (they have the smallest differences, so it's cheaper to fly them to city A).
   - Assign the remaining `n` people to city B.

4. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - Sum up the corresponding costs for the assignments to get the minimum total cost.

### Code

```python
def twoCitySchedCost(costs):
    # Calculate the differences and sort based on the differences
    costs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0] - x[1])
    
    total_cost = 0
    n = len(costs) // 2
    
    # Assign the first n people to city A
    for i in range(n):
        total_cost += costs[i][0]
    
    # Assign the last n people to city B
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        total_cost += costs[i][1]
    
    return total_cost
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step:** Sorting the costs list takes \(O(2n \log 2n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Summation Step:** Summing up the costs takes \(O(2n)\), which is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution efficiently ensures that exactly `n` people go to each city while minimizing the overall cost.
