title:  Lemonade Change-out
permalink: /s860
---
Suppose you are a cashier at a lemonade stand, and each lemonade costs $5. Customers queue up to buy from you, and they may pay with a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You need to provide them with the correct change using the bills you have so far. Initially, you start with no change.

Write a function `lemonadeChange` that takes in a list of integers representing the bills customers use to pay for their lemonade and returns `True` if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or `False` otherwise.

### Example
```python
Input: [5, 5, 5, 10, 20]
Output: True

Input: [5, 5, 10, 10, 20]
Output: False
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can bills be of any other value than $5, $10, and $20?**
    - No, only $5, $10, and $20 bills will be used.
2. **Will the list of bills always be non-empty?**
    - Yes, the list will always contain at least one bill.
3. **Is the order of bills in the list guaranteed to be the order of transactions?**
    - Yes, the order in the list represents the chronological order of transactions.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize Counters**: Use counters to keep track of the number of $5 and $10 bills you have.
2. **Iterate Through the Bills**:
    - When you receive a $5 bill, increment the count of $5 bills.
    - When you receive a $10 bill, you need to give back one $5 bill as change (if you have it); otherwise, return `False`.
    - When you receive a $20 bill, prefer giving back one $10 bill and one $5 bill (if you have both); otherwise, give back three $5 bills. If neither option is possible, return `False`.
3. **Return True if All Transactions Succeed**: If you can process all the bills without running out of change, return `True`.

### Code
```python
def lemonadeChange(bills):
    five_dollar_count = 0
    ten_dollar_count = 0
    
    for bill in bills:
        if bill == 5:
            five_dollar_count += 1
        elif bill == 10:
            if five_dollar_count > 0:
                five_dollar_count -= 1
                ten_dollar_count += 1
            else:
                return False
        elif bill == 20:
            if ten_dollar_count > 0 and five_dollar_count > 0:
                ten_dollar_count -= 1
                five_dollar_count -= 1
            elif five_dollar_count >= 3:
                five_dollar_count -= 3
            else:
                return False
    return True

# Example usage
print(lemonadeChange([5, 5, 5, 10, 20]))  # Output: True
print(lemonadeChange([5, 5, 10, 10, 20]))  # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bills. Each bill is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're only using a fixed amount of additional space to store the count of $5 and $10 bills.

This approach ensures that every transaction is considered in sequence and the appropriate change is given, if possible, thus ensuring all customers are satisfied.
