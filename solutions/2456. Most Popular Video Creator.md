### Problem Statement
You are given a string array `creators`, an integer array `ids`, and an integer array `views`. The `creators[i]`, `ids[i]`, and `views[i]` describe the i-th video on a platform, where:
- `creators[i]` is the name of the creator who made the i-th video,
- `ids[i]` is the ID of the i-th video, and
- `views[i]` is the number of views the i-th video has.

Your task is to find the creator with the most total views across all their videos. If there is a tie (i.e., multiple creators have the same highest total views), return all of them. For each creator with the highest total views, return the creator's name along with the ID of their most-viewed video. If there is a tie for the most-viewed video of a creator, return the lexicographically smallest ID.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should we assume that the length of the three arrays (`creators`, `ids`, and `views`) is always the same?
2. If there are no creators provided, what should be the output?
3. Should all input arrays always be valid (i.e., no null values, all proper lengths)?

### Approach and Strategy
1. **Data Structures Used**:
    - A dictionary to track the creators and their total views.
    - Another dictionary to track the most-viewed video for each creator.
    
2. **Steps**:
    - Traverse through the `creators`, `ids`, and `views` arrays simultaneously.
    - Update the total views for each creator.
    - Track the most viewed video for each creator, and in case of a tie (multiple videos with the same number of views for the same creator), keep the lexicographically smallest ID.
    - Determine the maximum total views.
    - Collect all creators who have this maximum total views and their corresponding most-viewed video IDs.

### Time Complexity
The solution involves a single traversal of the input arrays, making it O(n) in complexity, where n is the number of videos.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def mostPopularCreator(creators, ids, views):
    total_views = defaultdict(int)  # to accumulate total views per creator
    top_videos = {}  # to track the most viewed video per creator
    
    for creator, vid_id, view in zip(creators, ids, views):
        total_views[creator] += view
        if creator not in top_videos:
            top_videos[creator] = (view, vid_id)
        else:
            # Update the most viewed video
            prev_view, prev_id = top_videos[creator]
            if view > prev_view or (view == prev_view and vid_id < prev_id):
                top_videos[creator] = (view, vid_id)
                
    # Determine the maximum total views
    max_views = max(total_views.values())
    
    result = []
    for creator in total_views:
        if total_views[creator] == max_views:
            most_viewed_video_id = top_videos[creator][1]
            result.append([creator, most_viewed_video_id])
    
    return result

# Example Usage
creators = ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Alice", "Bob"]
ids = ["v1", "v2", "v3", "v4", "v5"]
views = [100, 200, 150, 100, 200]

print(mostPopularCreator(creators, ids, views))
```

This should provide a list of the most popular creators with their most-viewed video IDs.
