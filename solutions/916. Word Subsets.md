Given two arrays `words1` and `words2`, consider `word2` a subset of `word1` if every letter in `word2` occurs in `word1` including multiplicity. For example, `words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"]` and `words2 = ["e", "o"]`, then the universal words are `["facebook", "google", "leetcode"]`, because all these words contain at least one 'e' and one 'o'.

Write a function `wordSubsets(words1, words2)` that returns a list of all the universal elements in `words1`. The answer must be returned in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the words in `words1` and `words2` always lowercase alphabetical characters?**
   - Yes, all entries are lowercase alphabetic strings.

2. **Can `words1` or `words2` be empty?**
   - It's assumed `words2` is not empty. If `words1` is empty, the result would be an empty list.

3. **What are the size constraints for `words1` and `words2`?**
   - Typical constraints can be considered, like 1 <= `|words1|`, `|words2|` <= 10^4 and 1 <= `|words1[i]|`, `|words2[i]|` <= 10.

### Strategy

1. **Character Count Aggregation:**
   - Create an aggregated character count requirement from `words2` that each word in `words1` must meet or exceed.
   - For each word in `words2`, count the frequency of each character.
   - Take the maximum frequency of each character across all `words2` words to form the aggregated requirement.

2. **Filter `words1`:**
   - For each word in `words1`, compare its character frequencies against the aggregated requirement.
   - If a word in `words1` satisfies all character counts in the aggregated requirement, it is considered a universal word.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def wordSubsets(words1, words2):
    # Aggregate maximum character counts required by words2
    aggregate_char_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for word in words2:
        word_count = Counter(word)
        for char, count in word_count.items():
            aggregate_char_count[char] = max(aggregate_char_count[char], count)

    # Filter words1 based on aggregate char count requirement
    result = []
    for word in words1:
        word_count = Counter(word)
        if all(word_count[char] >= aggregate_char_count[char] for char in aggregate_char_count):
            result.append(word)
    
    return result

# Example usage
words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
words2 = ["e", "o"]
print(wordSubsets(words1, words2))  # Output: ["facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Aggregating Character Counts (for `words2`):**
   - Suppose `m` is the number of words in `words2` and the average length of a word is `k`. 
   - Time complexity to process `words2` is O(m * k).

2. **Filtering `words1`:**
   - Suppose `n` is the number of words in `words1` and the average length of a word is `l`.
   - Time complexity to filter `words1` is O(n * l).

3. **Overall Complexity:**
   - The overall time complexity is O(m * k + n * l). Given typical constraints, this complexity is efficient.
