Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`s and `1`s, find the largest square containing only `1`s and return its area.

You can assume that `matrix` is a binary matrix (contains only 0 and 1) and the number of rows and columns does not exceed 300.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any restrictions on the values within the matrix?
   - **A:** The matrix contains only binary values, ‘0’ and ‘1’.
2. **Q:** What should be returned if the matrix is empty?
   - **A:** If the matrix is empty, the function should return 0.
3. **Q:** What are the dimensions of the matrix?
   - **A:** The number of rows and columns does not exceed 300.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at `matrix[i][j]`.

1. **Initialize a DP array with the same dimensions as the matrix** filled with zeroes.
2. **Iterate through each cell in the matrix**:
    - If the cell contains '1', update the DP array at that position. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the minimum of the three possible neighboring values (left, top, and top-left) plus one.
3. **Track the maximum length of the square** found during the iteration.
4. The area of the largest square will be the square of this maximum length.

### Example
For a given matrix:
```
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 0
```
The largest square containing only 1's has an area of `4` (2x2 square).

## Code

```python
def maximalSquare(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    max_side = 0
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if matrix[i][j] == '1':
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
                max_side = max(max_side, dp[i][j])
    
    return max_side * max_side

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    ["1","0","1","0","0"],
    ["1","0","1","1","1"],
    ["1","1","1","1","1"],
    ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
print(maximalSquare(matrix))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns of the matrix. This is because we iterate through each cell once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) for the DP array. However, if we optimize and use a single row array, the space complexity can be reduced to \(O(n)\).
