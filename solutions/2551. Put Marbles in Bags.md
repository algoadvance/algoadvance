title:  Put Marbles in Bags-out
permalink: /s2551
---
You are given a list of integers `weights` representing the weights of marbles and an integer `k`. Distribute these marbles into `k` bags such that each bag has at least one marble and the weight difference between the lightest and heaviest bags is minimized. 

**Constraints:**
- The number of marbles `n` is at least k, i.e., \( n \geq k \).
- Each weight in `weights` is a positive integer.

**Output:**
Return the minimum difference between the heaviest and lightest bags after distribution.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can there be duplicate weights in the `weights` list?
2. Should each bag have at least one marble, or can some bags be empty?
3. Are we guaranteed that there are enough elements in `weights` to split into `k` bags, i.e., \( |weights| \geq k \)?

### Code:
Let's get into writing the code that accomplishes this.

### Strategy:
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `weights` list.
2. **Initial Distribution**: Start by initializing `k` bags, initially empty.
3. **Distribute Marbles**:
    - Assign weights to each bag in a way that minimizes the difference between the lightest and heaviest bags.
    - There are several strategies to do this, but placing one marble in each bag starting from the smallest to the largest may help maintain the balance.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the list of weights will take \( O(n \log n) \).
- Distributing items into bags after sorting and calculating the difference is linear \( O(n) \).

```python
def minimize_weight_difference(weights, k):
    weights.sort()
    
    lightest_bag = 0
    heaviest_bag = 0
    
    # Initialize bags
    bags = [[] for _ in range(k)]
    
    # Distribute weights: smallest to largest in a round-robin fashion
    for i, weight in enumerate(weights):
        bags[i % k].append(weight)
    
    # We only need the sum of each bag to determine lightest and heaviest bag
    bag_weights = [sum(bag) for bag in bags]
    
    # Calculate the difference between heaviest and lightest bags
    lightest_bag = min(bag_weights)
    heaviest_bag = max(bag_weights)
    
    return heaviest_bag - lightest_bag

# Example usage
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
k = 4
print(minimize_weight_difference(weights, k))  # Output should be minimized weight difference
```

### Remarks:
- The sorting step ensures that weights can be evenly distributed.
- The round-robin distribution helps to balance the weight across the bags.
- Calculating the total weights of the bags gives the necessary values to determine the minimal difference.
  
This approach should provide an answer with a minimized difference effectively utilizing sorting and efficient distribution of weights.
