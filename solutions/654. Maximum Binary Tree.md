1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: Can you please confirm the specifics of the problem we're tackling (i.e., constructing a maximum binary tree)?
2. **Input Specifications**: Do we need to handle any special input cases, such as empty arrays?
3. **Expected Output**: Should the function return the root node of the constructed binary tree?

Based on the typical description of the Maximum Binary Tree problem on LeetCode (#654), here are a few assumed clarifications:
- **Input**: A list of distinct integers.
- **Output**: The root node of a binary tree.

### Strategy
1. **Definition**: A Maximum Binary Tree is defined as:
   - The root is the maximum number in the array.
   - The left subtree is the maximum tree constructed from elements on the left side of the maximum number.
   - The right subtree is the maximum tree constructed from elements on the right side of the maximum number.

2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Find the maximum element and make it the root.
   - Recursively construct the left subtree from the elements to the left of the maximum.
   - Recursively construct the right subtree from the elements to the right of the maximum.

### Code
Here is the Python implementation:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def constructMaximumBinaryTree(self, nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not nums:
            return None
        
        # Find the index of the maximum number in the list
        max_index = nums.index(max(nums))
        
        # Create the root TreeNode with the maximum number
        root = TreeNode(nums[max_index])
        
        # Recursively construct the left and right subtrees
        root.left = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums[:max_index])
        root.right = self.constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums[max_index + 1:])
        
        return root

# Example usage
# To test the function, we can define a helper function to print the tree or check the structure.
def print_tree(node):
    if node is not None:
        print(node.val)
        print_tree(node.left)
        print_tree(node.right)

sol = Solution()
tree = sol.constructMaximumBinaryTree([3,2,1,6,0,5])
print_tree(tree)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\)
  - In each recursive call, the function scans the list to find the maximum element, which is \(O(n)\).
  - The list is divided into two sublists, leading to \(O(n)\) recursive calls in the worst-case scenario.
  
- **Average Case**: Optimized using segment tree or monotonic stack for \(O(n)\).
  - Optimizing the maximum search can reduce the time complexity to \(O(n)\), but the straightforward approach remains \(O(n^2)\) without such optimization.

By understanding the problem better, we can further refine our approach if needed. Let me know if any specific details need to be addressed!
