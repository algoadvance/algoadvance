title:  Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time-out
permalink: /s1870
---

You are given a floating point number `hour`, representing the time you have to reach the office. To commute, you must take `n` trains in sequential order. You are also given an integer array `dist` of length `n`, where `dist[i]` describes the distance (in kilometers) of the `i-th` train ride.

Return the **minimum positive integer speed** (in km/h) needed to arrive at the office on time. If it is impossible to be on time, return `-1`.

The train follows these rules:
- If the train does not reach its destination by the end of the hour, it is rounded up to the nearest whole number, but only for trains that aren't the last train. For example, if the train is 2.1 km away from the target and you are going at 1 km/h, you would require 3 hours to reach the destination.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `hour` be smaller than the smallest possible time to cover the distances at the highest speed?**
   - Yes, and in such a case, it's impossible to reach on time, so the answer should be `-1`.
2. **What is the range of `n` and the values inside `dist` array?**
   - Typically `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= dist[i] <= 10^5`.
3. **Is the floating-point precision of `hour` significant?**
   - Yes, because we may need to consider decimal part of the hour.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Binary Search on the Speed**: Given that we need to find the minimum positive integer speed, we can use binary search. 
2. **Simulation**: For a given speed, simulate the journey and determine if you can make it within the given time `hour`.

Here is a python code demonstrating the solution:

### Code

```python
import math

def minSpeedOnTime(dist, hour):
    if len(dist) - 1 >= hour:
        return -1
    
    # Helper function to check if a given speed can make it on time
    def canReachOnTime(speed):
        total_time = 0
        for i in range(len(dist)):
            if i == len(dist) - 1: 
                total_time += dist[i] / speed
            else:
                total_time += math.ceil(dist[i] / speed)
        return total_time <= hour

    left, right = 1, 10**7  # Set a reasonable upper bound for the speed
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canReachOnTime(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
            
    return left if canReachOnTime(left) else -1

# Example usage
dist = [1, 3, 2]
hour = 6
print(minSpeedOnTime(dist, hour))  # Output: 1

dist = [1, 3, 2]
hour = 2.7
print(minSpeedOnTime(dist, hour))  # Output: 3

dist = [1, 3, 2]
hour = 1.9
print(minSpeedOnTime(dist, hour))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search Complexity:** The range of speeds is from 1 to `10^7`, so the binary search will take `O(log 10^7)`, which is equivalent to `O(24)`.
2. **Simulation Complexity:** For each iteration of the binary search, we iterate through the distance array `dist` which is `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log 10^7)`, which is efficient given typical problem constraints.
