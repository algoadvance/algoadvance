title:  Minimum Length of String After Deleting Similar Ends-out
permalink: /s1750

Given a string `s`, repeatedly perform the following operation until you cannot:

- Choose the first character of `s` and remove all occurrences of this character from the start and end of `s`.

Return the length of the final string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `s` be empty?
   - If `s` is empty, the output should be `0`.
2. Can `s` contain only one type of character?
   - Yes, if `s` contains only one type of character, the output would be `0`.
3. Is the string case-sensitive?
   - Yes, the string is case-sensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters.

## Strategy
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` starting at the beginning of the string and `right` starting at the end.
2. Check the first character (`s[left]`). Move `left` pointer towards the right while the characters are the same as `s[left]`.
3. Similarly, move the `right` pointer towards the left while the characters are the same as `s[left]`.
4. If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, repeat the check for the new `s[left]` character.
5. When `left` pointer surpasses `right`, exit the loop and calculate the length of the remaining string using `right - left + 1`.

## Code
Let's implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def minimum_length(s: str) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right and s[left] == s[right]:
        char_to_remove = s[left]
        # Move left pointer to the right
        while left <= right and s[left] == char_to_remove:
            left += 1
        # Move right pointer to the left
        while left <= right and s[right] == char_to_remove:
            right -= 1
    
    return right - left + 1

# Example usage
print(minimum_length("abcabca")) # Expected output: 0
print(minimum_length("aabbccaa")) # Expected output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- The provided solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each character is checked at most twice. The operations inside the while loop (increment or decrement of pointers) are linear with respect to the string length.
