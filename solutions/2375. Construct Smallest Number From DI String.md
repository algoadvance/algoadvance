title:  Construct Smallest Number From DI String-out
permalink: /s2375
---

You are given a string `pattern` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'I' and 'D'. 'I' means increasing, and 'D' means decreasing. For each index `i` in the pattern, find the smallest permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n + 1` that match the pattern. 

Return the permutation as a string.

Example:

1. Input: `pattern = "IDID"`
   Output: `"13254"`

2. Input: `pattern = "III"`
   Output: `"1234"`

3. Input: `pattern = "DDI"`
   Output: `"3214"`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the input pattern be empty?
   - No, the problem statement specifies that it will have a length of `n`.

2. What is the maximum length for the input pattern?
   - Typically, constraints for such problems would be provided; for the purpose of this solution, we will assume a reasonable length up to 1000.

3. Are there any invalid characters in the pattern?
   - No, the pattern will only contain 'I' and 'D'.

## Strategy:

The main concept is to build the smallest number that satisfies the given 'I' and 'D' pattern by:
1. Using a greedy approach to place the smallest available numbers according to the pattern.
2. When encountering an 'I', place the smallest possible number.
3. When encountering a 'D', place the largest possible number left in subsequent positions to create a decreasing sequence.
4. Convert the resulting permutation to a string and return it.

The algorithm can be implemented by iterating through the positions of the pattern and adjusting the position of numbers by swapping to ensure the pattern is followed.

## Code:

```python
def smallestNumber(pattern: str) -> str:
    n = len(pattern)
    # Start with the smallest permutation of [1, 2, 3, ..., n+1]
    result = list(range(1, n + 2))
    
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if pattern[i] == 'I':
            i += 1
        else:
            j = i
            while i < n and pattern[i] == 'D':
                i += 1
            # Reverse the sequence from j to i to fit 'D' pattern
            result[j:i+1] = reversed(result[j:i+1])
    
    # Convert list of integers to string
    return "".join(map(str, result))

# Example usage:
print(smallestNumber("IDID"))  # Should output "13254"
print(smallestNumber("III"))   # Should output "1234"
print(smallestNumber("DDI"))   # Should output "3214"
```

## Time Complexity:

- The solution involves a single pass through the pattern and potentially reversing subsequences multiple times.
- The time complexity is O(n) where `n` is the length of the pattern, as reversing a subsequence of length k takes O(k) time and each element is part of at most one reverse operation.
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the space required to store the resulting permutation.
