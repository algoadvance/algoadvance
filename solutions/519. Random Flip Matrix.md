title:  Random Flip Matrix-out
permalink: /s519
---
You are given the number of rows `m` and the number of columns `n` of a 2D binary matrix where all values are initially 0. Implement the `FlipMatrix` class:
- `FlipMatrix(m: int, n: int)`: Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix `m` x `n`.
- `flip() -> List[int]`: Returns a random position `[row, col]` of a 0 in the matrix. The 0 at this position will now be set to 1. This function should ensure that each position is flipped at most once.
- `reset() -> None`: Resets all values of the matrix back to 0. 

You need to implement these functions such that each flip is done in `O(1)` time on average, and the memory used is `O(m * n)`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the arguments always within the expected range?
   - Yes, you can assume that `m` and `n` are positive integers within reasonable limits.
2. How do we ensure randomness?
   - Randomness should be uniform across the matrix positions that haven't been flipped yet.
3. Can we use extra space for keeping track of the flipped positions?
   - Yes, but the solution should still be efficient in terms of both time and space.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - We'll treat the matrix as a flattened list of size `m * n`. This helps us to simplify the problem to a 1D array.
   - We will use a dictionary to map flipped positions to ensure constant time operations.

2. **Flipping:** 
   - We'll randomly pick an index from the available positions in the 1D array.
   - We keep track of which indices have been flipped by using a dictionary that maps from the picked position to the last available position in the array.

3. **Resetting:** 
   - Simply reset the tracking dictionary and counter.

By storing only the necessary information to remap positions, we efficiently manage and maintain matrix flips.

## Code
```python
import random

class FlipMatrix:
    def __init__(self, m: int, n: int):
        self.m = m
        self.n = n
        self.total = m * n
        self.flips_map = {}
        self.available = self.total

    def flip(self) -> List[int]:
        rand_index = random.randint(0, self.available - 1)
        self.available -= 1

        # Get the mapped position or default to rand_index
        flip_pos = self.flips_map.get(rand_index, rand_index)

        # Update the map to reflect this position has been flipped
        self.flips_map[rand_index] = self.flips_map.get(self.available, self.available)

        return [flip_pos // self.n, flip_pos % self.n]

    def reset(self) -> None:
        self.flips_map = {}
        self.available = self.total

# Example usage:
# obj = FlipMatrix(m, n)
# param_1 = obj.flip()
# obj.reset()
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** `O(1)`, setting up initial variables.
- **flip():** `O(1)` on average, due to constant-time updates and dictionary access.
- **reset():** `O(1)`, resetting the dictionary and counter.

This ensures that the operations are efficient and scalable with respect to the matrix size.
