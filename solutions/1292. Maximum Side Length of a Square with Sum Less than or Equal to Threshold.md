title:  Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold-out
permalink: /s1292
---
Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return the maximum side length of a square with a sum less than or equal to `threshold` or return `0` if there is no such square.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the matrix have negative numbers?**
   - It is typically assumed that matrix values are non-negative, but confirm if negatives are possible.
2. **What are the constraints of the matrix dimensions and the range of the threshold?**
   - Example constraints help in determining the method to solve the problem.
3. **Is the threshold always positive?**
   - Helps in understanding edge cases such as zero threshold.

### Strategy:
1. **Prefix Sum Approach**:
   - Use a prefix sum matrix to compute the sum of any submatrix efficiently.
   
2. **Binary Search on Side Length**:
   - Perform a binary search on possible side lengths to find the maximum one that meets the condition.

### Steps:
1. **Compute Prefix Sum Matrix**:
   - Create a prefix sum matrix where `prefix[i][j]` represents the sum of the submatrix from (0, 0) to (i-1, j-1).
   
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Binary search over possible side lengths from 1 to min(m, n).
   - Check if there exists a square of the current length whose sum is within the threshold using the prefix sum matrix.

### Code:
```python
def maxSideLength(mat, threshold):
    def compute_prefix_sum(mat):
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        prefix = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                prefix[i][j] = mat[i - 1][j - 1] + prefix[i - 1][j] + prefix[i][j - 1] - prefix[i - 1][j - 1]
        return prefix
    
    def is_valid(length):
        for i in range(length, len(prefix)):
            for j in range(length, len(prefix[0])):
                total = prefix[i][j] - prefix[i - length][j] - prefix[i][j - length] + prefix[i - length][j - length]
                if total <= threshold:
                    return True
        return False

    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    prefix = compute_prefix_sum(mat)

    left, right = 1, min(m, n)
    result = 0
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if is_valid(mid):
            result = mid
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return result

# Example usage
mat = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
threshold = 8
print(maxSideLength(mat, threshold))  # Output should be 1 in this case
```

### Explanation:
1. **Prefix Sum Matrix Construction**:
   - `prefix[i][j]` includes cumulative sums which allow calculating any submatrix sum in constant time.
2. **Binary Search**:
   - We search for the largest possible side length. For each mid-point in the binary search, `is_valid` function checks if a square with that side length can be found such that its sum is below the threshold.

### Time Complexity:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - \(O(m \times n)\)
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Logarithmic steps \(O(\log(\min(m, n)))\), and for each step, we need to check the submatrix sums \(O(m \times n)\).
3. **Overall Complexity**:
   - \(O(m \times n \times \log(\min(m, n)))\)

This approach efficiently narrows down the largest possible side length using prefix sums and binary search, making it suitable for typical constraint sizes in such problems.
