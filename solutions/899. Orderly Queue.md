You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. The task is to reorder the string in such a way that you get the lexicographically smallest string possible. You're allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose one of the first `k` characters of `s` and move it to the end of the string.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the meaning of "lexicographically smallest string"?**
   - It refers to the smallest string in dictionary order.

2. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - The maximum length of the string is 1000.

3. **Is it always guaranteed that the input string will be non-empty?**
   - Yes, since the constraints start from `1 <= s.length`.

### Strategy

1. **Case for `k == 1`:**
   - When `k` is 1, the only operation you can perform is rotating the string. Therefore, to find the smallest lexicographical order, you need to try all possible rotations and pick the smallest one.

2. **Case for `k > 1`:**
   - When `k` is greater than 1, you have more flexibility. Specifically, you can essentially perform any permutation of the string (since with `k=2`, you can, for example, move the second character to the end followed by the first character, etc.).
   - In this case, the smallest possible string is simply the sorted version of the original string.

### Solution

**Coding Approach:**

1. Check if `k` is equal to 1. If yes, generate all rotations of the string, and return the smallest one.
2. If `k` is greater than 1, simply return the sorted version of the string.

### Code

```python
def orderlyQueue(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    if k == 1:
        # Generate all possible rotations of the string and find the smallest one
        return min(s[i:] + s[:i] for i in range(len(s)))
    else:
        # For k > 1, the smallest possible string is the sorted version of the original string
        return ''.join(sorted(s))
```

### Time Complexity

1. **For `k == 1`:**
   - Generating all rotations takes `O(n^2)` time (where `n` is the length of the string) as generating each rotation and comparing might require linear time.
2. **For `k > 1`:**
   - Sorting the string will take `O(n log n)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
- `O(n^2)` for `k == 1`
- `O(n log n)` for `k > 1`

This efficiently handles the constraints given.
