title:  Maximum Total Importance of Roads-out
permalink: /s2285
---

You are given:

- An integer `n` denoting the number of cities.
- A 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road connecting cities `a_i` and `b_i`.

Each city can be given an importance from `1` to `n`, and the total importance of all roads is the sum of the importances of the two cities connected by each road.

The objective is to assign importances to each city such that the total importance of all roads is maximized and return this maximum total importance.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the cities labeled from `0` to `n-1`?**
   Yes, cities are labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Is there a limit to the number of roads?**
   The constraints for `n` and `roads` would be needed to ensure our approach handles the input efficiently, but we'll assume they're within reasonable large input limits typical for such problems.

3. **Can there be multiple roads between the same two cities or self-loops?**
   Let's assume the roads are unique pairs of cities without self-loops unless otherwise specified.

### Strategy

To maximize the importance of all roads, the strategy revolves around:
1. Determining the number of roads connected to each city.
2. Assigning the highest importance to cities with the most roads.

We'll follow these steps:
1. Calculate the degree of each city (i.e., the number of roads connected to it).
2. Sort the cities based on their degree in descending order.
3. Assign importances from n to 1 based on the sorted order.
4. Calculate the total importance of the roads using the assigned importances.

### Code

```python
def maximumImportance(n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Create a dictionary to store the degree of each city
    degree = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Calculate the degree of each city
    for road in roads:
        a, b = road
        degree[a] += 1
        degree[b] += 1
        
    # Sort cities based on their degrees in descending order
    sorted_cities = sorted(degree.keys(), key=lambda x: degree[x], reverse=True)
    
    # Assign the highest available importance (from n to 1) to cities with highest degrees
    importance = {}
    importance_value = n
    for city in sorted_cities:
        importance[city] = importance_value
        importance_value -= 1
    
    # Calculate the total importance of all roads
    total_importance = 0
    for road in roads:
        a, b = road
        total_importance += importance[a] + importance[b]
        
    return total_importance

# Example Usage
print(maximumImportance(5, [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]))  # Output should match the expected importance maximization
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating the degree of each city:** \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of roads.
- **Sorting the cities based on their degrees:** \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of cities.
- **Assigning importances and calculating the total importance:** \(O(m)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(n \log n + m)\).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and works well within typical input limits for similar problems.
