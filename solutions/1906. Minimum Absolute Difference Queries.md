title:  Minimum Absolute Difference Queries-out
permalink: /s1906
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an array `queries` where `queries[i] = [li, ri]`. For each query `i`, compute the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subarray `nums[li...ri]` (inclusive) and return an array of the answers.

The minimum absolute difference of an array is the minimum value of `|a - b|` where `a` and `b` are elements of the array (and `a != b`).

### Example

**Example 1:**

```python
Input: nums = [1,3,4,8], queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,3]]
Output: [2,1,4,1]
Explanation:
The queries are processed as follows:
- queries[0] = [0,1]: The subarray is [1,3] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-3| = 2.
- queries[1] = [1,2]: The subarray is [3,4] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.
- queries[2] = [2,3]: The subarray is [4,8] and the minimum absolute difference is |4-8| = 4.
- queries[3] = [0,3]: The subarray is [1,3,4,8] and the minimum absolute difference is |3-4| = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```python
Input: nums = [4,2,1,3], queries = [[0,2],[1,3],[0,3]], 
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation:
The queries are processed as follows:
- queries[0] = [0,2]: The subarray is [4,2,1] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-2| = 1.
- queries[1] = [1,3]: The subarray is [2,1,3] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-2| = 1.
- queries[2] = [0,3]: The subarray is [4,2,1,3] and the minimum absolute difference is |1-2| = 1.
```

### Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `0 <= li < ri < nums.length`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in `nums` array repeat?
   - Yes, elements can repeat.

2. What is the range of values for each element in the `nums` array?
   - Each element in `nums` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.

3. Should the difference be calculated only between distinct elements?
   - Yes, the difference should be between distinct elements, i.e., having `a != b`.

## Strategy

1. **Preprocessing with Sparse Tables:**
   Given that `nums`' values range between 1 and 100, this is manageable with a frequency array.

2. **Range Frequency Counting:**
   Count the frequency of each number between 1 and 100 for each prefix of `nums` to efficiently handle the range queries.

3. **Efficient Query:**
   Utilize the precomputed frequency array to extract the possible distinct values in the range defined by each query quickly, and then compute the minimum absolute difference between any two distinct numbers in this set.
   
4. **Complexity Consideration:**
  - Preprocessing the prefix count array can be done in O(100 * n).
  - Each query can be processed in O(100 * log(100)), since the highest number of distinct elements is 100.
  
  Given the constraints, these operations are efficient.

## Code

Here's how you can implement the strategy in Python:

```python
def minDifference(nums, queries):
    n = len(nums)
    # Presuming a value range of [1, 100], we need 101 slots.
    prefix_count = [[0]*101 for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    # Fill prefix_count
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(101):
            prefix_count[i+1][j] = prefix_count[i][j]
        prefix_count[i+1][nums[i]] += 1
    
    def compute_min_abs_diff(left, right):
        count = [prefix_count[right+1][j] - prefix_count[left][j] for j in range(101)]
        prev = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        for num in range(101):
            if count[num] > 0:
                if prev != -1:
                    min_diff = min(min_diff, num - prev)
                prev = num
        return min_diff if min_diff != float('inf') else 0
    
    result = []
    for l, r in queries:
        result.append(compute_min_abs_diff(l, r))
    
    return result

# Example use case:
nums = [1,3,4,8]
queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,3]]
print(minDifference(nums, queries))  # [2, 1, 4, 1]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Time Complexity:** O(100 * n)
  - Constructing the `prefix_count` array.
  
- **Query Time Complexity:** O(q * 100)
  - For each of the `q` queries, we perform a range sum and find the minimum absolute difference.
  
- **Overall Complexity:** Given that `q` and `n` can go up to 100,000 and 20,000 respectively, this approach efficiently handles the problem within permissible limits.
