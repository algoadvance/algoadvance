title:  Shortest Uncommon Substring in an Array-out
permalink: /s3076
---

You are given a string array `words`. Your task is to find the length of the shortest substring that is an uncommon substring among all the strings in the array. An uncommon substring of a single string is a substring that is not a substring of any other string in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","plum","grape"]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["ab","cd","ab"]
Output: 1
```

**Note:**

1. The length of each string in the array will be at least 1 and at most 100.
2. The number of strings in the array will be at least 2 and at most 50.
3. All the strings in the array will consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are we only considering substrings or can we also consider individual characters?
   - We are considering substrings which include individual characters.
2. Is our goal to find the shortest substring in total or of each word and then compare?
   - Our goal is to find the shortest uncommon substring across the array.
3. Can there be duplicates in the words array?
   - Yes, and they should be treated as separate entities.
4. Is the answer always guaranteed to exist?
   - Yes, since each word has at least 1 character, we know there should be at least one solution for the uncommon substring.

## Strategy

1. **Generate All Substrings:** For a given word, generate all possible substrings.
2. **Check Uncommon Substrings:** Check each substring to see if it is a substring of any other string in the `words` array.
3. **Track Minimum Length:** Track the length of the shortest uncommon substring found.
4. **Edge Case**: If all words are the same, any single character would be a valid output as all words being the same contradicts the definition.

## Code

Here's the implementation based on the strategy:

```python
def shortest_uncommon_substring(words):
    def is_substring_in_any_other(word, substring, idx):
        for i, w in enumerate(words):
            if i != idx and substring in w:
                return True
        return False

    min_length = float('inf')

    for idx, word in enumerate(words):
        n = len(word)
        # Generate all substrings for this word
        for length in range(1, n + 1):
            for start in range(n - length + 1):
                substring = word[start:start + length]
                if not is_substring_in_any_other(word, substring, idx):
                    min_length = min(min_length, length)
    
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0

# Example usage
print(shortest_uncommon_substring(["apple","plum","grape"]))  # Output: 2
print(shortest_uncommon_substring(["ab","cd","ab"]))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Generating Substrings:** For each word of length \(n\), the number of substrings is \(O(n^2)\).
- **Checking Substrings:** For each substring, checking in all other words will take \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the average length of the words array of \(k\) words.
- Thus, the overall time complexity can be approximated to \(O(k \times N^3)\), where \(k\) is the number of words and \(N\) is the average length of the words.

This complexity should be feasible given the constraints (length up to 100, number of words up to 50).
