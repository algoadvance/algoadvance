title:  Distance Between Bus Stops-out
permalink: /s1184
---

You are given an integer array `distance` where `distance[i]` represents the distance between the `i-th` and `(i+1)-th` bus stops. You are also given two integers `start` and `destination` both in the range `[0, distance.length - 1]`.

Return the shortest distance between the bus stops `start` and `destination`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the bus route circular?**
   Yes, the bus route is circular, meaning that the end of the route connects back to the beginning.

2. **Can `start` and `destination` be the same?**
   If `start` is equal to `destination`, the distance would be zero since you do not need to travel.

3. **Do we need to consider edge cases with minimum and maximum lengths of `distance`?**
   Yes, we should handle edge cases where the length of the `distance` array can have minimum and maximum lengths as allowed by constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Route:**
   Since the route is circular, there are two possible paths between `start` and `destination`:
   - **Clockwise Path:** This path follows the sequence from `start` to `destination` directly.
   - **Counterclockwise Path:** This path goes from `start` to `destination` by going the other way around the circle.

2. **Calculating Distances:**
   - Calculate the distance for both the clockwise and counterclockwise paths. 
   - To find the shortest path, we take the minimum of both distances.

3. **Steps to Implement Solution:**
   - If `start` is greater than `destination`, swap them to simplify the calculations (always move from smaller index to larger index).
   - Calculate the clockwise distance by summing `distance` from `start` to `destination`.
   - Calculate the counterclockwise distance by summing the remainder of `distance` array (from `destination` to end and then from start to `destination`).
   - Return the minimum of these two distances.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Python:

```python
def distanceBetweenBusStops(distance, start, destination):
    if start > destination:
        start, destination = destination, start
        
    # Calculate clockwise distance
    clockwise_distance = sum(distance[start:destination])
    
    # Calculate counterclockwise distance
    counterclockwise_distance = sum(distance) - clockwise_distance
    
    return min(clockwise_distance, counterclockwise_distance)

# Example Usage
distance = [1, 2, 3, 4]
start = 0
destination = 2
print(distanceBetweenBusStops(distance, start, destination))  # Output: 3

start = 2
destination = 0
print(distanceBetweenBusStops(distance, start, destination))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `distance` array. This is because in the worst case, we might need to sum up all the elements in the `distance` array for the counterclockwise calculation.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables.

This approach efficiently calculates the shortest distance between two bus stops on a circular route.
