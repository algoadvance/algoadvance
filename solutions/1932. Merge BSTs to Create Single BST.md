title:  Merge BSTs to Create Single BST-out
permalink: /s1932
---

Given an array of Binary Search Tree (BST) roots, you must merge them into one single BST (if possible). If it is possible to generate exactly one valid BST, return the root of the merged tree. Otherwise, return `None`.

A valid BST is defined as follows:
- The left subtree of any node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of any node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the nodes in each BST guaranteed to have unique values?
2. Can one of the BST roots be `None`, and if so, should it be ignored?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of each BST?
4. Should we handle invalid BSTs in the input array (i.e., the given trees are not actually BSTs)?

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Extract All Nodes:** Perform an in-order traversal on all the given BSTs to extract all nodes and their values.
2. **Check for Duplicate Values:** Ensure there are no duplicate values among the nodes from all the BSTs since a BST cannot have duplicate values.
3. **Sort Nodes:** Once we gather all the nodes, sort them based on their values.
4. **Construct a Valid BST:** Use the sorted list of nodes to construct a valid BST.

#### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **In-Order Traversal:** Traverse each BST to get all nodes.
2. **Validate No Duplicates:** Ensure no duplicates exist.
3. **Sort Nodes:** Sort extracted nodes.
4. **Build BST:** Construct a balanced BST from the sorted nodes list.

### Code

Here's an implementation to solve the problem:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def merge_bsts(bst_roots):
    def in_order_traversal(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        return in_order_traversal(node.left) + [node.val] + in_order_traversal(node.right)
    
    def sorted_array_to_bst(nums):
        if not nums:
            return None
        mid = len(nums) // 2
        root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        root.left = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[:mid])
        root.right = sorted_array_to_bst(nums[mid + 1:])
        return root

    # Gather all nodes
    all_nodes = []
    values_set = set()
    
    for root in bst_roots:
        if root:
            nodes = in_order_traversal(root)
            for val in nodes:
                if val in values_set:
                    return None # Found duplicate
                values_set.add(val)
                all_nodes.append(val)
    
    # Sort the gathered nodes' values
    all_nodes.sort()
    
    # Construct and return a balanced BST
    return sorted_array_to_bst(all_nodes)
```

### Time Complexity

1. **In-Order Traversal:** O(N) where N is the total number of nodes across all BSTs.
2. **Sorting:** O(N log N) for sorting the extracted nodes.
3. **Constructing the BST:** O(N) as we construct the balanced BST from the sorted list.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step:
**O(N log N)**

This solution ensures we create a single balanced BST from the given BSTs if possible, while checking for and handling invalid scenarios such as duplicate values among the BSTs.
