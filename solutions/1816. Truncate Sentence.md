title:  Truncate Sentence-out
permalink: /s1816
---

You are given a sentence `s` and an integer `k`. You need to truncate the sentence such that it contains only the first `k` words. Return the truncated sentence.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Splitting Criteria:** Are we assuming words are separated by single spaces and there are no leading/trailing spaces?
    - Yes, we'll assume that words are separated by single spaces and there's no leading/trailing whitespace.

2. **Input Constraints:** Can the value of `k` be equal to or greater than the number of words in the sentence?
    - No, `k` will always be a positive integer less than or equal to the number of words in the sentence.

3. **Character Set:** Are we assuming the input sentence only consists of alphabetic characters and spaces?
    - Yes, we can assume the sentence consists only of alphabetic characters and spaces.

### Strategy

1. **Split the Sentence:** Use Python's `split` method to split the sentence `s` into a list of words based on spaces.
2. **Extract First `k` Words:** Slice the list to get the first `k` words.
3. **Join the Words:** Use the `join` method to join the words back into a sentence with a single space as the delimiter.
4. **Return the Result:** Return the truncated sentence.

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the Sentence:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the sentence.
- **Slicing the List:** `O(k)` where `k` is the number of words to be returned.
- **Joining the Words:** `O(k * m)` where `m` is the average length of the words.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + k * m)`, which is typically linear in nature given the constraints.

### Code

```python
def truncateSentence(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Take the first k words
    truncated_words = words[:k]
    
    # Join the words back into a sentence
    truncated_sentence = ' '.join(truncated_words)
    
    return truncated_sentence

# Test cases
print(truncateSentence("Hello how are you Contestant", 4))  # Expected: "Hello how are you"
print(truncateSentence("What is the solution to this problem", 4))  # Expected: "What is the solution"
print(truncateSentence("chopper is not a tanuki", 5))  # Expected: "chopper is not a tanuki"
```

This code effectively splits the sentence, takes the first `k` words, and then rejoins them into the truncated sentence.
