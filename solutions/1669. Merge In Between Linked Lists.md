title:  Merge In Between Linked Lists-out
permalink: /s1669
---
You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of size `n` and `m` respectively, and two integers `a` and `b` with `0 <= a <= b < n`.

You need to:
1. Remove the nodes from the `a`-th node to the `b`-th node (inclusive) from `list1`.
2. Insert `list2` into `list1` starting from `a`-th position.

Finally, return the modified list.

**Example:**
```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5], list2 = [1000,1001,1002], a = 3, b = 4
Output: [0, 1, 2, 1000, 1001, 1002, 5]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the lists be empty? 
2. Are the nodes in the linked lists guaranteed to have unique values?
3. Is the input guaranteed to be valid (i.e., 0 ≤ a ≤ b < n)?

### Plan
1. **Locate Nodes:**
   - Traverse `list1` to locate the node before the `a`-th node (`pre_a`) and the node after the `b`-th node (`post_b`).
2. **Modify Pointers:**
   - Connect the `pre_a`'s next pointer to the head of `list2`.
   - Traverse to the end of `list2` and connect its last node to `post_b`.
3. **Return the head of modified `list1`.**

### Code
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeInBetween(list1: ListNode, list2: ListNode, a: int, b: int) -> ListNode:
    # Find the node just before the 'a'-th node.
    pre_a = list1
    for _ in range(a - 1):
        pre_a = pre_a.next
    
    # Find the node just after the 'b'-th node.
    post_b = pre_a
    for _ in range(b - a + 2):
        post_b = post_b.next
    
    # Connect pre_a's next to the head of list2.
    pre_a.next = list2
    
    # Find the end of list2.
    end_of_list2 = list2
    while end_of_list2.next is not None:
        end_of_list2 = end_of_list2.next
    
    # Connect the end of list2 to post_b.
    end_of_list2.next = post_b
    
    return list1
```

### Strategy
1. **Traversing List1:** Use a loop to find `pre_a` and `post_b`, the nodes respectively before and after the segment to be replaced.
2. **Connecting Lists:** Update `pre_a.next` to point to the head of `list2`, then find the tail of `list2` and set its next to `post_b`.

### Time Complexity
- **Traversing List1 (up to `b`): O(n)**
  - Locating `pre_a` and `post_b` involves iterating up to the `b`-th node which takes linear time.
- **Traversing List2:** O(m)
  - Finding the tail of `list2` takes linear time in terms of the length of `list2`.

The overall time complexity is O(n + m).
