title:  Continuous Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2762
---

The task is to identify the lengths of subarrays that are continuous and subarrays of length `d`. 

In this problem, the objective is to determine the allocation of continuous subarray lengths for a given input array `A`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the constraints on the size of the array `A`?
    - What values can `A` take? Are they integers and is there a bound on range?
2. **Output details:**
    - Should the function return the lengths of all possible continuous subarrays?
    - Should the result be in any particular order?
3. **Examples:**
    - Could you provide an example with input array and desired output for better understanding?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into the following steps:
1. **Generate All Subarrays:**
    - Iterate over all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays.
2. **Determine Length:**
    - Compute the length of each subarray and store it.
3. **Filter Unique Lengths:**
    - Eliminate duplicate lengths and potentially sort if required.

### Code

Here is a Python solution to achieve the above strategy:

```python
def continuousSubarrayLengths(A):
    n = len(A)
    result_lengths = set()

    # Sliding window to get all possible subarrays
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start, n):
            subarray_length = end - start + 1
            result_lengths.add(subarray_length)
    
    # Convert set to list to sort or return as required
    return sorted(list(result_lengths))

# Example usage:
A = [1, 2, 3]
print(continuousSubarrayLengths(A))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating all subarrays:** We have two nested loops which each run `O(n)` giving us an overall time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
- **Adding lengths to a set:** Each insertion in a set takes `O(1)`, and there will be at most `n` entries for lengths.
- **Sorting the list:** Sorting a list of lengths takes `O(n log n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the nested loops and is **O(n^2)**.

### Final Notes

- The solution provides a list of unique subarray lengths sorted in ascending order as an example.
- The complexity is efficiently handled given the constraints typically associated with such a problem.
