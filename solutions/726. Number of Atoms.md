title:  Number of Atoms-out

---

Given a string representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom present in the formula in a standardized format. The format should be sorted in lexicographical order of the atom names. The string will always be valid, containing alphanumeric characters, '(', ')', and digits.

### Examples:

1. Input: `formula = "H2O"`
   Output: `"H2O"`

2. Input: `formula = "Mg(OH)2"`
   Output: `"H2MgO2"`

3. Input: `formula = "K4(ON(SO3)2)2"`
   Output: `"K4N2O14S4"`

### Constraints:

- The length of the formula will be in the range [1, 1000].
- The formula will be a valid chemical formula as per the problem's definition.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Are the atoms always represented by their respective chemical symbols with the first letter uppercase, followed by optional lowercase letters?
2. Is there a maximum limit on the nesting of parentheses in the formula?
3. Should we handle formulas with implied coefficients like "H2O" where "O" implies "O1"?

## Strategy:
To solve this problem, we need to parse the formula effectively:

1. Use a stack to manage nested parentheses and coefficients.
2. Traverse the string:
   - Whenever encountering an element symbol, handle the element and its immediate coefficient.
   - Whenever encountering '(', push a marker onto the stack to handle nested scope.
   - Whenever encountering ')', pop stack items until the corresponding '(', and multiply them by the succeeding coefficient.
3. Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each type of atom.
4. Sort the dictionary by atom names and format them as requested.

## Code:
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import collections

def countOfAtoms(formula: str) -> str:
    def parse():
        N = len(formula)
        i = 0
        
        def parse_element():
            nonlocal i
            i += 1
            start = i - 1
            while i < N and formula[i].islower():
                i += 1
            return formula[start:i]
        
        def parse_number():
            nonlocal i
            if i == N or not formula[i].isdigit():
                return 1
            start = i
            while i < N and formula[i].isdigit():
                i += 1
            return int(formula[start:i])
        
        stack = [collections.Counter()]
        
        while i < N:
            if formula[i] == '(':
                i += 1
                stack.append(collections.Counter())
            elif formula[i] == ')':
                i += 1
                num = parse_number()
                top = stack.pop()
                for elem, v in top.items():
                    stack[-1][elem] += v * num
            else:
                elem = parse_element()
                num = parse_number()
                stack[-1][elem] += num
        
        return stack.pop()
    
    atom_counts = parse()
    result = []
    for elem in sorted(atom_counts):
        count = atom_counts[elem]
        if count > 1:
            result.append(f"{elem}{count}")
        else:
            result.append(elem)
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Testing the function with the provided examples
print(countOfAtoms("H2O"))  # Output: "H2O"
print(countOfAtoms("Mg(OH)2"))  # Output: "H2MgO2"
print(countOfAtoms("K4(ON(SO3)2)2"))  # Output: "K4N2O14S4"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Parsing Elements:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the formula string.
- **Managing Stack Operations:** Each operation involving stack takes \(O(1)\) and in the worst-case scenario, we can have all elements nested or followed by a large coefficient.
- **Managing Dictionary Operations:** Counting elements is \(O(n)\) and sorting the elements by their names is \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of different elements.

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n \log k)\).
