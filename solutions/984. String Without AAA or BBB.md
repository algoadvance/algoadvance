title:  String Without AAA or BBB-out
permalink: /s984

Given two integers `A` and `B`, return any string `S` such that:
- `S` has exactly `A` 'a' letters and exactly `B` 'b' letters,
- The substring `'aaa'` does not occur in `S`,
- The substring `'bbb'` does not occur in `S`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `A` and `B` be zero?**
   - Yes, either `A` or `B` (or both) can be zero.
2. **What should be the length of the resulting string?**
   - The length should be exactly `A + B` since it contains exactly `A` 'a' letters and exactly `B` 'b' letters.
3. **Is there any preference for which string to return if multiple valid strings can satisfy the requirements?**
   - No, any valid string that meets the conditions is acceptable.

### Strategy
- We need to create a balance between 'a' and 'b' characters to avoid three consecutive 'a's or 'b's.
- If one character type exceeds twice the other plus two (e.g., `A > 2 * B + 2`), it is impossible to generate such a string under the given constraints. This scenario should be handled.
- We will utilize a greedy approach:
  - If `A` (number of 'a') is greater than `B` (number of 'b'), we try to add 'a' first unless it creates three consecutive 'a's.
  - Similarly, if `B` is greater than `A`, we try to add 'b' first unless it creates three consecutive 'b's.
  - Continue this process until all characters are used.
- Append the char which has the highest count left whenever possible.

### Code
Here's the implementation:

```python
def strWithout3a3b(A: int, B: int) -> str:
    result = []

    while A > 0 or B > 0:
        # Append 'a' if either 'a' count is greater than 'b' count and no "aa" at the end, or "bb" at the end
        if (A > B and (len(result) < 2 or result[-1] != 'a' or result[-2] != 'a')) or (len(result) >= 2 and result[-1] == 'b' and result[-2] == 'b'):
            result.append('a')
            A -= 1
        # Append 'b' if not adding 'a'
        else:
            result.append('b')
            B -= 1

    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(A + B)
  - Each 'a' or 'b' added to the result string is processed in constant time, and there are a total of `A + B` characters to be added.
- **Space Complexity:** O(A + B)
  - We are using the result list to store all characters before joining them into the final string. Hence, the space complexity is linear in the number of characters.

This approach ensures that the resulting string satisfies the conditions while adhering to a linear time and space complexity.
