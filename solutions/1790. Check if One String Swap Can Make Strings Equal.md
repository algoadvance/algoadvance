title:  Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal-out
permalink: /s1790
---

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length, your task is to determine if there is a way to swap exactly one pair of characters in `s1` so that it becomes equal to `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Are `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to have the same length?
    - What is the maximum length of `s1` and `s2`?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the function return a boolean value indicating whether a single swap can make the strings equal?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Comparison:** First, ensure `s1` and `s2` have equal lengths. If they don't, return `False` immediately (given the constraints, though, this should not happen).
  
2. **Identifying Mismatch:** Traverse both strings and identify the indices where they differ.

3. **Conditions for Swap:**
   - If the strings are already equal, a swap is not necessary, but technically a "no-op swap" can be considered valid.
   - If there are exactly two positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, check if swapping these two positions in `s1` will equalize the two strings.
   - If there are more or less than two mismatches, it is impossible to make the strings equal with just one swap.

### Code

```python
def areAlmostEqual(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    # Step 1: Check if lengths of s1 and s2 are the same
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return False

    # Step 2 & 3: Find all positions where the strings differ
    mismatches = []
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            mismatches.append(i)

    # Step 4: Evaluate mismatch conditions
    if len(mismatches) == 0:
        # Strings are already equal; one "no-op swap" is trivially possible
        return True
    elif len(mismatches) == 2:
        # Strings differ at exactly two positions
        i, j = mismatches
        # Check if swapping s1[i] with s1[j] will match s2
        if s1[i] == s2[j] and s1[j] == s2[i]:
            return True
    
    # In all other cases, return False
    return False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm involves a single traversal of both strings, thus it operates in O(n) time, where n is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity:** The additional space used is simply for storing the mismatched indices, which in the worst case could be O(n), but typically we only need to store up to 2 indices. Thus, average case space complexity is O(1), and the worst case is O(n).

By following this strategy, you can effectively determine if the strings `s1` and `s2` can be made equal with exactly one swap.
