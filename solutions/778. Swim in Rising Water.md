title:  Swim in Rising Water-out
permalink: /s778
---

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually is at most `t`. You want to swim from the top left corner (`0, 0`) to the bottom right corner (`n-1, n-1`).

Return the least time `t` at which you can reach the bottom right corner and swim out of the grid.

### Example

```python
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n^2`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the water level ever decrease or stay the same once it starts rising?
   - No, the water level only rises as time `t` increases.

2. Are we allowed to use any path-finding or graph traversal algorithms?
   - Yes, you can use path-finding algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm.

3. Are diagonal movements allowed?
   - No, only 4-directional movements (up, down, left, right) are allowed.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**: We'll use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the lowest elevation first.
2. **Priority Queue**: Push the starting position `(0,0)` with its elevation.
3. **Visited Set**: Keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles.
4. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Extract the cell with the minimum elevation from the heap, check all its neighbors, and if they are within bounds and not visited, push them onto the heap with the maximum elevation encountered so far.
5. **Termination**: The search terminates once you reach the bottom right corner `(n-1, n-1)`.

## Time Complexity

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** itself runs in `O(E log V)` where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices.
- Since the graph is an `n x n` grid, there are `O(n^2)` vertices and `O(4 * n^2)` edges.

Therefore, the time complexity for this solution is **O(n^2 log n)**.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def swimInWater(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    min_heap = [(grid[0][0], 0, 0)]  # (elevation, row, col)
    visited = set((0, 0))
    
    while min_heap:
        elevation, x, y = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        # If we've reached the bottom right corner, return the elevation time
        if x == n - 1 and y == n - 1:
            return elevation
        # Explore the neighbors
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (max(elevation, grid[nx][ny]), nx, ny))

# Example Usage
print(swimInWater([[0, 2], [1, 3]]))  # should output 3
```

This approach leverages Dijkstra's algorithm with a min-heap to find the path with the minimal maximal elevation encountered, ensuring efficient traversal and minimal time complexity.
