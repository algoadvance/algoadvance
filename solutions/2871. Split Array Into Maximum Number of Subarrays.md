title:  Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2871

Given an array `nums`, your task is to split the array into the maximum number of subarrays such that the sum of every subarray is odd. Return the maximum number of subarrays.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,2,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can split the array into [1,3,5], [4], [2,6], each of which has an odd sum.
```

### Constraints
- The array `nums` will have at least one element.
- The array `nums` will contain integers.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the subarrays be of length 1?**
   - Yes, if the elements themselves result in an odd sum.
   
2. **What should the function return if it's not possible to split into subarrays with odd sums?**
   - It's always possible since we can choose a single element as a subarray if it's odd.

3. **How should we handle negative numbers?**
   - The sum of subarrays should still consider the sign; we're checking if the sum is odd.

## Strategy
We need to split the array into the maximum number of subarrays with odd sums. Hereâ€™s the strategy to achieve this:

1. **Identify candidates for new subarrays:** 
   - Traverse the list and calculate the sum of elements until you encounter an element that triggers a subarray sum to be odd.
   - Once an odd sum subarray is identified, start a new subarray from the next element.

2. **Split on Even-End Sums:** 
   - If the current subarray's sum is odd, continue adding elements.
   - If the current subarray's sum is even, potential split might happen but try to keep adding until finding an odd sum subarray.

3. **Check each element:** 
   - For each element in the array, attempt to either extend the current subarray or to start a new subarray if needed.

4. **Track maximum subarrays:** 
   - Count each successful odd sum subarray and return the total count.

## Code
```python
def max_subarrays_with_odd_sum(nums):
    max_subarrays = 0
    current_sum = 0

    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum % 2 != 0:
            max_subarrays += 1
            current_sum = 0

    return max_subarrays
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` list. We are traversing the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of additional space irrespective of the input size.

The above code implements the strategy where we split the array based on the current sum reaching odd values and resetting it to zero for further evaluations. This way, we maximize the number of subarrays with odd sums.
