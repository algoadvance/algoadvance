title:  Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups-out
permalink: /s2074
---

You are given the head of a linked list. The nodes in the linked list are sequentially labeled from 1, 2, 3, and so on. In an even-length group, nodes should be reversed.

For example, if the linked list is:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> ...

Grouped into:

1 -> (2 -> 3) -> (4 -> 5 -> 6) -> (7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10) -> ...

You should reverse nodes in even groups resulting in:

1 -> (3 -> 2) -> (4 -> 5 -> 6) -> (10 -> 9 -> 8 -> 7) -> ...

Return the modified head of the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always a valid linked list?**
   - Yes, assume the input is always a valid linked list.
   
2. **What should be done if the last group is incomplete and has an even length?**
   - Reverse it since it is an even-length group.

3. **What if the last group has an odd number of nodes?**
   - Leave it as it is since only even-length groups are reversed.

### Strategy

1. **Determine Group Sizes:**
   - Traverse through the linked list to determine the length of each group. The size of the i-th group is i.

2. **Reverse Even-Length Groups:**
   - For each group, check if its length is even. If it is, reverse the nodes in that group.

3. **Link Groups Appropriately:**
   - While reversing, ensure that the nodes before and after the group link appropriately to preserve the list structure.

### Code

Here's how we can implement the solution:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseEvenLengthGroups(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    def reverse(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        prev, current = None, head
        for _ in range(k):
            nxt = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = nxt
        return prev
    
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev, current = dummy, head
    group_size = 1

    while current:
        tail = current
        count = 0
        
        # Find the size of the current group
        while count < group_size and current:
            current = current.next
            count += 1
        
        if count == group_size and count % 2 == 0:
            next_group_head = current
            tail, current = prev.next, prev.next
            
            for _ in range(group_size):
                new_next = current.next
                current.next = next_group_head
                next_group_head = current
                current = new_next
                
            prev.next = next_group_head
            tail.next = current
            prev = tail
        else:
            for _ in range(group_size):
                if not current:
                    break
                prev = current
                current = current.next

        group_size += 1
    
    return dummy.next
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**
  - Each node is visited once during the check of group size and potentially during the reversal.
  - This results in a linear complexity relative to the number of nodes in the linked list.

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**
  - The space complexity is constant as we are utilizing a fixed number of pointers regardless of the input size.
