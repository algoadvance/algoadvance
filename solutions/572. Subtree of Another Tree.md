title:  Subtree of Another Tree-out
permalink: /s572
---
Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `True` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `False` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: True
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,None,None,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: False
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the tree node values guaranteed to be integers?
2. Can either `root` or `subRoot` be None?
3. Should we consider that duplicates can exist in the trees?

## Code
```python
from typing import Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSubtree(root: Optional[TreeNode], subRoot: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    if not subRoot:
        return True  # An empty tree is a subtree of any tree
    if not root:
        return False  # Non-empty tree cannot be a subtree of an empty tree

    if isSameTree(root, subRoot):
        return True

    return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) or isSubtree(root.right, subRoot)

def isSameTree(s: Optional[TreeNode], t: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
    if not s and not t:
        return True
    if not s or not t:
        return False
    if s.val != t.val:
        return False

    return isSameTree(s.left, t.left) and isSameTree(s.right, t.right)
```

## Strategy
1. **Base Cases**:
    - If `subRoot` is `None`, then it is a subtree of any tree, thus return `True`.
    - If `root` is `None` and `subRoot` is not `None`, then `subRoot` cannot be a subtree of `root`, thus return `False`.
   
2. **Recursive Check for Subtree**:
    - Utilize a helper function `isSameTree` to check if two trees are identical.
    - If `isSameTree(root, subRoot)` returns `True`, then `subRoot` is indeed a subtree of `root`.
    - Recursive calls to `isSubtree` to check `root.left` and `root.right`.

3. **Helper Function `isSameTree`**:
    - Check if both trees are `None` which means they are identical.
    - If one of the trees is `None` and the other is not, return `False`.
    - If values of the current nodes don't match, return `False`.
    - Recursively check left and right children.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of `isSameTree` is O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the trees being compared.
- Worst-case scenario:
    - Each node in `root` is checked, and for each node, `isSameTree` compares potentially `m` nodes of `subRoot`.
    - Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is O(N * M), where `N` is the number of nodes in `root` and `M` is the number of nodes in `subRoot`.
