title:  Reorder Data in Log Files-out

You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words. 

**(1)** The first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier. 

**(2)** Each of the rest of the words consists only of lowercase letters, or digits.

**(3)** Reorder these logs so that:

- The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
- The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
- The digit-logs should maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

### Example:
    Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1", "let1 art can", "dig2 3 6", "let2 own kit dig", "let3 art zero"]
    Output: ["let1 art can", "let3 art zero", "let2 own kit dig", "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6"]

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is it always guaranteed that logs will contain at least one letter-log and one digit-log?
2. Can the logs contain spaces at the beginning or end of the strings, or will they always be properly formatted?
3. Is there a limit on the number of logs or the length of each log?
4. Are there any specific constraints or considerations on the alphabetic characters and digits used in the logs?

## Strategy
1. Separate the logs into two categories: `letter-logs` and `digit-logs`.
2. Sort the `letter-logs`:
   - Primarily by their contents.
   - Secondarily by their identifiers if contents are the same.
3. Maintain the `digit-logs`' original order.
4. Concatenate the sorted `letter-logs` with the original order `digit-logs` and return the result.

## Code
Here's the implementation of the solution:

```python
def reorderLogFiles(logs):
    # Define a function to determine whether a log is a digit-log or a letter-log
    def get_key(log):
        identifier, rest = log.split(" ", 1)
        if rest[0].isdigit():
            return (1,)  # Digit logs get a key of (1,)
        else:
            return (0, rest, identifier)  # Letter logs get a key of (0, content, identifier)
    
    # Sort using the custom key function
    return sorted(logs, key=get_key)

# Test the function with the example
logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1", "let1 art can", "dig2 3 6", "let2 own kit dig", "let3 art zero"]
print(reorderLogFiles(logs))
```

## Time Complexity
- Splitting each log takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the log.
- Sorting the logs will primarily be O(M * log M), where M is the number of logs. Within each comparison, the cost would be dependent on the length of the logs being compared, which adds an inner factor of O(N) for the total complexity.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(M * N * log M), where M is the number of logs and N is the average length of the logs.
