Leetcode Problem #2376: Count Special Integers

We are given an integer `n`, and we need to return the count of all special integers between `1` and `n` (inclusive). A special integer is defined as an integer where no digit repeats.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range for the input integer `n`?**
   - The input integer `n` lies in the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Do leading zeros count?**
   - No, leading zeros are not allowed as they do not form valid numbers.

3. **Is `0` a considered special number?**
   - No, we consider numbers from `1` to `n` only.

Now, let's implement the solution.

### Strategy
1. **Counting approach:** Use a digit-based counting approach.
    - First, identify how many digits `n` has.
    - For numbers with fewer digits than `n`, calculate the special numbers directly.
    - For numbers with the same number of digits as `n`, we recursively count the valid configurations ensuring no digit is repeated.

2. **Permutations for digit count:** Use permutations of available digits to ensure uniqueness and count combinations efficiently.

### Code

```python
def countSpecialNumbers(n: int) -> int:
    s = str(n)
    length = len(s)

    # Helper function to calculate permutation
    def permutations(m, k):
        result = 1
        for i in range(k):
            result *= m - i
        return result

    # Count numbers with lengths less than the length of n
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, length):
        count += 9 * permutations(9, i - 1)

    # Count the numbers with the same number of digits as n
    used = set()
    for i, digit in enumerate(s):
        for d in range((0 if i > 0 else 1), int(digit)):
            if d in used:
                continue

            additional_numbers = permutations(9 - i, length - i - 1)
            count += additional_numbers
        if digit in used:
            break
        used.add(int(digit))
    else:
        count += 1

    return count

# Test the function
print(countSpecialNumbers(20))  # Output: 19
print(countSpecialNumbers(100))  # Output: 90
print(countSpecialNumbers(1000))  # Output: 738
```

### Time Complexity
- **Permutations Calculation Time Complexity:** `O(k)` for calculating permutations.
- **Digit Processing:** We process each digit of `n`, resulting in a complexity of `O(len(n))`.
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(len(n) * len(n))` which simplifies to `O((log10 n)^2)` due to the length of the input number `n`.

The above algorithm efficiently handles large values by leveraging permutations and constraints only relevant to the current number's structure and length.
