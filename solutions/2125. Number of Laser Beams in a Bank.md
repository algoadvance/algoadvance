title:  Number of Laser Beams in a Bank-out
permalink: /s2125
---

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `bank` representing a network of laser beams. Each cell either contains a security device (represented by '1') or is empty (represented by '0'). Each row in the matrix represents a row of devices where the laser beams can be directed.

A laser beam can only be fired from one security device and will travel horizontally to either the right or left side until it hits another device or goes out of bounds. Your task is to count the total number of laser beams in the matrix.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the laser beams travel through empty cells (cells with '0')?**
   - No, the laser beams can only be activated between cells containing devices '1'.
   
2. **Do laser beams wrap around the matrix edges?**
   - No, laser beams do not wrap around; they terminate at the matrix boundary or when they hit another device.

3. **Are beams bidirectional within their row?**
   - Yes, a laser can travel both to the left and the right within the same row.

### Strategy

1. **Filter out rows without any security devices:** Rows entirely composed of '0's cannot contain any beams.
2. **Compute security devices per row:** For each valid row, count the number of '1's as it represents the number of devices in that row.
3. **Count cross-row laser beams:** Multiply the number of security devices from consecutive rows to compute the beams between these rows and sum them up.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation based on the described strategy:

```python
def numberOfBeams(bank: [[str]]) -> int:
    device_count_per_row = []
    
    # Calculate the number of devices in each row and filter out empty rows
    for row in bank:
        device_count = row.count('1')
        if device_count > 0:
            device_count_per_row.append(device_count)
    
    # Calculate the number of beams between each pair of consecutive rows with devices
    total_beams = 0
    for i in range(len(device_count_per_row) - 1):
        total_beams += device_count_per_row[i] * device_count_per_row[i + 1]
        
    return total_beams

# Example usage:
bank = [
    "011001",
    "000000",
    "010100",
    "001000"
]
print(numberOfBeams(bank))  # Output: 8
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Filtering and Counting Devices:**
    - We iterate through each row of the matrix.
    - Count the number of '1's in each row and store it in a list if the count is greater than zero.

2. **Calculating Beams:**
    - Iterate through the `device_count_per_row` list and compute the total beams between each consecutive pair of rows.
    - Sum the product of devices between each consecutive row since each device in one row can potentially form a laser beam with devices in the next row.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the `bank`.
  - Counting devices in each row takes O(n) and we do this for all `m` rows.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m) in the worst case if every row in the `bank` has at least one security device.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of laser beams in the given bank of security devices.
