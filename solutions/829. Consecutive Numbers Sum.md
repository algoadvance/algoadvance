permalink: /s829
---

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of ways that `n` can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can n be any positive integer?**
   - Yes, `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Is there a limit to the value of n?**
   - No specific limit provided, but you can assume it is large within the normal constraints of coding challenges.

3. **How do we count different sets of consecutive numbers?**
   - Each set of consecutive numbers that sum to `n` is considered a unique way.

4. **Any specific requirements for the return type?**
   - Return an integer representing the number of ways `n` can be written as a sum of consecutive positive integers.

### Strategy

To determine the number of ways `n` can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers, we need to understand the relationship between `n` and the sequence of consecutive integers.

Suppose `n` can be expressed as the sum of `k` consecutive integers starting from `a`:
\[ n = a + (a + 1) + (a + 2) + \cdots + (a + k - 1) \]

This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ n = k \times a + \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \]
\[ n = k \left(a + \frac{k - 1}{2}\right) \]
\[ a = \frac{n - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}}{k} \]

For `a` to be a positive integer, the following must hold:
\[ n - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} > 0 \]
\[ n - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \% k == 0 \]

We'll iterate through possible values of `k` and check if they provide a valid starting value `a`.

### Code

```python
def consecutiveNumbersSum(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    k = 1
    
    while k * (k - 1) // 2 < n:
        if (n - k * (k - 1) // 2) % k == 0:
            count += 1
        k += 1
        
    return count

# Example usage:
n = 15
print(consecutiveNumbersSum(n))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `count` will store the number of different ways `n` can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers.
   - `k` starts from 1, representing the number of terms in the consecutive sequence.

2. **While Loop:**
   - We iterate while` k * (k - 1) / 2` is less than `n` because beyond this point, the sequence will not sum up to `n`.
   
3. **Check Criteria:**
   - For each `k`, we check if `(n - k * (k - 1) / 2) % k == 0`. If true, it implies that we have a valid starting integer `a`.
   - If the condition is met, we increment `count`.

4. **Return the result.**

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is approximately \(O(\sqrt{n})\), because we increment `k` until the triangular number \(\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2}\) exceeds `n`.
