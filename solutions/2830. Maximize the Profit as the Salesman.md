title:  Maximize the Profit as the Salesman-out
permalink: /s2830
---

You are tasked with maximizing the profit as a salesman. You have a number of tasks to complete during the day, and each task has a start time, an end time, and a profit associated with it. To maximize your profit, you need to choose tasks such that no two tasks overlap and the total profit is maximized.

The input is given as a list of tasks, where each task is represented as a tuple/list with three elements: `[startTime, endTime, profit]`.

**Input:**
- `tasks` (list): A list of tasks, where each task is represented as `[startTime, endTime, profit]`.

**Output:**
- `maxProfit` (integer): The maximum profit you can achieve by selecting non-overlapping tasks.

Example:

```python
tasks = [[1, 3, 50], [3, 5, 20], [6, 19, 100], [2, 100, 200]]
output = maximizeProfit(tasks)
print(output) # Should return 200 (by taking the task [2, 100, 200])
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the tasks guaranteed to be well-formed (i.e., start time < end time)?
2. Can the tasks be completed in any order or do they need to be sorted first?
3. Do we need to consider any constraints on the number of tasks or their durations?
4. Can tasks have overlapping start and end times but not be considered overlapping in terms of scheduling?

## Code Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming along with binary search for optimizing the task scheduling part.

1. **Sort Tasks by End Time:** First, sort the tasks based on their end times. This helps in structuring the problem where we consider one task at a time and combine it with previous non-overlapping tasks.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming Array:** Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve by considering tasks up to the `i-th` task (after sorting).

3. **Binary Search for Previous Non-Overlapping Task:** For each task, use binary search to find the latest task that does not overlap with the current task. This enables us to quickly find the optimal combination of tasks.

4. **DP Transition:** For each task, the DP state would be the maximum profit of either not taking the task or taking the task and maximizing profit with previously computed optimal profits.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the tasks takes `O(n log n)`.
- For each task, the binary search takes `O(log n)` and updating the DP array takes `O(1)`, making it `O(n log n)` for processing all tasks.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

## Code

Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def maximizeProfit(tasks):
    # Sort tasks by their endTime
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Initialize DP array
    dp = [0] * len(tasks)
    end_times = [task[1] for task in tasks]

    for i, (start, end, profit) in enumerate(tasks):
        # binary search to find the latest task that doesn't overlap
        k = bisect_right(end_times, start) - 1

        # calculate current profit
        if k != -1:
            dp[i] = max(profit, dp[k] + profit)
        else:
            dp[i] = profit
        
        # carry over the max profit from previous tasks
        if i > 0:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-1])

    return dp[-1]

# Example usage
tasks = [[1, 3, 50], [3, 5, 20], [6, 19, 100], [2, 100, 200]]
print(maximizeProfit(tasks))  # Output should be 200
```

This code effectively uses dynamic programming and binary search to achieve the optimal profit configuration for non-overlapping tasks, ensuring an efficient solution.
