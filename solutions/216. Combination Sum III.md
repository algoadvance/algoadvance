Leetcode Problem 216, "Combination Sum III", requires you to find all possible combinations of `k` numbers that add up to a number `n`, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

A combination is considered unique if it contains numbers in a different sequence or different sets of numbers. Given these constraints, ensure that your solution does not include duplicate combinations and utilizes the numbers 1 through 9 only once in each combination.

Return the list of all possible combinations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the numbers in a combination required to be in any particular order?**  
   - No, the unique combinations should be reported regardless of the order.

2. **Can a number be used more than once in the same combination?**  
   - No, each number from 1 to 9 can be used only once in each combination.

3. **Is the order of the combinations in the output important?**  
   - No, the order of the combinations in the output does not matter.

4. **What should be returned if no combination is found?**  
   - An empty list should be returned if no valid combination is found.

Let's proceed with the strategy for solving this problem.

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking Approach:**  
   - We will use backtracking to generate all possible combinations of `k` numbers from 1 to 9.
   - We need to keep track of the current combination and the sum of its elements.
   - If the length of the current combination is `k` and the sum is `n`, we add the combination to the results.
   - If the sum exceeds `n` or the length exceeds `k`, we backtrack.

2. **Optimize Early Stopping:**  
   - If at any point the sum exceeds `n`, there is no point in exploring further as adding more numbers will only increase the sum.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def combinationSum3(k, n):
    def backtrack(start, comb, remaining_sum):
        if len(comb) == k:
            if remaining_sum == 0:
                result.append(list(comb))
            return
        for i in range(start, 10):
            if i > remaining_sum:
                break  # No need to continue if i exceeds remaining sum
            comb.append(i)
            backtrack(i + 1, comb, remaining_sum - i)
            comb.pop()  # Backtrack to explore the next number
    
    result = []
    backtrack(1, [], n)
    return result

# Example usage:
print(combinationSum3(3, 7))  # Output: [[1, 2, 4]]
print(combinationSum3(3, 9))  # Output: [[1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 5], [2, 3, 4]]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this backtracking approach is difficult to express exactly due to the branching factor. In the worst case, it explores a large part of the power set of the numbers [1-9], leading towards O(2^N) where N is 9. However, since we prune the search space by limiting the sum and the combination length, the practical performance is significantly better than the worst case in most scenarios.

**Complexity Breakdown**:
- **Time complexity:** O(2^N) in the worst case where N is 9, but pruned significantly.
- **Space complexity:** O(k) for the recursion stack and O(C(9, k)) for storing the results where C is the combination count.
