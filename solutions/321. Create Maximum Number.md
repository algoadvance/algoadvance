title:  Create Maximum Number-out
permalink: /s321
---
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively. Return the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` that can be created from multiples selections from these two arrays. The relative order of the selected digits from the same array must be preserved.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the size of the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` or on the values within the arrays?
    - *Typically, array lengths are manageable, e.g., not exceeding 1000, and the values are non-negative single-digit numbers (0-9).*
    
2. **Selection Constraints:** Can we assume that when constructing the maximum number, once a digit is taken from an array, the rest of the digits to the right cannot be used again?
    - *Yes, once a digit is selected from an array, all subsequent digits from that array follow the relative order constraint.*

3. **Output Format:** Should the result be returned as an integer, a list of digits, or a string?
    - *The result should be a list of digits.*

## Strategy
1. **Sub-problem Implementation:** Develop a helper function `maxSingleNumber` that constructs the maximum sequence of a given length from a single array while preserving the relative order of elements.
2. **Combination:** Implement a helper function `merge` to combine two sequences into the largest possible sequence.
3. **Main Function:**
    - Iterate over possible lengths for the first array from `max(0, k - n)` to `min(k, m)`.
    - For each split, use the helper functions to pick the maximum subarrays from both `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
    - Merge these subarrays and track the maximum merged number.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

def maxNumber(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    def maxSingleNumber(nums: List[int], pick: int) -> List[int]:
        # Helper function to get the maximum number of length `pick`
        if pick == 0:
            return []
        drop = len(nums) - pick
        stack = []
        for num in nums:
            while drop > 0 and stack and stack[-1] < num:
                stack.pop()
                drop -= 1
            stack.append(num)
        return stack[:pick]

    def merge(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Helper function to merge two lists into the maximum sequence
        return [max(nums1, nums2).pop(0) for _ in range(len(nums1) + len(nums2))]

    max_num = []
    for i in range(max(0, k - len(nums2)), min(k, len(nums1)) + 1):
        merged = merge(maxSingleNumber(nums1, i), maxSingleNumber(nums2, k - i))
        max_num = max(max_num, merged)
    
    return max_num
```

## Time Complexity
- **maxSingleNumber:** Constructing a maximum sequence of length `pick` requires iterating through the array, giving a complexity of \(O(n)\) where `n` is the length of the given array.
- **merge:** Merging two lists of total length `k` involves iterating through a maximum combined length of `k`, with a complexity of \(O(k)\).
- **Overall Complexity:** Considering the main function's iteration through possible splits, the combined time complexity is \(O(k \cdot (m + n))\), where `m = len(nums1)` and `n = len(nums2)`. 

This complexity should be efficient for reasonably sized inputs (e.g., up to 1000 elements in each array).
