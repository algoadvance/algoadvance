title:  Number of Good Paths-out
permalink: /s2421
---

You are given an undirected tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and `n - 1` edges.

Each node has a value associated with it, given in the array `vals` of length `n`.

A "good path" is a simple path that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The starting node and the ending node have the same value.
2. All nodes on the path have values less than or equal to the starting node's value.

Calculate the number of different good paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Properties**: Since it is a given that the input is a tree, we can derive that it is connected and acyclic.
2. **Node Values**: Are the values in `vals` always non-negative integers? This will be assumed unless otherwise specified.
3. **Edge List**: How is the edge list provided? Will it be in the form of a list of tuples where each tuple represents an edge between two nodes?

---

### Strategy

1. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**: The problem can be tackled using the union-find (disjoint set) data structure to handle the merging of components efficiently.
2. **Sort by Node Values**: We sort the nodes based on their values. Processing the nodes in increasing order ensures that we are making connections where the maximum node value does not decrease along the path.
3. **Count Paths**: For each value, consider merging nodes with that value into larger components, and count the sizes of these components to calculate the number of good paths among nodes of the same value.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
        self.component_size = [1] * size  # To keep track of the size of each component
    
    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x: int, y: int):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        
        if rootX != rootY:
            # Union by rank
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.component_size[rootX] += self.component_size[rootY]
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
                self.component_size[rootY] += self.component_size[rootX]
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1
                self.component_size[rootX] += self.component_size[rootY]

def numberOfGoodPaths(vals: List[int], edges: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    n = len(vals)
    
    # Create adjacency list
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)
    
    # Node values and their indexes
    val_to_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for idx, val in enumerate(vals):
        val_to_nodes[val].append(idx)
    
    # Initialize union-find structure
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    good_paths = 0
    
    # Process nodes value by value in ascending order
    for value in sorted(val_to_nodes.keys()):
        nodes = val_to_nodes[value]
        
        # Union the nodes with that value
        for node in nodes:
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if vals[neighbor] <= value:
                    uf.union(node, neighbor)
        
        # Count the size of each component with the current value
        component_count = defaultdict(int)
        for node in nodes:
            root = uf.find(node)
            component_count[root] += 1
        
        # Calculate the number of good paths in these components
        for count in component_count.values():
            good_paths += (count * (count - 1)) // 2
        good_paths += len(nodes)  # each node itself is a good path
    
    return good_paths

# Example usage
vals = [1, 3, 2, 1, 3]
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
print(numberOfGoodPaths(vals, edges))  # Output: Number of good paths
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the values**: `O(n log n)`
- **Union operations**: Near-linear in practice due to the Union-Find with path compression.
- **Overall**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting being the most dominant factor.

This solution aims to efficiently count good paths by leveraging the union-find structure to group nodes and handle component sizes dynamically.
