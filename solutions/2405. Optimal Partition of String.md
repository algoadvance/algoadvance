title:  Optimal Partition of String-out
permalink: /s2405
---

You are given a string `s`. You need to partition the string into one or more substrings such that no character appears in more than one substring. Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters can the string `s` contain?**
   - The string can contain lowercase English letters.

2. **Is there a maximum or minimum length for the string `s`?**
   - No specific constraints are given, but typically, LeetCode problem constraints apply.

3. **Is the output required to be the actual substrings or just the count of substrings?**
   - The output is just the count of substrings required for an optimal partition.

4. **Can we assume the input string is not empty?**
   - Typically, with such problems, itâ€™s safe to assume the input is non-empty unless stated otherwise.

### Strategy

To solve this problem optimally, we can use a greedy approach with the help of a set to keep track of characters we have encountered in the current partition.

1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of characters in the current partition.
2. Initialize a counter to count the number of partitions.
3. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is already in the set, it means we need to start a new partition. Increment the partition counter and reset the set with the current character.
   - If the character is not in the set, add it to the set and continue.
4. The number of partitions required will be the count we kept track of.

### Code

Here's the Python code to implement the strategy:

```python
def partitionString(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a set to keep track of characters in the current partition
    seen = set()
    # Initialize the count of partitions
    num_partitions = 0

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is already in the set, we need a new partition
        if char in seen:
            # Increment the partition count
            num_partitions += 1
            # Reset the set to only contain the new character
            seen = {char}
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the character to the set
            seen.add(char)
    
    # Edge case, flush out the last partition
    if seen:
        num_partitions += 1

    return num_partitions
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once, and set operations (insert and lookup) average to \(O(1)\) time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). The space used by the set is limited to \(O(26)\) which is \(O(1)\) in terms of big-O notation, since the set can contain at most 26 lowercase English letters.

This approach ensures an optimal and efficient way to partition the string such that no character is repeated in any of the partitions.
