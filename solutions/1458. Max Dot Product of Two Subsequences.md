title:  Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences-out
permalink: /s1458
---

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the maximum dot product between **non-empty** subsequences of the arrays.

A subsequence of a given array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Do `nums1` and `nums2` contain both positive and negative numbers?
   
   Yes, `nums1` and `nums2` can contain both positive and negative numbers.

2. **Size Constraints:**
   - What are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   
   The sizes of both arrays are such that `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`.
   
3. **Output Specification:**
   - Do we always have non-empty arrays `nums1` and `nums2`?
   
   Yes, both arrays are guaranteed to be non-empty.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum dot product of subsequences of `nums1` ending at index `i` and `nums2` ending at index `j`.
   - Initialize `dp` with negative infinity for handling cases where initially no elements contribute to the subsequence.
   - The choice at any `dp[i][j]` will be:
     - Take the dot product of the current elements `nums1[i] * nums2[j]` plus the best dot product so far excluding the current ones.
     - Maximize the current position by either including it or excluding it from both subsequences.
     
2. **Transitions:**
   - `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum of:
     - `nums1[i] * nums2[j]`
     - `nums1[i] * nums2[j] + dp[i-1][j-1]` (adding current pair to previous best excluding them)
     - `dp[i-1][j]` (excluding current element of `nums1`)
     - `dp[i][j-1]` (excluding current element of `nums2`)
   - Loop through all possible pairs `(i, j)` and update `dp[i][j]`.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - Create a grid with dimensions `len(nums1) x len(nums2)` initialized to negative infinity.

### Code

```python
def maxDotProduct(nums1, nums2):
    n, m = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    dp = [[-float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            dot_product = nums1[i] * nums2[j]
            if i > 0 and j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dot_product + dp[i-1][j-1])
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dot_product)
            if i > 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j])
            if j > 0:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1])
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dot_product)
    
    return dp[n-1][m-1] 

# Example Usage:
# nums1 = [2, 1, -2, 5]
# nums2 = [3, 0, -6]
# print(maxDotProduct(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 18
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)` where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This results from filling an `n x m` DP table.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * m)` for the DP table that stores intermediate results.

This approach guarantees finding the maximum dot product by exploring all possible subsequences efficiently using dynamic programming.
