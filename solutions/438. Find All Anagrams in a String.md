title:  Find All Anagrams in a String-out
permalink: /s438
---

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example

**Input**: `s = "cbaebabacd"`, `p = "abc"`
**Output**: `[0, 6]`
Explanation: 
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

**Input**: `s = "abab"`, `p = "ab"`
**Output**: `[0, 1, 2]`
Explanation: 
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the input strings?**
   Constraints typically mention that `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`.

2. **Are the strings case-sensitive?**
   Yes, the problem involves lowercase English letters only.

3. **Can `s` and `p` be empty?**
   As per the problem statement, they cannot be empty since the minimum length is 1.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**: Utilize a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in `p`.
2. **Sliding Window**: Maintain a sliding window of the same size as `p` and slide across `s` to check each substring of size `p` for being an anagram.
3. **Count Matching**: Compare the frequency of characters in the current window to the frequency count of `p`.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def findAnagrams(s, p):
    if len(p) > len(s):
        return []
    
    p_count = Counter(p)
    s_count = Counter()
    
    result = []
    window_size = len(p)
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        s_count[s[i]] += 1
        
        # Remove the character that's now outside the window
        if i >= window_size:
            if s_count[s[i - window_size]] == 1:
                del s_count[s[i - window_size]]
            else:
                s_count[s[i - window_size]] -= 1
        
        # Compare window with the pattern
        if s_count == p_count:
            result.append(i - window_size + 1)
    
    return result

# Example usage
s = "cbaebabacd"
p = "abc"
print(findAnagrams(s, p))  # Output: [0, 6]

s = "abab"
p = "ab"
print(findAnagrams(s, p))  # Output: [0, 1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the `p_count` Counter is `O(M)`, where `M` is the length of `p`.
- **Sliding Window Execution**: We traverse the string `s` once which is `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `s`. Updating the counter for each character is `O(1)`.
- **Comparison**: Checking if two Counters are equal takes `O(1)` if we assume the alphabet size is fixed (26 letters).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(N + M)`, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
