title:  Number of Sub-arrays With Odd Sum-out
permalink: /s1524
---
Given an array `arr` of integers, find the number of sub-arrays with an odd sum.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of the array and the values of the elements?**
   - The length of the array can go up to \(10^5\).
   - Elements can be both positive and negative integers and their absolute values can be large.

2. **Can the elements in the array be zero?**
   - Yes, elements can be zero.

3. **Is there a specific requirement for the solution (like expected time complexity)?**
   - Given the constraint on the array length, an \(O(n)\) solution is suitable.

4. **What should be the output if no sub-arrays with odd sum exist?**
   - The output should be `0`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we utilize the properties of prefix sums and the parity (odd or even nature) of sums. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prefix Sum and Parity Tracking:**
   - As we traverse the array, we maintain the cumulative prefix sum.
   - Track counts of prefix sums that are even and odd.
  
2. **Odd-Even Parity Transition:**
   - A sum will be odd if the number of odd integers encountered so far is odd.
   - A sum will be even if the number of odd integers encountered so far is even.
   
3. **Counting Valid Sub-arrays:**
   - Use a `count_odd` and `count_even` tracker to maintain how many times we have seen odd and even prefix sums up to the current index.
   - Initialize `count_even` to 1 because an empty sub-array sums to 0, which is even.
   - As you iterate through the array, update the prefix sum and check its parity:
     - If the current prefix sum is odd, there are `count_even` previous sums that can combine with it to form an odd sum.
     - If the current prefix sum is even, there are `count_odd` previous sums that can combine with it to form an odd sum.
   - Update the counts of odd or even prefix sums accordingly.
  
### Code
```python
def numOfSubarrays(arr):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7  # Given the constraint on the number of sub-arrays
    prefix_sum = 0
    count_odd = 0
    count_even = 1  # accounts for the initial state (no elements)
    result = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        prefix_sum += num
        
        # Check if the current prefix sum is odd or even
        if prefix_sum % 2 == 0:
            result += count_odd
            count_even += 1
        else:
            result += count_even
            count_odd += 1
        
        result %= MOD  # Ensure result stays within MOD to avoid overflow
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# arr = [1, 3, 5]
# print(numOfSubarrays(arr))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the array. We traverse the array once, and each operation inside the loop is constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since we use a fixed number of additional variables irrespective of the input size.

This solution ensures an efficient calculation of the number of sub-arrays with odd sums using prefix sums and the properties of even and odd numbers.
