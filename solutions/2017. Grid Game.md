title:  Grid Game-out
permalink: /s2017

You are given a 2d grid with `n` rows and `n` columns. Initially, you are positioned in the top-left corner of the grid. You need to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. You can move right or downwards only. The challenge is to reach the destination while minimizing certain grid cells' values. Consider designing a strategy to solve this grid game. 

Each cell of the grid contains a value representing a penalty when stepping on it. The objective is to minimize the total penalty from the top-left to the bottom-right.

Your task is to determine the minimum total penalty one can accumulate from the top-left to the bottom-right.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the value of the cells be negative?
2. What is the range of the values present in the cells?
3. Is there any constraint on the grid's size?

## Code
We need to implement a function that takes a 2D grid and returns the minimum penalty from the top-left to the bottom-right.

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize a 2D dp array with the same dimensions as grid
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Initialize the first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Initialize the first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum penalty path for the rest of the cells
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    return dp[-1][-1]

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 3, 1],
    [1, 5, 1],
    [4, 2, 1]
]
print(minPathSum(grid))  # Output should be 7
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Create a 2D list `dp` which will hold the minimum penalty values up to each cell.
2. **Base Case:** Set the top-left cell `dp[0][0]` to `grid[0][0]`.
3. **First Row & Column Initialization:** Fill in the first row and the first column of `dp` with cumulative penalty values since they have only one possible path.
4. **Dynamic Programming:** For each remaining cell in `grid`, compute the minimum penalty by considering the minimum path sum from the cell above and the cell to the left, and then add the penalty value of the current cell.
5. **Result:** The bottom-right cell of `dp` will contain the minimum penalty required to reach there.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the `dp` array used to store the minimum penalty values.

If we want to optimize space, we can use a 1D array instead of a 2D array, since we only need the current and the previous row at any point in time.
