title:  Find the Most Competitive Subsequence-out
permalink: /s1673
---
Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return the most competitive subsequence of `nums` of size `k`.

An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of the array without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A subsequence of an array `nums` is called **most competitive** if it has the smallest possible lexicographical order among all possible subsequences of size `k`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
Output: [2,6]
Explanation: Among the subsequences of size 2, [3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], and [2,6], the most competitive subsequence is [2,6].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 100000.
   - Each element in `nums` is an integer between 0 and `10^9`.
   - `1 <= k <= len(nums)`

2. **Can the subsequence have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, subsequence can include duplicates if they appear in the original order of `nums`.

3. **Should we consider time complexity due to the potential large size of the input?**
   - Yes, an optimized approach considering time complexity is necessary since `nums` can be very large.

### Strategy
1. **Use a Monotonic Stack:**
   - We can use a stack to maintain the subsequence we build iteratively.
   - We can guarantee the lexicographical order by ensuring that the top of the stack is always the smallest possible value.
   - We need to ensure that we always have enough elements left to reach size `k`.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   - Initialize an empty stack.
   - Iterate over each element in the `nums` array:
     - While the current element is smaller than the last element in the stack and removing the last element doesn't prevent us from building a subsequence of required length `k`, pop the stack.
     - Push the current element onto the stack if the resulting length of the stack doesn't exceed `k`.
   - Finally, return the first `k` elements from the stack as the most competitive subsequence.

### Code

```python
def mostCompetitive(nums, k):
    stack = []
    to_remove = len(nums) - k  # number of elements we can remove
    
    for n in nums:
        while stack and stack[-1] > n and to_remove > 0:
            stack.pop()
            to_remove -= 1
        stack.append(n)
    
    return stack[:k]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of `nums`. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\), as the size of the stack is limited to `k`.

This approach ensures we efficiently construct the most competitive subsequence using a single pass through `nums` with controlled space usage.
